WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.200
I trust them. However, now we want to hear about, is this the first slide? Oh, sorry.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.680
Like this. OK. Jean-Luc, and Kemen, who starts?

00:17.680 --> 00:24.520
Good morning, everyone. I'm Jean-Luc DorÃ©le. I work for the next generation unit, an generation

00:24.520 --> 00:32.200
internet unit. It's not a new unit. So together with colleagues, and I have one of them here,

00:32.200 --> 00:38.880
we are supporting the so-called thanks generation internet initiative, NGI. So I don't know how

00:38.880 --> 00:45.800
familiar you are with NGI, but I will introduce that in a few words. And then Clementine will

00:45.800 --> 00:52.600
give you some insights on what we are currently doing in analyzing the impact of this initiative.

00:52.600 --> 01:02.680
So we have heard about the legislation this morning, the CRA, PLD. We'll probably hear about

01:02.680 --> 01:10.600
the DMA a bit later, the DMA-DSA. So the European Commission is the executive body of the European

01:10.600 --> 01:16.920
Union, and we have the right of initiative, and we give initiative and suggestion to the

01:17.000 --> 01:24.760
co-legislators. And we have two main, to simplify, two main stream of action. One is legislation,

01:24.760 --> 01:34.120
one is money, funding. So I'm representing the funding part, and the colleagues who are

01:34.120 --> 01:39.960
representing the legislation part. And in the funding part, you will have many, many things

01:39.960 --> 01:46.680
like agriculture, policy, regional development, infrastructure, and you have something called

01:46.760 --> 01:54.440
research, and more precisely, the Horizon Europe program. So this is where the money for research

01:54.440 --> 02:01.960
is channel, the main instrument. By the way, it's a law, so it's also a legislation, so

02:01.960 --> 02:09.000
co-legislator matters, even in this part. And as part of Horizon Europe, there is a lot of

02:09.000 --> 02:16.680
actions. You can imagine, it's the research spectrum. It's a little bit less than 100

02:16.680 --> 02:24.280
billions euro over seven years, that's the budget. And if you scroll down, at one point,

02:24.280 --> 02:30.600
you will find something called next generation internet, that's us. It's been operational for

02:30.600 --> 02:38.360
five years now. We are completing the fifth year. We mobilized between 20, 25 million euros per

02:38.360 --> 02:46.360
year. That's the envelope. And what we do is we fund open source. So I don't know how familiar you

02:46.360 --> 02:55.480
are, but there are a lot of people funded by us in this FOSDEM event, these two days. There was

02:55.480 --> 03:01.800
a session yesterday, there was a stand from NLNet. And the way we work as commission is that we don't

03:01.880 --> 03:08.920
give the money directly to the funded party, but we give money to intermediaries. Why? Because in

03:08.920 --> 03:18.920
the context of open source, we believe that we don't have the instrument to fund open source

03:19.560 --> 03:25.320
communities, because at the commission, we have instruments for big consortium, 2, 3, 4, 5 million,

03:26.280 --> 03:31.880
and a lot of participants, et cetera. So what we do, we give money to intermediaries,

03:33.560 --> 03:41.080
and we have projects, and some of them are here. And they, in turn, take this money and do calls,

03:41.080 --> 03:49.000
open calls. You can find them in ngi.eu, and there is somewhere a section on those calls that are

03:49.000 --> 03:57.720
open more or less continuously. We just awarded a 27 million euro funding for the next three years,

03:57.720 --> 04:07.720
so it's a quite significant project called NGI0 Commence Fund. And this notion of commence is that

04:07.720 --> 04:13.880
we are funding community-based and community-governed development of open source. So there are some

04:13.960 --> 04:19.880
nuances in open source that will not dig into that details, but check the eligibility if you're

04:19.880 --> 04:29.160
interested, and you will find that it's relatively, it's very open. Well, five years means that we

04:29.160 --> 04:36.840
need to step back a little bit, understand what we have been doing. It's 1,000 funded projects.

04:37.400 --> 04:44.600
Again, you can find the catalog in ngi.eu, 1,000 projects, and we need to understand what's the

04:44.600 --> 04:52.600
dynamic of this portfolio, because comes the next steps of funding, and it is a core legislation,

04:52.600 --> 05:00.920
it is a policy, so we have to have the impact understanding so that we can come to the decision

05:00.920 --> 05:06.760
maker and tell them that's the five years we have done this and this, and this impact this and this.

05:06.760 --> 05:14.440
So we have contracted the Gartner and the Clementine that was involved also in the early

05:14.440 --> 05:22.200
discussion more than five years ago that settled the rules and the principle for this initiative.

05:22.200 --> 05:31.880
And I'll leave you the floor for detailing precisely the benchmarking of these five years of NGI and its impact.

05:34.840 --> 05:40.360
Thank you, Jean-Luc. Good morning, everyone. I am Clementine Vellier. I used to be a researcher

05:40.360 --> 05:47.160
here at ULB. I studied a master in IT at ULB, and I have been coming to FOSDEM for the past 20 years.

05:47.480 --> 05:58.760
Five years ago when the European Commission launched the bid for creating the next generation

05:58.760 --> 06:09.400
internet initiative and shaping it, at Gartner we are humbly in love of technology, and so of course our

06:09.400 --> 06:14.840
understanding was that it had to be digital commons as well, the next generation internet, and that we

06:14.840 --> 06:21.320
would have to reach out to the existing community. So what did I do? I called an LNET, I called Mikhail,

06:22.520 --> 06:29.720
and that was my lucky moment. We won the bid. And so that year at FOSDEM when we finished the study,

06:30.440 --> 06:37.640
we had one of the keynotes of FOSDEM presenting the NGI study with the policy officers at the time.

06:38.360 --> 06:44.040
So that's also for me, I think, the first where the European Commission came to FOSDEM, and I'm

06:44.040 --> 06:50.440
glad that they're here every year since. The reason why we thought it was also interesting to present

06:50.440 --> 06:57.560
the NGI in this track, as Jolnik was explaining, is that the NGI initiative with its thousand projects

06:57.560 --> 07:03.640
has an impact also on EU policy, because it actually helps implement them. So we've been trying to

07:03.640 --> 07:09.240
collect data points fast to present them at FOSDEM today, and these data points come out from the

07:09.240 --> 07:13.800
initial analysis of a survey of these NGI thousand open source projects.

07:16.120 --> 07:22.840
So we looked at how they implement EU law, how do they carry and foster European digital rights,

07:23.560 --> 07:30.200
how do they provide alternatives, how do they link to standardization, what standards do they

07:30.200 --> 07:36.360
implement, and the topic of sustainability is also analyzed through other different dimensions.

07:39.480 --> 07:46.760
So basically, there are six European digital rights and principles. We have data points here

07:46.760 --> 07:52.680
that basically show how many projects implement how many digital rights, and so basically we have

07:54.040 --> 07:59.960
over 20, 25 percent of the projects in NGI that implement up to three of these digital rights,

08:01.080 --> 08:06.200
and we can cite this number, which I think is really interesting. You have three quarts of them

08:06.200 --> 08:11.240
that actually state that they increase safety, security, and empowerment of individuals.

08:11.960 --> 08:18.840
These EU digital rights are really important. I encourage you to follow the link and keep them

08:18.840 --> 08:24.760
at heart. I think they stick close to the open source community as well. So this was one of the

08:24.760 --> 08:32.840
initial findings. The next one is about how do they fuel the uptake of EU policy. So we have

08:32.920 --> 08:38.840
cited many different EU policies. Those that were actually mentioned by Jean-Luc, so I won't go too

08:38.840 --> 08:45.160
much through them, but I think what's interesting to see is that let's say 90 percent of the projects

08:45.160 --> 08:51.080
see themselves as implementing EU policy. So to be honest, I think the open source community

08:51.080 --> 08:56.520
understands somehow EU policy because they have similar values and they understand what they're

08:56.520 --> 09:06.600
thriving for. We're getting there. Another data point that's really interesting, of course,

09:06.600 --> 09:13.240
is the fact that more than half of the projects state that they're implementing an alternative

09:13.960 --> 09:22.120
to large monopolistic solutions that exist. And so as these alternatives are open source and available,

09:22.440 --> 09:32.440
they will, of course, be a good source for driving digital sovereignty in Europe.

09:34.280 --> 09:41.640
The standards. The standards are also very strong on the European Commission's radar for many reasons.

09:41.640 --> 09:50.040
For one, they fuel innovation, but they also help create, let's say, scale and breadth in the market

09:50.120 --> 09:58.280
and interoperability aspects as well. So obviously the NGI projects are rooted in the standards

09:58.280 --> 10:05.880
community, mostly ITFW3CIOIEE, but we've heard also other standardization organizations linked to

10:06.440 --> 10:13.400
geospatial aspects that were cited. And now, of course, this is key as well because the NGI is

10:13.400 --> 10:22.600
going to, of course, be part of the Web 4.0 that will take place worldwide. And so geolocalization

10:22.600 --> 10:31.240
will be a key part of that. What about sustainability? I mean, we've seen in these last data points

10:31.240 --> 10:37.320
that there's a strong footprint in those EU digital rights, values, policies, standardization,

10:37.320 --> 10:41.000
but what about the outcome? How do these projects follow through?

10:42.920 --> 10:47.720
Well, actually, three quarters of them follow through. It's a significant data point for many

10:47.720 --> 10:53.160
reasons. For one, it shows that there isn't a concrete outcome. So either they follow through

10:53.160 --> 10:58.600
because they are part of a larger effort, an open source community or a business, and so those

10:58.600 --> 11:07.080
contributions funded by public money have been integrated back into the community solutions.

11:08.280 --> 11:13.720
The second point that's interesting is that 8% of them have, as a follow-up, created a company

11:13.720 --> 11:21.320
or foundation. And to build on that point, so we can extrapolate the data and then estimate that

11:22.200 --> 11:28.520
NGI so far in those five years has generated probably a data point around 80

11:30.120 --> 11:34.440
companies or organizations or foundations that have been created.

11:34.840 --> 11:43.160
What about those companies? So we asked what are those business models? And interestingly and

11:43.160 --> 11:50.360
probably not unsurprisingly, the main business model is about SaaS hosting hosted solutions

11:51.640 --> 11:59.400
for almost 50% of them. So let's say this is also an interesting data point because

11:59.480 --> 12:05.560
we understand that this releases or at least takes away the struggles for implementing

12:05.560 --> 12:11.560
other people's open source tools and solutions and the technical hurdles if you're not a techie.

12:11.560 --> 12:16.760
So the reuse is also important. How are these tools reused and how are they made available to end users

12:17.480 --> 12:27.640
as a wider part of consumer base? Another very interesting data point talks about the developers.

12:27.640 --> 12:31.320
So what about the developers? What about the open source community?

12:32.520 --> 12:37.720
Well, the NGI definitely attracted the community and the talent. So in that sense, we were very

12:37.720 --> 12:44.120
happy to see some of these data points because it was the bet to actually reach into the existing

12:44.120 --> 12:51.000
community and inject the funding into the one that's actually making the internet run and trying to

12:51.000 --> 13:00.440
make it, let's say, pursue further its maintenance, its update and its innovation. And so in terms

13:00.440 --> 13:08.040
of community, we have 40% of projects that have a small community. We have 15% of projects that

13:08.040 --> 13:14.280
have a large community. We call that over 50 people. And then we also have six of these projects that

13:14.280 --> 13:24.040
are running in a community larger than a thousand people. So if we extrapolate that data, we can

13:24.040 --> 13:31.000
estimate that 80,000 people are actually contributing to the NGI through code testing or bug reporting.

13:31.000 --> 13:40.440
This is a very important data point for us. But it's also interesting to see how the NGI solutions

13:40.440 --> 13:48.600
are channeled through the open source community through the mainstream distros. This means that

13:48.600 --> 13:54.040
the user base is also expanding. We're looking on how to make sure that these solutions are reused.

13:58.920 --> 14:06.440
And last but not least, I think one of the main lessons also is the notion of agility of funding.

14:07.160 --> 14:13.720
The mechanism that Jandik explained at the beginning of this session is about funding innovation.

14:13.720 --> 14:19.560
And that was also one of the recommendations of our study was how to do this. We have these notions

14:19.560 --> 14:25.320
of course of fail fast, of incremental funding when you fund innovation. And the fact that

14:26.040 --> 14:30.600
three quarters of projects pulled through means that a quarter of them are recognized as failing

14:30.600 --> 14:39.720
fast and that's fine when you fund innovation. I think from my take today, from the discussion

14:39.720 --> 14:46.600
of this morning that were really interesting, as much as we managed here to do an agile funding

14:46.600 --> 14:53.320
scheme for the open source community, as much the European Commission and NL net have done with

14:53.320 --> 15:00.040
the CRA discussions, almost an agile policy making approach. And I think there's lessons to be learned

15:00.040 --> 15:09.000
from that. I think there is value in iterating, in iterations. And I think the open source community

15:09.000 --> 15:18.920
has taught a lot in an unorganized organization that you can't really tap into formally, but

15:18.920 --> 15:25.880
somehow always finds a way to innovate and always finds a way to get their messages through. So for

15:25.880 --> 15:31.960
me, this was a really insightful morning and I'm really happy to have presented these data points

15:31.960 --> 15:42.600
today with you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, let's hope we can continue with the interesting

15:42.600 --> 15:53.560
and conversations. With this, I'm going to hand over to Kiran, who is there.
