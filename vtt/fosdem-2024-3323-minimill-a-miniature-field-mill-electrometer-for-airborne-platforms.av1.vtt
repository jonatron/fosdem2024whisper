00:00.000 --> 00:11.360
Thank you so much and thank you for staying. I know that I'm keeping you up from your beer,

00:11.360 --> 00:16.840
which will be quite lovely and with a gnarly piece of software and hardware, let's say.

00:16.840 --> 00:25.440
So I'm Lily and this is a part of my PhD work that I completed a couple of months earlier.

00:25.440 --> 00:30.960
I'm a researcher in astrophysics and atmospheric physics and what we did with a couple of folks

00:30.960 --> 00:38.440
back in where I'm coming from, Greece, we made a miniaturized sensor that's used to measure

00:38.440 --> 00:45.160
the electric field strength in the atmosphere and I'll show you in a bit. So a brief agenda of

00:45.160 --> 00:50.040
the presentation, so I'm going to do a bit of an intro and discuss a bit the scientific question

00:50.040 --> 00:57.120
that was posed in our minds and that attracted all the funding for this research to be conducted

00:57.120 --> 01:04.520
and then why we chose open source, which is self-explanatory, let's say for that case,

01:04.520 --> 01:12.520
the sensor assembly and a few testing bits from the sensor, some observations from scientific

01:12.520 --> 01:19.440
campaigns that we did throughout all this period and then our data sharing platforms and what's

01:19.520 --> 01:27.320
next and what we hope from the sensor. So a lot going on here but what I want you to keep in mind

01:27.320 --> 01:34.320
is that we're coming from a field of, let's say again, atmospheric physics and what we were seeing

01:34.320 --> 01:40.400
throughout all the years of science is that our experimental data were showing that particles

01:40.400 --> 01:46.560
and particularly ones coming all the way from the Sahara dust particles were transported all the

01:46.600 --> 01:54.480
way towards central Europe most of the time and we are all the way from the Atlantic so we couldn't

01:54.480 --> 02:03.960
figure out why that was happening and we couldn't because our models and our forecasting models

02:03.960 --> 02:11.920
couldn't depict this change. So we were hypothesizing that these particles are moving within a fairly

02:11.960 --> 02:18.280
dynamic system which is our atmosphere and that we have this vertical electric field that's within

02:18.280 --> 02:25.480
the entire spectrum of the atmosphere and as they were moving within there was some electric force

02:25.480 --> 02:31.320
most probably that would act on the particles and make them to, let's say, float within the atmosphere

02:31.320 --> 02:38.320
or negate the gravitational force that was acted on the particles and then another, let's say,

02:38.360 --> 02:45.480
after effect of these electrical forces could be that it would orient the particles on the vertical

02:45.480 --> 02:52.080
direction and that would give them even fairly more time within the atmosphere which was another

02:52.080 --> 03:01.280
part of my research back in the PhD days. So in order to have and collect all the data that we

03:01.280 --> 03:08.160
could possibly have for our hypothesis we needed to do some measurements from ground-based sensors

03:08.600 --> 03:16.560
but we also needed and found that the best practice to do was to launch balloons over in the atmosphere,

03:16.560 --> 03:23.000
lower atmosphere with atmospheric electricity sensors and acquire the data that we needed within

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
the layers of the dust particles. So could we verify our hypothesis through the observations and

03:31.000 --> 03:36.880
then we needed new developments in order to do so? So the only way was that to do all these launches

03:36.960 --> 03:45.160
that I talked about before. So let's say why we went for the open source in terms of, you know,

03:45.160 --> 03:53.880
all the traditional academic structures that do not allow the scientists to form collaborations

03:53.880 --> 03:58.560
and they did not foster, many times they did not foster collaborations between open source

03:58.560 --> 04:06.120
practices and then there's this concern in terms of the researcher personal status and

04:06.120 --> 04:14.400
recognition and that all the open source work that's been done doesn't get recognized as it

04:14.400 --> 04:23.960
should be and again then there are these biased reward systems that fog, let's say, the perception

04:23.960 --> 04:29.800
of the researchers and what we wanted to do is exactly that challenge and create transparency

04:30.160 --> 04:36.920
through our work and what we found up till then concerning the specific sensors was unfortunately

04:36.920 --> 04:44.360
fairly closed so we had a couple of projects which were depicted from publications, you know,

04:44.360 --> 04:51.680
the traditional system of the academia to present their results and these were for the left-hand

04:51.680 --> 04:59.080
side they were not tested on these balloon-borne platforms that we needed them from and they were

04:59.080 --> 05:05.040
most of the times sketchy and there were nonexistent schematics at all in terms of the sensors

05:05.040 --> 05:11.360
which was pretty bad and then there were some other stuff that were mostly homebrewed projects

05:11.360 --> 05:18.400
which weren't, let's say, tethered to our applications for the measurements or that they

05:18.400 --> 05:26.600
weren't sensitive to the electric fields that we wanted to measure so these two on the right-hand

05:26.640 --> 05:35.120
side are both very cool projects and we used a lot of their, let's say, bases for our projects so

05:35.120 --> 05:44.080
again cool ones but not the exact one that we wanted for the data in the research field so

05:44.080 --> 05:50.760
a few words about the sensor we are calling it a mini-meal which is a miniaturized version of a

05:50.800 --> 05:56.720
commercial field-meal electrometer that's what they are called and what it actually does in the

05:56.720 --> 06:05.080
principle of operation is that you have a fan with two vanes that they're periodically screening

06:05.080 --> 06:12.920
a sensing electrode on the bottom side of the fan and this what does is that it induces charges

06:13.120 --> 06:22.280
on the effective area of the electrode and this time-resolved charge creates and induces

06:22.280 --> 06:30.560
an un-stern induced current and that's what we measure with the sensor and the internal

06:30.560 --> 06:40.480
processing and the data for the sensor are amplified and then we get the measured voltage

06:40.520 --> 06:46.240
which is twice the amplified output voltage from each of the coupled electrodes for the

06:46.240 --> 06:54.400
latest version of the sensor we were using DC-brustless motor which was used and the speed

06:54.400 --> 07:00.600
controlled respectively in order to minimize the electromagnetic interference in our system

07:00.600 --> 07:09.440
and the circuitry and then we also integrated gyro three-axis gyroscope for the rotational

07:09.440 --> 07:15.920
position of the sensor so we were trying to use as low RPMs as possible for the optimal response

07:15.920 --> 07:24.920
of the of the electrometer on the right hand side that's the exploded view of the sensor it was

07:24.920 --> 07:30.920
used in we were using layers so we have like the cover plate which unfortunately you can see here

07:30.920 --> 07:39.320
because it's shielded by the electrode view for the PDF and then we have the motor and the veins

07:39.320 --> 07:44.800
that I told you about and then we have the motor mount and the back plate which was all

07:44.800 --> 07:53.800
cut in aluminum for sturdy purposes and then we have the intermediate PCB with the electronics of

07:53.800 --> 08:01.920
the sensor so it was ADC it was controlled by an analog to digital microcontroller and we used

08:01.920 --> 08:10.200
a serial transmission for the data so it was all assembled in the institute with the two guys that

08:10.200 --> 08:19.520
I showed you before and that's the final result for the sensor it's quite a small and robust sensor

08:19.640 --> 08:27.240
like 8 centimeters at each side and we have used a thermal shielding because you know as you

08:27.240 --> 08:33.840
go up within the atmosphere the temperature drastically falls and we needed to shield our

08:33.840 --> 08:40.000
electronics and the battery supply and what it does is that I said measures the electric field

08:40.000 --> 08:46.880
strength with the altitude so the pros for the sensor was that it was easy to reproduce it's a

08:47.000 --> 08:53.680
fairly low cost sensor with all its the hardware and the electronic components components it's

08:53.680 --> 09:01.240
lightweight and it's disposable which is it's a bit of a problem because you have you know all

09:01.240 --> 09:07.640
these metallic parts and all these circuitry that are going into the ocean most of the times and

09:07.640 --> 09:13.840
they are not retrievable because you know the cost of getting it it's quite larger than the

09:13.840 --> 09:19.880
sensor itself so we will jump to another version which is going to be not biodegradable but

09:19.880 --> 09:28.040
definitely with less metallic structures and hopefully it will be sturdy enough for the

09:28.040 --> 09:35.840
measurements that we would like to do and same same validation methods so on the cons it was had

09:35.840 --> 09:41.480
these bulky electronics because it was an implementation on a PhD level and we had the

09:41.520 --> 09:48.760
minimal amount of knowledge for this for this project but hopefully it's going to get better

09:48.760 --> 09:55.480
and better with SMD's and stuff so what it does in scientific terms it slightly overestimates the

09:55.480 --> 10:00.360
electric field because as the sensor you know it's actually hanging from this balloon and you

10:00.360 --> 10:07.440
have all these wings and shears that are hitting it as it goes up so we have parasitic electric

10:07.440 --> 10:15.560
fields that can be detected from the motion of the sensor but we are using a rotation the rotation

10:15.560 --> 10:22.440
of the sensor to minimize this effect and it has unfortunately a limited operation temperature at

10:22.440 --> 10:30.280
minus 50 degrees it can mostly operate at this specific version on dry conditions so if you

10:30.280 --> 10:37.320
have like heavy rain conditions it's going to be heavily biased in terms of the output but

10:37.360 --> 10:45.440
that's that can be fixed easily and it has a maximum altitude of about 16 kilometers which was in

10:45.440 --> 10:55.160
the atmosphere again which was fairly biased by the battery level freeze due to the decreasing

10:55.160 --> 11:02.440
temperature so it's a sensor you have to do all sorts of calibrations to be ready and robust for

11:02.480 --> 11:08.520
measurements that you're taking so we had a hard vibration test we were actually you know moving

11:08.520 --> 11:15.480
the sensor around and getting the data we had the temperature resilience test and we tested

11:15.480 --> 11:22.840
its response with a commercial which was well validated instrument and they had similar responses

11:22.880 --> 11:33.360
pretty good ones and again we put it on different different conditions and the most you know famous

11:33.360 --> 11:39.680
let's say set up for calibration of such sensors is that you're putting them like into parallel

11:39.680 --> 11:46.600
plates and you're using a fixed voltage between the plates and you are securing the sensor in

11:46.640 --> 11:52.920
order to measure this fixed voltage that you have and to control the output so that was the

11:52.920 --> 12:00.440
standard calibration setup and it's also since it's pretty small and it doesn't have you know

12:00.440 --> 12:08.160
these complex aerodynamics can be easily tethered to UAVs we haven't completely tested that through

12:08.200 --> 12:16.800
modeling but we know that it's viable and it can send send its data so the telemetry now that was a

12:16.800 --> 12:22.440
bit complex because we couldn't use we didn't have the knowledge actually to make a telemetry on

12:22.440 --> 12:30.440
our own and just pop the data down but we also needed meteorological data from collocated with

12:30.440 --> 12:35.480
our electric field data because that was just a single measurement and we need other parameters

12:35.520 --> 12:41.920
also to explain you know this this ecosystem of models that we needed to use for the forecasting

12:41.920 --> 12:51.040
so we created another second sensor which was also measuring its own stuff and we desechained our

12:51.040 --> 12:58.520
electrometer to the second sensor and then to a commercial radius on if you are not familiar

12:58.560 --> 13:05.880
with with these these are like small instrumentation that are flying almost every day from around

13:05.880 --> 13:13.400
Europe and the meteorological services are releasing those those balloons and they are

13:13.400 --> 13:21.360
giving us all the data that we need within the atmosphere for meteorological parameters so a

13:21.360 --> 13:28.440
cool stuff that was done here the the radius hunt had its own protocol data protocol the X data

13:28.480 --> 13:35.760
one and we needed to do a bit of reverse engineering in order to connect our sensor to the the X data

13:35.760 --> 13:41.920
protocol and then trick the the ground station that was receiving the data that our sensor was

13:41.920 --> 13:48.520
actually one of the commercial ones which was yeah which was dumb because you you just was putting

13:48.520 --> 13:55.080
we're putting with our hands an ID and a fixed ID and the the ground station knew that that was

13:55.280 --> 14:01.040
completely different sensor I said you know okay just passing through the data that's that's fine

14:01.040 --> 14:09.160
and then we created the decoder for the for the data and then we have the raw output and also the

14:09.160 --> 14:15.000
sensor was able to to measure as a standalone but on the ground not flying up in the atmosphere

14:15.000 --> 14:23.480
with the serial that was giving out a text simple text output and then again we said you know okay

14:23.520 --> 14:28.120
we have one we've made all this effort like for a couple of months to create one let's create

14:28.120 --> 14:38.480
another 30 which was quite tedious but yeah but we needed that because you know when you when you

14:38.480 --> 14:48.080
research all these dynamic systems as the atmosphere you need to have as temporarily dense data

14:48.080 --> 14:55.440
so we needed to launch almost every day or maybe twice a day if we if we had the correct

14:55.440 --> 15:05.360
conditions so of that we are going to a very very nice place the Cape Verde islands in South

15:05.360 --> 15:12.840
Sahara and South Africa yeah and we've launched there through an initiative and a campaign that

15:13.120 --> 15:22.320
we did with the ESA the European Space Agency it was called ASCOS it was a pretty big campaign and

15:22.320 --> 15:29.920
it had all sorts of atmospheric stuff going on over there it was not only that part but we were

15:29.920 --> 15:37.760
tasked to measure the electrical conditions in the atmosphere and some you know very fancy results

15:37.800 --> 15:45.200
from the first experiments that we were doing on the plot whatever you see these colorful dots

15:45.200 --> 15:52.080
these are different days that we were launching our sensors and on the x-axis you have the electric

15:52.080 --> 15:57.920
field strength which is measured in volts per meter and on the altitude the x the y-axis you

15:57.920 --> 16:05.120
have the altitude so within these layers that you can see but visualize here of dense dust particles

16:05.480 --> 16:13.040
we have this increase of the electric field that we are seeing in different days of thank you

16:13.040 --> 16:20.720
of launching our sensors and that was a pretty good win because you know from from this addition of

16:20.720 --> 16:27.680
the sensor we were getting data which were quite realistic and we were getting some hints that the

16:27.720 --> 16:36.080
dust particles were charged indeed as we were expecting again we did a correlation between the

16:36.080 --> 16:42.720
wind speed and the electric field with a wavelet transform and we saw a small anti-correlation

16:42.720 --> 16:52.000
but that gets a bit too researchy and technical so I'm going forward and that was a very very nice

16:52.080 --> 17:00.400
day for us because we are going all the way again to Cape Verde and that's a day that we have a pretty

17:00.400 --> 17:07.920
intense layer dust layer what you see with this colorful green thing over here is dust within the

17:07.920 --> 17:14.960
atmosphere it's measured from a very specific laser which is called lighter and we also launched

17:14.960 --> 17:21.040
the sensors that day in order to see if we have this electrification of the dust particles and it

17:21.040 --> 17:30.240
was a pretty successful one we have many many and lots of data from the days that we have on the

17:30.240 --> 17:37.280
campaign and and the data are also available so the sensors for the day let's say were operational

17:37.280 --> 17:43.120
up to 40 kilometers due to battery decay so we are keeping the data up to that point

17:43.520 --> 17:54.080
so now what do we do in terms of sharing all this work so primarily our repository is in github

17:54.800 --> 18:03.280
and we have also collaborated with the evaluation and validation center for the data of ESA and

18:03.280 --> 18:08.720
that's where the the raw data set from the sensors and the entire campaign can be found

18:09.520 --> 18:16.560
we also have right over here the escos calendar which shows a step by step process of what were

18:16.560 --> 18:23.680
the instruments used the the daily plots from the sensors and then all the other instruments that we

18:23.680 --> 18:31.440
were having and all the work including all the publications done for the work the the data sets

18:31.440 --> 18:39.520
and all the presentations can be found in in zanodo so please do contribute if you if you find it

18:39.520 --> 18:48.400
interesting and yeah so some long bullets but i would like to to mention that so what were the

18:48.400 --> 18:55.280
challenges that we faced as we were conducting all these open source practices and all these research

18:55.280 --> 19:00.720
is that we had some you can have fairly large standardization issues so if you

19:01.840 --> 19:07.440
have variations within the sensors and all the the bulk of the sensors there it can affect the

19:07.440 --> 19:13.760
right reliability and the consistency of your collected data so another step was to have a

19:13.760 --> 19:18.240
pretty good documentation quality so that we can ensure the the project success

19:18.560 --> 19:25.520
and especially for those which that were not quite familiar with the hardware we do not have that many

19:25.520 --> 19:32.000
contributions to know if it is a good documentation but you know please do check the the project so

19:32.000 --> 19:38.160
also we needed to have a technical expertise minimum technical expertise for all those that

19:38.160 --> 19:44.160
would like to assemble the the sensor or that we employ the people that we employ to assemble

19:45.120 --> 19:53.360
the sensor so also we have data calibration and validation that needs to be compliant and with

19:53.360 --> 19:59.440
the regulations unfortunately of large research organizations when you're talking when you're

19:59.440 --> 20:07.040
talking about research that can affect many fields and being interdisciplinary so also we had to

20:07.040 --> 20:14.640
battle a bit with the funding constraints which is present and limited in terms of the open source

20:15.840 --> 20:24.000
and open research projects and we had to do a lot of testing and and also the quality control of

20:24.000 --> 20:31.200
the data themselves can be quite challenging so also we have the the ending that's the long-term

20:31.200 --> 20:37.200
support when addressing open source hardware issues through releasing updates of the of the

20:37.200 --> 20:43.760
hardware and if that's going to be a compatible technology for the second version of the sensor

20:44.320 --> 20:52.400
so the key takeaway is that do we answer our initial scientific question and fairly yes which

20:52.400 --> 21:00.000
was quite good and the minimal produced nice results and we were pretty happy about that and

21:00.000 --> 21:08.000
it's definitely not something that can be used only in research you can you can build it on your

21:08.000 --> 21:15.680
own and just use it for fun if you'd like on your backyard so in retrospect in terms of the

21:17.280 --> 21:23.200
in terms of the result that I had in my personal research is that the electrical properties

21:24.160 --> 21:30.080
do not play a significant role on the long-range transport of the particles which was a boom

21:31.840 --> 21:37.680
okay because we we didn't know all that work but again we had a milestone and a physical mechanism

21:37.680 --> 21:46.320
that was not accounted before in all these research so what's next the next step is that

21:46.320 --> 21:53.440
we want to migrate in complete open hardware technologies like a free cut and key card and

21:53.440 --> 21:58.880
version the version 2 is being baked at the moment and we would like to do it on our local

21:58.880 --> 22:05.920
hacker space with a bunch of people that were interested and yeah that's more or less it from

22:05.920 --> 22:13.040
me thank you so much all and that's my email if you want to address some questions apart from the

22:13.040 --> 22:16.640
ones that you're going to do now if you have to and my geek handle back there

22:26.480 --> 22:34.560
yeah hi so if it doesn't turn out that electrical properties are not responsible for the transportation

22:34.560 --> 22:41.360
of desert dust do you have any ideas or suggestions what might be yeah I do thank you for the question

22:41.440 --> 22:48.400
that was that was one that I was expecting on my phd defense and never came so that's good yeah um

22:48.960 --> 22:55.920
um a factor that I didn't you know quite oh do I need to you yes please repeat the question so

22:57.920 --> 23:03.520
the question was that if there are the the electrical properties and not a factor that will

23:06.400 --> 23:11.200
be very crucial for the particle dynamics if there's something else that plays a role and if

23:11.200 --> 23:16.800
we have an idea about that and yeah yeah we do um it's actually the orientation of the particles

23:16.800 --> 23:23.840
which was the the second part of my phd that I was uh researching with an instrument and we've seen

23:23.840 --> 23:28.480
that particles are indeed getting oriented in the atmosphere and from you know complex modeling of

23:28.480 --> 23:33.520
the particle dynamics we know that they're going to float a bit more from that movement alone so

23:34.320 --> 23:40.480
but that movement won't be efficient only by the electrical forces you have winds

23:40.480 --> 23:47.760
like strong updrafts that um are gonna you know orient the particles or maybe do a sling sort of

23:47.760 --> 23:52.960
effect and make them flow within the atmosphere so there are pretty complex mechanisms but that was

23:52.960 --> 24:01.280
a bit a small milestone to that maybe one more yeah yeah really one of the open source hardware

24:01.280 --> 24:06.080
uh so in your documentation do you also essentially for example

24:06.640 --> 24:11.760
duck on all the steps of the hardware along with for example calibration and maybe maintenance

24:11.760 --> 24:18.080
and repair details yes you said you're working on a second version are there any efforts for example

24:18.080 --> 24:24.640
to say institute replication efforts around the if there is a story and a replication to essentially

24:25.120 --> 24:30.960
as a open source hardware application yeah yeah yeah it's going to be so we have recently uh well oh

24:30.960 --> 24:37.120
yeah they repeat the question yeah I have to remember all that you know and my my brain is jammed so um

24:38.800 --> 24:44.160
if the the the question was if the current documentation uh has you know all the the

24:44.160 --> 24:51.920
tedious processes that we've used from the hardware uh documentation to the um steps step by step

24:51.920 --> 24:58.880
process of calibrating the sensor and stuff so yeah that's that's correct we have it and uh the the

24:58.880 --> 25:07.040
concept is to have to be able to you know with with some small steps to be able to recreate the

25:07.040 --> 25:13.920
sensor yourself um it needs a bit of you know cnc machining and cating it doesn't have 3d printing

25:13.920 --> 25:19.600
at the moment but maybe uh the best strategy would be to wait for version two which is going to be a

25:20.560 --> 25:27.840
fairly usable and much more usable and then you can reproduce the results yourself so the the basic

25:27.840 --> 25:33.760
calibration process was the one that I showed you we did it like in our in our house and it's yeah

25:33.760 --> 25:42.800
you you need the voltage supply and the the plates and that's more or less it but yeah for for the

25:42.800 --> 25:48.480
purposes of the research you need to do all the other stuff that I numbered in terms of calibration

25:50.560 --> 25:56.000
thank you yeah uh is this kind of measurement also done in space

25:56.800 --> 26:04.960
yeah that's a nice question um the specific yeah is it nice you know you you want to go with the

26:04.960 --> 26:10.720
flow and just answer quickly but that's yeah so are that no no I didn't say it did I say sorry

26:11.200 --> 26:21.280
um so does do such kind of measurements get repeated uh in space uh well not with the specific

26:21.280 --> 26:31.200
sensor because it's um pretty um pretty bad in in low temperatures pretty pretty bad in low

26:31.200 --> 26:40.000
temperatures and it doesn't have space hardened components so the the basic strategy to go to

26:40.000 --> 26:46.000
there are like rods that are collecting particles and these are translated to electric field

26:46.000 --> 26:51.840
measurements when we talk about let's say rovers for example when you're going to mars which is

26:51.840 --> 26:57.680
actually the image that I showed here so that's the planet marsh and it has a fairly large global

26:57.680 --> 27:07.040
dust storm um which is pretty pretty nasty and lasted for at least a couple of years so when

27:07.040 --> 27:13.760
when you're speaking for that kind of technology that's the go-to sensors but these were sparse

27:13.760 --> 27:19.680
I think there was actually one mission that was successful and that landed on on mars with such

27:19.680 --> 27:24.560
an instrument that was using electric field measurements and then apart from that nothing

27:25.600 --> 27:34.720
yeah around the earth around the earth yeah um not not that I'm aware of I know that there are some

27:34.880 --> 27:43.680
uh processes of magnetic field measurements that are done with small uh pocket tube satellites

27:44.320 --> 27:50.800
but I'm not aware of electric field measurements yeah because you know if you make the satellite

27:50.800 --> 27:58.800
two centimeters bigger you have the nano satellite format and you can it's quite easy to get in

27:59.520 --> 28:04.240
yeah yeah it's quite easy yeah and I hope that you stay there all the time yeah all the time

28:05.360 --> 28:11.600
I know um we're actually uh I'm pretty close with guys that are uh with us uh in in the room

28:11.600 --> 28:16.400
they're called uh Libre Space Foundation and they are using all sorts of open hardware and

28:16.400 --> 28:22.960
open software stuff to make small satellites so it would be a nice collaboration let's say where

28:23.920 --> 28:30.880
yeah he's waving yeah he's doing all sorts of mechanical engineering stuff yeah so

28:31.840 --> 28:38.560
it needs the the objective it needs the scientific objective yeah that's it okay

28:40.560 --> 28:45.120
thank you so much thank you
