WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.320
Thank you all for coming back and thank you for spending the day with us.

00:12.320 --> 00:19.160
The idea of the people who organized this and I'm going to give 99% of the credit, I

00:19.160 --> 00:22.160
think appropriately to Crystal and Matthias.

00:22.160 --> 00:24.520
Thank you very, very much.

00:24.520 --> 00:31.640
We're also key in initiating the Open Website Alliance as an organization which we have,

00:31.640 --> 00:36.000
I would say, successfully launched today.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.960
We need to bash some champagne against someone somewhere but other than that.

00:42.960 --> 00:50.200
So I also found the program really interesting and really well rounded and actually ran the

00:50.200 --> 00:55.720
gamut from technical including code to very aspirational.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.680
There was tons of practical pragmatic stuff along the way.

00:59.680 --> 01:05.400
So I just wanted to run through this idea of things that bring us together based on

01:05.400 --> 01:10.320
the talks that we heard and I'm going to have to sit down or something so I can see my screen

01:10.320 --> 01:11.400
while I do it.

01:11.400 --> 01:17.760
Or what if we change the slide up there?

01:17.760 --> 01:18.760
Please change.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.320
There we are.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.320
Right.

01:22.320 --> 01:30.120
So for those of you who weren't here at the crack of dawn, Matthias and I talked about

01:30.120 --> 01:38.280
the wake up call that we had about a year ago where Open Source is losing out to proprietary

01:38.280 --> 01:43.520
offerings in cases where we clearly shouldn't be.

01:43.640 --> 01:51.920
So the big wake up call was around the Australian government and personalization but we've seen

01:51.920 --> 01:54.640
and heard many other examples.

01:54.640 --> 02:01.680
So we think that we need to remember what Open Source is about at a fundamental level,

02:01.680 --> 02:07.840
how it can make us and anyone we know better business people and how in very practical

02:07.880 --> 02:13.600
ways using and applying Open Source principles and technologies can make the world a better

02:13.600 --> 02:14.600
place.

02:14.600 --> 02:20.400
So that is what we kicked off the day with.

02:20.400 --> 02:26.560
Gabber Hoitje gave a really interesting inspiring talk about the nuts and bolts around coordinating

02:26.560 --> 02:35.560
volunteers around long term technical goals and getting community to become contributors

02:35.560 --> 02:40.320
and keeping them there is something that Drupal's been working very, very hard at since the

02:40.320 --> 02:47.160
project existed and they're really admirable and Gabber's a big force of nature in that.

02:47.160 --> 02:51.880
So thank you for doing that Gabber and I think that that gives us ideas about how we can

02:51.880 --> 02:58.800
coordinate our own communities and probably how to make a meta community around what we

02:58.800 --> 03:03.280
want to do with the Alliance.

03:03.440 --> 03:14.280
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it's been a long day.

03:14.280 --> 03:21.440
I think offered us a really powerful tool set to help grow Open Source in general and

03:21.440 --> 03:27.440
probably grow what we do together as well because the certification, competency, skill

03:27.600 --> 03:35.600
tree concept, once you show how to learn or teach any given CMS, how much of it is going

03:35.600 --> 03:41.880
to be applicable to the next one, 70%, 90%, there might only be the details there and

03:41.880 --> 03:46.360
I think that also since skill display has a really tight affiliation with Open Source

03:46.360 --> 03:49.960
anyway I think they're really interesting allies for the future so thank you for coming

03:49.960 --> 03:52.560
Fluria.

03:52.680 --> 03:58.520
So Martin and Lucas who I think are not here anymore gave a really cool accessibility talk

03:58.520 --> 04:03.080
and reminded me of a bunch of things.

04:03.080 --> 04:08.240
It's just really important that all of us bake accessibility in right from the start

04:08.240 --> 04:16.080
and I guess it's because of the nature of my career and my work now but yes building

04:16.120 --> 04:23.360
things accessibility is easier if you do it from the start and cheaper but it doesn't

04:23.360 --> 04:25.520
have to be a moral choice.

04:25.520 --> 04:31.520
There is a significant percentage of people who are online who have some disability of

04:31.520 --> 04:38.360
some kind and some or all of us are sometimes less able than others.

04:38.360 --> 04:45.360
So from a business perspective or any kind of value proposition where I want someone to

04:53.000 --> 04:55.640
do something else, I want to conversion, I want them to read something, I want them to

04:55.640 --> 04:59.920
buy something, the more accessible you make it the better business you can do if you're

04:59.920 --> 05:05.440
offering is a good one and the more accessible you make your web properties the better they

05:05.480 --> 05:08.760
can be found by the robots who will then show it to your consumers.

05:08.760 --> 05:15.760
So I like these stories that we in our communities cloak in a lot of morality and ethical choices

05:16.960 --> 05:20.160
which is right and proper and the thing to do.

05:20.160 --> 05:25.880
I like to note that there are a lot of ways to argue for those things that are from a

05:25.880 --> 05:29.720
non, it's not a moral conversation so it's a very pragmatic one.

05:29.720 --> 05:34.480
So I was really happy to see that one today.

05:34.520 --> 05:40.840
Owen gave a bit of an aspirational picture of what it looks like to be the biggest CMS

05:40.840 --> 05:47.840
in the room with grappling with some problems of like being at huge scale but not necessarily

05:49.680 --> 05:54.040
being taken seriously at the same time.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.160
Like everybody's heard of Aqia now.

05:56.160 --> 06:02.280
I've been to some events where people talk about Aqia and it was so surprised and then

06:02.360 --> 06:05.920
they know there's that Drupal thing behind it and that's that oh there's that thing behind

06:05.920 --> 06:08.680
it that I think is really challenging.

06:08.680 --> 06:12.760
But Drupal's got really, really conscientious leadership and I think that if we get the

06:12.760 --> 06:17.800
chance to work together on some of these visibility issues I think it will be really exciting.

06:17.800 --> 06:23.040
I especially somewhere in your talk I realized that the thing that Matthias talks about a

06:23.040 --> 06:30.040
lot is open source could, should be a brand and you should come in in your tech decision

06:30.680 --> 06:37.680
making process early and say I want to use open source yes no and then if it's yes open

06:38.680 --> 06:45.680
source which it should be then is it Wagtail, is it Drupal, is it Type 03, is it right?

06:47.600 --> 06:54.040
And then we can still make our own work and things do better together by collaborating

06:54.040 --> 06:57.760
at the community level on the code level and so on wherever it makes sense.

06:57.800 --> 07:04.800
So Daniel then incredibly beautifully picked up what I think was my point about making

07:08.600 --> 07:14.200
a difference in the real world with open source thinking in practice and the incredibly

07:14.200 --> 07:19.840
impressive to me work that's gone into like not just throwing some agency work to somebody

07:19.840 --> 07:24.920
and leaving the Rwandans to figure out what they'll do next year but like building a structured

07:24.920 --> 07:30.960
measurable completely practical approach to government digital infrastructure and then

07:30.960 --> 07:35.640
oh yeah you can put your own websites on it I love that, I love my favorite part was

07:35.640 --> 07:40.760
that no one from the Type 03 like none of the Europeans who came to help and teach wrote

07:40.760 --> 07:47.760
any code I thought that was super awesome right. So all of us can use that open standard

07:48.120 --> 07:53.740
to and that methodology to make sure there's a backup plan make sure you have processes

07:53.780 --> 07:57.700
make sure there's disaster recovery and of course we can check any CMS we want in there

07:57.700 --> 08:03.540
right that's going to be a huge resource for all of us so that was super awesome. Sage

08:03.540 --> 08:09.020
gave us insight into as for most of the people in the room some cool insight to like what

08:09.020 --> 08:16.020
coding looks like when it's not in PHP right and like the deep roots of building content

08:17.060 --> 08:21.740
management experiences right when so many of us have been living in the world where the

08:21.740 --> 08:25.780
interfaces have been built for a while or the paradigms have been fixed and the decisions

08:25.780 --> 08:30.260
have been made and we just kind of live with what our code ancestors gave us right so I

08:30.260 --> 08:37.260
really really appreciated the fresh eyes on to solving web publishing and yes and Jesus

08:39.980 --> 08:46.140
talking about how we solve the contributor gap right the long tail the how many people

08:46.140 --> 08:50.340
use it versus never contribute all of those issues and I think the fight for the future

08:50.380 --> 08:57.380
initiative is a super cool idea and I think it intersects with and highlights ways that

08:58.260 --> 09:03.500
other communities have tried to solve this you know contribution credits or not the

09:03.500 --> 09:07.860
Gabor's idea about future promises versus measuring past contributions I thought was

09:07.860 --> 09:12.500
super interesting so you know but we have to have healthy communities and contributions

09:12.500 --> 09:18.380
all of us to continue our projects so that's got to be that's got to be some valuable

09:19.140 --> 09:22.900
got to be some valuable insight for us I think maybe especially if there's some more data

09:22.900 --> 09:27.260
that could come out of that that would be very very interesting so thank you to all of today's

09:27.260 --> 09:34.260
speakers very very interesting day I think I had if I find my phone I had three concrete

09:36.300 --> 09:43.300
questions that we could pose to the four representatives one of whom non-official from our four projects

09:43.460 --> 09:50.460
disclaimer disclaimer so I think that we could try I have three questions we could try them

09:56.100 --> 10:02.700
and we can see where they go right so how about I will ask the first question and each of you

10:02.700 --> 10:07.700
has a minute to introduce yourself and like a couple minutes to talk about the question

10:07.780 --> 10:14.780
and and we'll just let you fight over the microphone yeah so perhaps to the branding

10:17.900 --> 10:23.060
side of things just like php fig and the psr's have helped us grow together and reinvent

10:23.060 --> 10:30.060
even fewer wheels how do we do that at a public facing level Robert so yeah I'm I'm Robert

10:31.060 --> 10:38.060
I'm representing in officially wordpress here and with the which our base is php so as as

10:43.180 --> 10:50.180
James said it's very the foundation of what we're doing so what we can learn I think is

10:50.180 --> 10:57.180
the that's so much code that we have is like as we had today the dependencies between the

10:57.340 --> 11:03.420
systems are very small and so we could share those things and have less and learn that one

11:03.420 --> 11:09.900
system learned and can have gift as to other systems so that we have shared shared code

11:09.900 --> 11:16.180
and shared responsibilities and also can contribute it to central infrastructure maybe that we

11:16.180 --> 11:22.340
can reuse between the systems super cool I thought on that note on that note I basically

11:22.420 --> 11:28.260
thought whatever the next GDPR is right probably the accessibility thing or something like

11:28.260 --> 11:35.260
let's make libraries and standards together and work almost together right yeah when I

11:35.260 --> 11:40.220
hear that question I also think about you know it's actually important that we who work

11:40.220 --> 11:47.220
with CMS's talk more together try to answer questions together so we know that one of

11:47.740 --> 11:53.740
the projects is working on a nice solution it doesn't even mean that it has to be the

11:53.740 --> 12:00.740
same programming language the concept behind it might be enough to share something that

12:01.980 --> 12:08.980
can really help us all and I think then the difficult question will become you know well

12:09.060 --> 12:16.060
what is not something that we want to share is there anything you know that goes totally

12:16.060 --> 12:22.060
against the idea of our CMS for example you know that's also very very interesting discussion

12:22.060 --> 12:25.060
that I also think we should actually take together.

12:25.060 --> 12:32.060
I agree my name is Crystal I'm the president of open source matters which is the organization

12:33.060 --> 12:40.060
responsible for the JUMLO project and this is Matias with typo 3.

12:40.060 --> 12:47.060
So I think that there are so many things to talk about with this question it's a complicated

12:47.380 --> 12:54.380
one but in respect to like how we're communicating publicly as a collaborative effort I think

12:54.380 --> 13:01.380
it kind of goes back to how this whole open website alliance started because it was born

13:03.540 --> 13:10.540
from the need to make a coordinated response to the upcoming cyber resilience act so that

13:12.340 --> 13:19.340
was kind of the first time that we had collaborated on a global executive level in the United

13:19.340 --> 13:26.340
States and we knew that if we were to try and make individual responses that we wouldn't

13:30.460 --> 13:36.180
have the kind of impact as we could have as a group and I think that that's going to

13:36.180 --> 13:41.780
kind of set the tone of our future collaborations not just on policy stuff because you know

13:41.780 --> 13:48.780
the CRI was the first thing that we're going to have to deal with in open source for legislative

13:48.780 --> 13:53.540
actions but it's not going to be the last but also to maybe coordinate on making resources

13:53.540 --> 13:58.420
for our communities for this kind of thing a couple days ago we were at the policy summit

13:58.420 --> 14:04.020
and I had the thought okay well maybe we could work together to have like some kind of compliance

14:04.020 --> 14:10.620
checklist because there are so many things in common across each of our CMS communities

14:10.620 --> 14:16.900
that it doesn't make sense to do the same thing individually put in the individual effort

14:16.980 --> 14:22.540
to get essentially the same kind of result. One of the key concepts in programming is

14:22.540 --> 14:26.060
don't repeat yourself right so we can apply that here too.

14:26.060 --> 14:30.220
And compliance is technostics so that makes perfect sense.

14:30.220 --> 14:37.220
Yeah and to what Matias said about also knowing what things we shouldn't be sharing I think

14:37.380 --> 14:44.380
it goes to knowing where we stand in comparison to other CMSs because there are things that

14:45.380 --> 14:50.940
we share as strengths and there are things that aren't necessarily good fits and I love

14:50.940 --> 14:55.780
to the chart that you shared in your presentation about where Drupal sits as far as richness

14:55.780 --> 15:00.780
versus I don't remember what the other exes said but.

15:00.780 --> 15:03.700
Oh was that the gotten though of course.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.220
No it was where the.

15:06.220 --> 15:09.340
Oh no that was that was Dries' slide.

15:09.380 --> 15:13.100
Yeah okay it's a good slide. Thank you Dries.

15:13.100 --> 15:18.620
And I liked that you said you know we know that Drupal is not for these smaller brochure

15:18.620 --> 15:24.100
sites. I also liked that Wagtail had something similar that you said okay we know that people

15:24.100 --> 15:27.820
are going to have to code to set this up this is not going to be like a one and done kind

15:27.820 --> 15:32.940
of thing and I think that's going to be critical for how we are collaborating so that we can

15:32.940 --> 15:37.780
make sure that we know where we sit and help people make the best choice per project as

15:37.820 --> 15:42.340
opposed to being dogmatic about our individual CMSs.

15:42.340 --> 15:44.340
That was longer than two minutes sorry.

15:44.340 --> 15:51.340
It's okay so choose open source then based on the strengths of a project go ahead.

15:52.340 --> 15:59.340
I'm Owen from the Drupal Association that's the body that oversees aspects of the Drupal

15:59.580 --> 16:06.580
community and if I was going to pick one thing which is really really hard.

16:08.780 --> 16:15.780
The thing that does keep me up at night is the renewal of new developer talent into our

16:17.500 --> 16:20.660
communities. It's great to see a few people here under 40.

16:20.660 --> 16:25.660
This side of the room maybe not so much.

16:25.660 --> 16:32.660
And so I think where I think we can actually unify in terms of visibility and effort is

16:32.660 --> 16:39.660
around promoting the benefits of considering a developer career pathway into any of our

16:40.660 --> 16:47.660
platforms because it's not too hard to switch between platforms once you know a bit of PHP.

16:47.660 --> 16:54.660
And I think what I have seen not so much in Europe and North America but in emerging markets

16:55.460 --> 17:00.460
people are starting to look at careers in the future.

17:00.460 --> 17:07.460
People are starting to look at careers in say Drupal as being a pathway to prosperity.

17:09.460 --> 17:16.460
And Dries does have a great story about being in China and asking young developers why they've

17:16.460 --> 17:19.460
chosen Microsoft over Drupal.

17:19.460 --> 17:23.460
And the answer was well I want to buy an apartment.

17:23.460 --> 17:26.460
He's like well what's the big deal about buying an apartment?

17:26.460 --> 17:33.460
And if they can buy an apartment then they can woo a partner to live in that apartment with them.

17:33.460 --> 17:41.460
And so it kind of speaks to these quite fundamental needs that we have this incredible ability to

17:41.460 --> 17:43.460
tap into I think.

17:43.460 --> 17:50.460
So many of us in this room have had 20 plus year careers based on open source of built amazing

17:50.460 --> 17:52.460
businesses around that.

17:52.460 --> 17:58.460
And I don't think that story gets told as well as it could is that there are these incredible

17:58.460 --> 18:00.460
careers that you can have.

18:00.460 --> 18:07.460
And just to kind of wrap it up the fulfillment of a career working in open source I personally

18:08.460 --> 18:13.460
think is significantly above what you would get if you're working in a closed proprietary system.

18:14.460 --> 18:23.460
And in our own company a key hiring metric that we use or a tractor that we use is the ability to be able to

18:23.460 --> 18:31.460
work in open source as part of your role and to be working in a little 20 person company in Australia

18:31.460 --> 18:39.460
but to be part of this network of mentors around the world who help you grow in your own personal development.

18:39.460 --> 18:41.460
Did that make sense?

18:41.460 --> 18:43.460
Yes.

18:43.460 --> 18:46.460
And since we're all in the...

18:46.460 --> 18:55.460
Since we're all in the same space right actually this issue of being able to find developers and whether you

18:55.460 --> 19:03.460
know young CMS is not as cool as it was radical and wild 20 years ago right but content management is

19:03.460 --> 19:08.460
somehow the backbone of how the world works now right.

19:08.460 --> 19:15.460
Digital everything solving web publishing device publishing digital publishing of any kind in the end you have to

19:15.460 --> 19:19.460
manage content and and these systems are a great way to do it.

19:19.460 --> 19:21.460
Also yours.

19:25.460 --> 19:32.460
I was incredibly gratified coming out of the pandemic when I started going to events again.

19:32.460 --> 19:43.460
I have been to events in several communities especially typo 3 because I live in Germany and love that community

19:43.460 --> 19:53.460
but also Drupal and whether it's been local regional typo 3 events even German language typo 3 events rather than

19:53.460 --> 20:00.460
the international ones or Drupal-Con-Pittsburg I think in all my time in open source I have never seen so many

20:00.460 --> 20:05.460
young people coming to open source events and I have never seen so much diversity before right.

20:05.460 --> 20:12.460
So I find that incredibly heartening for all of us that some young people are interested in a sensible,

20:12.460 --> 20:17.460
helpful career in the world right so I think that's pretty awesome.

20:17.460 --> 20:25.460
We could and I really liked what you said about what makes working in open source potentially a lot more satisfying right.

20:25.460 --> 20:29.460
You're not locked away in the corporate walls with secrets you can't talk about right.

20:29.460 --> 20:33.460
You can work with the best and learn from the best and be part of something more meaningful.

20:33.460 --> 20:35.460
All right.

20:40.460 --> 20:51.460
Is there a need to reframe the conversation in each of our communities away from this level of competition and towards more cooperation

20:51.460 --> 20:54.460
and if there is how do we make that happen?

20:55.460 --> 21:07.460
So as an example we had in Germany there is a collaboration between the communities from the open source world in Germany

21:07.460 --> 21:16.460
called CMS Garden which is like all the CMS here plus a few more you never heard in your life and they were all awesome

21:16.460 --> 21:25.460
and what we have with this collaboration is we simply know each other and we simply have like the contacts of the other CMS

21:25.460 --> 21:35.460
so this is kind of like already happening in the world but it's not like that on the global level not like really normal standard

21:35.460 --> 21:45.460
and that's why we simply now can like go forward and go like hey all of you in the whole world of CMS all over the world

21:45.460 --> 21:55.460
you know someone bring them to the next CMS event that is not theirs and like simply have those connections who are already there

21:55.460 --> 22:05.460
simply have them flourish and like move them forward and invite everybody to join in because like we I think it was Matt Malinweg

22:05.460 --> 22:12.460
who said like that's like it's kind of like a sibling rivalry what we're having we are not really a competition

22:12.460 --> 22:20.460
because we all stand on the same like open source paradigms and it's just like that we have like an understanding of like

22:20.460 --> 22:30.460
I like my bowls to be red you're like your bowls to be yellow so but we built the same cars and we built the same structures together

22:30.460 --> 22:40.460
but it's just like a disagreement of how to reach this point but at the same we at the end we still work together and as I had connections with

22:40.460 --> 22:50.460
all the open source systems that's the same frequency everybody has so everybody's agreeing on that we need to work together

22:50.460 --> 23:01.460
that collaboration brings more forward than simply downloading like this not open file to simply run something but it's really the goal to work together

23:01.460 --> 23:06.460
and to achieve better results together with all the input that someone can bring.

23:07.460 --> 23:08.460
Community.

23:08.460 --> 23:09.460
Yes.

23:09.460 --> 23:17.460
Yeah I mean the website Alliance is a community of communities and I think that's something that we can really use and I think

23:17.460 --> 23:25.460
looking at things we can do I mean or what we're already doing.

23:26.460 --> 23:40.460
Benny the type of three core team lead is sitting on in on core team meetings in Drupal and that doesn't mean that type of

23:40.460 --> 23:46.460
three is becoming Drupal or anything like that which I think is an easy thought to make that you know we'll just copy everything

23:46.460 --> 23:55.460
but it's something about participating in larger discourse knowing why are they making these choices.

23:55.460 --> 24:04.460
Okay what are the reasons what is informing them on their decisions and that doesn't mean that we will always come to the same

24:04.460 --> 24:10.460
agreement but it means that we all become wiser in our decisions.

24:11.460 --> 24:18.460
Community connections perspectives.

24:18.460 --> 24:23.460
Now I'm waiting for what my word will be so I know what to say.

24:23.460 --> 24:31.460
Now I feel like a lot of collaboration has already been happening on the community level it's just not been recognized or talked about as much

24:31.460 --> 24:39.460
as the CMS garden or like individual initiatives between specific communities like some I don't remember the exact details right now

24:39.460 --> 24:44.460
but there was a security issue a few years ago that what?

24:44.460 --> 24:45.460
The far wrapper?

24:45.460 --> 24:58.460
Possibly I'm not a security person and it just goes in one ear not the other but so I think that there have been community level

24:58.460 --> 25:12.460
or you know especially on an individual level or local level collaborations already like I think that Jumla recently lent some video

25:12.460 --> 25:19.460
equipment to another CMS community in Germany for an event.

25:19.460 --> 25:20.460
Thank you.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.460
Yeah you're welcome.

25:22.460 --> 25:33.460
So it's not that it hasn't been happening it's about acknowledging the efforts that have been happening and also maybe being a little bit more coordinated with how we can do this

25:33.460 --> 25:40.460
because like Matias said we don't necessarily want to become each other we don't want a giant homogenous CMS monster.

25:40.460 --> 25:50.460
We have one thing that someone said a few days ago in a conversation about this was shared strengths and we can also still celebrate our differences

25:50.460 --> 25:58.460
because in different projects in different contexts one CMS is going to be a better choice than another.

25:58.460 --> 26:06.460
Jumla people in the room don't kill me for this but Jumla is not going to always be the best solution for every single project.

26:06.460 --> 26:17.460
It happens it's fine it's normal and I think it's important to say okay well this isn't a good choice for Jumla but it could be a good choice for type 03 or Drupal

26:17.460 --> 26:29.460
and if we have more collaboration around those things and recognition of what are the things that make us different or what are respective strengths are

26:29.460 --> 26:34.460
then we can help guide people to different choices that maybe they wouldn't otherwise make.

26:34.460 --> 26:38.460
It's kind of a just because you can doesn't mean you should situation.

26:38.460 --> 26:41.460
So sharing your word is sharing.

26:41.460 --> 26:42.460
I like that word.

26:42.460 --> 26:47.460
And choosing a technology.

26:47.460 --> 26:53.460
Do you want the mic?

26:53.460 --> 27:06.460
Choosing a given open source technology isn't always only WordPress does X better than type 03 does better than Drupal does.

27:06.460 --> 27:12.460
There's times when hey what is the local service provider market where I live?

27:12.460 --> 27:22.460
Who has been around and will help me run my business, the digital part of my business better in the long term?

27:22.460 --> 27:26.460
Or who made prettier designs this time?

27:26.460 --> 27:38.460
It's not just whether you're the super best at dynamic page building and the super best at very large very performance or the easiest way to get to specific site functionality

27:38.460 --> 27:44.460
or like great pre-packaged functionalities that get you going very fast.

27:44.460 --> 27:47.460
Everybody's got many other strengths as well.

27:56.460 --> 28:03.460
Just take a moment to reset.

28:03.460 --> 28:19.460
So I think in my talk I alluded to we had a pitch bird contest and one of the projects that receive funding was to put Gutenberg content editor into Drupal.

28:19.460 --> 28:25.460
And the person that funded that project was Matt Malinvec.

28:25.460 --> 28:29.460
Whether it was his own money or whether it was WordPress money I'm not sure.

28:29.460 --> 28:40.460
But in any commercial setting that would just make people's brains explode.

28:40.460 --> 28:50.460
That seeming competitor would offer their technology into a potentially competing platform.

28:50.460 --> 29:00.460
And I think what it speaks to is that in the Drupal world we were tearing our hair out a little bit in terms of content editor experience for a number of years.

29:00.460 --> 29:06.460
And we realized that there was this big gap between what was happening in WordPress and what was happening in Drupal.

29:06.460 --> 29:18.460
And I think it's a huge credit to both projects that there was this pragmatism to say well why are we going to spend all that effort to try and reinvent Gutenberg when we could actually just use Gutenberg.

29:18.460 --> 29:25.460
For the people that want to use it because it's not the type of thing that every use case will require.

29:25.460 --> 29:35.460
But for the people that want to use Drupal but they might be on the fence about committing because they do want that Gutenberg editor experience then that becomes a no brainer.

29:35.460 --> 29:43.460
And it might go the other way as well. Views in WordPress.

29:44.460 --> 29:56.460
But I think there is quite a strong model there in terms of where it makes sense to why reinvent the wheel when the wheel is already round.

29:56.460 --> 30:07.460
So other people's pretty things right? If it's clear that Gutenberg just represents a significantly better editorial experience for most people, right?

30:07.460 --> 30:12.460
That's something that we can actually all adopt and follow as a best practice or a standard or whatever.

30:12.460 --> 30:16.460
So that's back to the sharing point. Okay, terrific.

30:28.460 --> 30:33.460
You choose which piece and then that's how sharing works at my house.

30:34.460 --> 30:36.460
Whoever cuts doesn't get to choose which piece.

30:43.460 --> 30:49.460
Alright, so I feel really, really excited about this as a first step.

30:49.460 --> 30:53.460
I think the energy is there and the wheel is there to make this happen.

30:53.460 --> 30:58.460
I think it's a really interesting time economically and just in general in the world to be doing this.

30:59.460 --> 31:04.460
I've heard stories today that I never heard before and reasons to hope as well.

31:04.460 --> 31:16.460
And I think that getting these stories out and talking about these wins and talking about how this collaboration and sharing and connection is happening and can happen.

31:16.460 --> 31:26.460
I think there's a lot of fun, easy things to do like encouraging people to go to other people's meetups and fix a bug in somebody else's project, all that classic stuff.

31:26.460 --> 31:33.460
I feel like even that small stuff can really make a difference and those can really add up over time.

31:33.460 --> 31:39.460
Does anybody in the room have any questions for us in the last 10, 15 minutes that we've got here?

31:42.460 --> 31:44.460
Overloaded to here.

31:45.460 --> 31:47.460
We need coffee or beer.

31:47.460 --> 31:50.460
Can you read it?

31:50.460 --> 31:52.460
Thank you very much.

31:53.460 --> 31:58.460
Oh, see, I've been operating without glasses all day.

32:03.460 --> 32:05.460
Wait, is this one from Mike Giverd?

32:05.460 --> 32:07.460
It's for him.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.460
Oh, Mike is not in the room, but...

32:09.460 --> 32:12.460
Yeah, so Brian T. Mann wrote,

32:12.460 --> 32:23.460
I don't know if Mike Griffith is in the room, but he gave a talk yesterday about the collaboration that took place between several open source projects on accessibility under the EU funded research project.

32:23.460 --> 32:29.460
We need more of this shared research discussing the approaches and then our own implementations.

32:29.460 --> 32:32.460
We need to have more cross project research projects.

32:32.460 --> 32:33.460
That is a true.

32:33.460 --> 32:34.460
So thank you, Brian.

32:34.460 --> 32:35.460
That's terrific.

32:35.460 --> 32:38.460
Mike was here for part of the day, but he's not now.

32:38.460 --> 32:40.460
And I also...

32:42.460 --> 32:53.460
He wasn't here when the accessibility talk started, and I promised the guys to introduce him on LinkedIn and he showed up during their talk and connected with him on LinkedIn while they were talking, which was hilarious.

32:53.460 --> 32:55.460
So, yes.

32:55.460 --> 32:56.460
Yes.

32:57.460 --> 33:21.460
Just as the letter that came out of what is now the alliance to the European Union saying, hey, the Cyber Resilience Act has some significant problems and we'd love to help you, like, understand that the idea of it's illegal to release unfinished software is tricky, right?

33:21.460 --> 33:28.460
And, oh, there has to be software that is purely European if it's going to be run in Europe, like stuff like that.

33:28.460 --> 33:42.460
So a beautiful international community of practice sprang up and because these four projects run 50% of the web and because they were able to present a code instead of arguments, Europe's actually listening, right?

33:42.460 --> 33:44.460
We've gotten some doors open.

33:44.460 --> 34:04.460
So I think that sort of influence, right, is a really positive sign for us and the fact that we could probably also then go and make proposals that say, hey, European Future Project, whichever year they're going to do next, we'd like this money to put together X.

34:04.460 --> 34:12.460
Accessibility guidelines, GovStack, European version, whatever the ultimate, you know, editing experiences.

34:12.460 --> 34:14.460
I think that's a really interesting way to go.

34:14.460 --> 34:26.460
Yeah, and I just want to also, you know, give a big call out to Wagtail and to Umbroko who are here today as well as fellow open source CMS.

34:26.460 --> 34:37.460
Neither of them use PHP and I'm really happy that they're here because this is not, you know, for CMS group.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.460
This is really a group for everyone.

34:39.460 --> 34:59.460
And one thing that we haven't said anything about, well, we did say that we encourage everyone to become members, but we didn't say that the Open Website Alliance is built around everyone agreeing and, you know, making decisions together and that kind of stuff.

34:59.460 --> 35:11.460
But it also says in the charter that anyone who, you know, doesn't have anything to do with a certain issue are encouraged to refrain from voting.

35:11.460 --> 35:23.460
And that means that as a website alliance, we can also have smaller groups that, you know, are still supported by the whole alliance.

35:23.460 --> 35:35.460
Because for example, maybe there's something with a programming language that isn't PHP and the PHP guys can say, well, you know, we don't know anything about it, but, you know, we're not going to vote against it.

35:35.460 --> 35:44.460
And that's also a really important part of collaborating, saying that, you know, wow, you're doing an amazing job.

35:44.460 --> 35:49.460
It's not what I'm doing, but, you know, we're here together to support each other.

35:49.460 --> 35:57.460
And yeah, I love it.

35:57.460 --> 36:11.460
I also want to say that the results that we've seen with the CRA, with the European Union listening and chaining significantly from the original drafts is not only a result of the work that we did as CMSs.

36:11.460 --> 36:32.460
I think that a massive, massive amount of work and effort was put in by Open Forum Europe and their policy task force and everything and all of the very, I think almost 200 open source organizations had submitted feedback to the European Union about the CRA when it was during the feedback period.

36:32.460 --> 36:36.460
And so this is certainly not a result from just what we did.

36:36.460 --> 36:45.460
And I just want to make sure that we acknowledge that because so many people, so many projects put hours and hours and hours of time into this.

36:45.460 --> 36:49.460
And it really isn't perfect.

36:49.460 --> 37:00.460
I think one of the things that I liked that was said during the policy summit that we attended on Friday was that it's imperfect as all things made by humans are.

37:00.460 --> 37:03.460
But it's definitely a lot better than it would have been.

37:03.460 --> 37:20.460
So just brief shout out to them as well for their efforts and in making that kind of impact because it could have had a drastic, it would have changed drastically the way open source works, I think.

37:20.460 --> 37:24.460
What was the question?

37:24.460 --> 37:26.460
There wasn't one.

37:26.460 --> 37:27.460
There wasn't one.

37:27.460 --> 37:30.460
Hi, Brian.

37:30.460 --> 37:31.460
We've got this now.

37:31.460 --> 37:32.460
What do we do with it?

37:32.460 --> 37:33.460
Right.

37:33.460 --> 37:39.460
I think that we as an alliance.

37:39.460 --> 37:45.460
Yeah, Owen.

37:45.460 --> 37:49.460
I think I remember the question.

37:49.460 --> 38:01.460
Again, in my talk, I referenced that the protection of the open web is a very keen interest well beyond the people in this room.

38:01.460 --> 38:24.460
To the point, and I'm not sure how many people are aware, but the statement on the future of the Internet was signed by 60 national countries like their foreign officers signed this collective statement that said we need to keep the web open and free and interoperable and all of the things that we stand for and that we can support.

38:24.460 --> 38:35.460
And it's quite interesting to then think, okay, well, what kind of investment are they prepared to make to ensure that that remains the case?

38:35.460 --> 38:44.460
And then it's not just governments, it's major corporations, major tech companies that rely on the open web for their business models.

38:44.460 --> 38:50.460
If you have a major search engine, you cannot have content locked behind paywalls.

38:50.460 --> 38:58.460
So it's in their vested interest to ensure that content is open and indexable and all of those types of things as well.

38:58.460 --> 39:05.460
So there is significant forces out there that want to succeed.

39:05.460 --> 39:16.460
We need to have the language and the stories to be able to have those conversations with them in a way that that value then flows back into our projects.

39:16.460 --> 39:20.460
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

39:20.460 --> 39:24.460
This grouping in terms of scale, right?

39:24.460 --> 39:43.460
If the Alliance can come up with a common voice and common answers, more or less representing the hundreds of thousands of people who make a living either by building and maintaining these things or running their own businesses, right?

39:43.460 --> 39:49.460
The millions of people that benefit from all of our work, I think that gets us to see the table, right?

39:49.460 --> 39:58.460
And if we're prepared then to use the language that works at the higher levels than we are normal humans are used to interacting, right?

39:58.460 --> 40:06.460
I think that gives us a potential to make more of a difference too.

40:06.460 --> 40:08.460
Matthias is looking keen.

40:08.460 --> 40:12.460
Yeah, and about the charter, there's another point.

40:12.460 --> 40:14.460
We really like the charter.

40:14.460 --> 40:27.460
Yeah, the charter also allows us to have affiliates, so non-CMSs, but that sort of share our values that can also join meetings as observers, for example.

40:27.460 --> 40:31.460
And that's also a really nice feature that I like.

40:31.460 --> 40:44.460
And I know the clock is ticking here and we're closing in on five o'clock, and I also wanted to take this opportunity because I like to hear my own voice.

40:44.460 --> 40:48.460
But also because, Jam, you've done a fantastic job today.

40:48.460 --> 40:49.460
I wanted to say thank you.

40:49.460 --> 40:51.460
You volunteered to do this.

40:51.460 --> 40:56.460
So this is real volunteer community contribution.

40:56.460 --> 41:09.460
And just because I know what you love most in this world, I brought two bags of Norwegian salted nut chocolate for you.

41:09.460 --> 41:10.460
That counts as vegetables, right?

41:10.460 --> 41:14.460
That counts as vegetables because it's all from, you know, it's...

41:14.460 --> 41:15.460
I think it's fruit, technically.

41:15.460 --> 41:17.460
Yeah, it's technically fruit.

41:17.460 --> 41:20.460
So that works. It's five a day. Anyway.

41:20.460 --> 41:22.460
Thank you. I'm super happy to be here.

41:22.460 --> 41:24.460
He says he's super happy to be here.

41:24.460 --> 41:26.460
Yeah. Nice.

41:26.460 --> 41:28.460
He's happy to get the candy.

41:28.460 --> 41:30.460
He told us.

41:30.460 --> 41:32.460
What about my salt liquid?

41:32.460 --> 41:34.460
Oh, no.

41:34.460 --> 41:36.460
The tumble is for next day.

41:36.460 --> 41:38.460
So do you want a final word?

41:38.460 --> 41:43.460
Well, yes. Who's coming in exactly on time?

41:43.460 --> 41:49.460
I live in Germany. We love that because we don't get it from the trains anymore.

41:49.460 --> 41:52.460
So anyway, thank you all for coming. Thank you all the presenters.

41:52.460 --> 41:55.460
Thanks everyone who's here. Thank you also for the people on the stream.

41:55.460 --> 41:59.460
Thank you for having the super cool idea of the Alliance.

41:59.460 --> 42:04.460
Thank you for not representing WordPress but being very involved in WordPress.

42:04.460 --> 42:06.460
Just disclaimer, disclaimer, right?

42:06.460 --> 42:09.460
Thank you for coming the furthest to be here.

42:09.460 --> 42:12.460
Oh, and flew in from Australia to be here today.

42:12.460 --> 42:17.460
Right. And it really was my pleasure and privilege to be here and interact with all of you.

42:17.460 --> 42:22.460
And I'm really looking forward to the next time and to seeing what the Alliance does.

42:22.460 --> 42:24.460
So thanks everyone.
