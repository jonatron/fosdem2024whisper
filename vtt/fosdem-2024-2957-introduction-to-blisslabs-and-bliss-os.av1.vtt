00:30.000 --> 00:46.840
Okay, let's go to the next talk right now is John West and the talk is introduction

00:46.840 --> 00:49.640
to bliss labs and bliss OS.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.880
Thank you John, the stage is yours.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.360
Thank you.

00:54.360 --> 00:58.240
I represent bliss labs.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.120
Thank you very much.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.480
I represent bliss labs and bliss OS.

01:03.480 --> 01:10.840
So what bliss labs is, is we're a volunteer based 501C3 non-profit organization that helps

01:10.840 --> 01:18.640
open source projects thrive, mostly Android based, but we also do Linux projects as well.

01:18.640 --> 01:23.360
Our goal is to create and maintain various open source operating systems and other software

01:23.360 --> 01:29.320
that helps extend the life of devices in order to help with the world's e-waste problems.

01:29.320 --> 01:34.480
Bliss labs also maintains bliss OS and other open source software.

01:34.480 --> 01:40.560
We're not just a bunch of projects, we're a very mature open source org with a proper

01:40.560 --> 01:43.040
organizational structure.

01:43.040 --> 01:48.560
We work to mentor and teach future open source developers in all aspects.

01:48.560 --> 01:54.080
We form alliances with other projects that share in our visions.

01:54.080 --> 02:00.240
We develop tools to help minimize the complex development process of Android and Linux and

02:00.240 --> 02:01.400
aid in learning.

02:01.400 --> 02:08.200
And we also act as a global fiscal host for open source projects that are not able to

02:08.200 --> 02:11.320
monetize in their current region.

02:11.320 --> 02:17.440
So this allows for a much larger opportunity to work with others globally and increase

02:17.440 --> 02:21.520
their user base.

02:21.520 --> 02:27.320
Our region is global, so we have members of bliss labs all over the world.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.400
Age group ranges from 13 to 60.

02:31.400 --> 02:36.080
Students, professionals, retirees, the whole nine yards.

02:36.080 --> 02:45.600
Women, men were LGBT friendly, different able in key positions like CFO, CPO, CTO.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.840
For education, we don't have any requirements really.

02:48.840 --> 02:54.920
You can be a middle school student or you could have a PhD in the professor.

02:54.920 --> 03:02.480
Our estimated download count from the year we started in 2014 is now up to over 6 million.

03:02.480 --> 03:07.840
That's across the entire suite of bliss labs projects.

03:07.840 --> 03:13.040
And speaking of the projects, how many of you recognize any of these logos?

03:13.040 --> 03:14.040
Anybody?

03:14.480 --> 03:16.280
Okay.

03:16.280 --> 03:24.720
To go over some of these, we have BlissOS, which is a unified Android experience irrespective

03:24.720 --> 03:26.120
of hardware.

03:26.120 --> 03:33.640
We use Android X86 as the base OS, works on Intel and AMD X8664 version 2 devices and

03:33.640 --> 03:35.000
greater.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.320
We also run RayDroid, Android integration with Linux.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.400
It's a lightweight containerized base project.

03:43.400 --> 03:50.440
We run Android Linux hybrid, which is a cross of Linux and Android running on bare metal

03:50.440 --> 03:52.040
hardware.

03:52.040 --> 03:59.720
We maintain SmartDoc, which is a desktop UX for Android.

03:59.720 --> 04:07.040
We maintain XTmapper, which is an on-screen keymapper for Android as well.

04:07.040 --> 04:14.360
We maintain a community called Supreme Gamers, which is centered on Android X86 development.

04:14.360 --> 04:22.200
We also maintain BoringDroid, which is a complete open source desktop UI solution for AOSP.

04:22.200 --> 04:27.360
We're adding Bliss base to the mix now, which is a production ready example of Android on

04:27.360 --> 04:36.920
X86 based on Bliss, but geared towards, we'll say, commercial applications.

04:36.920 --> 04:43.520
Then we maintain Android Generic Project, which is an easy button for Android X86 and

04:43.520 --> 04:45.600
BlissOS builds.

04:45.600 --> 04:51.400
We also maintain BlissROM, which is Android for Android devices.

04:52.400 --> 04:59.920
Our matured process model includes building, testing, releasing, and documentation for

04:59.920 --> 05:05.720
both dev and users, and then post-release support.

05:05.720 --> 05:10.720
Popular open source projects having links with our projects.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.160
BlendOS is one.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.360
They use our RayDroid project.

05:15.360 --> 05:19.480
Ubuntu Web also uses our RayDroid project.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.200
Ubuntu Touch is well.

05:22.200 --> 05:27.200
PrimeOS, which uses Android Generic Project to generate their images.

05:27.200 --> 05:34.400
Then Android X86, we fully support that project by supplying team resources, build servers,

05:34.400 --> 05:38.240
development, et cetera.

05:38.240 --> 05:43.080
What we do to support sub-projects is we attend conferences like this.

05:43.080 --> 05:48.640
We supply hardware for testing, hardware for development, hardware for build and web

05:48.640 --> 05:56.960
servers, and communication servers like Slack, Discord, GC, Telegram, Matrix, et cetera.

05:56.960 --> 06:02.960
Then we provide software services like storage, source, forging, GDrive, or development services

06:02.960 --> 06:11.960
like GitLab, GitHub, Access to Jira, Confluence, Trello, and then servers for updates, OTA,

06:11.960 --> 06:16.120
GitHub, and CICL.

06:16.120 --> 06:20.680
Which brings me to the next part of what we're doing here, is we're introducing BlissOS,

06:20.680 --> 06:24.480
which is an Android on X86 hardware.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.880
It's Android for your PC.

06:26.880 --> 06:32.040
Funny thing is, my Linux PC took a crap on traveling out here.

06:32.040 --> 06:38.040
I actually had to put this whole thing together on Android X86, so on BlissOS.

06:38.120 --> 06:42.640
That's what we're seeing this whole thing run today from.

06:42.640 --> 06:48.160
It's based on mainline Linux, so using Android X86 patches on top of the kernel in order

06:48.160 --> 06:51.360
to provide support for Android subsystem.

06:51.360 --> 06:59.240
We have features of desktop UI, changes for X86 hardware, custom house, et cetera.

06:59.240 --> 07:04.920
Generic builds, so one ISO runs everything.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.840
We have tons of customization options included.

07:08.840 --> 07:17.760
Low resources based subsystem, so it's a very low overhead system to run Android on

07:17.760 --> 07:19.880
X86 hardware.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.000
A lot like Edge Linux would be.

07:23.000 --> 07:30.840
Then we have added Linux tools integrated with Android, like Turmux, networking tools.

07:30.840 --> 07:40.760
We bring in DRM hardware composer, Greylock, Mesa, all from mainline Linux.

07:40.760 --> 07:51.680
Some of the diverse use cases of BlissOS and the likes are kiosks, mobile devices, PCs,

07:51.680 --> 07:59.680
gaming devices like the Steam Deck, automotive displays, POS and customer facing displays,

07:59.680 --> 08:07.120
new displays, ad displays, TV and large screen applications, IoT and industrial IoT, industrial

08:07.120 --> 08:12.160
displays, gaming and component displays.

08:12.160 --> 08:14.760
BlissOS is open source.

08:14.760 --> 08:21.760
It's based on Apache version 2, GPL version 2 and GPL version 3.

08:21.760 --> 08:26.560
If you're using BlissOS, as is, it's free and open source to use anywhere.

08:26.560 --> 08:33.480
If you're using BlissOS, using a modified source, still comes as open source as long

08:33.480 --> 08:35.760
as you release the source code.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.240
It's open for anybody to use in their project.

08:38.240 --> 08:44.840
Coming to BlissLabs is not a requirement as long as you release that source code.

08:44.840 --> 08:50.320
Then a small per device or perpetual licensing cost for those that are using a modified source

08:50.320 --> 08:55.080
and do not wish to release that source code.

08:55.080 --> 08:59.320
Some of our milestone achievements as of lately are EIDU.

08:59.320 --> 09:06.600
We've gotten into a pilot program for Kenya using their low end hardware with our operating

09:06.600 --> 09:08.320
system.

09:08.320 --> 09:11.040
Companies have been using it in products lately.

09:11.040 --> 09:17.400
We've been shortlisted by Swarchforge multiple times as a featured project.

09:17.400 --> 09:22.840
We've been adding more and more devices every year.

09:22.840 --> 09:28.320
You can find demo videos on our website as of this week.

09:28.320 --> 09:38.520
You can also download an ISO for Android 11, 12, 13, and as of today, Android 14, which

09:38.520 --> 09:41.160
is our announcement today.

09:41.160 --> 09:46.640
We will be making BlissOS version 17 available within the next couple of days for everybody

09:46.640 --> 09:48.360
to test and download.

09:48.360 --> 09:52.120
Swarchforge is already on GitHub.

09:52.120 --> 09:55.560
The source is already on GitHub.

09:55.560 --> 10:04.240
Initial features are ported from Android 13 to 14, including desktop UI, dual ethernet,

10:04.240 --> 10:08.720
multi-display, et cetera.

10:08.720 --> 10:13.840
What you can expect from us in the near future are more device groups will be supporting

10:13.840 --> 10:19.200
Raspberry Pi, RISC 5, et cetera.

10:19.200 --> 10:26.320
More leaning towards the Linux hybrid side of things, where we'll have a larger Linux

10:26.320 --> 10:29.040
subsystem running Android on top.

10:29.040 --> 10:35.680
We'll be more independent and a complete fossil ecosystem, so we'll be providing tools

10:35.680 --> 10:44.840
for companies and individuals to create their own cutoff app stores, pretty much.

10:44.840 --> 10:52.480
Then we're going to be supplying some Edge IoT and IIoT examples as well in the code.

10:52.480 --> 10:57.920
Our process, we're going to be documenting even for newbies, so we're going to continue

10:57.920 --> 11:02.000
on that, dumbing it down for everybody.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.600
And automated installation support, so we're working on a couple new installers, graphical

11:07.600 --> 11:11.440
installers as well as text mode installers for Linux.

11:11.440 --> 11:19.120
And then we're going to fine tune our AI-enabled support bots that we use to help users answer

11:19.120 --> 11:23.880
the questions so we don't have to.

11:23.880 --> 11:30.520
Community engagement includes contests, Easter eggs we put into the operating system.

11:30.520 --> 11:39.960
We have goodies we often do giveaways, stickers, t-shirts, et cetera, get points, and then

11:39.960 --> 11:44.840
Blisify videos in the link on our website.

11:44.840 --> 11:51.360
Opportunities available through Blis Labs and BlisOS are internships, mentorships, open

11:51.360 --> 11:54.560
roles paid soon.

11:54.560 --> 12:01.000
We'll be web development, server maintenance, project management, HR, finance, and developers.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.760
Contributors can get mileage for the next move in their career or can be absorbed by

12:06.760 --> 12:11.800
BlisOS, BlisLabs for commercial opportunities.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.440
We have a very easy streamlined way of joining.

12:15.440 --> 12:22.640
We cut out most of the crap, no ego, but we are healthy and drama free.

12:22.640 --> 12:29.560
We are full democracy on team, so we have a flat structure, nobody's head of anything,

12:29.560 --> 12:36.440
nobody's overseer, nobody's the god of Blis.

12:36.440 --> 12:39.400
And that brings us to where you can find us online.

12:39.400 --> 12:45.560
So if you could scan the QR code, that'll take you to our link tree and that has all

12:45.560 --> 12:49.760
the links available for you to contact us and move forward in the future.

12:50.240 --> 12:56.560
If you have any questions, I will be available outside the room and I have my device and

12:56.560 --> 13:00.400
a couple other screens so I could demo if you guys are interested.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.120
Thank you very much.
