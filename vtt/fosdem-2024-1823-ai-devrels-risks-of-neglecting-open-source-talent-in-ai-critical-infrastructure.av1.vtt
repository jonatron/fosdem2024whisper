WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.640
Thank you so much for attending for my talk.

00:10.640 --> 00:18.100
So today I'm going to be talking about a topic that at the end of the talk I'm planning

00:18.100 --> 00:23.480
to do like an open forum to hear your thoughts because, well, this is part of the presentation

00:23.480 --> 00:25.480
and part of the discussion.

00:25.480 --> 00:32.640
So we are talking about trying to find other areas where a dev rel can be critical and

00:32.640 --> 00:39.280
valuable for an organization perspective and where are the risks of neglecting critical

00:39.280 --> 00:42.240
open source infrastructure.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.280
So before getting started, a little bit of myself.

00:45.280 --> 00:51.600
And currently the project manager at Chuta Group, that is a Linux foundation project

00:51.600 --> 01:00.400
formed by a group of community sharing open source from offices, best practices and tooling,

01:00.400 --> 01:06.480
basically to help with open source management, open source operations and sharing the value

01:06.480 --> 01:09.680
of OSPOS among organizations.

01:09.680 --> 01:15.080
But before that I was working at Viteria, that is a software development analytics firm.

01:15.080 --> 01:22.480
I spent there three and a half years and I can say that everything I know about open

01:22.480 --> 01:28.920
source, like my very background was thanks to them so I own them a lot.

01:28.920 --> 01:34.880
While I was in Viteria, I was also studying my masters in data science that I finished

01:34.880 --> 01:41.640
and I focused my thesis on a really interesting report based on dev rel.

01:41.640 --> 01:51.680
So I still have in my repo that is public in my GitLab account because I'm mixing between.

01:51.680 --> 01:57.160
That was a set of Python scripts to gather and analyze data to measure the value of

01:57.160 --> 02:02.320
dev rels when helping open source communities.

02:02.320 --> 02:10.120
And right now I'm also studying another masters because I like to keep myself busy in front

02:10.120 --> 02:15.280
of content and struggling with JavaScript.

02:15.280 --> 02:21.080
In my spare time when I have some, I try to contribute to other open source communities

02:21.080 --> 02:26.040
and foundations like in your source commons, open chains or chaos.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.040
So that's me.

02:27.040 --> 02:35.040
So before getting into the topic, I know this is quite boring, descriptions and definitions

02:35.120 --> 02:40.320
but I think it's important because when we are talking about developer relations, you

02:40.320 --> 02:47.280
can type on Google or in other search engines and they will give you thousands of definitions

02:47.280 --> 02:54.040
and send to open source and also even when you type AI, it's like, oh, I don't really

02:54.040 --> 02:56.360
understand what do we mean.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.640
So I'm not here to set up a definition.

02:59.720 --> 03:06.720
I'm here to at least say during this presentation, when we are referring to developer relations,

03:07.440 --> 03:09.440
that is the definition we will use.

03:09.440 --> 03:13.520
When we are referring to open source, that is the definition we will use.

03:13.520 --> 03:18.640
And when we are referring to generative AI, that is the definition we will use.

03:18.640 --> 03:25.160
So we will see developer relations as a discipline that focus on supporting developers and building

03:25.160 --> 03:31.520
relationships with developers and also connecting with the organization's goals.

03:31.520 --> 03:38.520
In open source, in this context, we will see it as a method and also as a culture to develop

03:38.520 --> 03:41.000
and distribute software.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
But we also saw that open source as a wide variety like open data, also open hardware

03:48.240 --> 03:50.000
and so on.

03:50.000 --> 03:57.000
And generative AI, because I know AI has been here for ages, but now people are calling

03:57.000 --> 03:59.920
AI everything.

03:59.920 --> 04:05.200
In here, we will put it in the technology capable on generating text, but also image

04:05.200 --> 04:11.200
or other data, two models that basically is a generative model and that is why it's called

04:11.200 --> 04:14.120
generative AI.

04:14.120 --> 04:21.120
So our objectives for this presentation is basically answering these three questions,

04:22.840 --> 04:27.480
the first one and most important I would say is how these three things are connected.

04:27.480 --> 04:34.480
Because sometimes you talk open source, you talk about gen AI, and then you are also thinking

04:34.720 --> 04:39.920
on the organization side about, okay, and how those are connected with the security and

04:39.960 --> 04:44.360
innovation goals that an organization might have.

04:44.360 --> 04:51.360
Also why so this organization considers this open source integration when investing in

04:51.440 --> 04:54.280
AI.

04:54.280 --> 05:01.280
And I think this is where DevRoss comes in, who can facilitate such connection.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
So to start with, I wanted to really serve like the typical and really base and basic

05:13.800 --> 05:20.800
process when gathering data and when training models and in sum up like the AI lifecycle

05:21.640 --> 05:28.640
and try to ask ourselves where is open source here.

05:29.160 --> 05:36.160
So when, because AI is just like a small part of the whole process when you also need to

05:36.160 --> 05:41.680
clean the data which takes you sometimes like 80% of the whole time and then when you clean

05:41.680 --> 05:44.920
the data you perform an experimentally analysis.

05:44.920 --> 05:49.960
Like that is a process that is not just an AI, it has been on machine learning, it has

05:49.960 --> 05:54.880
been also in the science studies.

05:54.880 --> 06:01.880
There's not something new that we don't know, but I think an important question when looking

06:02.080 --> 06:07.200
at around all this life cycle is to ask where is open source.

06:07.200 --> 06:14.200
The sort of question, the answer would be, well, it's literally everywhere in any step

06:14.200 --> 06:15.280
of the process.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.160
And let me tell you why.

06:18.160 --> 06:25.160
So around the technology stack when an organization decides to invest in artificial intelligence,

06:27.640 --> 06:33.640
generative artificial intelligence in this case, there are different components that

06:33.640 --> 06:40.160
they need to take care of or they need to start thinking of.

06:40.160 --> 06:47.160
And in the technology stack you see tools for data collections or which generative AI

06:48.640 --> 06:51.760
model to use because there are different ones.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.720
What is the deep learning framework you will use?

06:54.720 --> 06:59.440
Are they going to use TensorFlow, Python, Keras?

06:59.440 --> 07:05.240
Also if you are thinking about putting into a container, what is the best tool or the

07:05.240 --> 07:08.080
best framework to use as well?

07:08.080 --> 07:14.040
When you are trying to represent that data, are you going to represent it in graphs?

07:14.120 --> 07:20.720
Then maybe you use D3JS or are you going to represent it into another different format

07:20.720 --> 07:24.920
and use Matplotlib?

07:24.920 --> 07:31.920
I keep saying names and childrens and many, many of those childrens are open source.

07:33.080 --> 07:40.080
I think that is when talking with organizations and not in the tech sector and more in the

07:40.560 --> 07:43.640
business side, the decision makers.

07:43.720 --> 07:50.720
They are not aware that when they say let's invest in AI or let's use this AI for creating

07:50.840 --> 07:57.400
software or for our internal development, they are not aware that the technology stack,

07:57.400 --> 08:04.400
the baseline that muters all that AI, it is powered by open source.

08:05.800 --> 08:12.800
So now, well, you might see this famous image, I just edited it a bit.

08:14.600 --> 08:20.280
So instead of thinking like modern infrastructure, think about the AI technology stack, how it

08:20.280 --> 08:27.280
is like chat GPT and all these popular AI toolings, even though they are proprietary.

08:29.200 --> 08:34.200
I mean, chat GPT is powered by PyTorch, that is open source.

08:34.200 --> 08:40.800
But anyway, think about that and then think about these open source maintainers being

08:40.800 --> 08:47.800
burned out because open source is just different from a proprietary software and organizations

08:49.240 --> 08:51.520
selling proprietary software.

08:51.520 --> 08:58.520
And I think that is the message that sometimes organizations might not want to understand.

09:00.600 --> 09:07.600
So organizations are far more innovative and secure in collaboration than insulation,

09:08.600 --> 09:13.600
but I think everyone here knows that.

09:13.600 --> 09:19.600
I think organizations have in their minds like yes, the benefits of open source and so on,

09:19.600 --> 09:23.600
but I think the tricky question here is how.

09:23.600 --> 09:30.600
And I know in the other time we were talking about OSPOS and as a vehicle to make that happen.

09:31.600 --> 09:38.600
But even OSPOS sometimes they are struggling to prove their value and to do the right work

09:41.320 --> 09:46.720
because organizations don't understand how they just heard the word OSPOS and they just

09:46.720 --> 09:51.480
go there and OSPOS cannot perform their work, for instance.

09:51.480 --> 09:56.480
So how can organizations advance in their AI maturity?

09:57.360 --> 10:00.360
So everything starts with people.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.360
Let's start with the baseline.

10:03.360 --> 10:10.360
And the people, it's a cross functional skill set of different areas.

10:11.360 --> 10:18.360
So of course we need to have project managers, but we also need security and license compliance

10:19.240 --> 10:26.240
and people managing the project health of the projects of the critical infrastructure,

10:27.240 --> 10:32.240
also all the infrastructure on IT development.

10:32.240 --> 10:39.240
In this talk, I know because this is really, really broad, I really want to focus on these

10:40.240 --> 10:46.240
three areas that can be like more attached to what our developer relations or community

10:46.240 --> 10:51.240
management role is.

10:51.240 --> 10:58.240
So when coming back to this integration of open source and how it connects with Gen AI

10:59.440 --> 11:06.440
and how it connects with the organizational schools in terms of security and innovation,

11:07.880 --> 11:14.880
I believe, and again this will be later an open forum, that there was with this experience

11:15.280 --> 11:22.280
in open source communities might be hidden gems for organizations that are right now

11:23.320 --> 11:30.320
investing thousands and thousands of dollars or euros in using or creating Gen AI power

11:31.320 --> 11:32.880
tools.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.880
And why?

11:33.880 --> 11:36.800
Okay, let's see the scope again.

11:36.800 --> 11:43.800
So we already have seen that machine learning, I mean not only AI, there's a lot of information

11:44.880 --> 11:47.960
that depends on open source projects.

11:47.960 --> 11:54.960
And these projects are maintained by developers that require support, they really are seeking

11:55.080 --> 12:02.080
for help because they cannot like, issues keep coming, keep going on and sometimes they

12:02.560 --> 12:06.440
don't have enough hands.

12:06.440 --> 12:13.440
And at that role that is this connector, this person that has the knowledge of an organization

12:13.440 --> 12:18.760
and has and understand the needs of those developers, of those maintainers because maybe

12:18.760 --> 12:24.160
in the past they were developers, they were open source maintainers too, can have to build

12:24.160 --> 12:31.160
this relationship and can transmit to the community the value and also to the organization

12:32.800 --> 12:33.840
a business value.

12:33.840 --> 12:40.840
I think that is this person, this linchpin that can connect and help both worlds.

12:41.280 --> 12:46.280
It's a win-win situation in my honest opinion.

12:46.280 --> 12:53.280
So, two organizations that maybe I know like someone were asking, yeah it's hard for an

12:57.520 --> 13:03.520
organization to prove the value of contributing to open source or using open source.

13:03.520 --> 13:10.520
So I think it's smart to invest not just on the final product but to what is behind.

13:11.840 --> 13:14.080
But it's smart to know how.

13:14.080 --> 13:21.080
And I think we are now coming into a point where we know the benefits, we know like we

13:21.280 --> 13:28.280
can think, analyze whether or not we should use or not use open source.

13:29.160 --> 13:34.120
But when we are using open source, we need to know how or if not, the organization is

13:34.120 --> 13:39.880
not going to see value and the communities are going to be at risk.

13:39.920 --> 13:46.920
So, this comes from one of the blog posts from the open source.com blog.

13:48.800 --> 13:55.300
And I think it's really interesting to see like how the old software supply chain funnel

13:55.300 --> 14:02.300
was and now how with open source you are putting a new layer and organization needs to really

14:03.880 --> 14:06.200
understand that layer.

14:06.200 --> 14:12.320
Because since it's a supply chain funnel, if someone fails at the very beginning, it

14:12.320 --> 14:17.840
will impact to their product, it will impact to their services and to their customers and

14:17.840 --> 14:19.760
to money.

14:19.760 --> 14:24.600
If it's a company and if not, it will impact to the experience.

14:24.600 --> 14:31.600
For instance, if we are talking with a government or a public administration.

14:32.600 --> 14:39.600
So, how we were talking about people, but there are other ways also to make that happen.

14:41.400 --> 14:44.960
Because sometimes one person is not enough.

14:44.960 --> 14:51.960
As I mentioned earlier, it's about a cross functional team or a skill set of people.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.000
We were mentioning that there was a really critical role.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.640
But there are people with experience in license compliance.

15:00.640 --> 15:06.120
There are people with experience in security compliance and infrastructure.

15:06.120 --> 15:13.120
So, if an organization is creating this cross functional team with different experts who

15:14.320 --> 15:18.000
sets the world for us in the organization.

15:18.000 --> 15:23.960
Because everyone will have different micro goals, different objectives, how can we put

15:24.000 --> 15:27.320
order into all these scales.

15:27.320 --> 15:33.440
This is a way, there is a way, but there are other many ways on how that to bring this

15:33.440 --> 15:39.400
connection and also connect with the different teams in the organization.

15:39.400 --> 15:43.160
Because here when we are talking about open source, we are talking about open source as

15:43.160 --> 15:50.160
a way to integrate it into the existing organizational teams.

15:50.600 --> 15:56.520
So we are thinking about how open source can help engineering teams to do their things,

15:56.520 --> 16:00.040
the things they have been doing, but with open source.

16:00.040 --> 16:05.120
And we are also helping the security team to do their things they have been doing also

16:05.120 --> 16:05.960
with open source.

16:05.960 --> 16:10.680
It's about integrating open source in what already exists.

16:10.680 --> 16:17.680
So there is one of the vehicles that has been proven to be effective in many organizations,

16:18.680 --> 16:22.560
that is OSPOS.

16:22.560 --> 16:27.680
And OSPOS sometimes they have devils and project manager, they have legal experts, they have

16:27.680 --> 16:29.440
security experts.

16:29.440 --> 16:33.000
So it's in a nutshell, this dedicated cross functional team.

16:33.000 --> 16:38.160
They don't need to be physical team, they can be virtual.

16:38.160 --> 16:44.840
So they can already have like in having like this advisors or experts into the different

16:44.880 --> 16:49.960
teams that the organization have.

16:49.960 --> 16:56.960
And these are some of the success stories based on the state of the OSPOS 2023 report.

16:57.720 --> 17:04.720
This is a study conducted by the organization I am currently working for, that is the children

17:04.720 --> 17:08.600
group has been doing this since 2018.

17:08.600 --> 17:14.800
And you have all the raw data in case you want to know like the devolution since in

17:14.800 --> 17:19.280
the children group's last OSPOS survey GitHub report.

17:19.280 --> 17:26.280
And in here the last year we saw that 93% of the OSPOS, the participants that responded

17:28.400 --> 17:33.600
they were part of the OSPOS, they had an OSPON, the organization were providing advice to

17:33.600 --> 17:35.760
security teams.

17:35.760 --> 17:42.760
And they also, we also saw that these OSPOS were really engaging in current age technology.

17:43.760 --> 17:48.760
Like containers or AI or data science.

17:48.760 --> 17:55.760
And also we saw in terms of how effective are those organizations providing upstream

17:57.480 --> 18:02.280
contributions like contributing back to those projects.

18:02.280 --> 18:07.360
We saw also a really big impact for those organizations who had OSPOS.

18:07.360 --> 18:14.360
So I'm not saying that the solution is OSPOS, but it's true that we are saying that...

18:14.360 --> 18:21.360
No, no, I mean I feel like...

18:21.360 --> 18:28.360
I'm not saying that, but just look at the data, no.

18:28.360 --> 18:33.360
All right.

18:33.360 --> 18:38.360
So you have the study there in case you want to be a bit more into that.

18:38.360 --> 18:45.360
So this was like a small break, but let's come back to the red-bird role.

18:49.360 --> 18:52.360
That can be in an OSPOS or not.

18:52.360 --> 18:59.360
I wanted to open the now the room for those people to think about what to the red-bird role description

19:01.360 --> 19:07.360
of the characteristics we have seen, like with an open source background, with an organization

19:11.360 --> 19:16.360
that has this deep AI involvement or they are willing to invest more in AI could look like.

19:17.360 --> 19:25.360
These are some examples I added, like for instance that the red-bird might have to have maybe an understanding on how

19:25.360 --> 19:32.360
the genitive AI models works much similar and how the different much similar frameworks works.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.360
Maybe they have been working already with some of those frameworks.

19:35.360 --> 19:43.360
They should have experience in contributing or maintaining open source projects in their past or currently.

19:44.360 --> 19:50.360
And disability, so this is more like their typical skill set, right?

19:50.360 --> 19:56.360
So advocates, developers need and be able to communicate that feedback to the organization.

19:56.360 --> 20:03.360
And disability could collaborate with organizations, with foundations, with independent maintainers from

20:03.360 --> 20:09.360
open source projects to co-create value because open source is a community of communities.

20:10.360 --> 20:21.360
So, yeah, this is to sum up with, I would like to open this open forum with this question,

20:21.360 --> 20:29.360
like how can we address the value of the role in AI field and teams to decision makers that basically

20:29.360 --> 20:34.360
are the ones that might be putting the money and investment.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.360
And yeah, thank you.

20:40.360 --> 20:42.360
Thank you.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.360
Anybody have any questions?

20:54.360 --> 21:04.360
So, have you thought about how this might change in the next couple of months or a year from now

21:04.360 --> 21:12.360
when we move towards, rather, an actual open source definition of AI?

21:12.360 --> 21:21.360
Because what you've described are, is AI, and brilliantly, AI that's using a lot of open source tools.

21:21.360 --> 21:26.360
But the open source initiative is trying to figure out what the open AI definition is.

21:26.360 --> 21:33.360
Do you feel like that's going to change thesis a little bit or it's not really,

21:33.360 --> 21:36.360
that the problem will be the same?

21:36.360 --> 21:40.360
I think that can be like a different scope.

21:40.360 --> 21:49.360
I'm also aware in the working group that the open source initiative is doing to come up with an open source definition of AI.

21:49.360 --> 21:58.360
I know it's hard because open source, for those who are unaware, open source is like software and in that sense

21:58.360 --> 22:03.360
it's like, okay, this is a way to distribute it, but AI has different components.

22:03.360 --> 22:07.360
What about the training models? What about the outcomes?

22:07.360 --> 22:09.360
What about the model itself?

22:09.360 --> 22:13.360
So it has different components and they need to define that.

22:13.360 --> 22:14.360
So it's hard.

22:14.360 --> 22:21.360
I will say, coming back to your question, I think that that is another angle.

22:21.360 --> 22:30.360
Like the organization can decide whether or not to use open source in their AI.

22:30.360 --> 22:38.360
And if they use open source, they might still need help from their brothers and people to take care of that critical infrastructure.

22:38.360 --> 22:50.360
But if they are not using open source AI, if they are still using TADGPT or other framework that is proprietary for building their machine learning models,

22:50.360 --> 22:52.360
they still need to do that.

22:52.360 --> 23:05.360
But maybe the planning or the objectives are going to be different from an organization that in the last phase they are still using open source

23:05.360 --> 23:11.360
versus an organization that in the last phase they are using proprietary software.

23:12.360 --> 23:18.360
Thank you for the presentation.

23:18.360 --> 23:25.360
And I just want to say that I think it's wonderful actually because in every discussion around open source that I've heard around AI today,

23:25.360 --> 23:29.360
it has been this kind of open source AI versus closed source AI.

23:29.360 --> 23:36.360
So I think the opportunity to remind people that so much of closed source AI is still dependent on open source technology is a huge...

23:36.360 --> 23:44.360
Like it's kind of like, which way you go, these are the things that need to be addressed and you can only do that by getting engaged in the open source ecosystem.

23:44.360 --> 23:47.360
It's a huge, powerful message actually. So thank you for highlighting it.

23:47.360 --> 23:51.360
And I guess the question I would have is how would we do that more?

23:51.360 --> 23:57.360
Because the conversation around open source in AI seems to be all around this, how do we define open source AI?

23:57.360 --> 24:04.360
But actually this point is probably more powerful and potentially more beneficial for the open source ecosystem

24:04.360 --> 24:11.360
because it's definitely true and there's definitely things you can do today to support that whole ecosystem.

24:11.360 --> 24:17.360
So how can we as a community kind of highlight that I guess? It gets lost in that other question.

24:17.360 --> 24:26.360
So what has been helping me is to focus on the supply chain funnel.

24:27.360 --> 24:40.360
Because like organizations are focused on just the tip of the iceberg and when they give a closer, like a deeper view on the whole picture, they say, oh, okay.

24:40.360 --> 24:45.360
So this is like a domino, is it called? Yeah, like a domino thing.

24:45.360 --> 24:51.360
Like if I screw up at the very beginning and everything is going to fall down.

24:51.360 --> 24:58.360
So that's what has worked, not saying, maybe others will say it's not so.

24:58.360 --> 25:04.360
Thank you. Great talk. Your question at the end posed around DevRel.

25:04.360 --> 25:09.360
Very compelling argument and I don't think you'd get much disagreement.

25:09.360 --> 25:15.360
But we seem to be losing the battle and losing DevRel's as pay positions.

25:15.360 --> 25:20.360
It seems to be the first thing that gets cut. Do you have any thoughts on that?

25:24.360 --> 25:31.360
Yeah, so you mean that right now they are going through a lot of the layoffs.

25:31.360 --> 25:38.360
And so, yeah, so actually, and I don't know if the message was quite understood of this talk,

25:38.360 --> 25:44.360
was to try to explore like other areas where the DevRel can provide value.

25:44.360 --> 25:53.360
Like there's going layoffs in DevRel, but on the other hand, organizations are investing thousands on AI.

25:53.360 --> 25:57.360
Like they are obsessed and it's like, are you obsessed with that? Okay.

25:57.360 --> 26:06.360
But in the other hand, you are losing and you are, yeah, you're losing the talent that will secure

26:06.360 --> 26:11.360
and will help you to your AI planning and strategy.

26:11.360 --> 26:21.360
So that was like the main goal of this to try to explore this role of DevRel into this emerging trends where the investment is going through.

26:21.360 --> 26:26.360
So how do we help DevRel's reposition themselves into that AI space?

26:26.360 --> 26:37.360
I think like, like giving like certain kinds of talks to like, related with AI and where the DevRel's can be helping.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.360
Like advocacy is always helping.

26:40.360 --> 26:45.360
And also maybe start exploring these job descriptions.

26:45.360 --> 26:53.360
I feel like, like for instance, in the Tudor group, we have these Ospo descriptions where we serve it in public.

26:53.360 --> 26:58.360
And then organizations use it to hire talent.

26:58.360 --> 27:06.360
Maybe like having this kind of like similar framework for a DevRel, like, okay, where can we include job descriptions?

27:06.360 --> 27:15.360
And we can include this AI DevRel and start advocating from that angle might help.

27:15.360 --> 27:22.360
Just a comment on that. I'm sorry, I came in late. I love that it's women also caring about developer relations.

27:22.360 --> 27:27.360
I work on an open source project that's building AI infrastructure.

27:28.360 --> 27:33.360
And we are at such a low level of the tech stack right now.

27:33.360 --> 27:40.360
We hope to be able to build developer tooling and provide a product that will give people access to that infrastructure.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.360
But we are just at such early stages.

27:42.360 --> 27:52.360
And I wonder if that's not also a problem for other projects right now is we're just not at a level of the stack that there's really good developer tooling to market.

27:52.360 --> 27:58.360
Because I think that's when DevRel becomes really powerful when you have a product people can use.

27:58.360 --> 28:09.360
So I would encourage DevRelers to become more active as product builders and help your engineering and more technical teams actually productize what they're doing right now.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.360
So the question.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.360
It's not a question.

28:15.360 --> 28:20.360
Oh, okay, okay. I was like, I think it was like a sense.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.360
Okay.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.360
Anybody else have any questions for Anna?
