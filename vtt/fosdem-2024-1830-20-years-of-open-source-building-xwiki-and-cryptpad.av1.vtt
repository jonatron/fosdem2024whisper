00:00.000 --> 00:10.520
Okay, so hello everybody and thank you for coming so early.

00:10.520 --> 00:15.640
And so for those that were not there before, since you came so early, there are a few free

00:15.640 --> 00:18.360
t-shirts if you want to take them.

00:18.360 --> 00:26.960
So I'm going to talk about the story of our company, X-Wiki SS, building the X-Wiki and

00:26.960 --> 00:30.760
CripPad open source software in the last 20 years.

00:30.760 --> 00:36.720
So first a bit of a track about myself.

00:36.720 --> 00:44.200
And so I discovered technology in 1984, like using an Apple II and then I moved to PCs,

00:44.200 --> 00:49.200
I even moved to Windows 95, then I graduated from a good school.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.520
And actually in that good school I was kind of told, so I was actually, it was that we

00:54.520 --> 00:59.080
had a speech at some point telling us, you're a soldier of economic war.

00:59.080 --> 01:05.920
And so that of course resonated in a young person, but it also, I mean later on, it's

01:05.920 --> 01:08.680
like what, I mean why are we doing war?

01:08.680 --> 01:10.680
Like that doesn't make any sense.

01:10.680 --> 01:15.360
We're not fighting other countries, we should work together with other countries.

01:15.360 --> 01:21.640
And then in 1995, I was really very interested by the internet.

01:21.640 --> 01:30.440
I saw people using Mozilla browsers, Mosaic browsers in the school and I really just wanted

01:30.440 --> 01:34.200
to work on internet technology.

01:34.200 --> 01:42.280
And I ended up, so I started, I took one job about the internet at Capgemini, but after

01:42.280 --> 01:49.040
a few months I was recruited by Netscape because somebody from the team had left to Netscape

01:49.040 --> 01:51.000
and I ended up working three years.

01:51.000 --> 01:58.280
So who knows Netscape here, like okay, like so just not so bad.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.360
And so I was a consultant, I became also their Mozilla fan.

02:02.360 --> 02:07.120
I even wanted to work for Mozilla, Oregon, inside the company when they launched it.

02:07.120 --> 02:12.640
They didn't take me, so I ended up working in a French startup.

02:12.640 --> 02:19.240
I wanted to stay in Europe and that startup raised money, went IPO.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.880
I actually even was a virtual millionaire and then there was the internet bubble, it

02:24.880 --> 02:25.880
crashed.

02:25.880 --> 02:31.160
I was not at all a millionaire anymore, just like any other IT guy.

02:31.160 --> 02:38.080
And in that company, we were both by US company and in that company I used Wikis and that's

02:38.080 --> 02:44.200
how I wanted, I found Wikis like amazing in terms of how it brings people and helps people

02:44.200 --> 02:46.080
share knowledge.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.000
And that's how in 2004 I created XWiki.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.560
I was a bit accustomed to open source with what Netscape was doing.

02:54.560 --> 03:01.160
Netscape had a highly transparent organization and a way to share things.

03:01.160 --> 03:10.360
It was really pushing internet protocols standards and then they made Mozilla open source.

03:10.360 --> 03:20.640
And then I was a user of open source in my company as a CTO, like installing using Apache

03:20.640 --> 03:23.360
software foundation code and so on.

03:23.360 --> 03:27.360
And so in Wikis, we're purely coming from the open source world.

03:27.360 --> 03:32.080
It was very natural when I wanted to create a company and create a software to create

03:32.080 --> 03:33.080
it as open source.

03:33.080 --> 03:37.000
But I was not as much aware of the political aspects of open source.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.240
I was really looking at open source from the technical point of view.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.680
So that's how I started XWiki.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.880
I'm going to continue from that in this presentation.

03:46.880 --> 03:52.800
But I'm also now a member, our company is a member of APEL, which is an organization

03:52.800 --> 03:56.560
of companies that do open source in Europe.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.800
In France, we have the CNL.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.720
We have the Herb Open Source, OW2.

04:01.720 --> 04:09.440
I'm also on the board of OpenFoodFacts, great association working on open data for food.

04:09.440 --> 04:14.480
And I'm a small shareholder of Morena that is doing an open source phone.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.280
So I'm welcome to look at this.

04:16.280 --> 04:19.120
I find this amazing work.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.600
So what is XWiki SIS?

04:21.600 --> 04:26.120
So XWiki SIS is a French and European independent company.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.400
So it means we've been self-funded.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.840
And I say independent.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.640
It means it's self-funded.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.240
And I still own majority ownership.

04:34.240 --> 04:39.960
And the very large majority of the share is owned by employees, some ex-employees.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.240
Yes, I should stop.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.360
Okay, great.

04:46.360 --> 04:49.640
It's on HDMI, you put HDMI.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.640
The slides are here.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.640
No, no, you're here.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.160
And you're not seeing them.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.160
That's too bad.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.160
I took this cable.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.160
Sorry.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.160
Okay.

05:02.160 --> 05:12.440
So it means we control the company, which is actually something that's not so easy to

05:12.440 --> 05:15.600
achieve in tech companies.

05:15.600 --> 05:22.320
We are at around 4 million revenue in 2023.

05:22.320 --> 05:26.600
We did 50% growth, which has been really very nice.

05:26.600 --> 05:34.520
And we have 60 people, mostly in France and Romania, but also some people in Germany,

05:34.520 --> 05:36.880
even two people in Brazil.

05:36.880 --> 05:42.520
We do two open source software, XWiki and Kripad.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.960
One is the one we started with that I created.

05:45.960 --> 05:50.120
And then Kripad that was created inside the company in 2016.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.400
We have an international community.

05:53.400 --> 05:58.120
And so we also are very engaged for digital sovereignty.

05:58.120 --> 06:07.560
We think open source is very important for gaining control of software, both for states

06:07.560 --> 06:09.560
but also individuals.

06:09.560 --> 06:16.320
And we have a business model of allowing to have revenue for that software so that we

06:16.320 --> 06:17.600
can build it.

06:17.600 --> 06:23.120
And this is done through services support training, like anything software company

06:23.120 --> 06:29.240
do, but trying to do it in a way that it allows us to fund the open source software.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.280
So we have employees in all these countries.

06:32.280 --> 06:36.960
And so what we're trying to do is enabling freedom, both with the code but also with

06:36.960 --> 06:38.280
the products that we do.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.440
I'll come back to that.

06:40.440 --> 06:42.560
So two software, XWiki.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.440
It's about knowledge management.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.760
It's sharing information.

06:47.760 --> 06:52.600
What's really interesting with the knowledge, Wikis, is that it really allows people to

06:52.600 --> 06:55.600
share and make knowledge available.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.440
So we all know Wikipedia.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.400
But we do it for organization.

07:01.400 --> 07:07.120
Inside that area, we have competitors such as conference or notion or even the Wikis

07:07.120 --> 07:09.680
of Microsoft Teams.

07:09.680 --> 07:15.480
And this is part of, I mean the competition in the end for any open source software has

07:15.480 --> 07:18.840
a high impact on how you can actually fund your work.

07:18.840 --> 07:25.120
Depending on how you compare to the competition, you can find more or it can be more or less

07:25.120 --> 07:27.920
difficult to find money.

07:27.920 --> 07:33.560
We have more than 7,000 installs and more than 400 clients.

07:33.560 --> 07:37.880
And XWiki is now part of the Open Desk project.

07:37.880 --> 07:42.520
Also if you don't know Open Desk, I think about looking at it.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.520
Google it.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.760
We also did CripPad since 2016.

07:46.760 --> 07:51.000
And CripPad is an end-to-end encrypted document editing platform.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Who knows CripPad?

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Here?

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
Okay, good.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.640
And so I'd say competitors to Google Docs.

07:57.640 --> 08:02.800
And the real part is that it protects people's privacy.

08:02.800 --> 08:07.680
So I'll go on, how did we start?

08:07.680 --> 08:12.280
And so the big question is why be an entrepreneur in the end?

08:12.280 --> 08:21.200
Because I'm trying to, so in this talk I will try to focus more about the open source aspect

08:21.200 --> 08:22.560
of what we did.

08:22.560 --> 08:29.160
But when you talk about your company, it's all also about the entrepreneurship and the

08:29.160 --> 08:32.240
difficulties to just run a company.

08:32.240 --> 08:39.040
But so I had this wish to kind of create things and make them happen.

08:39.040 --> 08:43.760
And so that was a bit at the core of being an entrepreneur.

08:43.760 --> 08:50.400
But one really important thing was to try to do something that's useful for people and

08:50.400 --> 08:51.400
have some impact.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.600
I wanted to do it also in Europe.

08:54.600 --> 09:01.600
I've been to the Silicon Valley and I didn't feel I liked the moons.

09:01.600 --> 09:06.800
So the technology was great, but I didn't feel as good about the fact that people were

09:06.800 --> 09:12.040
just talking about money and how they would become rich all the time.

09:12.040 --> 09:17.640
And that really made me think, okay, I don't want to spend my life in an area where that's

09:17.640 --> 09:18.640
the goal.

09:18.640 --> 09:25.520
Like I want to be more in a place where we're talking about culture or whatever.

09:25.520 --> 09:34.280
And another aspect was as an employee in companies, you sometimes feel your managers are not doing

09:34.280 --> 09:41.080
what you want them to do or they are not fair or the company makes decisions that you don't

09:41.080 --> 09:42.080
understand.

09:42.080 --> 09:50.920
And in the end, you can complain and stay as is and keep complaining about what people

09:50.920 --> 09:52.080
tell you around.

09:52.080 --> 09:59.560
But my idea was that my feeling was, well, instead of complaining, just try to do better.

09:59.560 --> 10:06.720
And that's also a reason to become a manager or own company and be the one that has to

10:06.720 --> 10:12.080
take responsibility for what's happening in the group.

10:12.080 --> 10:19.200
A big aspect is about believing in the product and in the purpose of the product.

10:19.800 --> 10:27.320
One of the really important things that motivated us at X-Wiki for 20 years is the fact that

10:27.320 --> 10:34.480
we feel our products are missing or they're not enough existent in the world and they're

10:34.480 --> 10:35.480
useful.

10:35.480 --> 10:39.720
They serve an important purpose.

10:39.720 --> 10:45.320
When I started X-Wiki, I was a big user of Wikis, I was a big user of task management

10:45.320 --> 10:46.320
tools.

10:46.320 --> 10:52.760
And I said, okay, we could do task management tools, we could do Wikis.

10:52.760 --> 10:59.320
And I directed myself towards Wikis because of the fact that they help sharing knowledge.

10:59.320 --> 11:05.160
Task management tools are a lot about efficiency being more efficient in companies and I felt

11:05.160 --> 11:06.720
knowledge is missing more.

11:06.720 --> 11:11.800
Like we're missing more the fact that we spread knowledge and that we educate people more.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.840
And in the end, this has stayed with us for 20 years.

11:16.840 --> 11:22.080
So we have a lot of Wikis inside companies that help people get more knowledgeable about

11:22.080 --> 11:25.400
what they do and about the work in their own company.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.760
But we also have a few public Wikis.

11:27.760 --> 11:36.440
We have the dictionary of the history of Switzerland, which is a public funded Swiss project about

11:36.440 --> 11:38.120
the knowledge about Switzerland.

11:38.120 --> 11:41.960
We also have a Wikis about rare disease.

11:41.960 --> 11:47.400
And you don't want to look at the website too much because it's sometimes really hard

11:47.400 --> 11:54.440
to look at it, what the parents of the kids that have this disease live.

11:54.440 --> 12:00.880
But it's highly useful for this community of parents that are living with the disease

12:00.880 --> 12:02.200
of their kids.

12:02.200 --> 12:06.520
We also have a Wikis for public service in France and so on.

12:06.520 --> 12:12.240
And so from my point of view, if you want to stay motivated about software for 20 years,

12:12.240 --> 12:16.400
you also need to really believe about the fact that your software is useful.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.560
And in the end, in 2016, we created CripPad.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.960
We created the technology, but we decided to make it a product because we really thought

12:24.960 --> 12:30.600
it was doing something that was missing, is protecting people's privacy and that too many

12:30.600 --> 12:36.800
software are exposing the data, are not built to protect the data, and CripPad is a product

12:36.800 --> 12:41.040
that is built to protect the data.

12:41.040 --> 12:45.520
So now the problem is that if you want to do a good software, you're interested in doing

12:45.520 --> 12:48.360
it as open source, then how do you fund it?

12:48.360 --> 12:49.360
There's different ways.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.440
So you can just raise money.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.240
So that works.

12:53.240 --> 12:58.240
You can build, there is a lot of open source software that is built by companies that have

12:58.280 --> 12:59.640
raised money.

12:59.640 --> 13:05.680
Even now, the modern way of raising money is doing some crypto thing and launching a token

13:05.680 --> 13:07.640
and getting millions of dollars.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.680
So it can work.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.840
I'll come back why.

13:11.840 --> 13:17.600
I didn't feel it was a good approach for us.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.840
You can be an open source volunteer and that's great.

13:20.840 --> 13:27.600
But what I tried to do in this graph is measure the sustainability of that action and how

13:27.600 --> 13:34.600
much impact it can have and on the other side, how fast you can develop things, but

13:34.840 --> 13:37.560
also the comfort of doing it.

13:37.560 --> 13:41.240
Because in the end, if you want to do that for a lot of years, are you doing this under

13:41.240 --> 13:42.240
stress?

13:42.240 --> 13:48.320
Are you doing this having a good day and being able to have a good life aside?

13:48.320 --> 13:53.880
And so open source volunteers won donations being an independent professional, like a

13:53.880 --> 13:58.320
freelancer and getting paid for doing service around open source.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.120
That's really good ways.

14:00.120 --> 14:03.160
And bootstrapping a company, this is what we did.

14:03.160 --> 14:08.000
And I feel, and this is what I want to show also in this presentation, is that it's a

14:08.000 --> 14:10.160
good way.

14:10.160 --> 14:12.800
You have a decent level of comfort.

14:12.800 --> 14:18.480
You can have speed because if you hire people, you do more.

14:18.480 --> 14:24.280
There is the sentence that you can go fast alone, but if you want to go far, you need

14:24.280 --> 14:27.680
to go as a group.

14:27.680 --> 14:34.200
And that's what the company allows, being a group that is funded, that has some money

14:34.200 --> 14:37.920
and can go further together.

14:37.920 --> 14:43.440
And you can see in this presentation also the acceleration that we had over the time

14:43.440 --> 14:46.760
between the beginning and now.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.760
So investors, why?

14:47.760 --> 14:51.880
I want to take a little bit more time on the investing.

14:51.880 --> 14:55.680
So it took us a little time to realize it was not what we wanted.

14:55.680 --> 15:01.920
I came from a company that had raised VC money, and I saw the fact that you can create a momentum.

15:01.920 --> 15:10.480
You can have a money hire very highly skilled people, and you can build things fast.

15:10.480 --> 15:16.480
But in the end, the real thing that you need to think about is the day you take VC money

15:16.480 --> 15:21.800
is who is the real boss and who holds the key of the decision in the future.

15:21.800 --> 15:29.320
And whenever I had discussions with some investors, beyond the fact that they tend to like the

15:29.320 --> 15:34.840
salespeople or the business people more than the tech people, and so that might be a reason

15:34.840 --> 15:37.320
for them to not giving us money.

15:37.320 --> 15:43.120
But for us, the problem was, okay, are we agreeing on where we want to go?

15:43.120 --> 15:49.120
And in the end, investors are in for a return on investment, so making more money with the

15:49.120 --> 15:50.720
money that they put.

15:50.720 --> 15:53.760
And as an entrepreneur, that's not what I was in for.

15:53.760 --> 15:59.200
I was in for the human relationship with the employees, running a project over the long

15:59.200 --> 16:02.080
term, and creating open source.

16:02.080 --> 16:07.120
And when you discuss about open source, and in France at the time, it was also quite simple.

16:07.120 --> 16:09.760
They didn't understand open source, so you had to explain it.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.040
Today, it might be better like, oh, open source, great.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.800
Let's do open source AI in France.

16:14.800 --> 16:18.400
They love it right now, and they tell you, oh, it's great.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.360
But what is their goal with it?

16:20.360 --> 16:24.960
Do they want to sustain that open source AI, for example, or do they just want to make

16:24.960 --> 16:31.360
a play to take a piece in the market and then cash in at some point and close the work?

16:31.360 --> 16:34.560
And so this can create good open source.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.120
And that's fine.

16:36.120 --> 16:42.920
But if you have a goal of being, for example, good to your community, not lie to them.

16:42.960 --> 16:47.960
Not tell them that you're doing open source and not have a hidden agenda about how you're

16:47.960 --> 16:50.320
going to make some money.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.680
That's going to be difficult.

16:51.680 --> 16:59.080
And I felt as a CEO, if I raise money, I would start lying to my customers about what our

16:59.080 --> 17:01.840
real goal is with this open source project.

17:01.840 --> 17:05.600
And being independent allowed us to not be that.

17:05.600 --> 17:06.720
It's much slower.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.360
It was much slower.

17:08.360 --> 17:12.440
But in the end, it's more important to do it like that.

17:12.480 --> 17:15.200
In the end, money is a mean not a goal.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.800
That's really a thing to think about.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.640
And so what was bootstrapping about?

17:20.640 --> 17:27.840
And so from 2003 to 2010, it took seven years to get to one million of revenue.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.440
It took a lot of time.

17:29.440 --> 17:32.760
It took three years almost of myself not getting paid.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.720
I found some other ways.

17:34.720 --> 17:42.240
And then any time we would do a little bit of money through service, we would use the

17:42.240 --> 17:43.240
product.

17:43.240 --> 17:47.600
We would use it for hiring more people and growing the product and making it better.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.400
One of the great things with open source is that you can build on other people's software.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.080
And that's magical.

17:54.080 --> 17:57.000
And so you can really reuse a lot.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.760
And that's actually what the proprietary software companies are doing.

18:00.760 --> 18:06.200
Now you have 90% of proprietary software is actually open source software.

18:06.200 --> 18:12.080
And they keep control of the latest piece, trying to cash in or build some business model

18:12.080 --> 18:15.160
about our data.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.560
But 90% of it is open source.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.560
And that helps us also.

18:19.560 --> 18:24.640
That helps also the open source companies we can build on that.

18:24.640 --> 18:27.520
The support of the community is huge.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.880
The service is a good way to start.

18:29.880 --> 18:33.160
It has problem over the long term to do only service.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.520
But it's a good way because you sell time, you make money.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.400
So you don't take risk with service.

18:39.400 --> 18:43.840
It can be something that doesn't have the level of risk.

18:43.840 --> 18:49.200
Another aspect that allowed us to go from zero to one million is European research money

18:49.200 --> 18:51.160
and French credit and brochures.

18:51.160 --> 18:54.320
In France you have a lot of help about research.

18:54.320 --> 18:59.280
So you can, if you do something innovative, you can bring it to the state and get some

18:59.280 --> 19:00.600
taxes back.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.760
So you will have less cost as a company.

19:03.760 --> 19:06.400
This is, for example, more difficult if you are in association.

19:06.400 --> 19:11.840
You can get subsidies, but you won't get social charges back because you're doing research.

19:11.840 --> 19:13.960
It's going to be more difficult.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.040
And then you have European research projects.

19:16.040 --> 19:17.840
You can group with other companies.

19:17.840 --> 19:25.440
And we had the chance in 2007 to join some other companies in projects and get some funding

19:25.440 --> 19:26.440
through that.

19:26.440 --> 19:34.000
In the end, over the 20 years of X-Wiki, I calculated that we received 10 million euros

19:34.000 --> 19:39.760
of European research grants of projects in France and so on.

19:39.760 --> 19:43.280
And that in the end was our VC.

19:43.280 --> 19:46.200
I mean, getting 10 million from a VC is quite difficult.

19:46.200 --> 19:52.280
It took 20 years to get that, but it allowed us to fund the software.

19:52.280 --> 19:58.960
Another thing that happened in that time is that we went to Romania in 2006.

19:58.960 --> 20:02.920
It was initially through the Google Summer of Code.

20:02.920 --> 20:07.200
And we had a student that was in Romania and we gave some projects.

20:07.200 --> 20:10.320
He candidated and he was really great.

20:10.320 --> 20:14.080
At the time, I didn't have money to pay people a lot.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.760
It was difficult to hire a full-time employer in France.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.560
There was competition about the cost.

20:18.560 --> 20:25.760
Romania was really an emerging country in the tech industry with great scientific skills.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.120
And we hired some of the first people.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.320
They all stayed.

20:30.320 --> 20:33.800
The first three that we hired are still working with X-Wiki today.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.840
And we have 25 people now in Romania.

20:36.840 --> 20:43.880
It was initially a cost-driven decision with the opportunity to have people with skills.

20:43.880 --> 20:49.400
And over the time, it's a fully integrated team that is also believing in open source.

20:49.400 --> 20:54.440
And so we hope that we also had this little effect to bring some open source to Romania

20:54.520 --> 21:00.360
because we're one of the rare companies that is doing open source in the city we are

21:00.360 --> 21:03.320
among Amazon, Microsoft and so on.

21:03.320 --> 21:08.200
And we also have, thanks to Romania, a lot of women in the team.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.960
And it may also happen that there were some couples created at X-Wiki.

21:12.960 --> 21:19.000
So as an entrepreneur, it makes you think about the impact you have.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.280
So that's just a graph of finance.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.960
I'm revealing our finances.

21:22.960 --> 21:27.920
So I'm not going to detail them, but it can show you the split.

21:27.920 --> 21:33.720
The most important data here is that when we started, 0% recurring revenue.

21:33.720 --> 21:40.560
And after six years, 20% of recurring revenue supports.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.640
And in the end, that's the goal.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.560
The goal is increase the support revenue.

21:44.560 --> 21:45.280
It takes time.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.480
You need a great product.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.880
You need to reach a maturity in the product.

21:49.880 --> 21:51.360
But it grows over time.

21:51.360 --> 21:57.760
So it's all about the strategy to make that recurrent revenue grow with the users and

21:57.760 --> 22:04.440
customers of the software, whatever the goals are, whatever the type of recurrent revenue.

22:04.440 --> 22:06.200
So it took a lot of time.

22:06.200 --> 22:10.480
It grew to 20%.

22:10.480 --> 22:16.000
So one thing that I really want people to think about is there is no success in open

22:16.000 --> 22:17.400
source without a good product.

22:17.400 --> 22:22.000
There's a lot of people that think that it's open source business model doesn't work, but

22:22.000 --> 22:24.520
in reality, it's just the product's not competitive.

22:24.520 --> 22:28.160
There is a huge amount of products, including in the open source world.

22:28.160 --> 22:30.480
If you don't do a good product, there's not going to work.

22:31.680 --> 22:38.400
And so you also need to think about the strategy to direct revenue towards the product.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.440
So when you do service, that's part of the problem.

22:41.440 --> 22:46.400
You might diverge from the product roadmap to make a great product.

22:46.400 --> 22:50.720
Because you're going to follow what some customers say instead of following what all

22:50.720 --> 22:52.480
customers need.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.560
So you need to think about that.

22:54.560 --> 22:59.600
And one of the things we learned over the 20 years is that it can be a good idea to condition

22:59.600 --> 23:04.760
the service on taking the support, which allows to give extra funding to the product

23:04.760 --> 23:06.840
and dedicate people to work on the product.

23:08.240 --> 23:13.520
And but there is also some companies, for example, NextCloud, one of the things they do is that

23:13.520 --> 23:15.440
they don't give you service.

23:15.440 --> 23:16.600
They don't sell you service.

23:16.600 --> 23:21.400
They make you pay the product, the support a bit more, and they give you the service.

23:21.400 --> 23:26.600
That's also a strategy that is interesting, that is going to raise the product revenue

23:26.600 --> 23:29.160
and really make the company focus on the product.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.840
And then the service will be used to make the product better.

23:33.440 --> 23:38.080
So we need to think about focusing the revenue towards the roadmap.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.640
That's the case, for example, of the research projects.

23:41.640 --> 23:44.680
Another aspect is the community is super important.

23:45.680 --> 23:46.840
It's your marketing.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.440
It's also your insurance.

23:48.440 --> 23:52.800
Customers will find it reassuring that you have open source.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.480
And it's also your recruitment tool.

23:54.480 --> 23:55.520
You'll find developers.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.560
We have hired so many people that came toward the community.

24:00.160 --> 24:04.920
And it's also very important, the community, to be a good open source citizen.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.240
That's also how you look.

24:06.240 --> 24:09.800
You see if companies are really true about open source.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.080
Are they really working with the community?

24:12.080 --> 24:13.400
Is the community open?

24:13.400 --> 24:18.880
If a software doesn't take patches, doesn't take pull requests,

24:18.880 --> 24:22.320
is not discussing with people about how the software should be,

24:22.320 --> 24:26.360
you could question their motivation to really do open source.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.200
So at X-Wiki, for example, even though we don't have that many contributors

24:32.200 --> 24:37.120
because we're moving fast on our end, and it's not fully natural that people come

24:37.120 --> 24:39.280
and give you code, it doesn't happen like that.

24:39.280 --> 24:41.880
It's a challenge to make people give you code.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.040
It doesn't happen on all software.

24:45.040 --> 24:50.320
So the fact that the community is not huge around a product, from my point of view,

24:50.320 --> 24:53.640
doesn't necessarily say that it's not a good open source community

24:54.960 --> 24:58.560
because it also depends on whether the people want to come.

24:58.560 --> 25:01.560
At X-Wiki, we have a fully open development model,

25:02.480 --> 25:05.800
but we don't get automatically people running.

25:05.800 --> 25:10.200
We're using Apache Software Foundation kind of rules for running the community.

25:10.200 --> 25:14.200
You can find our code, you can comment, discuss in the chat, and so on.

25:17.400 --> 25:21.680
So some companies bring their products to a foundation, that's also an approach.

25:23.000 --> 25:28.440
One thing is the relationship that we customer in open source at the beginning.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.000
I realized that you talk about open source,

25:31.000 --> 25:35.520
oh look, it's great, open source, you're going to be more free, no lock-in, etc.

25:35.560 --> 25:39.320
And you talk to some large companies, the thing is they don't give a shit.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.880
They don't care about this.

25:42.880 --> 25:47.960
They just want the best product at the lowest price possible, efficiency.

25:47.960 --> 25:53.520
So some people do care in the end, but you have to kind of find them in companies

25:53.520 --> 25:56.240
and find the people that can be sponsors of open source.

25:56.240 --> 25:59.200
Today you have OSPOS in very large companies,

25:59.200 --> 26:02.360
even in the European community, in public service.

26:02.360 --> 26:07.000
These are the sponsors, but the majority of buyers of software

26:07.000 --> 26:10.040
are looking for the best software at the lowest price.

26:10.040 --> 26:16.200
And that's why you need to be competitive to show them that you have also the best software.

26:18.360 --> 26:22.160
And there is a difficulty with the marketing of the proprietary products.

26:22.160 --> 26:25.200
There is so much marketing of the proprietary products

26:25.200 --> 26:28.640
that it will cloud the vision of the customers.

26:28.640 --> 26:30.040
They will get stuff for free.

26:30.040 --> 26:33.400
They don't look at the long-term price evolution of software.

26:33.400 --> 26:37.000
We lived it with our competition with conference.

26:37.000 --> 26:43.840
Conference recently changed the prices, but for years customers were buying.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.160
We knew it would happen.

26:45.160 --> 26:49.560
We knew that at some point they would cash in as much as they could.

26:49.560 --> 26:54.200
I mean, they would cash in on the proprietary nature of the software

26:54.200 --> 26:56.520
and the fact that they control people's data.

26:57.400 --> 27:01.720
And a good thing with open source is that open source validates your product.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.280
So you can go and show to customers,

27:04.280 --> 27:08.160
look, we have these users, it shows that the software is good.

27:08.160 --> 27:10.040
And that works very well.

27:10.040 --> 27:13.480
And we also have progress in Europe today

27:13.480 --> 27:16.960
because there is an issue of digital sovereignty,

27:16.960 --> 27:22.280
not something that was not foreseeable with the dominance of American companies,

27:22.360 --> 27:28.640
but it's something that politicians or European organizations or state organizations

27:28.640 --> 27:30.920
took time to take some action on.

27:30.920 --> 27:33.520
Now there is a bit of action in this area.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.840
One thing that I learned also through creating X-Wiki

27:37.840 --> 27:43.120
is looking at Floss and free and liberal open source software as a goal.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.920
Initially, let's create good software, let's create a good company,

27:46.920 --> 27:49.960
let's have a good balance with employee.

27:49.960 --> 27:56.120
But in what I discovered is the goal of open source of free software

27:56.120 --> 27:59.960
is giving us freedom, giving us control about software.

27:59.960 --> 28:06.360
It's all the values that are described by the FSFE that are really interesting.

28:06.360 --> 28:11.800
And that they discovered that and that motivates us even more in building what we do.

28:14.200 --> 28:17.200
In the end, we had to find a balance between all these things.

28:17.200 --> 28:21.800
And these are the values that we promoted internally in the company.

28:21.800 --> 28:23.880
This is what makes our company.

28:23.880 --> 28:28.600
We need to take care of our community, we need to take care of our customers,

28:28.600 --> 28:30.400
we need to do a great product.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.360
And the great product is about the domain in which we are,

28:33.360 --> 28:38.200
the knowledge and privacy, the goal that we have for software.

28:38.200 --> 28:45.480
And we want people to be happy inside the company and we want to do open source.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.000
So these are the values that we promote internally.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.600
And what the challenge for CEO and for the group is to find that balance

28:54.600 --> 28:57.720
between these five items.

28:57.720 --> 29:03.680
And for example, we can see that these are the highest ranked reason why

29:03.680 --> 29:08.040
the people at XWiki decided to join XWiki.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.440
This is recent data, this is not data from the past.

29:11.440 --> 29:18.120
And we can see that being open source is a key reason why people want to be there.

29:18.120 --> 29:22.480
But they also want to be there because they like the product that you're building on and

29:22.480 --> 29:24.160
that we're building.

29:24.160 --> 29:29.120
So one of the key things was building on support revenue.

29:29.120 --> 29:34.000
I mentioned the recurring revenue and this was really important to really

29:34.000 --> 29:37.920
make the support revenue accelerate to be able to gain sustainability.

29:37.920 --> 29:42.960
And that's really the challenge for a company that wants to build open source over the long term.

29:42.960 --> 29:49.520
And so from 2010 to 2015, we moved from 1 million to 2 million revenue.

29:49.520 --> 29:56.280
But most importantly, we grew from 250K to 800K of recurring revenue.

29:56.280 --> 30:01.960
In the end, that's what I look more at, like how much recurring revenue we're making.

30:01.960 --> 30:05.400
Because that is what's funding the company.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.240
We failed at building partnership.

30:07.240 --> 30:11.240
We hope the product could be used to build some other products.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.440
But we found it very difficult to find the deals.

30:13.440 --> 30:19.360
And in the end, we found that we were better at creating a direct relationship with customers.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.680
Also explaining them the open source model and what we were trying to do.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.320
And also explaining them the value of our product.

30:25.320 --> 30:31.360
Relationship with direct customers is key in order to build the value of your software.

30:32.360 --> 30:37.000
We also tried to build the first version of SaaS, we call it XWiki Cloud.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.880
In the end, we focused on the main product and the main product's value.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.800
It also allows some simplification.

30:43.840 --> 30:46.240
And so that's the graph, you can look at it.

30:46.240 --> 30:53.080
Recurrent revenue grew to 35% in the time and that's really great to have that.

30:53.080 --> 30:58.640
It's not only about the percentage of recurrent revenue, it's about the amount that sustains the team.

30:58.640 --> 31:03.600
Because even if you stay with a percentage that's 50,

31:03.640 --> 31:07.040
the extra money that you're getting from the service from the research product,

31:07.040 --> 31:11.760
it becomes bonus when the recurrent revenue is enough.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.960
So if you reach a certain amount of recurrent revenue, the rest becomes a bonus.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.120
At the beginning, that doesn't work like that.

31:18.120 --> 31:23.960
You have close to zero recurrent revenue, so you don't even manage to find the team

31:23.960 --> 31:26.160
to continuously develop the product.

31:27.080 --> 31:31.080
And one thing to keep in mind is that close source competition is tough.

31:31.080 --> 31:34.600
Even if you're doing something innovative, you'll launch something new,

31:34.600 --> 31:40.920
such as Enterprise Wiki when we started or an end-to-end encrypted tool.

31:40.920 --> 31:44.960
At some point, if there is a big market, you're going to have close source competitors

31:44.960 --> 31:47.240
that are raising money that are going to come.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.880
And they might grow faster than you for a while.

31:50.880 --> 31:54.720
They will educate the market, which is interesting for you, but

31:54.720 --> 31:58.320
they will also try to take the market and then lay the cash in.

31:58.320 --> 32:03.600
But you can stick and stay true to your goals and wait.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.520
I always tend to say when you're number three and

32:06.520 --> 32:09.280
number one buys number two, you become number two.

32:09.280 --> 32:12.680
And when you're number two, you're the alternative to the number one.

32:12.680 --> 32:16.600
And all companies want a need alternative for competition.

32:16.600 --> 32:22.080
So I hope, I wish that open source would not be the alternative, but

32:22.080 --> 32:27.080
would be the leader that's not always happening and not always easy.

32:27.080 --> 32:31.360
But being the alternative is also something that helps you grow.

32:32.560 --> 32:36.920
And so after that, we had a challenging period.

32:36.920 --> 32:41.520
And so we were growing progressively, but what happened at some point, we flattened.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.480
And that was because of the competition.

32:43.480 --> 32:46.600
At the beginning, we were working mostly on innovation.

32:46.600 --> 32:51.440
We had customers interested in buying what we were doing through innovation.

32:51.440 --> 32:54.200
But at some point, we flattened.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.120
And we didn't have that innovation thing.

32:57.120 --> 33:02.560
We had stronger competition, SaaS coming in and speeding up.

33:02.560 --> 33:05.240
Deployment people would just buy SaaS.

33:05.240 --> 33:07.880
Companies would be less interested in the open source aspect.

33:09.080 --> 33:13.120
So we basically were flat with 35%.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.160
So what difficulties that we had?

33:16.160 --> 33:18.840
Competiteness, SaaS, competition.

33:19.960 --> 33:24.160
Our custom work was less demanded because there were more products that

33:24.360 --> 33:27.000
were doing things in a standard way.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.920
The fact, we had to educate the market about the fact that open source is not

33:30.920 --> 33:32.240
completely free.

33:32.240 --> 33:37.600
So that's also, you tend to put the priority on this when you're not making enough money.

33:37.600 --> 33:39.880
You tend to think it's just a business model.

33:39.880 --> 33:44.720
It's also the business model, but the main thing that we changed in that period,

33:46.160 --> 33:50.960
one of the things that we stopped trying to think like open source startups,

33:51.000 --> 33:56.760
we came back to think like what we had, what was the value that we had,

33:56.760 --> 33:58.720
and it was about our product.

33:58.720 --> 34:03.880
And what we did in the end, we created Task Force to transform the company,

34:03.880 --> 34:06.400
focus again on the product, making the product better.

34:07.360 --> 34:11.800
And trying to convince again people that the product was good.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.320
And it worked.

34:13.320 --> 34:17.840
And we looked at what was missing, what was not so good in the UI,

34:17.840 --> 34:19.920
and really did effort in it.

34:19.920 --> 34:22.960
And the thing is, when you're doing two million revenue,

34:22.960 --> 34:27.640
you do have money to try to fix problems, and that's nice.

34:27.640 --> 34:33.040
And so we relaunched a competitive offering, and we also changed a few

34:33.040 --> 34:37.040
things in the way we were selling to customers to try to improve their

34:37.040 --> 34:41.080
understanding of open source so that they would give us more recurrent revenue

34:41.080 --> 34:43.160
in order to fund more of the product.

34:44.160 --> 34:48.400
And so one of the things we did is rewarding customers, paying the product.

34:48.400 --> 34:52.160
So for example, we decided to build open source paying applications.

34:52.160 --> 34:53.640
So this is quite unique.

34:53.640 --> 34:58.640
So I don't believe in the open core model where you're doing open source and

34:58.640 --> 35:03.000
proprietary on top of it, because it tends to push you towards doing more

35:03.000 --> 35:04.280
proprietary.

35:04.280 --> 35:08.800
At Xwiki, what we decided to do, we did paying extensions that's similar to

35:08.800 --> 35:11.800
open core in the sense that you have to pay for them.

35:11.800 --> 35:15.680
But the code is open source, we just don't make the build available.

35:15.680 --> 35:20.000
So we have the Xwiki core, completely free, and of course,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.440
completely open source.

35:21.440 --> 35:25.120
And we have extensions, you get them as extension, they say pay for it,

35:25.120 --> 35:26.040
pay for it.

35:26.040 --> 35:30.960
In reality, the code is fully 100% available in GitHub.

35:30.960 --> 35:34.560
If people would want to use them for free, they rebuild them.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.600
The thing is, people don't make the effort.

35:37.600 --> 35:40.080
It's a lot of effort for companies to do that.

35:40.080 --> 35:44.360
And by making a little bit of friction for companies to adopt these

35:44.360 --> 35:49.240
extensions, it motivates them to pay, to give them a reason to pay in companies.

35:49.240 --> 35:54.600
And the bad part of it is we like it to be free completely for individuals.

35:54.600 --> 35:59.080
But this means that you would need to find some other ways to make it happen.

35:59.080 --> 36:02.840
But the most important thing in this strategy is that the code itself is

36:02.840 --> 36:03.680
open source.

36:03.680 --> 36:08.320
That means over the long term, it's owned by everybody, not just by us.

36:08.360 --> 36:14.560
So we cannot be the owners of that code over the long term.

36:16.480 --> 36:21.000
So this is a part where open source is not free and it needs to be explained.

36:21.000 --> 36:24.720
We tend to think that everything needs to be free, but

36:24.720 --> 36:27.880
you cannot pay people if everything is free.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.640
So if you want to build it, you have this difficulty.

36:32.560 --> 36:35.880
In 2016, we launched CripPad.

36:35.880 --> 36:40.680
And it was another experience there because we relaunched

36:40.680 --> 36:43.200
a second product inside the company.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.120
It had some useful aspects.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.880
It recreated innovation in the company.

36:48.880 --> 36:53.000
And it helped us gain other research projects because research projects are

36:53.000 --> 36:54.640
highly linked to innovation.

36:54.640 --> 36:57.600
So we had a second batch of innovation inside the company.

36:58.640 --> 37:01.200
And it also helped for the image of the company.

37:01.200 --> 37:04.320
It made us more known by individuals.

37:04.320 --> 37:07.120
And then, oh, you're doing Xwiki also.

37:07.120 --> 37:09.440
Some people, I mean, I don't know.

37:09.440 --> 37:11.840
In people that know Xwiki and CripPad,

37:11.840 --> 37:16.600
how many people didn't know it was the same company that was doing that?

37:16.600 --> 37:17.960
I don't know.

37:17.960 --> 37:18.920
Who knows Xwiki?

37:18.920 --> 37:19.680
Who knows CripPad?

37:23.520 --> 37:28.320
Anyway, so then 2020 happens, COVID, what happens?

37:28.320 --> 37:29.680
So that's a crisis.

37:29.680 --> 37:34.240
One thing to think about is always be ready as an entrepreneur for a crisis.

37:34.240 --> 37:36.600
It will happen if you stay long enough.

37:36.600 --> 37:40.920
We had subprimes in 2009, 2020 we had COVID.

37:40.920 --> 37:47.760
The thing is for us, we were more ready than a lot of companies because we were

37:47.760 --> 37:50.520
already remote friendly.

37:50.520 --> 37:55.840
We were allowed to do, everybody was allowed to do two days of remote in the company.

37:55.840 --> 37:59.880
We just moved it to do whatever you want, just work.

38:01.040 --> 38:03.040
And everybody worked from home.

38:03.040 --> 38:07.720
We had the tools, everything was already adapted to work with remote tools.

38:07.720 --> 38:12.840
That's one of the magic of open source tools and open source development model.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.520
We had the knowledge, we had the knowledge tools.

38:15.520 --> 38:22.040
And it also gave a boost to CripPad because CripPad actually was used by education.

38:22.040 --> 38:29.000
For example, in Germany, we had credible usage of CripPad over a couple weeks during COVID.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.880
So it also gave a boost.

38:30.880 --> 38:35.440
But as a company, of course, it creates a bit of scare what will happen, will customers

38:35.440 --> 38:40.640
go away, will there be a financial worldwide crisis for years.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.600
In the end, we went through there.

38:42.600 --> 38:48.560
One of the things that COVID showed is a challenge for European digital sovereignty.

38:48.560 --> 38:54.160
Politicians realized that supply chains were a problem and that there were risks there.

38:54.160 --> 38:59.520
And this has tainted towards digital sovereignty and software.

38:59.840 --> 39:04.560
And since a few years, we've seen that there is an interest in this area.

39:04.560 --> 39:09.800
But the most important thing that happened for us is Atlassian changing their business model

39:09.800 --> 39:13.200
and saying that people should move to their cloud.

39:13.200 --> 39:16.760
And they should stop using software in their own companies.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.280
And they closed the smaller offers.

39:19.280 --> 39:22.400
And they decided that in 2020 in November.

39:22.400 --> 39:28.240
So I don't know how they found that COVID was a good time to add some stress to their users.

39:28.240 --> 39:33.840
But they did and their customers didn't like it because we received a lot of mail like saying that,

39:33.840 --> 39:40.760
okay, what is their way to replace Atlassian conference with Xwiki.

39:40.760 --> 39:48.360
And so we spent time on improving our migrators.

39:48.360 --> 39:50.760
And we were not necessarily surprised.

39:50.760 --> 39:56.320
We were surprised the extent of the change that they made and what they did to their customers.

39:56.320 --> 40:01.240
But from our point of view, it was something that would happen at least progressively.

40:01.240 --> 40:06.000
When investor backed companies want to cash in, this is a time for the SMAs and

40:06.000 --> 40:13.000
open source companies to really propose an alternative that is more sustainable over the long term.

40:13.000 --> 40:18.800
Open source is more sustainable for other people than proprietary software is.

40:19.880 --> 40:22.360
So for us, it brings some maturity.

40:22.360 --> 40:26.800
This raised our revenue to 3 million 3 of sales in 2023.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.600
50% growth, I said that at the beginning of the presentation.

40:30.600 --> 40:38.280
And in the end, 1 million 6 of recurring revenue with 30% growth on the recurring revenue.

40:38.280 --> 40:42.680
And that has been huge for the company and for allowing to build more software.

40:42.680 --> 40:46.280
So this is a graph you can see last three years, pretty nice.

40:46.280 --> 40:51.600
So when you look, when you are in 2020.

40:51.600 --> 40:55.080
When everything's flat, you feel a bit depressed.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.960
And that's not going well.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.920
But then three great years behind it.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.840
So it's never given.

41:00.840 --> 41:04.200
You can always turn things around.

41:04.200 --> 41:10.520
Not only because of Atlassian or thanks to Atlassian, but also because we

41:10.520 --> 41:16.280
went one project with Digital Sorbitancy in France and Germany and the software was recognized.

41:16.280 --> 41:19.040
And what about the future?

41:19.040 --> 41:22.520
So everybody talks about AI.

41:22.520 --> 41:25.400
For a knowledge company, it's a real question.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.880
So we need to think about it.

41:27.880 --> 41:33.440
One of the things that AI is doing right now is that it's questioning the aspect of open source again.

41:33.440 --> 41:38.880
We saw a lot of big companies, as I said, not caring about open source.

41:38.880 --> 41:41.000
Politicians not caring about open source.

41:42.080 --> 41:47.720
With AI, it's the first time the president of France said the word open source.

41:47.720 --> 41:53.520
Which we wanted him to do for years in the industry saying that it was important.

41:53.520 --> 41:55.560
And he said it for AI.

41:55.560 --> 41:56.720
Okay, what will it change?

41:56.720 --> 41:57.680
We'll see.

41:57.680 --> 42:03.800
But at least it raised the question of transparency again, of the control of code of data.

42:03.800 --> 42:07.600
And that's something that is positive for the future.

42:07.600 --> 42:11.280
But you also need to get prepared because it changes a lot of things.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.320
The architecture of running AI is complicated.

42:14.320 --> 42:17.840
It's much more harder to run it on premise.

42:17.840 --> 42:21.480
And so you need to find solutions for that.

42:21.480 --> 42:23.920
We're working on AI at Xwiki.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.400
We have an extension.

42:25.400 --> 42:32.240
And we also gained a research project to do some search engine using AI.

42:32.240 --> 42:38.800
And I would like to point out the approach of also NextCloud with ethical AI.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.160
We are completely aligned with that aspect.

42:41.160 --> 42:46.040
You cannot do AI today without thinking about whether it's ethical,

42:46.040 --> 42:48.120
whether it's protecting data or not.

42:50.120 --> 42:56.440
One big aspect that I think is really important for the future is software modularity and integrations.

42:56.440 --> 43:05.560
We believe at Xwiki that the future of open source software is allowing to assemble software together.

43:05.560 --> 43:07.320
And making better reuse.

43:07.320 --> 43:12.280
I said at the beginning of Xwiki that when we started, we reused a lot of open source software.

43:12.280 --> 43:17.680
Well, if we want our software to survive in the open source world,

43:17.680 --> 43:20.680
we also need to make sure that it can be reused more.

43:20.680 --> 43:22.720
And this is why we've launched a new product.

43:22.720 --> 43:24.920
We call it Xwiki Crystal.

43:24.920 --> 43:29.160
And it's going to be a new modular AI that will not only work with Xwiki,

43:29.160 --> 43:33.760
but can work with other Wikis and can be integrated in other tools.

43:33.760 --> 43:36.840
And the other thing is that we're part of the Open Desk project,

43:36.840 --> 43:42.440
which is a funded project in Germany to make an open source suite of collaborative products.

43:42.440 --> 43:45.240
And we're very happy to be part of it.

43:45.240 --> 43:49.800
And the other aspect is doing with CripPad what we did with Xwiki.

43:49.800 --> 43:54.960
I showed the financial of Xwiki, the company that included both Xwiki and CripPad.

43:54.960 --> 43:58.880
But what's really interesting is when you run a second product inside a company,

43:58.880 --> 44:01.800
how does the other product look?

44:01.840 --> 44:06.920
And what's really interesting is that it looks a lot like the Xwiki product at the beginning,

44:06.920 --> 44:09.480
20% only of recurring revenue.

44:09.480 --> 44:12.440
And it's difficult to build that recurring revenue.

44:12.440 --> 44:15.080
So if you love CripPad, we are very happy.

44:15.080 --> 44:21.040
We've been able to double the size of the team, as you can see in the funding in the last two years.

44:21.040 --> 44:26.240
So in 2023, we doubled the size of the team for 2024 too.

44:26.240 --> 44:30.120
But it's only 20% of recurring revenue.

44:30.120 --> 44:32.920
And that means we don't have the sustainability yet.

44:32.920 --> 44:40.240
And if you look, the blue and red part is our recurring revenue, subscriptions to CripPad.fr and donations.

44:40.240 --> 44:47.760
And you can actually help us build sustainable revenue by promoting CripPad and allow us to find more users and customers.

44:47.760 --> 44:50.960
But you can also help it with donations.

44:50.960 --> 44:56.280
Any software needs to reach that sustainability through the recurring revenue.

44:56.280 --> 44:59.080
That's really the challenge for it.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.200
Finally, giving back.

45:01.200 --> 45:05.000
So first we give our software because it's open source.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.240
We give our code as a company.

45:07.240 --> 45:11.760
But we also think that it's important that we give back to the other open source projects we do.

45:11.760 --> 45:14.200
We wish large companies would do that.

45:14.200 --> 45:25.480
Large companies that use open source for free a lot or proprietary software company today that are building on open source should give back something to all the project that they use.

45:25.480 --> 45:31.920
And we decided to create a fosfan of 1% of our recurring revenue to give it back to the projects that we use.

45:31.920 --> 45:38.880
We have three years backlog that we're going to give like almost 30K to the different projects that we use.

45:38.880 --> 45:41.800
We're going to give for example to the Matrix Foundation.

45:41.800 --> 45:46.480
We're going to give to MasterDont and to lots of other tools that we're using.

45:48.120 --> 45:54.800
And we're going to continue to participate to industry organization to help it make known.

45:55.560 --> 45:59.440
The conclusion is that nothing of this would happen without the team itself.

46:00.720 --> 46:05.920
And we have a team of 60 people,

46:05.920 --> 46:11.640
more than 200 people over 20 years that worked on Xwiki.

46:11.640 --> 46:17.320
And that's really the kudos to them because you cannot do that without all the people that worked.

46:17.320 --> 46:21.960
And we, for example, at Xwiki we have more than seven people that worked 15 years.

46:21.960 --> 46:24.240
We have seven people that worked 15 years at Xwiki.

46:24.240 --> 46:27.320
15 that worked 10 years at Xwiki.

46:27.320 --> 46:34.000
And this is not necessarily that easy to achieve that for a group of 60.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.800
We have a difficulty of funding all the time.

46:36.800 --> 46:39.480
If you want to join, we have jobs.

46:39.480 --> 46:45.840
And also nothing would have been possible of what we did without the help of European projects,

46:45.840 --> 46:49.160
French projects, BPI, Europe, NLNet.

46:49.160 --> 46:53.720
If you don't know the NGI program, the funding you can get for

46:53.720 --> 46:55.920
the open source from NLNet, go look at it.

46:55.920 --> 46:58.320
It can help you fund your project.

46:58.320 --> 46:59.000
That's it.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.360
And if you have any questions, I'm welcome.

47:01.360 --> 47:04.520
I'm available or I can take any questions.

47:04.520 --> 47:13.720
Any questions?

47:13.720 --> 47:23.920
No, I guess people are just installing here.

47:23.920 --> 47:26.080
I have a question if nobody has a question.

47:26.080 --> 47:38.080
So I was wondering how was the ride between building a company and having a community,

47:38.080 --> 47:43.040
basically, was there any conflict of what to put in the product, what to not put in

47:43.040 --> 47:47.880
the product, let's hide this away so that people pay for it, let's give it for free.

47:47.880 --> 47:52.920
How was this dynamic in the building of Xwiki?

47:52.920 --> 47:57.600
Yeah, and that's the difficult part is what do you do as a pain module?

47:57.600 --> 47:59.160
What do you do as free?

47:59.160 --> 48:03.360
Well, one of the things, so first is really keep an open community.

48:03.360 --> 48:09.160
We are very important and really keep everything open source even if you have pain stuff so

48:09.160 --> 48:12.520
that people can look at the code and discuss.

48:12.520 --> 48:18.760
For the choices of what the features are, well, we try to direct them as much as possible

48:18.760 --> 48:23.960
to the ones that the bigger companies would need, would need most themselves, not necessarily

48:23.960 --> 48:26.240
the individual or the smaller companies.

48:26.240 --> 48:30.440
Because in the end, it's mostly the bigger companies that have the funding for you or

48:30.440 --> 48:32.320
for an enterprise software.

48:32.320 --> 48:35.440
And it sounds weird that the bigger companies are not paying for it.

48:35.440 --> 48:41.560
I think Matrix has a talk just after and I know that they will talk about the fact that

48:41.560 --> 48:47.160
you have huge deployments of Matrix and with zero money and some smaller deployment that

48:47.160 --> 48:49.040
are giving significant money.

48:49.040 --> 48:54.080
And the larger companies that are massively using open source need to participate to it.

48:54.080 --> 49:01.600
And so directing the specific features that they need, for example, audit logs for compliance

49:01.600 --> 49:05.720
reason is something of big companies.

49:05.720 --> 49:13.800
But for example, LDAP authentication or SSO, it's a bit tougher to not give it because

49:13.800 --> 49:17.400
it's a security feature that's really important to make software more secure.

49:17.400 --> 49:20.040
So for example, that has been a difficulty for us.

49:20.040 --> 49:26.160
So we made active directory paying application, but LDAP configuration is still available

49:26.160 --> 49:32.360
in XWiki as a documentation in the open source documentation.

49:32.360 --> 49:39.000
But if they want the simple configuration with Microsoft Active Directory, they pay

49:39.000 --> 49:42.560
the application and we sold a few of them.

49:42.560 --> 49:50.400
Hello, first of all, very nice talk.

49:50.400 --> 49:51.560
Thank you.

49:51.560 --> 49:55.080
What would you have done differently on the Twiki journey?

49:55.080 --> 49:58.400
What would you have done differently on the Twiki journey?

49:58.400 --> 50:02.800
Oh, that's a good question.

50:02.800 --> 50:09.640
Well, the little strategies to make people understand open source better, for example,

50:09.640 --> 50:18.400
making people pay more for service if they didn't take support, what I've done earlier,

50:18.400 --> 50:22.240
the paying application maybe earlier, not so sure because initially you need to build

50:22.240 --> 50:27.160
community for sure first and you need to build competitiveness.

50:27.280 --> 50:29.320
So it's kind of difficult.

50:29.320 --> 50:37.360
So that part, not do the four products on top of XWiki with partners, but at the same

50:37.360 --> 50:39.080
time they gave us some money.

50:39.080 --> 50:43.440
So maybe do less service sometimes, more product.

50:43.440 --> 50:48.640
So these are the things I would have done.

50:48.640 --> 50:50.120
But it's done differently.

50:50.120 --> 50:56.760
Like basically the playbook of how you can fund the product or try to do it earlier.

50:56.760 --> 51:02.320
And then when we learned it, I had other presentation about the different method we found in prior

51:02.320 --> 51:07.440
for them about how to fund an open source software.

51:07.440 --> 51:15.200
So I gave to Kerl, which also has a great experience about how to fund the work in Kerl.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.200
Any other questions?

51:17.200 --> 51:20.680
Nope, okay.

51:20.680 --> 51:21.680
Thank you, Ludovic.

51:21.680 --> 51:22.680
Thank you.

51:22.680 --> 51:23.680
Thank you.

51:23.680 --> 51:24.680
Thank you.

51:24.680 --> 51:25.680
Thank you.

51:25.680 --> 51:26.680
Thank you.

51:27.680 --> 51:28.680
Thank you.

51:28.680 --> 51:29.680
Thank you.

51:29.680 --> 51:30.680
Thank you.

51:30.680 --> 51:31.680
Thank you.

51:31.680 --> 51:32.680
Thank you.

51:32.680 --> 51:33.680
Thank you.

51:33.680 --> 51:34.680
Thank you.

51:34.680 --> 51:35.680
Thank you.

51:35.680 --> 51:36.680
Thank you.

51:36.680 --> 51:37.680
Thank you.

51:37.680 --> 51:38.680
Thank you.

51:38.680 --> 51:39.680
Thank you.

51:39.680 --> 51:40.680
Thank you.

51:40.680 --> 51:41.680
Thank you.

51:41.680 --> 51:42.680
Thank you.

51:42.680 --> 51:43.680
Thank you.

51:43.680 --> 51:44.680
Thank you.

51:44.680 --> 51:45.680
Thank you.

51:45.680 --> 51:46.680
Thank you.

51:46.680 --> 51:47.680
Thank you.

51:47.680 --> 51:48.680
Thank you.

51:48.680 --> 51:49.680
Thank you.

51:49.680 --> 51:50.680
Thank you.

51:50.680 --> 51:51.680
Thank you.

51:51.680 --> 51:52.680
Thank you.

51:52.680 --> 51:53.680
Thank you.

51:53.680 --> 51:54.680
Thank you.

51:54.680 --> 51:55.680
Thank you.

51:55.680 --> 51:56.680
Thank you.
