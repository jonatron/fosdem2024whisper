00:00.000 --> 00:09.160
So we're going to close the session for today and for the whole day of session.

00:09.160 --> 00:12.840
So I'll ask the DEVRA managers to help us to organize if they could come as well with

00:12.840 --> 00:22.200
us and then we'll let Simon close everything.

00:22.200 --> 00:27.080
So thank you everyone for staying right to the bitter end here.

00:27.080 --> 00:38.960
So the DEVRA managers that have been organizing the day for you today are Enzo over there.

00:38.960 --> 00:42.600
Enzo was allowed to do this by clips.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.360
There's Deb here.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.760
Deb broadly did this because he wanted to.

00:50.760 --> 00:55.840
There's Heath here from the European Union.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.680
He's had to take it took him about a week to get permission from his boss to do this.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.520
So I think I thank him very much for doing that.

01:04.520 --> 01:08.600
Yeah, yeah.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.960
So let me see.

01:09.960 --> 01:16.920
We've got Alex here who is from FSFE.

01:16.920 --> 01:18.760
We've not in the room at the moment.

01:18.760 --> 01:25.920
We have Axel from Open Forum Europe who is out wandering the estate.

01:25.920 --> 01:30.960
And Martin without whom we probably wouldn't have done it at all right from the beginning.

01:30.960 --> 01:44.120
So thank you very much, Martin.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.680
So what are we going to do with all this?

01:45.680 --> 01:56.880
Well, the reason we've had a rapporteur in each of the four workshops is because we were told that if we want to get any traction at the European Commission, we need to give them a report.

01:56.880 --> 02:08.240
And so we've taken notes of all four of the workshops and we're going to construct a report that gives the essential feedback from each of the elements.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.480
We're going to make it look nice.

02:10.480 --> 02:17.680
And we're going to work out how to subdivide it so that it can be used in each of the directorates where it will be a useful tool.

02:17.680 --> 02:23.920
And hopefully that will be a way that there will be lasting change and not just a great weekend at FOSDEM.

02:23.920 --> 02:36.040
I am also very grateful to Alistair Kergan from the FOSDEM organizing team who has been our guardian angel for making this happen and making the keynote session that we had yesterday happen.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.280
Without him, we probably wouldn't have got it.

02:38.280 --> 02:39.960
And also last year.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.680
And so we're very grateful to him as well.

02:46.680 --> 02:58.600
And I'm very grateful to so many people, the people who are here now and the people who have been here all day, who have been so positive and encouraging and engaged so well with the European Commission staff.

02:58.600 --> 03:04.600
And I want to especially thank the European Commission staff who have given up a weekend day.

03:04.600 --> 03:13.400
In some cases, in the case of Omar and Benjamin, two weekend days to come and meet 8,000 friends who they didn't realize they had before.

03:13.400 --> 03:19.000
I'd like to encourage those of you in the commission to treat us as your friends.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.640
We're not lobbyists.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.280
We're subject experts.

03:22.280 --> 03:29.520
So please refer to us whenever you're preparing legislation in the way that you would refer to a subject expert.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.960
Many of us are freely available to you whenever you write.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.200
We're on signal.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.760
So.

03:35.760 --> 03:37.000
And on matrix.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Maybe parliament.

03:39.000 --> 03:39.720
So.

03:39.720 --> 03:46.520
So behind the scenes, we've also had some support.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.840
You haven't seen anyone from council here today.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.440
We did try to reach out.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.080
We didn't actually find anyone who was free this weekend.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.440
And we're grateful to the people from the parliament who supported us.

03:57.560 --> 04:04.520
And it's really very good to have had all three parts of the Trident present here.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.120
I think it amazes me.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.800
I've been coming to FOSDEM since 2006.

04:08.800 --> 04:14.960
And it amazes me that it's taken until 2023 last year for this to show up at FOSDEM.

04:14.960 --> 04:22.680
But we are going to try and make sure that it remains an important instrument in creating end user agency and

04:22.680 --> 04:27.280
software freedom for people throughout Europe going forward and in perpetuity.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.600
And with that, thank you very much.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.320
And there is a closing session in Janssen.
