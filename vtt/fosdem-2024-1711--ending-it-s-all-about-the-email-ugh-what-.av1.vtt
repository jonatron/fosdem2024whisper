00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
What is the future of female?

00:08.840 --> 00:17.240
So if you agree, you can shout, like, yeah, or, you know, this is for agree, and if you

00:17.240 --> 00:20.760
agree, you can go, boo, and, you know, thumbs down.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.040
You can count, oh, all right.

00:24.040 --> 00:27.080
Okay, let's get started.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.080
Quick introduction.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.960
My name is Bogos.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.920
People call me Bogos by one, get one.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.720
It's easy to remember.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.920
Thank you.

00:34.920 --> 00:39.560
Yeah, I prefer that like a beer, you know, it will be closer to my mouth.

00:39.560 --> 00:43.120
Okay, I used to write PHP, Python, and GS.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.360
Now I suck.

00:45.360 --> 00:47.000
I work on a call-up project.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.040
I don't know who remembers the call-up.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.280
Yay, awesome.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.360
But I really suck at it.

00:53.360 --> 01:06.080
I'm working on a- I'm part of Thunderbird Project, but I'm not representing the projects

01:06.080 --> 01:07.280
right now.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.960
I was- I'm born in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic.

01:10.960 --> 01:13.800
I love heavy metal.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.480
So there was a call, yeah.

01:16.480 --> 01:21.000
There was a call by me this morning about teaching people how to be nicer with heavy metal, so

01:21.000 --> 01:25.680
if you didn't have a chance to watch it, you can watch the recording, which is currently

01:25.680 --> 01:26.680
really bad.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.840
Okay, started.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.600
So as I said, I haven't thought a long time ago.

01:32.600 --> 01:36.760
I see some old people here starting at the same time as me.

01:36.760 --> 01:41.720
In the past, it was something like, I want to implement something, but the technology

01:41.720 --> 01:44.080
or the framework does not allow me.

01:44.080 --> 01:48.840
I want to do this, I want to do that, but hey, the PHP library that I have, it's really

01:48.840 --> 01:49.840
crappy.

01:49.840 --> 01:57.200
I really don't want- I want to do that, but first we need to invest more time, or it's

01:57.200 --> 01:58.600
not worth it.

01:58.600 --> 02:07.240
Now, looking at the topics over the conversations today, listening at the outer rooms, now everything

02:07.240 --> 02:09.080
is possible.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.080
Everything.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.720
If you want to do something, there is an API or a smart person that will write something.

02:14.720 --> 02:18.360
So just keep that in mind in the next few slides.

02:18.360 --> 02:25.760
Some of the things might look impossible to be done, but keep an open mind and just remember

02:25.760 --> 02:27.640
everything is possible.

02:27.640 --> 02:29.000
Okay.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.680
So those ideas, I will share that proposed by real customers, people that are using email

02:35.680 --> 02:40.400
every day, myself included.

02:40.400 --> 02:46.160
Let's get started.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.280
So my email is my identity.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.280
Yay or nay?

02:51.280 --> 02:53.280
Okay.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.360
So it's 50-50.

02:55.360 --> 02:56.680
Thank you.

02:56.680 --> 02:57.680
Thank you, Paulsman.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.720
Thank you.

02:59.720 --> 03:04.960
So let's say I'm the customer, right?

03:04.960 --> 03:08.720
I'll be the main protagonist.

03:08.720 --> 03:20.120
So I have my email client and a university, for example, wants to verify that I have a

03:20.120 --> 03:21.120
real diploma.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.600
It's not like something that I downloaded from the Internet.

03:24.600 --> 03:39.120
They send me a verification request through credentials.

03:39.120 --> 03:46.240
So they want to see information about my age and whether I'm using the ID credentials

03:46.240 --> 03:47.320
in my diploma.

03:47.320 --> 03:51.520
So I'll say whether I want to proceed it or not.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.600
So they're very different use cases.

03:54.600 --> 04:02.880
And again, this is really available to be implemented because the standard and the implementation

04:02.880 --> 04:07.720
of lots of languages already exist.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.520
Second one is be ready.

04:10.520 --> 04:11.800
Build the fans.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.200
So I'll talk about that.

04:14.200 --> 04:22.440
First of all, we really, we, the customers, we really would like to see all of the messages

04:22.440 --> 04:26.240
encrypted and to add to the code.

04:26.240 --> 04:31.960
If something is not in code, I want to see it in a very special folder.

04:31.960 --> 04:35.400
It's dangerous.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.800
So, okay.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.400
I didn't get anyone.

04:40.400 --> 04:41.400
Oh, all right.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.400
One.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.400
No, no.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.400
Okay, okay.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:46.960 --> 04:51.480
We're talking about the perfect world that you guys will build and on the next day of

04:51.480 --> 04:56.080
the day of the room, you'll present.

04:56.080 --> 05:14.760
So fishing, so, the information, fair, so, manage keys, but it's easy.

05:14.760 --> 05:15.880
This is really important.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.640
You know, jocosite.

05:17.640 --> 05:23.960
It's really important to give the power to underrepresented groups of people that are

05:23.960 --> 05:32.520
really fighting for our rights in different parts of the world, journalists, you know,

05:32.520 --> 05:34.240
fighters for human rights.

05:34.240 --> 05:41.120
They really need an easy encryption, but just a few pro-support.

05:41.120 --> 05:43.920
So this is why this is important.

05:43.920 --> 05:44.920
Oh, next.

05:44.920 --> 05:48.640
I don't have a lot, so don't worry.

05:48.640 --> 05:49.640
Okay.

05:49.640 --> 05:57.960
So I want my long email to be translated to TLDR.

05:57.960 --> 06:09.080
So to extract, of course, something that is useful to me, but then I would like to understand

06:09.080 --> 06:13.840
how much time I actually saved by this.

06:13.840 --> 06:19.000
Instead of reading the email, the green part here, and at the same time, I would like to

06:19.000 --> 06:26.840
understand how much energy the engine doing all the calculations.

06:26.840 --> 06:36.360
So if I'm one that is aware or about the end of the question, I don't think that is included

06:36.360 --> 06:38.800
and embedded by email.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.760
Yay or nay?

06:41.760 --> 06:48.760
Or I see the majority down.

06:48.760 --> 06:55.400
No, no, no.

06:55.400 --> 06:59.400
This is an example.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.040
That's maybe not.

07:01.040 --> 07:03.200
All right.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.320
The local is available.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.200
If you don't know this website, you can go and check it out.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.080
I think I have one more.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.080
Mood detector.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.240
All right.

07:14.240 --> 07:18.240
So imagine it's Monday morning.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.240
Monday morning.

07:19.240 --> 07:25.160
And usually the Monday morning is really crowded because of many things.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.720
I want to go there, open my email client.

07:28.720 --> 07:32.120
So the email client detects that I'm really sad.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.720
So it's like, yes.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.720
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah.

07:37.720 --> 07:49.280
And the analysis of the sentiment here.

07:49.280 --> 07:53.360
So I want to see my happy emails first.

07:53.360 --> 07:56.640
A gift that I buy for Ireland Made in Concord.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.720
That's happy.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.200
My boss sent me during the weekend.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.400
Weekend?

08:02.400 --> 08:03.520
Not happy.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.400
So post-exists.

08:05.400 --> 08:15.440
So if you want to use the second facial, it's open source.

08:15.440 --> 08:19.680
Use the camera to detect whether you're happy or sad.

08:19.680 --> 08:24.360
And the first one is that you can.

08:24.360 --> 08:29.520
Analysis, whether this is happy or not.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.600
And of course, you can teach it everything.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.600
All right.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.760
Quickly, the last one.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.360
I would like to have a trust levels.

08:39.360 --> 08:46.000
For example, I receive email from my wife, from my kid, from my boss, from everyone.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.160
And I would like to see something like whether I, if I trust my wife and my wife trust.

08:53.160 --> 08:54.160
Hello.

08:54.160 --> 08:55.160
Hello.

08:55.160 --> 09:00.160
I would like to see my wife and my wife trust.

09:00.160 --> 09:05.160
Her sister, whether she'll trust me.

09:05.160 --> 09:11.160
So the trust concept, and it's really nice.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.800
You know, some people would like to see that as well.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.360
I have one minute.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.160
And again, again, your name.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.160
All right.

09:20.160 --> 09:22.960
Again, everything is possible.

09:22.960 --> 09:29.120
Please be open-minded when you create a next generation of email services.

09:29.120 --> 09:32.960
And do something out of the box.

09:32.960 --> 09:33.960
Creative.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.960
I think this is it.

09:35.960 --> 09:36.960
Thank you very much.

09:36.960 --> 09:40.960
If you want to connect, this is me.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.960
If you want to kick my ass, I'm leaving right after this one.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.960
So thank you very much.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.960
Thank you very much.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.960
All right.

09:53.960 --> 09:54.960
Thank you.

09:54.960 --> 09:55.960
It was very entertaining.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.960
I think there are no more questions open.

09:57.960 --> 10:03.960
And I think on behalf of the organizers of this deaf room, I think that was a real intense,

10:03.960 --> 10:05.960
but also really interesting day.

10:05.960 --> 10:07.960
Thanks for all your participation.

10:07.960 --> 10:17.960
Yeah, we hope to see you.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.960
Yeah, we hope to see you next year probably.
