00:00.000 --> 00:10.600
So, hey everyone, my name is Zuri, I work for KFW in a field of development cooperation

00:10.600 --> 00:15.320
and in this case development cooperation is not about GitHub but working together with

00:15.320 --> 00:22.400
third world countries and donor organizations like us to make the world a better place.

00:22.400 --> 00:26.960
So together since a couple of years we developed the digital public goods so we also registered

00:26.960 --> 00:31.080
that and that's what I would like to show you and also to invite you for collaboration.

00:31.080 --> 00:35.360
There are three slides, I would like to explain the problem to you, our proposition and where

00:35.360 --> 00:38.280
we are at the moment.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.400
So that's one example, if you look at development cooperation and how it works today, so you

00:42.400 --> 00:46.200
see one country here, maybe someone recognizes it, it's Ethiopia and we started to count

00:46.200 --> 00:50.600
how many government organizations and NGOs are actually working in this country and supporting

00:50.600 --> 00:51.600
it.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.760
And at some point we stopped counting so we didn't have any time to put more logos on

00:54.760 --> 00:56.000
it.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.240
The problem here is that we don't trust the data exchange and information exchange for

01:00.240 --> 01:02.720
the partner countries, they don't trust basically us.

01:02.720 --> 01:06.720
So in the end we end up, many NGOs and we as well, to do the project ourselves instead

01:06.720 --> 01:11.160
of just giving the money to the country so that the ministry there can actually do, build

01:11.160 --> 01:13.080
schools, hospitals and so on.

01:13.080 --> 01:18.400
And that's the real problem and already in the Paris Declaration 2005 we decided that

01:18.400 --> 01:22.440
we should do all this stuff on the systems of our partner countries that never happened

01:22.440 --> 01:24.800
because of lack of trust.

01:24.800 --> 01:28.160
And now what's our proposition to solve this?

01:28.160 --> 01:29.680
We called it true budget.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.760
So we figured out that the solution is not to install some kind of SharePoint or Google

01:33.760 --> 01:38.520
workspace or something, so another intermediary because whoever owns the data is actually

01:38.520 --> 01:42.120
more powerful than the rest, the data is the new oil basically.

01:42.120 --> 01:46.000
So we don't want to own the data and also the partners, if they own the data we actually

01:46.000 --> 01:48.480
don't trust them potentially.

01:48.480 --> 01:53.520
So the idea was to build this decentralized solution, which is truly decentralized and

01:53.520 --> 01:54.880
managed data there.

01:54.880 --> 01:58.280
What I mean with data is actually to manage the workflows, who is doing what, how are

01:58.280 --> 01:59.280
the projects implemented?

01:59.280 --> 02:04.120
So for example we build schools, how are the tenders done, how was the money dispersed,

02:04.120 --> 02:05.240
who did what basically.

02:05.240 --> 02:10.040
So what is actually stored as decentralized data is the status of all the different workflows,

02:10.040 --> 02:15.720
of all the different participants in this network of people and organizations.

02:15.720 --> 02:20.400
So technically what it is, it's actually a front end based on material UI React, so

02:20.400 --> 02:25.320
the JavaScript stuff, also the API side, it's a Node.js server and on the data side

02:25.320 --> 02:30.640
it's a very small blockchain solution, it feels like a key value data store basically,

02:30.640 --> 02:35.880
but it has a very nice property that actually synchronizes across different nodes.

02:35.880 --> 02:40.160
So there's a kind of a conscious mechanism that the data is then synchronized across

02:40.160 --> 02:41.160
the different parties.

02:41.160 --> 02:46.120
And that is very important also from a political view that basically you process this data

02:46.120 --> 02:47.120
on i-level.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.640
There's not one party that owns the data and the other one doesn't, so if any one of

02:51.640 --> 02:56.400
these participants here, that's only a very simplified view, would get out of the picture,

02:56.400 --> 03:00.000
it would still work out, right?

03:00.000 --> 03:04.560
So where we are at the moment with this, yeah, we did this since a couple of years, as I

03:04.560 --> 03:07.200
said, we are registered as a digital public good.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.480
We have a couple of pilots, for example with a Brazil Amazon fund, it's a very important

03:11.480 --> 03:16.800
one where sort of Germany paid money if less Amazon forest was destroyed, so it is very

03:16.800 --> 03:17.800
good.

03:17.800 --> 03:23.440
We had the vaccine alliance also very important, Burkina Faso is I think one of the oldest

03:23.440 --> 03:29.520
projects we did or one of the first we started with, we have the Ministry of Water, we try

03:29.520 --> 03:33.400
to manage this data and get to a situation where we can actually give them the money

03:33.400 --> 03:37.920
and they actually use the money to do good stuff instead of us developing the projects

03:37.920 --> 03:41.480
which we believe is not the most sustainable approach.

03:41.480 --> 03:48.000
Yeah, of course, as I said, you are invited to contribute to this project, it's running

03:48.000 --> 03:52.600
since a couple of years already, we have a couple of contributors, it's also the first

03:52.600 --> 03:57.200
open source project we did as KFW, it's a state owned, German state owned bank, so remember

03:57.200 --> 04:03.760
the talk we had before that state owned organizations, it's tricky to do open source, we achieved

04:03.760 --> 04:08.320
it here and I'm quite happy to be part of this project and would also be happy to if

04:08.320 --> 04:09.320
you join us.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.320
