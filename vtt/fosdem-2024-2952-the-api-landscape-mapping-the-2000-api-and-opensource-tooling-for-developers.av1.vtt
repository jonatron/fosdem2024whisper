WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
Yeah, it's me again.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.240
I made two applications.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.600
I've been accepted in two.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.640
So that's it, right?

00:14.640 --> 00:17.960
So the API industry,

00:17.960 --> 00:21.860
we've talked a little bit before on the thermal services,

00:21.860 --> 00:24.680
but now it's really a complete view about the landscape,

00:24.680 --> 00:28.880
and again, some work I've been doing over the last 10 years about

00:28.880 --> 00:30.280
mapping this industry.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.960
So a little bit about who I am now,

00:31.960 --> 00:34.320
I can talk more a little bit about me before it was really

00:34.320 --> 00:37.080
a collaboration between me and Celia and you know, Cube.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.880
So I'm the founder and CEO of Olimp.Legal,

00:39.880 --> 00:42.720
which is an AI assistant for data protection officers.

00:42.720 --> 00:46.400
We want to help people who are involved into making

00:46.400 --> 00:49.280
personal data reality, make their job better.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.480
And also the founder of API days conferences,

00:51.480 --> 00:54.680
the main series of industry conferences about the APIs,

00:54.680 --> 00:57.600
on the business aspect and the technical aspect.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.480
You can, yeah, so that's it.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.560
I'm co-author of two books on APIs called Continuous API Management.

01:04.560 --> 01:07.760
API's need versions, so book need versions too, right?

01:07.760 --> 01:11.240
Some reports for the European governments,

01:11.240 --> 01:14.560
and the report on GDPR data portability.

01:14.560 --> 01:16.320
Like if there is an API,

01:16.320 --> 01:19.240
can you transfer data according to GDPR and law?

01:19.240 --> 01:21.040
No, it doesn't work.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.560
The company don't respect,

01:22.560 --> 01:26.200
so I saved you 40 pages of the landscape.

01:27.040 --> 01:29.040
But it's interesting to know why, right?

01:29.040 --> 01:32.320
And also I co-authored the API landscape industry

01:32.320 --> 01:34.000
a third of the market every year,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.360
where this data comes from.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.880
So this is the landscape, at least at the end,

01:38.880 --> 01:40.880
in December, that was the landscape.

01:40.880 --> 01:45.240
It was 15, I have not 15, 1800 companies

01:45.240 --> 01:48.120
or open source projects on a map, right?

01:48.120 --> 01:50.800
That was, that you could try to guess

01:50.800 --> 01:53.480
when you want to develop an API, document an API,

01:53.480 --> 01:56.600
build it, design it, secure it,

01:56.600 --> 01:58.720
when you want to promote it, version it.

01:58.720 --> 02:02.000
So this was all the tools and for-profit tools

02:02.000 --> 02:04.600
and open source tools for that, right?

02:04.600 --> 02:07.120
The new version is here, it's live,

02:07.120 --> 02:10.000
it's on apilandscape.apic.io,

02:10.000 --> 02:11.280
I will show you the link.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.000
So now this is this full map of 2100 tools,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.520
where, and we will dive it in together,

02:17.520 --> 02:19.400
but when you have the old APLF cycle,

02:19.400 --> 02:23.360
with coding tools, design tools, gateway management,

02:23.480 --> 02:27.400
API ops, whatever, the security adjacent API tools,

02:27.400 --> 02:29.200
you know, like you can go there

02:29.200 --> 02:30.440
and you can click on any company,

02:30.440 --> 02:32.280
let me, do you want to name a company,

02:32.280 --> 02:33.440
I can try to find it.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.960
No, I don't know, let's click on,

02:36.960 --> 02:39.720
let's click on a, I don't know, a company here,

02:39.720 --> 02:41.320
Postman, for example, here.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.120
So you can see many information about them

02:44.120 --> 02:45.920
and you can see the complete profile.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.600
What's the potential headcount?

02:49.600 --> 02:51.600
What's their diversity?

02:51.600 --> 02:54.120
Are there women in top management?

02:54.120 --> 02:56.840
Is there the management diverse in terms of ethnicity,

02:56.840 --> 03:00.640
funding, you know, like tool, patents,

03:00.640 --> 03:02.320
granted, active products, whatever,

03:02.320 --> 03:04.600
known, and all their sections, right?

03:04.600 --> 03:08.680
And we'll try, so I will save you to the 2100 tools,

03:08.680 --> 03:09.920
but I will try to give you some hints

03:09.920 --> 03:12.240
about how to understand the landscape these days, right?

03:12.240 --> 03:17.240
And on the 2100 tools that you can see on this landscape,

03:17.880 --> 03:19.840
there are approximately 700,

03:19.840 --> 03:23.000
which are completely open source with,

03:23.000 --> 03:24.440
let's say, license that,

03:24.440 --> 03:27.960
which are a copy left or copy center,

03:27.960 --> 03:29.400
functional scratch, of course.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.160
You know, have you tried to turn it on again?

03:33.160 --> 03:34.560
But at least this is the landscape here

03:34.560 --> 03:36.040
that you can navigate and it's free

03:36.040 --> 03:37.740
and the data is also accessible.

03:37.740 --> 03:39.960
We make it simpler, it's a big air table,

03:41.360 --> 03:42.960
like a hosted database,

03:42.960 --> 03:44.320
but at least you can see,

03:44.320 --> 03:47.160
you can try to get stuff, understand stuff there.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.680
On apilandscape.apc.io,

03:49.680 --> 03:51.920
you can download the map if you want to post there,

03:51.920 --> 03:53.040
about it in your room.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.120
There is a search engine, actually at the conference,

03:58.120 --> 04:00.480
we print it and people take it, right?

04:01.560 --> 04:03.720
And report if there is a bug or something.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.620
So, and you can also add your tool.

04:06.620 --> 04:07.720
You can add your tool here

04:07.720 --> 04:10.320
if you think your tool should be there, right?

04:11.560 --> 04:13.360
So we've gone from there to the other one

04:13.360 --> 04:15.000
and we'll see actually what does that change.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.720
And now my talk here is to try to give you some hints

04:17.720 --> 04:21.160
about what's the update and what's changed, right?

04:22.480 --> 04:27.480
In summary, we will see that there is a full API mindset.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.120
Many new products are evolving

04:30.120 --> 04:32.520
into helping people to build APIs

04:32.520 --> 04:34.320
and more and more open source.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.240
So we'll dive more into that.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.640
Regulations are enforcing the obligation to publish APIs

04:39.640 --> 04:41.920
for companies or for administration.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.560
That enable a lot of tooling.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.240
Many industries are pushing the tooling

04:48.240 --> 04:50.080
to be dedicated to their standards

04:50.080 --> 04:53.560
or to their norms.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.720
Security and privacy, and we had a speaker and security

04:56.720 --> 04:59.760
like Arno is stand alone industry almost by itself.

04:59.760 --> 05:02.480
Now they are dedicated to API security

05:02.480 --> 05:05.280
on top of existing product like API management

05:05.280 --> 05:06.040
or API gateways.

05:06.040 --> 05:09.000
So new layers are hiding each other.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.240
Also the privacy aspect,

05:10.240 --> 05:11.800
checking if there is personal data,

05:11.800 --> 05:13.760
checking if the regulations are enforced.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.520
Again, new layers of product, like it's really 1000 layers.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.760
There is also what we call the API as a product aspect

05:21.760 --> 05:25.560
or transactional API, payment API, communication API,

05:25.560 --> 05:28.680
SMS APIs, maps APIs, forms API,

05:28.680 --> 05:30.840
like really the building bricks

05:30.840 --> 05:32.440
of the digital infrastructure.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.160
And last but not least, which we consider APIs

05:35.160 --> 05:37.360
which are all the low code and no code,

05:37.360 --> 05:39.320
which is API for non-developers

05:39.320 --> 05:40.520
or for citizen developers,

05:40.520 --> 05:42.760
the ability to mix APIs together, right?

05:42.760 --> 05:44.640
So I give you a hint.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.840
Now we are updating the landscape with all the AI APIs,

05:47.840 --> 05:48.760
you know, like this model,

05:48.760 --> 05:49.960
sub-unsource versus others,

05:49.960 --> 05:53.480
but it's not there yet because we started the work, right?

05:54.480 --> 05:57.200
The API mindset, I just wanted to give you one thing

05:57.200 --> 06:00.320
to really understand what's happening in industry.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.200
We've often believed APIs are here

06:02.200 --> 06:04.720
to expose capabilities to others,

06:04.720 --> 06:07.160
to make them automated and programmable.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.960
Actually I had a discussion with Sam Newman,

06:08.960 --> 06:11.200
the author of the microservice book,

06:11.200 --> 06:13.680
who told me, no, an API is as much exposing

06:13.680 --> 06:15.560
as much as hiding.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.600
Tony's like a menu in a restaurant.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.680
When you go in a restaurant,

06:18.680 --> 06:20.000
when you look at the menu,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.760
it's not what the cook can do,

06:22.760 --> 06:25.240
he's hiding 99% of what he can do.

06:25.240 --> 06:29.180
Just show you 1% of he wants what you to order and do.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.240
And this is what the design,

06:30.240 --> 06:33.120
this is really understanding the diner experience

06:33.120 --> 06:34.160
that you wanna give, right?

06:34.160 --> 06:38.240
And so this is something that's extremely important

06:38.240 --> 06:39.760
and this is why we have so much security

06:39.760 --> 06:41.160
and compliance stuff, right?

06:42.480 --> 06:45.200
I love this advertisement of Lego, right?

06:45.200 --> 06:47.240
You know, APIs are,

06:47.240 --> 06:49.800
and the service behind APIs are building bricks.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.360
And when we expose them,

06:51.360 --> 06:53.840
people will consume them the way they want,

06:53.840 --> 06:55.680
not the way obligatory you expect,

06:55.680 --> 06:59.320
but how they want, exactly like these Lego bricks.

06:59.320 --> 07:02.600
You publish Lego bricks, I use them the way I want.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.360
Oh, this is a diner, this is a plane,

07:04.360 --> 07:05.880
this is a tank, or this is a car,

07:05.880 --> 07:08.080
or this is whatever you want, right?

07:08.080 --> 07:09.760
So that's really the idea.

07:09.760 --> 07:10.800
Unless you understand that,

07:10.800 --> 07:12.480
I think you can't understand what's happening

07:12.480 --> 07:13.520
in the API industry.

07:15.800 --> 07:18.760
Large trend that we have seen in this industry,

07:18.760 --> 07:20.800
if you want it to be digital in the 2000s,

07:20.800 --> 07:23.120
you need a website or a website strategy,

07:23.120 --> 07:25.520
2000s to be mobile, you remember?

07:25.520 --> 07:27.960
Solo, mobile, social, local, mobile,

07:27.960 --> 07:29.520
you remember that, right?

07:29.520 --> 07:30.360
I'm old, right?

07:31.880 --> 07:34.280
No, but like the 2000s, like the mobile aspect,

07:34.280 --> 07:36.920
you needed APIs actually to make mobile applications,

07:36.920 --> 07:39.360
to talk to the remote servers,

07:39.360 --> 07:41.200
and the backends and stuff like that.

07:41.200 --> 07:44.160
But now the 2000s are really API driven,

07:44.160 --> 07:47.640
to actually expose data to everyone else's website,

07:47.640 --> 07:49.960
or everyone else's mobile application.

07:49.960 --> 07:51.640
So that's really the idea, right?

07:51.640 --> 07:54.440
The first one was really like funnel channels,

07:54.440 --> 07:56.840
but now with APIs, I try to embed my data

07:56.840 --> 07:58.240
or my services to everyone else.

07:58.240 --> 08:00.080
So it's really horizontal aspect here.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.080
And last but not least,

08:03.080 --> 08:07.400
what we call the axiom of the API economy industry,

08:07.400 --> 08:11.360
whatever, is that organization, public, private,

08:11.360 --> 08:13.920
non-profit, at some point will open

08:14.960 --> 08:16.880
and provide their core competencies

08:16.880 --> 08:18.480
in the digital world through APIs.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.040
You know, they will, but I do really well.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.960
I will expose it to others so they can use it

08:23.960 --> 08:25.800
and consume it, right?

08:25.800 --> 08:28.440
And I will consume what others are doing the best

08:28.440 --> 08:29.280
in my system.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.520
So it's really the circular thing,

08:31.520 --> 08:32.360
I wouldn't say economy,

08:32.480 --> 08:34.240
at least it's circular use case,

08:34.240 --> 08:37.240
where I focus on what I do the best.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.360
I expose it to others and I consume what others

08:39.360 --> 08:43.120
are doing the best to support my stuff, right?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.480
So this is exactly the software we know,

08:45.480 --> 08:47.160
like the average application now,

08:47.160 --> 08:50.880
I think that's 37 APIs approximately, the consume.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.080
It's globalized, right?

08:52.080 --> 08:54.520
Let's say the digital world is really globalized.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.800
So I often take this comparison with the car industry.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.840
You know, like the car manufacturers,

09:01.840 --> 09:03.920
the old style of cars, right?

09:03.920 --> 09:05.520
Not the electric one, but these ones,

09:05.520 --> 09:07.080
actually they have hundreds of suppliers

09:07.080 --> 09:09.440
that they gather with each other,

09:09.440 --> 09:10.920
that they orchestrate.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.520
And I think the landscape, you know,

09:12.520 --> 09:14.400
showed you the previous version of landscape,

09:14.400 --> 09:15.920
is a little bit like that, right?

09:15.920 --> 09:17.800
At some point we will just gather

09:17.800 --> 09:19.800
project software, project libraries,

09:19.800 --> 09:22.160
web APIs, frameworks,

09:22.160 --> 09:23.680
and actually we will build a whole stack

09:23.680 --> 09:25.960
that is not for an application.

09:25.960 --> 09:26.960
So unless you understand that,

09:26.960 --> 09:28.920
I think it's really hard to understand

09:28.920 --> 09:30.320
what I will say later.

09:30.320 --> 09:34.640
So that was the latest version, right?

09:34.640 --> 09:37.520
And the latest version had five layers.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.880
First on top was the APLF cycle platforms,

09:41.000 --> 09:42.480
the back-end big needles,

09:43.720 --> 09:46.000
the API as a product, the transactional API,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.480
the business process of the service,

09:48.480 --> 09:49.920
the integration platform as a service,

09:49.920 --> 09:52.440
like how do I consume any APIs in one time,

09:52.440 --> 09:55.960
or the abstractions or the aggregators,

09:55.960 --> 09:59.320
you know, like how when API is wrapping a lot of them,

09:59.320 --> 10:01.200
I'll be able to consume them.

10:01.200 --> 10:04.280
The new version and updated version is different.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.800
So we made hard work, again,

10:06.800 --> 10:09.720
I will share the slides on social media and stuff,

10:09.720 --> 10:11.360
but like it's really different.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.680
We really try to not just make a list of tools,

10:13.680 --> 10:16.040
but understand the dynamic.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.440
So on the top left, you have the standard bodies,

10:18.440 --> 10:21.160
the governance bodies, and the protocols, right?

10:21.160 --> 10:23.480
These protocols are actually what we believe

10:23.480 --> 10:25.800
the standard, the base, right?

10:25.800 --> 10:27.680
And then after you have what we call

10:27.680 --> 10:30.440
the full life cycle, right, on top,

10:30.440 --> 10:32.840
which is the data provider providing APIs,

10:32.840 --> 10:34.320
delivering that with developer experience,

10:34.320 --> 10:37.000
security privacy, digital readiness,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.400
infrastructure availability, you know, all this stuff, right?

10:40.400 --> 10:42.200
Below you have the government and regulators

10:42.200 --> 10:45.480
that oblige sometimes to do it, that give a context, right?

10:46.480 --> 10:49.040
And all of this is now the exposition of the API.

10:49.040 --> 10:52.080
So all of this is behind the firewall,

10:52.080 --> 10:54.640
and now this is the term of services and the consumers.

10:54.680 --> 10:58.840
Now you expose these APIs into products,

10:58.840 --> 11:00.560
all the products API, transactional API

11:00.560 --> 11:01.720
that you consume to do something,

11:01.720 --> 11:04.240
oh, PDF reader, or whatever,

11:04.240 --> 11:07.040
and then you have the, on the right,

11:07.040 --> 11:09.800
the whole society, we believe it's important,

11:09.800 --> 11:11.760
but you also have all the aggregators,

11:11.760 --> 11:14.840
people who help you to consume these APIs, right?

11:14.840 --> 11:18.240
So standard bodies, full life cycle management,

11:18.240 --> 11:21.440
infrastructure, regulation and community,

11:21.440 --> 11:24.120
exposition, consumption, right?

11:24.840 --> 11:28.400
And so we try to do another taxonomy that looks like that.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.760
It's a little bit more complex,

11:29.760 --> 11:32.680
but I will drive you through that, right?

11:32.680 --> 11:35.080
So here, this is the infrastructure.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.480
All the project you may know about Docker,

11:38.480 --> 11:41.960
container, Kubernetes, all the cloud native aspect,

11:41.960 --> 11:43.920
you know, like Open Policy Agent,

11:43.920 --> 11:44.880
or you know, all this opens,

11:44.880 --> 11:47.720
this is really where a lot of the open source tools are, right?

11:47.720 --> 11:49.120
In this infrastructure, right?

11:51.160 --> 11:52.560
I guess someone who was nothing,

11:52.560 --> 11:55.360
I'm gonna say a lot of open source, but still.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.480
The standard bodies here,

11:56.480 --> 12:01.320
we believe they help things to happen on there in blue,

12:01.320 --> 12:02.960
and then we have the core aspect.

12:02.960 --> 12:07.520
So now we have 1400 approximately tools just there, right?

12:07.520 --> 12:09.320
The life cycle management, open source project,

12:09.320 --> 12:10.160
whatever, right?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.040
Developer proposal.

12:12.040 --> 12:14.840
So this is, if you work in the API space,

12:14.840 --> 12:17.360
these tools are mostly the one you know, right?

12:17.360 --> 12:20.440
Infrastructure is mostly made by ops, DevOps, whatever,

12:20.440 --> 12:23.600
but still they enable the microservices, architecture,

12:23.600 --> 12:24.920
the service mesh architecture,

12:24.920 --> 12:27.120
the stuff like that, right?

12:27.120 --> 12:29.640
Then we also put the industry, community, and intelligence.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.640
You know, many companies are providing services,

12:31.640 --> 12:34.080
consulting, whatever, design, whatever,

12:34.080 --> 12:35.080
so we put them here.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.960
And we said now it's the exposition,

12:37.960 --> 12:40.800
so now it's the product, the right.

12:42.280 --> 12:45.640
And then the discovery aggregators or marketplaces,

12:45.640 --> 12:47.200
I don't know where it's got,

12:47.200 --> 12:48.000
but at least you know,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.560
this is the, that helped you consume these ones

12:50.560 --> 12:52.880
who are produced, managed by these ones,

12:52.880 --> 12:56.160
who are actually powered by these ones, right?

12:56.160 --> 12:57.000
Just to give you a hint.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.960
So when you will go back here,

12:58.960 --> 13:00.040
I'll just go there,

13:00.040 --> 13:02.680
when you will go back not on the middle here,

13:02.680 --> 13:06.000
this is, we could not do a presentation on one page

13:06.000 --> 13:09.160
because we don't have a screen like this as big,

13:09.160 --> 13:12.040
but at least this is what you will be able to get

13:12.040 --> 13:17.040
but now in a vertical, yes, in a vertical manner, right?

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
And so, yeah, I have still some more minutes

13:26.000 --> 13:28.640
to what actually we can get from this.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.800
You can play with it, right?

13:29.800 --> 13:31.280
But at least if you wanna,

13:31.280 --> 13:33.360
in seven minutes to have the conclusion.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.720
So first, the core of this API industry

13:37.720 --> 13:39.400
is really what we call the API management.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.040
The ability to know for every data or services inside

13:43.040 --> 13:45.760
that we publish internally or externally,

13:45.800 --> 13:50.360
who is using it at what rate, for what use case,

13:50.360 --> 13:52.320
for at what level of authorization,

13:52.320 --> 13:54.960
and yeah, like mostly that, right?

13:55.960 --> 14:00.520
So yeah, so it was mostly the API gateway

14:00.520 --> 14:02.920
that's really the core, the technological core of this,

14:02.920 --> 14:04.680
but now there's a full practice around that,

14:04.680 --> 14:07.080
the governance, the design, the documentation,

14:07.080 --> 14:09.800
the development, the testing, the monitoring.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.160
So all of this that will go to the management

14:12.160 --> 14:13.800
is becoming a commodity.

14:13.800 --> 14:17.640
Many, many, the prices, yes, prices are really going down,

14:17.640 --> 14:19.600
many more open source tools.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.720
And just to show you how it becomes a commodity,

14:22.720 --> 14:25.480
this is the acquisition of the top layers

14:25.480 --> 14:28.160
of other management solutions.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.520
Broadcom acquired, CA technology who had acquired layer seven,

14:31.520 --> 14:34.000
who had acquired Renscope, like it's really,

14:34.000 --> 14:37.600
it's really like the fish eating the other fish, right?

14:38.680 --> 14:41.080
Google acquired Apigee, who had acquired

14:41.080 --> 14:44.960
user greed and Firebase, AppSheet, IBM acquired Red Hat,

14:44.960 --> 14:46.400
three scale and Trongloop, and Software AG

14:46.400 --> 14:49.000
like few weeks ago, for, I don't know if you know

14:49.000 --> 14:51.320
web methods, but web methods now

14:51.320 --> 14:52.840
has been acquired by IBM, right?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.680
And you can see that, just to say that

14:55.680 --> 14:58.560
when so many big players are constantly dating,

14:58.560 --> 15:00.680
doesn't mean there is so much innovation.

15:00.680 --> 15:01.640
When they're constantly dating,

15:01.640 --> 15:03.560
it means innovation is not there.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.560
This is why many new companies actually made

15:06.560 --> 15:10.000
things open source, say okay, it's commoditization,

15:10.040 --> 15:12.320
you know, innovation is slowing down,

15:12.320 --> 15:16.760
it's time to cut the, to hit the market

15:16.760 --> 15:20.600
with open source free software API management solutions.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.520
So most known one are Gravity, Kong,

15:23.520 --> 15:26.520
actually Kong opened the software at the beginning,

15:26.520 --> 15:29.000
and when they raise money from investors,

15:29.000 --> 15:30.200
they're closing it, right?

15:31.520 --> 15:33.000
Sometimes the business model of the opening

15:33.000 --> 15:34.600
is the closing, unfortunately.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.080
NGDX acquired by EFI, but solo, three scale,

15:39.120 --> 15:40.960
acquired by HEDAT, acquired by IBM,

15:40.960 --> 15:43.080
TAIC and WSO2, who has been open source

15:43.080 --> 15:44.680
is the beginning, but just to let you know,

15:44.680 --> 15:47.120
that now there's a real open source stack

15:47.120 --> 15:48.840
that is strong, that is complete,

15:48.840 --> 15:51.280
that can do the full lifecycle, right?

15:51.280 --> 15:54.400
So if company wants to go full on APIs,

15:54.400 --> 15:56.360
they can do it full open source too, right?

15:56.360 --> 15:58.960
And with a license that allows it to do it, right?

16:01.160 --> 16:03.240
About the other trends, many regulations

16:03.240 --> 16:07.280
have obliged companies or institutions to open APIs.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.520
One of the first, the main one that has been,

16:09.520 --> 16:12.000
is PSD2, who is familiar with PSD2,

16:12.000 --> 16:13.200
whoever heard about it?

16:14.480 --> 16:15.320
What it is?

16:15.320 --> 16:16.240
No, I'm joking.

16:16.240 --> 16:18.400
No, PSD2 is the payment service directive too,

16:18.400 --> 16:20.840
it's in banking, obliging banks to open APIs.

16:20.840 --> 16:23.320
So now in Europe, if you can have

16:23.320 --> 16:25.720
what we call bank aggregators easily,

16:25.720 --> 16:27.200
no, like on your bank account,

16:27.200 --> 16:30.560
you can import other banking account easily,

16:30.560 --> 16:33.400
even they are competitor, it's because of this regulation.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.400
If I go back to the previous talk,

16:36.400 --> 16:38.600
it's an API neutrality aspect.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.320
Every bank is obliged to allow access

16:41.320 --> 16:43.520
to any other financial institution,

16:43.520 --> 16:45.320
as long as they're registered,

16:45.320 --> 16:48.360
to open APIs to make any applications.

16:48.360 --> 16:49.520
Pure neutrality, you know?

16:49.520 --> 16:52.480
So yeah, so just to give you a hint,

16:52.480 --> 16:55.080
but yeah, so many banks have been obliged to open APIs

16:55.080 --> 16:56.600
because of PSD2 directive.

16:57.480 --> 17:02.000
This is a landscape a little bit of the regulation maps.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.800
All in green, they have strong banking regulation

17:05.800 --> 17:07.400
obliging to open APIs.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.360
Yellow, it's coming in the next year.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.800
And red and orange, it's not there yet.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.120
But just to let you know,

17:14.120 --> 17:17.640
like at least Europe invented this regulation

17:17.640 --> 17:19.200
and has been copied by others.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.520
There's also the healthcare,

17:22.520 --> 17:25.480
you know, HL7, fire standard,

17:26.800 --> 17:30.520
to do smart application as they call it.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.840
But yeah, so just to let you know,

17:31.840 --> 17:33.160
many standard in healthcare,

17:33.160 --> 17:35.400
so many tooling dedicated for that, right?

17:35.400 --> 17:36.960
And specifications there.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.320
Last but not least,

17:39.320 --> 17:42.000
personal data regulations like GDPR,

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
CCPA in California, like PIPL in China and whatever.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.480
60 countries of regulations inspired by GDPR.

17:50.480 --> 17:52.800
We're really good at regulation in Europe, right?

17:52.800 --> 17:55.480
Yeah, really good at regulations.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.040
But yeah, obliging to open APIs

17:58.040 --> 18:01.400
because the user needs to get their data back,

18:01.400 --> 18:02.400
need to transfer it,

18:02.400 --> 18:04.240
so many, many regulations have applied to that.

18:04.280 --> 18:06.080
And a new tooling around that.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.560
You will see to the slides, especially,

18:11.560 --> 18:15.600
so the AUAI Act recently,

18:15.600 --> 18:18.200
in the AUAI Act, there's one proposal

18:18.200 --> 18:21.040
that actually you will not be able in Europe,

18:21.040 --> 18:22.640
I don't know if it's where we go there,

18:22.640 --> 18:26.440
to consume an API that is not hosted in Europe, right?

18:26.440 --> 18:27.280
On AI, right?

18:27.280 --> 18:29.480
The API has to be hosted in Europe

18:29.480 --> 18:31.400
or from a European company in Europe, right?

18:31.400 --> 18:33.840
So again, the API is really at the center

18:33.840 --> 18:34.960
of the regulation.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.240
The open source models can be open source,

18:37.240 --> 18:39.680
but hosted and consumed, it has to be in Europe,

18:39.680 --> 18:42.360
so many new tooling will come to be sure

18:42.360 --> 18:44.560
that you consume what you're allowed

18:44.560 --> 18:46.880
in the place you're allowed to do that.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.320
In the US, they have the Access Act,

18:49.320 --> 18:53.080
which is actually sometimes better than GDPR and portability,

18:53.080 --> 18:54.600
that oblige company to have APIs

18:54.600 --> 18:56.200
when you request your data,

18:56.200 --> 18:58.120
or in GDPR is not the case.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.480
When you ask your data on GDPR,

18:59.480 --> 19:03.800
we give you a JSON file or PDF that you can't use,

19:03.840 --> 19:06.880
the Access Act, it has to be an API access.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.400
And just for the story, if, for example,

19:10.400 --> 19:13.040
you ask your data from Facebook, GDPR,

19:13.040 --> 19:16.400
they will give you a JSON which is not incomplete.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.440
It's great like that.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.880
If you create an app just for yourself

19:20.880 --> 19:23.920
and ask permissions to have data for yourself,

19:23.920 --> 19:25.760
you will have a lot, right?

19:25.760 --> 19:28.000
So if you create their,

19:29.640 --> 19:31.800
they give less data according with GDPR

19:31.800 --> 19:33.800
than when you sign their platform policy,

19:33.800 --> 19:36.920
which is nonsense, but just to tell you

19:36.920 --> 19:40.600
how the GDPR sometimes is not strong enough to oblige,

19:40.600 --> 19:43.120
because it didn't put the word API.

19:43.120 --> 19:46.040
It has to be machine readable, machine readable.

19:46.040 --> 19:46.880
Okay, JSON, man.

19:48.000 --> 19:48.840
Oh, girl.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.880
So you will see in the landscape,

19:51.880 --> 19:53.680
there are specific sections for,

19:53.680 --> 19:55.120
if you're from specific industry,

19:55.120 --> 19:57.040
like banking, finance, insurance,

19:57.040 --> 19:59.880
or other aggregator in the space,

19:59.880 --> 20:04.040
I'll just go a little bit there to respect the time.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.600
Section three, API security.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.880
So we had a speaker earlier about API security, yes.

20:07.880 --> 20:10.960
API security now standalone thing.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.560
We had the API management layer,

20:12.560 --> 20:14.000
and now new threats.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
There's a new layer of pure API security tools,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.680
pure play that comes.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.880
It's inspired by the DevSecOps approach.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.400
I don't know if you heard that term before,

20:23.400 --> 20:26.560
you know, like the ability to put security

20:26.560 --> 20:30.520
in the DevOps pipeline between the dev

20:30.520 --> 20:33.480
who build the apps and apps who ship it.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.280
You know, the security inside the code, right?

20:35.280 --> 20:37.160
This really side, yeah.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.800
And yeah, it's really a rimes racing up.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.960
Unfortunately, there is again,

20:40.960 --> 20:43.840
a lot of money injected in that industry.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.840
You will see a little bit like in the landscape,

20:46.840 --> 20:49.400
this is pure API security players, right?

20:49.400 --> 20:50.960
On top of API gateways.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.760
Imagine now you are a developer or an architect.

20:53.760 --> 20:56.520
How many layers you have to just publish your APIs, right?

20:58.080 --> 21:01.600
And what I like here in this report from Sol Security,

21:01.600 --> 21:04.240
here, sensitive that exposure privacy incident,

21:04.240 --> 21:08.200
like 30% of people believe it's one of their main,

21:08.200 --> 21:10.160
it's one of their main concern.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.520
So the privacy aspect is there,

21:12.520 --> 21:15.520
and we believe a new generation of privacy tools will rise.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.720
Section number four, the API product aspect.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.360
I love this quote from the CEO of Twilio,

21:22.360 --> 21:24.520
who resigned as CEO actually.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.400
But the word is getting broken down into APIs.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.120
Every part of the stack of a business developer might need

21:29.120 --> 21:31.360
to build is eventually turning into APIs

21:31.360 --> 21:32.640
that developer can use.

21:32.640 --> 21:35.560
This is the map of the car I showed you.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.800
The trend is really high,

21:36.800 --> 21:38.280
and we have a few hundred tools there,

21:38.280 --> 21:40.040
just for that, but actually there are thousands.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.240
There are thousands of thousands, we can't map them.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.600
Just in the landscape, we give a hint there.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.280
And he made a book called, Ask Your Developer,

21:48.280 --> 21:52.320
which is not too bad, which is good for a CEO, right?

21:53.360 --> 21:58.800
Yeah, and some companies just to show you,

21:58.800 --> 22:01.760
so now it was last year valuation,

22:01.760 --> 22:04.640
now it's 13, no, some up and down.

22:05.600 --> 22:08.040
But yeah, it's just to show you that when you do

22:08.040 --> 22:11.520
one thing really well, and everybody consume it,

22:11.520 --> 22:14.480
you can really scale at large, and APIs enable that.

22:14.480 --> 22:17.680
I just take the example of a company called Avalara here.

22:17.680 --> 22:22.240
Avalara, they just do tax, VAT, tax calculation

22:22.240 --> 22:24.520
in e-commerce cart.

22:24.520 --> 22:25.680
You know when you have a cart,

22:25.680 --> 22:27.240
they have to calculate the VAT,

22:27.240 --> 22:29.640
but depending on the country, especially in the US,

22:29.640 --> 22:32.280
depending on the state, VAT will be different

22:32.280 --> 22:35.240
depending on where you're delivered.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.120
They just do an API for that, there are 4,000 employees.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.360
New standards with a new logo,

22:43.360 --> 22:46.320
but open API initiative, async API for asynchronous API,

22:46.320 --> 22:48.000
GRPC mostly for microservices

22:48.000 --> 22:50.440
and high scalable infrastructure.

22:50.480 --> 22:53.880
JSON, LDJ, JSON schema, GraphQL

22:53.880 --> 22:56.480
for people who don't like to design APIs,

22:56.480 --> 23:01.240
and APIs JSON from KinLane.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.640
Now I'm joking about GraphQL, but API JSON,

23:03.640 --> 23:07.600
I put it in a standard base because it's a way to publish

23:07.600 --> 23:10.520
all the interfaces and all the links important to your APIs.

23:10.520 --> 23:14.200
It's suspect that KinLane is developing there.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.000
So new standard for new infrastructure.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.240
That's but not least the local aspect.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.400
There's a huge trend into the local no code,

23:22.400 --> 23:24.560
all part of APIs consuming these tools,

23:24.560 --> 23:26.080
enabling aggregation.

23:26.080 --> 23:29.120
I'll let you discover that because just an example,

23:29.120 --> 23:33.160
we lack five developers we consider until 2025,

23:33.160 --> 23:38.160
and just 260,000 just with API skills.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.840
So we lack of resource, people who want to automate more,

23:42.840 --> 23:44.980
and yeah, this is the trend here.

23:46.840 --> 23:49.840
So as a wrap up, the full landscape

23:49.840 --> 23:53.760
that you can visit, download, consult, search in.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.680
API management is coming to community,

23:56.680 --> 23:59.000
more open source tools there.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.600
Regulation obliged to open APIs

24:00.600 --> 24:04.720
that leads to specialization of many, many tools.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.200
API security is no standalone product

24:08.200 --> 24:10.200
and privacy the next wave.

24:10.200 --> 24:12.160
APIs are the new business infrastructure

24:12.160 --> 24:14.200
and with the new open source technical stacks

24:14.200 --> 24:18.120
with standards that people respect almost all the time.

24:18.120 --> 24:20.280
And citizen developers, non-developers

24:20.280 --> 24:22.120
are the next API users and consumers

24:22.120 --> 24:23.680
thanks to no code and no code.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.720
I just recap the address here,

24:27.720 --> 24:30.200
APIlandscape.APICn.io.

24:31.640 --> 24:32.600
Okay, no, I cannot.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.920
Good try.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.440
But you can see APIlandscape.APICn.io,

24:38.440 --> 24:41.800
which is a media, and then you will be able to click

24:41.800 --> 24:45.760
on any company and get data and know what you will integrate

24:45.800 --> 24:50.800
or as an open source project or consume as a product.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.120
Thank you very much.

24:53.120 --> 25:03.280
We have five minutes for questions.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.640
Three, four, two.

25:11.520 --> 25:12.360
Yeah, sorry.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.680
Like you've been working a lot

25:17.680 --> 25:22.680
through creating the content like the landscapes.

25:23.640 --> 25:28.480
You think it's still used for creating more products

25:28.480 --> 25:29.680
related to API.

25:29.680 --> 25:33.360
I think we have a lot of companies

25:33.360 --> 25:37.040
that are doing things related to APIs,

25:37.040 --> 25:38.560
but you think you have something

25:38.560 --> 25:43.120
that could help bringing something new?

25:43.120 --> 25:44.360
On it or?

25:44.840 --> 25:47.400
So two examples, again, how it evolved.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.960
GraphQL when it came, wow,

25:49.960 --> 25:52.480
few dozens and hundreds of tools in the few years.

25:52.480 --> 25:55.320
Now it's quite stable, some are dying, some are reviving.

25:55.320 --> 25:57.520
Async API, like ever driven architecture,

25:57.520 --> 26:00.000
asynchronous API, great community,

26:00.000 --> 26:02.920
no like whoop, we see that coming, right?

26:02.920 --> 26:06.560
So yeah, it leaves some part of the landscape

26:06.560 --> 26:08.400
where we remove hundreds of companies every year

26:08.400 --> 26:11.800
or projects that we consider not relevant

26:11.800 --> 26:13.320
for this year, not maintained or whatever,

26:13.360 --> 26:14.640
and some new are coming.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.280
As I said, for this year,

26:16.280 --> 26:18.240
the research we're connecting,

26:19.240 --> 26:22.520
the open source, AI, ML, APIs, whatever,

26:22.520 --> 26:24.000
there will be a lot of things.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.960
There is an API called form blur GPT

26:25.960 --> 26:28.520
to hide personal data from open source models.

26:28.520 --> 26:32.720
So many, many new tooling on AI APIs will emerge

26:32.720 --> 26:36.800
and we believe it will be a full section

26:36.800 --> 26:37.680
by the end of the year, right?

26:37.680 --> 26:40.640
Just an example here, right?

26:40.680 --> 26:41.520
So, great.

26:41.520 --> 26:44.200
That's a really more related to AI.

26:44.200 --> 26:48.080
Let's say, again, when you see the funding that goes there,

26:48.080 --> 26:49.640
a lot of open source projects are coming,

26:49.640 --> 26:52.840
a lot of companies are doing it,

26:52.840 --> 26:54.640
you know, follow the money, right?

26:54.640 --> 26:55.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:03.240 --> 27:04.080
Yep.

27:04.080 --> 27:08.080
I think I got to get the part on the new AI Act.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.280
Yeah, I know, it was just a mention.

27:12.280 --> 27:15.480
It was just a mention that in the AU AI Act,

27:15.480 --> 27:17.680
you know, in all the GPR stuff,

27:17.680 --> 27:19.800
the data has to be hosted in Europe, right?

27:19.800 --> 27:24.240
Unless you show that the word hosted

27:24.240 --> 27:26.280
respect the same values as in Europe

27:26.280 --> 27:27.600
and it's complex, right?

27:27.600 --> 27:30.680
We call it like that a transfers, you know, stuff like that.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.600
But the AI Act, like proposed,

27:32.600 --> 27:34.680
one of the proposition is that in Europe,

27:34.680 --> 27:37.000
you are not able to consume an API

27:37.000 --> 27:40.120
where the data is not hosted in Europe,

27:40.120 --> 27:41.320
even if the model is open source,

27:41.320 --> 27:43.280
but it has to be accessible,

27:43.280 --> 27:45.120
the model has to be hosted in Europe

27:45.120 --> 27:47.240
and accessible by an API in Europe.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.280
You just to say that the API now comes

27:49.280 --> 27:51.280
into the regulation, the term,

27:51.280 --> 27:53.480
versus the API when there is no API

27:53.480 --> 27:54.960
and people send you machine readable file,

27:54.960 --> 27:57.280
like Excel or PDF or,

27:57.280 --> 27:59.000
the claim PDF is machine readable,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.520
but or GZAN actually, right?

28:02.720 --> 28:04.480
The fundamental,

28:04.480 --> 28:06.800
what's the fundamental decision behind that?

28:11.800 --> 28:14.760
No, the fundamental reason is the data localization.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.000
You know, we consider it's your sovereign

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
as long as the data is in a place

28:19.000 --> 28:21.320
where you can send the police and take it, right?

28:21.320 --> 28:22.880
I make it really short.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.720
But, you know, like this is why company,

28:25.720 --> 28:28.040
country like Russia or China or others,

28:28.040 --> 28:29.520
have regulation that obliges

28:29.520 --> 28:31.040
the data to be on site,

28:31.040 --> 28:32.880
because at some point you're most sovereign

28:32.880 --> 28:34.680
if you can knock at the door, right?

28:34.680 --> 28:35.520
No.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.840
And ask a backdoor.

28:37.840 --> 28:39.160
Yeah, be good.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.160
Thank you very much.

28:40.160 --> 28:41.000
Thank you.

28:41.000 --> 28:41.840
Thank you.
