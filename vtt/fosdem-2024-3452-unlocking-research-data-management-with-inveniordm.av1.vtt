00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Thank you.

00:05.000 --> 00:28.080
Hello, everyone.

00:28.080 --> 00:33.480
My name is Karolina, and together with Havi today, we will tell you about how

00:33.480 --> 00:37.880
Invinio-RDM is unlocking research data management.

00:37.880 --> 00:43.280
But before we start, I would like to ask you if you see any connection between

00:43.280 --> 00:49.080
those three images, and is anyone able to answer that quiz?

00:49.080 --> 00:52.880
And Luisa says that you have three seconds to do so.

00:52.880 --> 00:53.880
Those are cuts.

00:53.880 --> 00:54.880
Those are cuts.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.880
No, no, sorry.

00:58.880 --> 01:00.880
So what about now?

01:02.880 --> 01:03.880
Sorry?

01:05.880 --> 01:06.880
Yes, you're close.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.880
So the common, the connection between the images is that is CERN, actually, where the

01:11.880 --> 01:13.880
World Wide Web was invented.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.880
It's located in Switzerland, so fondue and chocolate.

01:17.880 --> 01:22.880
And that's because you can see the funny pictures of the Internet of the Cuts.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.880
Thanks to World Wide Web Invention.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.880
But it's not the only thing that we do at CERN.

01:28.880 --> 01:34.880
So we are housing the biggest machine in the world, the Large Hadron Collider, and many

01:34.880 --> 01:38.880
more machines which experiments are using.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.880
And also we are sharing our knowledge and welcoming visitors.

01:42.880 --> 01:48.880
So wherever you are in Geneva, Switzerland, please pay us a visit.

01:48.880 --> 01:52.880
We do much more than only physics at CERN.

01:52.880 --> 01:58.880
So we do also open source projects, like, for example, the World Wide Web, that it was

01:58.880 --> 02:00.880
given back to the public.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.880
But that's not the only one.

02:02.880 --> 02:06.880
And this is what we are talking about today.

02:06.880 --> 02:13.880
So it's Zenodo, which I have been told that some of you know already, but you probably

02:13.880 --> 02:16.880
don't know what's in VINIA-RDM.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.880
But I will start with Zenodo.

02:19.880 --> 02:26.880
So Zenodo is an old-purpose research repository that any researcher around the world can just

02:26.880 --> 02:30.880
go and store their research results for free.

02:30.880 --> 02:35.880
And it is hosted there at CERN as long as CERN exists.

02:35.880 --> 02:39.880
So the question is, why do we need such a place?

02:39.880 --> 02:41.880
And this is the answer.

02:41.880 --> 02:48.880
So very important, up to plus, the crucial scientific data, many years of research work

02:48.880 --> 02:49.880
inside.

02:49.880 --> 02:54.880
Well, we don't want to allow this to happen ever again.

02:54.880 --> 02:59.880
So we provide a safe space for storing data for the researchers.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.880
But not only researchers.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.880
We have also integration with GitHub.

03:03.880 --> 03:07.880
So you can cite your software, stored in GitHub.

03:07.880 --> 03:14.880
And what's the advantage of storing it also in Zenodo is that GitHub allows you to delete

03:14.880 --> 03:19.880
your software, but it will be preserved in Zenodo.

03:19.880 --> 03:25.880
And we have received many questions about the platform, if it's possible, to take it

03:25.880 --> 03:28.880
and install it as it is in another institution.

03:28.880 --> 03:31.880
So up to a point, it was not possible.

03:31.880 --> 03:38.880
But we have received so many questions that in the end, we have developed another platform,

03:38.880 --> 03:43.880
which is InvinioRDM, now the engine of Zenodo.

03:43.880 --> 03:52.880
Now it is possible to easily upgrade the software, install a new version, and we are basically

03:52.880 --> 03:54.880
supporting the underlying engine.

03:54.880 --> 04:00.880
So, Havi, if you were to characterize InvinioRDM with one word, what would you say?

04:00.880 --> 04:02.880
That's a good question.

04:02.880 --> 04:05.880
So you have to use one word, I would say, that InvinioRDM is fair.

04:05.880 --> 04:10.880
And when we talk about the concept of fairness, I'd like to quote our former director general,

04:10.880 --> 04:13.880
San Roth-Litter, who once said, why do I like Zenodo?

04:13.880 --> 04:18.880
Because Zenodo is fair, fair in the sense of lower case and fair in the sense of upper case.

04:18.880 --> 04:25.880
The most conventional use of fairness, which was already covered by this first part of the presentation,

04:25.880 --> 04:27.880
is like equitable or just.

04:27.880 --> 04:32.880
Now let's see how InvinioRDM embraces and promotes the fair principles that are,

04:32.880 --> 04:38.880
that is an acronym that stands for Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Redusability.

04:38.880 --> 04:43.880
So starting with the first one about Findability, when we upload our research,

04:43.880 --> 04:48.880
one of the key things is that we want to have a link that we will make sure that it will resolve over time,

04:48.880 --> 04:50.880
that it's not going to be broken.

04:50.880 --> 04:54.880
And for that purpose, we have DOIs, which is a digital object identifier,

04:55.880 --> 04:59.880
which is a globally unique and persistent identifier.

04:59.880 --> 05:02.880
We encourage people to use their own DOIs if they have one,

05:02.880 --> 05:09.880
otherwise there will be one automatically generated and registered using, registered in data site.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.880
It's as important to have a nice metadata.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.880
That's why we adopted the data site metadata schema, which is simple,

05:17.880 --> 05:24.880
yet a powerful format to describe nearly any research output, data sets, software,

05:24.880 --> 05:29.880
as she mentioned, journal, papers, anything you can think of.

05:29.880 --> 05:34.880
And of course, to find out all this data, we need a good search engine with capabilities,

05:34.880 --> 05:39.880
such as filtering options or search variations or powerful query syntax

05:39.880 --> 05:42.880
that will allow you to find the data even without the identifier.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.880
So these are key aspects, not only for humans to find data, but also machines.

05:46.880 --> 05:51.880
So if we continue about accessibility, a very common use case is that we have our data

05:51.880 --> 05:56.880
and we want to keep it restricted, but we want still people to find the data.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.880
For that purpose, you will make your metadata public,

05:59.880 --> 06:05.880
and if people want to access the data, they will have to request access via a simple form,

06:05.880 --> 06:08.880
and then you can choose if you want to grant access or not.

06:08.880 --> 06:12.880
In the same way, you can also share different links with different permissions levels

06:12.880 --> 06:17.880
that will allow people to view the record and the non-pullished versions

06:17.880 --> 06:21.880
or even edit to make collaboration easier.

06:21.880 --> 06:26.880
Now if we talk about interoperability, one key thing is to follow standards.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.880
That's why we follow the one I mentioned, the data site metadata schema,

06:30.880 --> 06:33.880
which includes things like common vocabularies,

06:34.880 --> 06:38.880
which will allow us to have the same concepts to describe data

06:38.880 --> 06:41.880
as other people do and other machines do,

06:41.880 --> 06:44.880
so that we make sure that everyone will understand it in the same way.

06:44.880 --> 06:48.880
Another important thing is that when we upload our work,

06:48.880 --> 06:52.880
we have to link it properly with other data that is also uploaded,

06:52.880 --> 06:54.880
and you can do it very easily as well.

06:54.880 --> 06:57.880
And if we talk about how machines exchange data,

06:57.880 --> 07:02.880
we also provide a strong REST API that allows you to build your own data,

07:02.880 --> 07:05.880
build your own integrations of top of the Miner-DM,

07:05.880 --> 07:07.880
and we also have an integrated YPMH server,

07:07.880 --> 07:12.880
which is a standard in how systems exchange data.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.880
If we talk about the reusability, I think one of the key aspects is that

07:16.880 --> 07:19.880
when people use our work, we want them to cite it correctly.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.880
So here you have different styles of citation that will always include a DUI.

07:23.880 --> 07:27.880
The DUI is very important also to track the impact of your work.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.880
If you remember, she talked about software citation.

07:30.880 --> 07:35.880
We know that 85% of all software citation is on Senado.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.880
And of course, having also a clear licensing information,

07:38.880 --> 07:44.880
it's also important so that people know how they can use your data under what conditions.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.880
And I want again to stress a little bit on the metadata,

07:48.880 --> 07:51.880
so having a rich and comprehensive metadata is very important

07:51.880 --> 07:53.880
not only for people to reuse their data,

07:53.880 --> 07:57.880
but maybe for people to also reproduce it in the future.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.880
And since we are talking about the reusability,

07:59.880 --> 08:02.880
do you think there is something else that we can reuse?

08:04.880 --> 08:08.880
Yes, we can reuse the whole software entirely.

08:08.880 --> 08:14.880
So these are examples of how InvinioRDM was reused with other institutions,

08:14.880 --> 08:18.880
with our other partners, and as you can see, it's very customizable.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.880
Those interfaces are very different from each other,

08:21.880 --> 08:26.880
so it's quite flexible if you would like to join this sizable community,

08:26.880 --> 08:28.880
that it's still growing.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.880
We have many partners around the world.

08:31.880 --> 08:36.880
And if you would like to install an institutional repository,

08:36.880 --> 08:41.880
also in your institution, you can get to know more about InvinioRDM

08:41.880 --> 08:44.880
under this QR code on the right side.

08:44.880 --> 08:49.880
Also, you could pass by our booth, it's in the building K, floor 2,

08:49.880 --> 08:54.880
floor 2nd, and if you are a developer who would like to contribute

08:54.880 --> 08:59.880
to Open Source Project, you can check out our community on Discord as well.

08:59.880 --> 09:04.880
We answer questions, and you can see also a growing community there.

09:04.880 --> 09:06.880
So thank you very much.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.880
So are there any questions?

09:19.880 --> 09:21.880
Thank you very much for the talk.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.880
I already know it, and I like it, by the way.

09:24.880 --> 09:27.880
But I have only one specific question for the...

09:27.880 --> 09:36.880
You also said, you have plans to support the process with mixed licenses.

09:36.880 --> 09:40.880
Software is usually not just one license,

09:40.880 --> 09:44.880
there's a lot of SPDX expressions or something like that.

09:44.880 --> 09:50.880
Okay, I will just repeat the question for the stream.

09:50.880 --> 09:54.880
So we also were told that it's like our repository,

09:54.880 --> 09:56.880
I think that's worth to mention.

09:56.880 --> 10:01.880
So the question was, if we plan to provide more licenses,

10:01.880 --> 10:05.880
so I think we were very fast here on the slide.

10:05.880 --> 10:09.880
There are already many standard licenses that you can find,

10:09.880 --> 10:14.880
and they're available, but also it can be customized.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.880
So whatever license you need, you can add to the software.

10:20.880 --> 10:28.880
If there are more licenses, you have a data file under CC4, CC by 4,

10:28.880 --> 10:30.880
and draft code under MIT,

10:30.880 --> 10:35.880
so then you cannot simply say from the outside this is only MIT or CC by,

10:35.880 --> 10:41.880
so then you need a list or CC by and MIT or something.

10:41.880 --> 10:46.880
Okay, you mean if there are multiple values for the licenses attached to one record,

10:46.880 --> 10:48.880
do I understand correctly?

10:49.880 --> 10:52.880
Okay, if I remember correctly, it was no?

10:52.880 --> 10:54.880
You can have multiple licenses.

10:57.880 --> 11:02.880
Yes, so you can have multiple licenses, but you cannot map it one to one.

11:02.880 --> 11:06.880
You cannot say for the file is this license and for the metadata is this license,

11:06.880 --> 11:08.880
so it's not there.

11:09.880 --> 11:11.880
Okay, thank you.

11:18.880 --> 11:24.880
I think the question is, if I archive the software in Zenodo,

11:24.880 --> 11:30.880
how long does the software is preserved in Zenodo?

11:30.880 --> 11:36.880
So the question was for how long is the software preserved in Zenodo?

11:36.880 --> 11:42.880
So the answer is as long as we have data center at CERN,

11:42.880 --> 11:44.880
as long as CERN exists.

11:44.880 --> 11:53.880
Okay, but what is the commitment of CERN in order to organize in terms of how long it will last?

11:53.880 --> 11:57.880
Well, in terms of contract, can I?

11:58.880 --> 12:03.880
Well, for now we say forever, but let's see what future holds.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.880
We'll see if the sun goes out.

12:05.880 --> 12:06.880
Sorry?

12:06.880 --> 12:08.880
We'll see if the sun goes out.

12:08.880 --> 12:09.880
Yes.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.880
Hello.

12:12.880 --> 12:25.880
I am, sorry, out of those compared to other data in photos at CERN,

12:25.880 --> 12:30.880
is it more specified for scientists' researches?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.880
Or...

12:32.880 --> 12:38.880
So what I think the question is,

12:38.880 --> 12:44.880
is that if it's targeted on one area,

12:44.880 --> 12:48.880
that's this what you meant, of research whatsoever?

12:48.880 --> 12:49.880
Yes.

12:49.880 --> 12:55.880
So it is not targeted, because it's very, like we said, it's reusable.

12:55.880 --> 13:02.880
So we have, for example, universities also installing the software

13:02.880 --> 13:05.880
and keeping it as institutional repositories,

13:05.880 --> 13:08.880
but these universities might differ in the domain.

13:08.880 --> 13:14.880
So it might be, for example, Northwestern University, but then they host many domains.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.880
They do a lot of research.

13:16.880 --> 13:25.880
We have also installations at CERN, like one is an ODA and one an internal one,

13:25.880 --> 13:30.880
an institutional repository, which we are in the process of migration right now

13:30.880 --> 13:33.880
to upgrade the version of the software.

13:33.880 --> 13:41.880
But I can also, like, come back to hear there are much more many usages.

13:41.880 --> 13:45.880
So it's not targeted to simple domain.

13:45.880 --> 13:46.880
Okay.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.880
Next time again, there's another theme.

13:48.880 --> 13:49.880
Thank you.
