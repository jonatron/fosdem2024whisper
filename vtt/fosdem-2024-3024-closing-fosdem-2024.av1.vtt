WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.520
Finally, so if you're leaving, please do so quietly.

00:10.520 --> 00:12.600
It's horrendously loud up front.

00:12.600 --> 00:18.800
Also, if you're still talking, please stop.

00:18.800 --> 00:19.560
Thank you.

00:19.560 --> 00:23.760
So this is over, finally.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.040
It is, as they say, a wrap.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.080
And yes, I love this picture.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.200
You're going to see this every single year.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.160
OK, is this better for you?

00:32.160 --> 00:32.760
Oh, OK.

00:32.760 --> 00:33.760
Thank you.

00:33.760 --> 00:34.260
Yeah.

00:34.260 --> 00:34.760
Yeah.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.260
Yeah.

00:35.260 --> 00:35.760
Yeah.

00:35.760 --> 00:36.260
Yeah.

00:36.260 --> 00:36.760
Yeah.

00:36.760 --> 00:37.260
Yeah.

00:39.760 --> 00:44.960
OK, so yeah, it is another year done.

00:44.960 --> 00:45.960
It is a wrap.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.440
And yes, I'm going to show you this picture

00:47.440 --> 00:48.160
every single year.

00:51.480 --> 00:53.840
To talk about stuff, again, you'll

00:53.840 --> 00:57.120
find a lot of really good content, good conversations,

00:57.120 --> 00:58.520
link to all the slides.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.160
If you're a speaker, also talk about your stuff.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.520
Put summaries off your deaf room, the small, the big stories.

01:04.520 --> 01:07.000
Put stuff onto Macedon.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.400
As several people know, there is only one social media network,

01:10.400 --> 01:12.720
which is relevant during FOSSTEM.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.800
And it's the open source one.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.360
And it's super awesome.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.000
Yeah, also, oh, yeah, I need to take a picture.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.160
Good thing that I took this note.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.640
You'll find this picture if you want to wave or anything.

01:22.640 --> 01:23.400
Now is a good chance.

01:23.760 --> 01:27.280
I'll also not make this one blurry this time.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.480
And this one.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.160
And now we're done.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.160
Thank you.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.760
So you'll find those later.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.480
And also use it.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.120
Yes.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.640
Slide correction about conference size.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.800
I have been approached about, I stated

01:39.800 --> 01:41.960
we are the largest open source conference on Earth.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.880
And this is not precisely correct.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.840
By the amount of talks and everything,

01:45.840 --> 01:47.920
and by the amount of tracks which we have in parallel,

01:47.920 --> 01:50.560
we are the largest conference on Earth, not just open source.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.600
Like the largest conference on Earth.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.200
Not just open source, like the largest, period.

01:54.200 --> 01:56.440
Which is pretty nice.

01:56.440 --> 01:59.160
Largest conference on Earth, period.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.240
Yeah.

02:00.240 --> 02:01.240
Yeah.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.240
Yeah.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.680
Yeah.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
Yeah.

02:04.680 --> 02:05.680
Yeah.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.680
Yeah.

02:06.680 --> 02:07.680
Yeah.

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
Yeah.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.680
Yeah.

02:09.680 --> 02:10.680
Yeah.

02:10.680 --> 02:11.680
Yeah.

02:11.680 --> 02:12.680
Yeah.

02:12.680 --> 02:13.680
Yeah.

02:13.680 --> 02:14.680
Yeah.

02:14.680 --> 02:15.680
Yeah.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.680
Yeah.

02:16.680 --> 02:17.680
Yeah.

02:17.680 --> 02:18.680
Yeah.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.680
Yeah.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.680
Yeah.

02:20.680 --> 02:21.680
Yeah.

02:21.680 --> 02:29.680
If you have old shirts from Fostom or Ostom or other projects or whatever, bring them next year.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.680
If they are too tight or too loose, still ideally bring them the older the better.

02:34.680 --> 02:40.680
We are going to figure something out. We don't know what, but we'll probably do something on Sunday next year.

02:40.680 --> 02:47.680
So bring your old stuff and share it with your friends and like get as much old stuff as you possibly have.

02:48.680 --> 02:59.680
If you have anything or if you do not have anything anymore, we have as always a lost and found in K at the Infodesk.

02:59.680 --> 03:05.680
I haven't been able to get the information until when we have it, but we probably have it until like 10-ish I guess.

03:05.680 --> 03:14.680
But the sooner the better. So if you lost anything, I saw a helmet, I saw some notebook and other stuff.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.680
Just go there and see if we have your stuff because we would like to return it to you.

03:18.680 --> 03:27.680
If you have feedback, please send it to feedback at FostomOrc. We do read everything and by we, I mean every one of us reads pretty much everything.

03:27.680 --> 03:34.680
Keep it light on the crazy stuff, but other than this we like reading your feedback. Good, negative, anything in between.

03:34.680 --> 03:40.680
Some video stats. Our peak outgoing video was 5 gigabits.

03:40.680 --> 03:46.680
Still hosted off-site. Next year we are planning to pull this on-site because now we have the bandwidth and the redundancy.

03:46.680 --> 03:50.680
And yes, it's super loud if you talk in the audience, so please stop. Thank you.

03:50.680 --> 04:01.680
We had a total of 27 concurrent streams going out of the conference at all times and we peaked at 2,200 concurrent viewers.

04:01.680 --> 04:07.680
And the unique viewers are too low, but they're too low. They're like 5,000 or something.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.680
Sorry, I was there too low. I messed up the slide. Sorry.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.680
The stats in small is what you already had from last time.

04:16.680 --> 04:23.680
As of 1300 UTC, roughly those are the stats of the review system.

04:23.680 --> 04:29.680
As you can see that those numbers went earlier, I got tricked into also harrowing to some extent the things.

04:29.680 --> 04:33.680
So I had three talks in a row. This is why the numbers are earlier.

04:33.680 --> 04:40.680
The point is if you are a speaker or a deaf room manager, please, please, please, please, please with sugar on top.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.680
You get those emails, do not ignore them.

04:43.680 --> 04:50.680
We rely on you to actually cut your own video because we cannot possibly cut all of this video ourselves.

04:50.680 --> 04:56.680
The last time we tried this, it took us into the summer to actually cut all the video. Please crowdsource this.

04:56.680 --> 05:03.680
If you get those emails, do not ignore them. Work through them and help us cut your stuff.

05:03.680 --> 05:06.680
We can upload your content much earlier.

05:06.680 --> 05:10.680
You did all the work for the presentation for deaf room. Please do not ignore this work.

05:10.680 --> 05:15.680
Some are really awesome about this and some completely ignored. Please do not ignore it.

05:15.680 --> 05:24.680
Matrix stats. Again, as of this afternoon sometime, we had 2300 users this time in the matrix space.

05:24.680 --> 05:30.680
As you can see, the numbers go low, which is kind of stents to reason because this phosem is definitely larger than last year's.

05:30.680 --> 05:36.680
Obviously, the remote component is going down with more people on site again.

05:36.680 --> 05:46.680
We almost sold out as of this afternoon, I believe. We completely sold out, but I am not quite certain.

05:46.680 --> 05:54.680
You ate a lot of food. The free cookies which were given out this year did not have a GDPR by now.

05:54.680 --> 05:59.680
Maybe we need to improve this next year.

05:59.680 --> 06:05.680
Network stats. Again, those numbers are relatively useless.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.680
They are only a rough indication because of privacy extensions.

06:08.680 --> 06:15.680
We used to be able to deduce amount of visitors from this because we did photos and we calculated how many people did have their laptops out.

06:15.680 --> 06:22.680
Every person won one's phone. We could deduce roughly the amount of visitors, but with privacy extension, this has gone away.

06:22.680 --> 06:29.680
As the different operating systems have different timings for the privacy extensions, and we do not know what operating systems you are all using,

06:29.680 --> 06:34.680
we can't even roughly deduce this based on statistics.

06:34.680 --> 06:39.680
The main thing is, it is significantly more than last year.

06:39.680 --> 06:44.680
The main thing is, I think everyone who was here last year sees the same.

06:44.680 --> 06:49.680
We are actually coming back to a real in-person, which is super nice to see.

06:49.680 --> 06:59.680
We had some fun things, like for example the very smelly room, which you don't want to spend a lot of time in, which we called the operating center or the knock.

06:59.680 --> 07:04.680
We left the door open and we literally had water running down.

07:04.680 --> 07:09.680
Actually, this container was half full by the time and this is my foot.

07:09.680 --> 07:16.680
Just to show you that not everything is going right with large conferences, I will spare you pictures of all the overflowing toilets,

07:16.680 --> 07:21.680
but you probably saw how we closed things off on it again.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.680
Oh, I forgot to include this picture.

07:23.680 --> 07:33.680
Also, we had the free cat people and they designed a key, which the Prusa people printed, which we could use to open all the towel holders.

07:33.680 --> 07:38.680
We actually get more towels into the toilets. This is why you could try your hands.

07:38.680 --> 07:51.680
Some of you will have seen or will have noticed that we had a power cut in part of the K building.

07:51.680 --> 07:53.680
Again, please stop talking.

07:53.680 --> 08:02.680
Some of you will have noticed that there was a power cut in K, which impacted quite a few of the stands which we had.

08:03.680 --> 08:11.680
We narrowed it down over time. Initially, we had a ladder to come up and then I just stood there with a broom and just popped the breaker back in.

08:11.680 --> 08:18.680
We just started isolating bits and pieces of the daisy chain of power strips until we found the short circuit.

08:18.680 --> 08:25.680
It's just part of what makes a conference run, in which thankfully, none of the people here actually see happen.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.680
It just magically works.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.680
Also, if you are a speaker,

08:35.680 --> 08:42.680
and if anyone wires you up with one of those lapel mix, they do cost money.

08:42.680 --> 08:52.680
Also, if you go away, not on purpose, and you still have them, yes, we noticed, but this basically means we scramble and we send someone running after you.

08:52.680 --> 08:56.680
Please, for the future, try and remember to return your mic.

08:56.680 --> 09:03.680
It would be nice. It makes less panic, because those are expensive and we have to pay for them if they go missing.

09:03.680 --> 09:12.680
If you want to make donations, you can still do this, because for those who don't know, we try to limit the amount of corporate sponsorship which we are taking,

09:12.680 --> 09:16.680
but I heard we are going to take some money from you, I think.

09:16.680 --> 09:21.680
Anyway, we try to have a broad base of financing.

09:21.680 --> 09:28.680
We could easily go with corporate sponsors for all the costs which we have for running FOSDEM, but we do not want this.

09:28.680 --> 09:37.680
We want to have a broad base of financing, so at any point in time, we are not dependent on a single large sponsor or anything.

09:37.680 --> 09:49.680
There is no hard dependency from our end to keep someone happy, which is what allows us to completely separate all of the donations and everything and all of the content.

09:49.680 --> 10:01.680
You will find very few conferences which do this as aggressively and as absolutely as FOSDEM does it, and the continued donations by everyone are what make this work.

10:08.680 --> 10:18.680
Now we come to the thank yous, I might start crying as per usual.

10:18.680 --> 10:29.680
These are the first ones.

10:29.680 --> 10:40.680
These are our sponsors.

10:40.680 --> 10:48.680
We have a total of 160 deaf room managers, which is pages and pages of names.

11:11.680 --> 11:19.680
Next, that is the most important one.

11:19.680 --> 11:24.680
We are almost at a thousand speakers and maybe we are going to break this next time.

11:24.680 --> 11:30.680
It would be nice for 2025 for 25 years, so those are all the names.

11:40.680 --> 12:06.680
Thank you.

12:06.680 --> 12:10.680
Then we have a total of 173 names volunteers.

12:36.680 --> 12:47.680
Just to be clear, there are a lot of people who just have around the edges or take some trash with them or whatever.

12:47.680 --> 13:00.680
There is more than this.

13:00.680 --> 13:08.680
Those are ourselves.

13:08.680 --> 13:23.680
I forgot to thank you, because you also all make FOSDEM happen, so thank you.

13:23.680 --> 13:29.680
Again, three talks in a row, this was rushed.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.680
Please help us.

13:32.680 --> 13:36.680
Take a look around you if you see any trash.

13:36.680 --> 13:40.680
Congratulations, it's yours now.

13:40.680 --> 13:47.680
Bring it to the next trash bin or anything, because if you don't do it, one of the volunteers or the staff are going to do it.

13:47.680 --> 14:00.680
If you have more time, it would be great if you could just come down to here after the whole thing.

14:00.680 --> 14:05.680
We will collect you, give you brooms, gloves, everything and tell you what to do.

14:05.680 --> 14:12.680
As per usual, any of the network cabling which you remove under our guidance, you can keep.

14:12.680 --> 14:20.680
We are going to have a common feeding session when we are done, roughly between 10 and 12 o'clock.

14:20.680 --> 14:28.680
Anyone who stays to the end, we have plenty of food to thank you in a more direct way for helping us clean up.

14:28.680 --> 14:37.680
I have a kidney thing, and also my knee is kind of broken, so I can't do the FOSDEM dance.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.680
Who volunteers to do the FOSDEM dance, if you know what the FOSDEM dance is?

14:41.680 --> 14:47.680
We have probably enough people, I need someone to volunteer.

14:47.680 --> 14:51.680
No? Come on, come on.

14:51.680 --> 14:58.680
Someone? Anyone? No? I can explain it to you, but you have to do it.

14:58.680 --> 15:08.680
No? Yeah? No? Too late, too late.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.680
Okay, we have one, perfect.

15:11.680 --> 15:18.680
So, we also need more volunteers. So anyone who is a volunteer, anyone who is a speaker, anyone who is a deaf room manager, anyone who is deaf,

15:18.680 --> 15:33.680
please come up front A for a round of applause and B for the FOSDEM dance.

15:33.680 --> 15:37.680
You don't have microphone beauties anymore, you can just come.

15:37.680 --> 15:41.680
I see a staffer who is trying to hide.

15:41.680 --> 15:51.680
Come on, come on.

15:51.680 --> 15:59.680
So, if you are using this chance to leave, then please do so quietly for the few who do.

15:59.680 --> 16:04.680
Yeah, you can explain it.

16:04.680 --> 16:09.680
Yeah, just from what I remember from all those years, you just start on one feet.

16:09.680 --> 16:18.680
You go on one leg, you just go like so until you go crazy.

16:18.680 --> 16:32.680
Thank you all.

16:32.680 --> 16:53.680
Yeah, thank you and see you next year.

17:02.680 --> 17:12.680
Thank you.
