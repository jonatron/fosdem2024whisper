Hello everyone. So today I'm here to talk about ARC. We'll see that, but more of that

00:14.440 --> 00:22.680
in a minute. So about myself, so my name is Robin. I'm an open source and Frank Zappa

00:22.680 --> 00:29.640
enthusiast. Maybe these things are related, I'm not sure. Actually in a previous career

00:29.640 --> 00:40.400
I was a sound engineer in Brussels and now I went to software. It took some time. And

00:40.400 --> 00:47.160
I took over the maintenance of ARC since 2021. Actually this project was created by Drew

00:47.160 --> 00:56.000
DeVolves. I'm assuming some of you know who that guy is. And there was a question about

00:56.120 --> 01:06.240
how do you pronounce this thing? So who cares? It's not, I mean. So Drew pronounces it with

01:06.240 --> 01:16.320
his American accent, orc. In French we say, and I've asked an Hungarian guy, he said,

01:16.320 --> 01:30.240
we say, I guess you can choose. As long as it's more or less the same. So what is it? It's

01:30.240 --> 01:38.080
actually an email client that's running in your terminal. Like very similar to mutt or

01:38.160 --> 01:47.200
pine, alpine. There's even a melly or melly, I don't know how to pronounce that. It covers a large

01:47.760 --> 01:53.840
span of protocols. I don't think there's a standard protocol that we don't support yet.

01:55.840 --> 02:01.920
One of these features which is kind of unique is that you can have multiple tabs. So when you're

02:01.920 --> 02:08.160
using mutt starting to compose, you actually, the editor takes over the terminal and you are stuck.

02:08.160 --> 02:14.720
You cannot browse your other emails or watch the original email while replying. You can do that

02:14.720 --> 02:22.000
with ARC. Also you can have VIM style commands and key binings. You can compose in VIM and

02:22.000 --> 02:30.080
view your emails in less. There's an account configuration wizard. I'm speeding up because

02:30.080 --> 02:37.280
I'm seeing the timer. One unique feature is the filters. There's an example just after.

02:37.280 --> 02:45.760
You can control it with install scripts. Actually you have a virtual terminal embedded into ARC.

02:45.760 --> 02:52.160
So you can start shells, edit or whatever is running in the terminal. You can run it into

02:52.240 --> 03:01.200
ARC in a frame or in a new tab. It has been designed with email contribution in mind.

03:01.200 --> 03:07.360
So you can actually apply patches from emails directly without using GitHub or anything else.

03:07.360 --> 03:15.360
So it's like the Linux kernel. They use that way. It's a short demo. I don't know if anyone in the

03:15.360 --> 03:23.680
back can see well. So this is a short presentation where you can, so this is just plain text.

03:24.960 --> 03:33.840
You can also have, you can visualize patches and with via filters you can colorize things. So it

03:33.840 --> 03:42.720
looks like a patch. You can also view HTML in plain text via filters as well. And you can see

03:42.720 --> 03:52.560
also images with filters. Soon we'll actually add also a way to visualize real images using the

03:52.560 --> 03:58.080
SIG cells and KT extensions. So if you have a modern terminal you'd be able to

03:59.040 --> 04:07.280
really visualize images without the hyper pixelated way. And yeah, anyway, so here I'm just running

04:07.280 --> 04:15.440
a terminal and you can just run anything you want. There's no problem. Okay, so what are filters?

04:16.160 --> 04:22.480
Filters are just, you define per mime type, so text plane and then you define a command. And you

04:22.480 --> 04:30.400
can use it to do a bunch of various things. So you pipe a message by part into a command, then

04:30.400 --> 04:38.080
into a pager which gets rendered. And these are small examples. So anyway, you can just,

04:38.720 --> 04:48.080
we have a lot of examples in the man pages. And 017 just got released this week. So if you want

04:48.080 --> 04:56.240
to check it out, please do. And please give us some feedback on the mailing list. And that's

04:56.240 --> 05:07.360
what I have. So thank you. Thank you very much. Short question, which probably language is used?

05:08.400 --> 05:13.680
It's written in Golan. Golan. Okay. All right. Any questions?

05:16.240 --> 05:21.440
Do you use server-side search in, for example, Jmap or IMAP, or do you rely on your entire mail

05:21.440 --> 05:26.960
history being synced to the local disk? No, it's all server-side except when you're using a not-much

05:26.960 --> 05:39.360
or mail-deer backend. So server-side. Yeah. Right. Questions? Yes, one, two. Yeah, this inspires

05:39.360 --> 05:46.240
my next question. What about any kind of optimizations for the indexes and searches for local files?

05:46.720 --> 05:53.280
And so we have, if you're having your mail local, you can use not-much to index your

05:53.280 --> 06:01.120
mails and search. And if you're using IMAP or Jmap, usually the servers have the indexes.

06:01.120 --> 06:08.320
So you can, the searches are pretty fast most of the time. And we currently, if you're just

06:08.320 --> 06:15.600
using plain mail-deer, you don't have any index speedup. Maybe we were thinking about

06:16.640 --> 06:23.760
running a not-much, you know, hidden into ERC to speed up the searches, but I don't know.

06:23.760 --> 06:31.200
We were still wondering what to do with that. Yeah. Thanks for your talk. So the last time I

06:31.200 --> 06:38.880
tried to use ERC, my IMAP and STP, I do SSH forwarding. So they are ports and local hosts.

06:38.880 --> 06:44.960
And then the certificate work, and I had to apply patches. I can't use Go. I don't

06:44.960 --> 06:50.080
can't rebase Go patches because I don't know anything about Go. And is that, yeah,

06:50.080 --> 06:55.520
is that something that you want to support? Or is... Are you using Proton mail or anything?

06:55.520 --> 07:02.240
No, it's at my works mail. Okay. And so is it a self-signed certificate or...

07:04.560 --> 07:10.240
An internal domain that I can't access from outside. I need to SSH and then it's a certificate,

07:10.240 --> 07:16.880
but for local hosts at my side. Okay. And maybe you can install the certificates in your CA

07:17.440 --> 07:24.240
certificate store local or something like that. Maybe we could do something in ARC mit.

07:25.680 --> 07:31.520
It feels like this is TLS stuff, which is out of our hands.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.040
Yeah, I don't think so. Okay. Yeah.

07:39.040 --> 07:43.120
If there's a variable you can use a set before you start the application to ignore...

07:43.120 --> 07:47.520
Go looks at a different place for your certificates. So if you only talk to this one host...

07:47.520 --> 07:53.840
Oh, maybe, yeah. Yeah, we could do that or we could say ignore invalid certificates, but I don't know.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.920
I'm more comfortable with installing the certificate in the global bundle so that,

07:57.920 --> 08:01.600
yeah, then you don't have to hack into anything and it will work.

08:03.440 --> 08:07.680
All right. Have a look at NK3rd, the greatest open source. Yeah.

08:11.280 --> 08:15.360
There's a question from the internet from Moritz. Does the account with do autoconfig?

08:17.200 --> 08:22.560
All right. Yeah, so there's a very basic autoconfig based on DNS server entries.

08:24.080 --> 08:32.640
But not all providers actually do provide server entries and Moritz is currently submitting a patch

08:32.640 --> 08:42.240
series to improve that autoconfig stuff. Yeah. Very subtle. Nice. Just one last thing.

08:43.360 --> 08:50.720
There was one guy who actually reported an issue during FOSDEM because the FOSDEM Wi-Fi only gives

08:50.720 --> 08:58.160
you an IPv6 address and we had a bug in IMAP where we actually resolved only the IPv4.

08:59.520 --> 09:04.800
Anyway, it's fixed, pushed, and yeah. FOSDEM works. Yeah. Thank you again. Thank you.
