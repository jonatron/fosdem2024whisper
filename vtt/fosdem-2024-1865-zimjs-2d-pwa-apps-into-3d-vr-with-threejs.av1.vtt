00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
Hello. Hello, Europe. Welcome to FOSDEM 2024. I am Carlo Roestel and I want to explain ZIM.

00:18.000 --> 00:28.660
ZIM JavaScript is a new way of coding creativity for kids who wants to type and not drag blocks.

00:28.660 --> 00:43.660
We can do different things. I will explain you the version 014, the version 015 and we launched this January two weeks ago, number 16.

00:43.660 --> 00:53.660
So let's enjoy the new tablet apps creating online. ZIM is created by Dan Zenn.

00:53.660 --> 01:04.660
You see a little man at the left side. He's from Canada and his name is Dan Zenn, but his alias is Dr. Abstract.

01:04.660 --> 01:14.660
And I am Carlo from Belgium and I created my own signature ZIM Salabim, the magic of code. Let's start.

01:14.660 --> 01:25.660
So this year ZIM already exists 10 years. So if you go to ZIM's history, you can see different versions. You can click on.

01:25.660 --> 01:45.660
So we now launched speech. Everybody is talking about AI, but we can now show you Happy New Year. It's okay, February, but still we can say Happy New Year to everybody.

01:45.660 --> 02:00.660
When we launch an app, here you have the possibility to see the promo for the app, the full version at the right side, the editor to see the code and to view the app in the online editor.

02:00.660 --> 02:18.660
So I'm going to give you a promo in the full version. So click on the button of the computer. You see an animation of the hand. It's a GIF. You can import into an HTML canvas and the computer should talk.

02:18.660 --> 02:32.660
If you click on it. So here it's a computer voice speaking, but you can choose wherever sound of the computer is active. Speak.

02:33.660 --> 02:58.660
This is Dutch. The language Dutch. I speak Dutch. So we are 10 years old. So we celebrate with this FOSDEM edition. I'm happy I can give you some information. I was here a year before also.

02:58.660 --> 03:12.660
But we now have the new ZIM forum. A little applause because we always work into the Slack version. So if you have problems or questions for ZIM, please contact ZIM forum.

03:12.660 --> 03:37.660
There is a big team of developers helping you if you have a problem to make apps. It's a pleasure to meet us there. So how did I start with ZIM? It was Corona three years ago and I'm a teacher and I was looking for my wife who is a teacher for little people, so toddlers in school.

03:37.660 --> 03:55.660
She was making videos. And the videos, they are not interactive. So I want to make apps because I'm a graphicist. I did not have lessons into JavaScript. So I found a man. I found Frank. I found Ken Academy.

03:55.660 --> 04:11.660
But suddenly Dan Zan came up and he is the inventor of ZIM. His little crazy man, but he loves a lot of inspiring people all over the world. You can see a little introduction. This movie.

04:25.660 --> 04:38.660
I was like a little bit of that myself. Now a two time Canadian New Media Awards winner. The second time was for educator of the year. I'm a professor of interactive media at Sheridan College in Canada.

04:38.660 --> 05:04.660
The first time was the programmer of the year for my website called Dan Zan because I'm also inventor of Dan Zan. Dan Zan is a large site. He's been going since the 90s. Many games and gadgets. Tools. There's a tool called Appartica, which was the number one appart making tool in Google for 20 years.

05:05.660 --> 05:22.660
Until Flash Die. And most of the Dan Zan site was made with Flash or even directed before that. And so it's now treated as a museum. I'm well known in the physical world for dancing and fashion parties.

05:22.660 --> 05:34.660
I had a happy celebration. Here are some of the things people have to say about me. These can all be found at the front of the creativity framework.

05:34.660 --> 05:59.660
Okay, so many people are telling about him and the reviews of the website. And I'll show you some reviews. So kids want to be happy and they want to make apps. So that was my first idea. And Dan Zan helped me to create simple active apps to go with the robot up and down, for example. It's a D-pad.

05:59.660 --> 06:19.660
And you can, for example, make dialogues and the kids can animate robots and aliens, for example. So if you click on the aliens, you can move them around in space or you can move the robot left and right.

06:19.660 --> 06:38.660
So this is what kids like a lot. They want to be satisfied with 10 minutes lesson, maybe about coding. And they can make this. We have assets for children made into ZIM kits slate. That's a new way of programming for kids.

06:38.660 --> 06:53.660
So also we have a hero sensor inside the RG. Here's him. Mobile device and we tilt the device. Also the robot can tilt left or right.

06:53.660 --> 07:14.660
And in 2023 we have results and no time is set. Frank Loss. So Frank Loss is somebody in the known physical world for game making with JavaScript. He made space inventors.

07:15.660 --> 07:30.660
And I was asking Dan, can we make also retro games? It's fun for kids also. But with the knowledge Dan gave me, I could use the information of Frank Loss and he is talking about ZIM that it's really fun.

07:30.660 --> 07:55.660
And fun is a factor for me to start exploring ZIM. Even videos in five minutes you can explore. So for example Angry Birds, if you want that, making Angry Birds a very known game. You have articles on dev.2 Angry Birds in 15 minutes. You have little videos where he's explaining how to code.

08:00.660 --> 08:29.660
So this is the intro. You see, he's really doing cool things for children. We look to other libraries also for examples and then maybe show you my example. I made on my website ZIM Salabim. You can find it there.

08:30.660 --> 08:50.660
And then you can drop and drag. So we have physics in ZIM. You can do whatever you want in ZIM. Just your imagination and you can make it. All for free and with a little help of others on the forum. It's nice to know.

08:50.660 --> 09:03.660
So for example the reviews. Thank you to ZIM. Develops. Time was quite short and a very smooth ride along a quick learning curve. So all around the world we are now.

09:03.660 --> 09:26.660
When you are a beginner intermediate or you're an expert, no problem. You can join. This is a survey so we can collect the people who are meeting us and the cat is Omi. We have given the name as Scratch has a cat. We also have our cat, the grown up, you know, the big one.

09:26.660 --> 09:31.660
Because we have to type a little introduction by then.

09:56.660 --> 10:23.660
Okay, so this is the framework ZIM slate. We a little change it.

10:23.660 --> 10:41.660
One year back it looks like this, but the main idea stays on the left side. You have the view of the app. Other outside you can code. For example, if color is white, you can use that to color the background in white.

10:42.660 --> 10:52.660
Okay, you see Harry Potter is teaching you because it's magic code, you know. Okay.

10:52.660 --> 10:54.660
We have.

10:54.660 --> 11:11.660
What is bubbling at ZIM bubbling is like what are we doing with ZIM. I'm Carl and I just had the idea to make kids happy. So I put a lot of effort each night because I also I have kids of one of five years and one of one year and eight months.

11:11.660 --> 11:29.660
So I need to measure time settings with my wife and it's very difficult because I believe in the product. It's free. It's open source and why shouldn't I invest in this beautiful website because I want to spread it to the world, you know.

11:30.660 --> 11:37.660
But I'm not alone. For example, I see games. It's from UK. They make a lot of kids apps. I'll show you.

11:39.660 --> 11:55.660
This is a website of I see games. You have math or English you can learn. You have even Dutch examples of apps. You're learning tools. This is, for example, a beautiful one. You can expand. So you have to learn the numbers.

11:56.660 --> 11:58.660
So you have to push 123.

12:08.660 --> 12:13.660
So the kids have to follow just with the finger. It's not doing anything, but the animation is made in ZIM.

12:13.660 --> 12:39.660
So I clicked the one. It's okay. There comes a star. Here we use physics so you can drag the wooden block and you have to make a bridge. So the children has to count because the one is before two and then we have the three after the two.

12:39.660 --> 12:44.660
And then we already have to running. So this is a sprite running, you know, this makes us fun for kids.

12:47.660 --> 13:04.660
So that's the idea after ZIM, but also top marks, for example, has a lot of examples for kids. If you want to be inspired as the teacher, this is like all made in ZIM, you know.

13:05.660 --> 13:14.660
So and also close up makes a lot of games. I'll show you a little further.

13:16.660 --> 13:26.660
So here we have the ZIM kids golden bar at the right side. If you go on the red side, you can click kids and then you can make the apps.

13:26.660 --> 13:37.660
But we do also VR for kids. So and we do AI. It can be imported in AI also. So here you are at the right side. You have a virtual environment.

13:38.660 --> 13:49.660
So I'll show you an example in some minutes. ZIM has also a Facebook where you can find some information. So the latest apps or post there.

13:49.660 --> 13:54.660
This is a clap lap from Israel who's making apps in ZIM.

14:19.660 --> 14:25.660
So this is the mediums of users have already played and use the products we developed this year.

14:26.660 --> 14:41.660
In the past, again, they want to take us about two months of work. Now takes us only two weeks of work. Working with ZIM is very flexible and makes it possible to work with dozens of components developed in the past.

14:41.660 --> 14:48.660
And also to develop and expand our own components and code elements that optimize the work.

14:49.660 --> 14:54.660
One of the biggest advantages of ZIM is the connection and support done and healthy.

14:55.660 --> 15:05.660
The availability and possibility of the web kind of ZIM developers and Slack or Git allows us to rely on ZIM as our main platform for development.

15:05.660 --> 15:16.660
Any question, buy or request is immediately a sensitive tool and we are very quick and we and our customers know that there is something to trust.

15:17.660 --> 15:21.660
Unlike other platforms, ZIM is constantly being updated.

15:22.660 --> 15:28.660
And every few weeks new features and innovations are released that optimize the work.

15:28.660 --> 15:36.660
Working with ZIM is easy and fast. Images, videos, samples, vector files and much more work naturally with ZIM.

15:37.660 --> 15:43.660
ZIM allows us to be present in the design and focus finishing our developments and games.

15:44.660 --> 15:49.660
The number one reason to work with ZIM is coding with ZIM is just fun.

15:50.660 --> 15:55.660
So thank you ZIM and all the team developers in ZIM. ZIM is here to stay.

15:55.660 --> 16:07.660
Okay, so I hope it's little advertisement but they also have the possibility made to tap lab to create your own game with an environment.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.660
So three games are free and the other of us you have to pay for.

16:11.660 --> 16:14.660
And I'll go to the next slide.

16:15.660 --> 16:17.660
So also the ICT games.

16:17.660 --> 16:22.660
It's not about why another ZIM is in the S when I'm in the game.

16:23.660 --> 16:25.660
And why I'm in the game.

16:26.660 --> 16:35.660
So I started 16 in the year 2000 and I wanted to make educational games to support my children from the past.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.660
On the learning objective of doing that thing and we get home.

16:39.660 --> 16:43.660
I wanted it to be free so that all children had the equal opportunity.

16:44.660 --> 16:52.660
And I originally made games in Clash and then about six years ago I was with an alternative and then ZIM.

16:53.660 --> 16:56.660
ZIM.JS which is just brilliant.

16:57.660 --> 16:59.660
So hopefully we'll see some things.

17:00.660 --> 17:03.660
So you can turn things and through this space.

17:04.660 --> 17:05.660
It's cute.

17:06.660 --> 17:10.660
And there's a mask to make it to chop off the edges, make it look like it's a mask.

17:10.660 --> 17:18.660
We've got randomly sorted shapes and words and then you can drag.

17:20.660 --> 17:28.660
And if you look at the code with this, then it breaks it up.

17:29.660 --> 17:32.660
See the grid there, climate and outfits.

17:33.660 --> 17:34.660
They describe how it works.

17:35.660 --> 17:37.660
It makes sense of what's happening.

17:38.660 --> 17:43.660
Also, I really like the documentation.

17:44.660 --> 17:45.660
It's not clear.

17:46.660 --> 17:47.660
The documentation.

17:48.660 --> 17:50.660
So we saw rectangles.

17:51.660 --> 17:52.660
We just found rectangles.

17:53.660 --> 17:54.660
I can type in something.

17:55.660 --> 17:56.660
I have a new rectangle again.

17:57.660 --> 18:01.660
So remember the themes of light in that game over there.

18:01.660 --> 18:03.660
This is all this section.

18:04.660 --> 18:05.660
This is all rectangles.

18:06.660 --> 18:13.660
These are all the powers and variables you need to make a rectangle.

18:14.660 --> 18:15.660
So you'll see.

18:16.660 --> 18:17.660
We have.

18:19.660 --> 18:24.660
We have explained the ICT man.

18:25.660 --> 18:29.660
The library has a lot of components made by ZIM and eco-appointments.

18:29.660 --> 18:34.660
You can use, for example, to make games for kids to connect lines.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.660
So many kids want to learn the numbers and connect them.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.660
And then you have an image popping up.

18:41.660 --> 18:44.660
So that was a question of me and then implemented it.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.660
So I was happy I could make games like that.

18:48.660 --> 18:49.660
So for my wife, this is the website.

18:50.660 --> 18:54.660
We have Dragon Games and matching games together.

18:55.660 --> 18:56.660
So you can visit it if you want.

18:57.660 --> 18:58.660
The slideshow is online.

18:59.660 --> 19:06.660
But now we will talk a little more about the environment where kids can make games.

19:07.660 --> 19:08.660
So it's a scene.

19:09.660 --> 19:15.660
So you have to choose for a background and some pictures.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.660
And you have to combine some pictures like the eyes on a gem.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.660
And you can then make your own creativity.

19:22.660 --> 19:27.660
So first of all, the names for a picture.

19:28.660 --> 19:29.660
We shortened it to pick.

19:30.660 --> 19:31.660
So you have a new pick.

19:32.660 --> 19:33.660
New out is audio.

19:34.660 --> 19:35.660
A video is feed.

19:36.660 --> 19:37.660
A hif is an animation.

19:38.660 --> 19:39.660
A hif is a hif.

19:40.660 --> 19:42.660
And a sfiji is a scalable vector graphic in a purple box.

19:43.660 --> 19:44.660
You have seen it.

19:45.660 --> 19:49.660
So Pragma is a little woman in the middle is the daughter of Dan Zan.

19:49.660 --> 19:54.660
And she's also helping kids programming because also girls can code of course.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.660
So it's good because also love it a lot.

19:58.660 --> 20:03.660
If you want to know how, for example, you need to make a new pick.

20:04.660 --> 20:06.660
We also have at the right side a help button.

20:07.660 --> 20:08.660
And then you see a video.

20:09.660 --> 20:15.660
So if you click the video, it then is explaining how you can work with the assets.

20:19.660 --> 20:20.660
A little explanation.

20:49.660 --> 20:51.660
So that's a little tricky.

20:52.660 --> 20:53.660
But let's try that again.

20:54.660 --> 20:55.660
Test.

20:56.660 --> 21:01.660
So no sound is playing because the user is supposed to interact with the act first.

21:02.660 --> 21:03.660
Here's what they do.

21:04.660 --> 21:05.660
Start.

21:06.660 --> 21:07.660
And now the back of the sound plays.

21:08.660 --> 21:09.660
Yay.

21:10.660 --> 21:11.660
So that's a little tricky.

21:12.660 --> 21:13.660
But.

21:14.660 --> 21:15.660
Okay.

21:15.660 --> 21:20.660
You can get to kids at kids.zinjs.org.

21:21.660 --> 21:24.660
So come on in and I'm going to show you how you can make a scene.

21:25.660 --> 21:26.660
Scroll down here.

21:27.660 --> 21:28.660
Make scenes.

21:29.660 --> 21:37.660
If you want to learn about coding, then you should be taking a look at all of these parts and trying out the handy tutorials here to work with you.

21:37.660 --> 21:39.660
But you can also make a scene in Slate.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.660
And Slate is this link right here.

21:43.660 --> 21:44.660
Or you can click.

21:45.660 --> 21:48.660
And that's a place where we can type any code that we want.

21:49.660 --> 21:50.660
Of course it needs to work.

21:51.660 --> 21:53.660
And then we can test our code over here.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.660
You may see it's starting with this demo.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.660
And then we can test our code over here.

22:00.660 --> 22:02.660
And then we can test our code over here.

22:02.660 --> 22:07.660
You may see it's starting with this demo right here.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.660
A fragment.

22:10.660 --> 22:11.660
And there's the code for that.

22:12.660 --> 22:15.660
But we want to make our own scene.

22:16.660 --> 22:17.660
And we'll do that over here.

22:18.660 --> 22:19.660
And test right now.

22:20.660 --> 22:21.660
We got nothing in it.

22:22.660 --> 22:23.660
Alright.

22:24.660 --> 22:25.660
We can add some assets.

22:26.660 --> 22:27.660
And then available up here.

22:28.660 --> 22:29.660
And if you want help on how to do that.

22:29.660 --> 22:31.660
Well, this is a help video.

22:32.660 --> 22:33.660
So hopefully this will give you help.

22:34.660 --> 22:35.660
But you can press help there.

22:36.660 --> 22:40.660
And what that does is it jumps you down to this help section right here.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.660
Where it tells you how to use the asset buttons.

22:44.660 --> 22:45.660
And it says see the video.

22:46.660 --> 22:48.660
There's a bunch of examples as well.

22:49.660 --> 22:50.660
We can add a background color.

22:51.660 --> 22:52.660
And that just adds a color.

22:53.660 --> 22:54.660
That's not really using assets.

22:55.660 --> 22:56.660
But here's adding a background image.

22:57.660 --> 22:58.660
Such as a beach.

22:59.660 --> 23:01.660
And there's adding images.

23:02.660 --> 23:03.660
Like a butterfly.

23:04.660 --> 23:05.660
We'll do that too.

23:06.660 --> 23:07.660
There's a code to be able to do that.

23:08.660 --> 23:09.660
We'll talk about that.

23:10.660 --> 23:11.660
Here we can put things into containers.

23:12.660 --> 23:13.660
And move them all together as well.

23:14.660 --> 23:15.660
So we'll take a look at that.

23:16.660 --> 23:17.660
Here's adding sounds.

23:18.660 --> 23:19.660
So that when we press on above, it plays a sound.

23:20.660 --> 23:21.660
And then here's adding a background sound.

23:22.660 --> 23:23.660
Which is a little bit tricky.

23:24.660 --> 23:26.660
Because we're really supposed to click on something in the app.

23:26.660 --> 23:27.660
Something in the app.

23:28.660 --> 23:29.660
Something in the app.

23:30.660 --> 23:31.660
Before we can play a sound.

23:32.660 --> 23:35.660
It's a sort of a polite thing that the browsers make it do.

23:36.660 --> 23:39.660
Because otherwise people would go to a page and sound would be playing right away.

23:40.660 --> 23:43.660
So that makes it a little tricky to add the code for a toggle button.

23:44.660 --> 23:45.660
As you can see.

23:46.660 --> 23:47.660
Or the start button.

23:48.660 --> 23:49.660
It's not too bad.

23:50.660 --> 23:51.660
We can actually test just fine.

23:52.660 --> 23:53.660
Nice and easily with the background sound.

23:54.660 --> 23:55.660
But that will only work because we're pressing the buttons here.

23:56.660 --> 23:57.660
If you did.

23:58.660 --> 23:59.660
In a full mode.

24:00.660 --> 24:01.660
Don't worry too much about that.

24:02.660 --> 24:04.660
Let's start before we go into the assets.

24:05.660 --> 24:07.660
Let's just show you how to change the color of this.

24:08.660 --> 24:10.660
The way you do that is you go frame.color

24:11.660 --> 24:12.660
is equal to something.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.660
Such as yellow.

24:15.660 --> 24:16.660
We have a bunch of colors.

24:17.660 --> 24:19.660
Most of the playing colors there are green.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.660
For instance, will work.

24:22.660 --> 24:23.660
And we get test.

24:24.660 --> 24:25.660
So there it is.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.660
This outer color here didn't change.

24:28.660 --> 24:29.660
It's still black.

24:30.660 --> 24:32.660
We can change that color by going frame.outer.color.

24:33.660 --> 24:34.660
Is equal to blue.

24:36.660 --> 24:37.660
Oops.

24:38.660 --> 24:39.660
That's cool.

24:40.660 --> 24:41.660
And we can test that.

24:42.660 --> 24:43.660
We may have done some other colors down.

24:44.660 --> 24:45.660
In the example.

24:46.660 --> 24:47.660
There you go.

24:48.660 --> 24:49.660
There's also a way.

24:50.660 --> 24:51.660
If you take a look at the demo.

24:52.660 --> 24:53.660
You see how that's called a gradient.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.660
And if you take a look at the code there.

24:56.660 --> 24:57.660
We made a new page.

24:58.660 --> 24:59.660
And we told it the stage would.

25:00.660 --> 25:01.660
And the same type.

25:02.660 --> 25:03.660
And we told it two different colors.

25:04.660 --> 25:05.660
We added that to the stage.

25:06.660 --> 25:07.660
So if you did that.

25:08.660 --> 25:09.660
Copy this.

25:10.660 --> 25:11.660
Copy.

25:12.660 --> 25:13.660
And paste it in here.

25:14.660 --> 25:15.660
And do a test.

25:16.660 --> 25:17.660
There it is.

25:18.660 --> 25:19.660
It's going from pink to blue.

25:20.660 --> 25:21.660
And our outer color happens to be blue.

25:21.660 --> 25:22.660
Okay.

25:23.660 --> 25:24.660
So that's some ways that you could.

25:25.660 --> 25:26.660
Change the other color at that point.

25:27.660 --> 25:28.660
There we go.

25:29.660 --> 25:30.660
You can see how I think of it.

25:31.660 --> 25:32.660
That's some ways that you could start off.

25:33.660 --> 25:34.660
Without the background image.

25:35.660 --> 25:36.660
And just start building things here.

25:37.660 --> 25:38.660
For instance.

25:39.660 --> 25:40.660
A new rectangle.

25:41.660 --> 25:42.660
Or a new circle.

25:43.660 --> 25:44.660
And we'll make it 100.

25:45.660 --> 25:46.660
Radius and red.

25:47.660 --> 25:48.660
And dot center.

25:48.660 --> 25:49.660
And dot drag.

25:51.660 --> 25:52.660
So this is you making an app.

25:53.660 --> 25:54.660
It just doesn't have any pictures.

25:55.660 --> 25:56.660
But it allows you to think.

25:57.660 --> 25:58.660
Think what if we want.

25:59.660 --> 26:00.660
Start making a game.

26:00.660 --> 26:01.660
It just has these shapes.

26:02.660 --> 26:03.660
Okay.

26:03.660 --> 26:04.660
Now let's go to assets.

26:05.660 --> 26:06.660
And see how that works.

26:07.660 --> 26:08.660
We'll clear that.

26:09.660 --> 26:10.660
And test.

26:10.660 --> 26:11.660
So we're back to nothing here.

26:12.660 --> 26:13.660
We're going to go and add a background image.

26:14.660 --> 26:15.660
So I'll click on backies.

26:15.660 --> 26:16.660
And then we'll go to the background image.

26:17.660 --> 26:18.660
And here's a bunch of different backings.

26:19.660 --> 26:20.660
We've collected for you.

26:21.660 --> 26:22.660
And thank you to back easy.

26:23.660 --> 26:24.660
We've got these right.

26:24.660 --> 26:25.660
And thank you to our co-ops.

26:26.660 --> 26:27.660
You help process all these.

26:28.660 --> 26:29.660
Okay.

26:29.660 --> 26:30.660
Let's choose the beach.

26:31.660 --> 26:32.660
Beach one.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.660
So you put on the beach picture.

26:35.660 --> 26:36.660
Or the check box.

26:36.660 --> 26:37.660
You want that check gone.

26:38.660 --> 26:39.660
And then hit save.

26:40.660 --> 26:41.660
What that does is it says.

26:42.660 --> 26:43.660
Okay.

26:43.660 --> 26:44.660
So we're back.

26:45.660 --> 26:47.660
And we can access that by going asset.

26:48.660 --> 26:49.660
Singulate.

26:50.660 --> 26:51.660
Asset.

26:51.660 --> 26:52.660
We're using an asset.

26:53.660 --> 26:54.660
And then you put the name that is right here.

26:55.660 --> 26:56.660
Beach zero one.

26:57.660 --> 26:58.660
Inside of little quotes.

26:59.660 --> 27:00.660
That turns it into a string.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.660
If you don't use a string, it will break.

27:04.660 --> 27:05.660
And then we will talk center that.

27:06.660 --> 27:07.660
So there's the asset.

27:10.660 --> 27:12.660
Asset by the way is a word for images and sounds.

27:13.660 --> 27:14.660
And we have images here.

27:15.660 --> 27:16.660
And also sounds.

27:17.660 --> 27:18.660
One day we may add sprints.

27:19.660 --> 27:20.660
So there is our background image.

27:21.660 --> 27:22.660
Now you can go to phone mode here.

27:23.660 --> 27:24.660
You'll see the phone mode makes it a bit longer.

27:25.660 --> 27:26.660
And you can see that the image doesn't really fit perfectly in the stage.

27:27.660 --> 27:28.660
And if we're not intended to.

27:29.660 --> 27:30.660
It's not high enough.

27:31.660 --> 27:32.660
So that's because the asset is just a little bit too big.

27:33.660 --> 27:34.660
And you can see that the image doesn't fit perfectly in the stage.

27:35.660 --> 27:36.660
And if we're not intended to.

27:37.660 --> 27:38.660
It's not high enough.

27:39.660 --> 27:40.660
So that's because the asset is just a little bit too big.

27:40.660 --> 27:41.660
Or for this.

27:42.660 --> 27:43.660
Which means we'll need to adjust.

27:44.660 --> 27:45.660
We can do that with scale.scot.

27:46.660 --> 27:47.660
So we put in a.scot.

27:48.660 --> 27:49.660
And if we make it twice as big.

27:50.660 --> 27:51.660
And save it.

27:52.660 --> 27:53.660
Or get test.

27:54.660 --> 27:55.660
There it is.

27:56.660 --> 27:57.660
And that fits.

27:58.660 --> 27:59.660
It's a little bit too big.

28:00.660 --> 28:01.660
As a matter of fact, if you want,

28:02.660 --> 28:03.660
we could drag it and sort of see what we mean.

28:05.660 --> 28:06.660
See?

28:07.660 --> 28:08.660
There's some.

28:09.660 --> 28:10.660
Maybe it's just fine.

28:11.660 --> 28:12.660
Maybe we like it like that.

28:13.660 --> 28:14.660
But we sort of have to guess at the scale a little bit.

28:15.660 --> 28:16.660
Or we could make it this scale.

28:17.660 --> 28:18.660
And then move it over.

28:19.660 --> 28:20.660
For instance, we could center.

28:21.660 --> 28:22.660
And then m o b e for move.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.660
And then we want to move it this way.

28:26.660 --> 28:27.660
This way.

28:28.660 --> 28:29.660
Then it has to move negative.

28:30.660 --> 28:31.660
It's negative x.

28:32.660 --> 28:33.660
So we could move it minus 300.

28:35.660 --> 28:36.660
Hey, there we go.

28:37.660 --> 28:38.660
So if we moved it to zero.

28:39.660 --> 28:40.660
There's what it looks like.

28:41.660 --> 28:42.660
You can see.

28:43.660 --> 28:44.660
But we're going to move it 300 pixels.

28:45.660 --> 28:46.660
Over in the negative direction.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.660
Okay?

28:50.660 --> 28:51.660
So that would look like this.

28:52.660 --> 28:53.660
Negative 300.

28:54.660 --> 28:55.660
And hey, that looks pretty good.

28:56.660 --> 28:57.660
I like that.

28:58.660 --> 28:59.660
But there's an easier way perhaps to just pick the picture.

29:00.660 --> 29:01.660
Or make the picture.

29:02.660 --> 29:03.660
Fill.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.660
And let's show you how we can do those two things.

29:06.660 --> 29:07.660
Moving it.

29:08.660 --> 29:09.660
What we'll do is we'll use scale.

29:11.660 --> 29:12.660
To.

29:13.660 --> 29:14.660
So if we use scale to.

29:15.660 --> 29:16.660
That will scale to the stage.

29:17.660 --> 29:18.660
And I say this.

29:19.660 --> 29:21.660
And now it's scaled to fit in the stage.

29:23.660 --> 29:24.660
Like that.

29:25.660 --> 29:26.660
If we made it at a bone.

29:27.660 --> 29:28.660
It fits to the top this time.

29:29.660 --> 29:30.660
And if we made a portrait.

29:31.660 --> 29:32.660
There it is.

29:33.660 --> 29:34.660
Fitting in there.

29:34.660 --> 29:35.660
That's okay.

29:36.660 --> 29:37.660
Well not really.

29:38.660 --> 29:39.660
Because it leaves this stuff on the top and the bottom.

29:40.660 --> 29:41.660
That's fit.

29:42.660 --> 29:43.660
So we want the sweepy bracket.

29:44.660 --> 29:45.660
Tight.

29:46.660 --> 29:47.660
Pulling.

29:48.660 --> 29:49.660
Fill.

29:50.660 --> 29:51.660
So we'll see what we've done there.

29:52.660 --> 29:53.660
We've used the sweepy bracket.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.660
To go to the tight parameter.

29:56.660 --> 29:57.660
Of.

29:58.660 --> 29:59.660
Fill.

30:00.660 --> 30:01.660
Hey look.

30:02.660 --> 30:03.660
Now it fills the stage.

30:04.660 --> 30:05.660
Fill in the stage at a bone.

30:06.660 --> 30:07.660
And you know the portrait.

30:08.660 --> 30:09.660
It fills it.

30:10.660 --> 30:11.660
So it fills it.

30:12.660 --> 30:13.660
No matter what you choose.

30:14.660 --> 30:15.660
You can still move it afterwards.

30:16.660 --> 30:17.660
But that will probably do us for now.

30:18.660 --> 30:19.660
It also may.

30:20.660 --> 30:21.660
Okay.

30:22.660 --> 30:23.660
A little introduction.

30:24.660 --> 30:25.660
To the slate.

30:26.660 --> 30:27.660
We have made several changes now.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.660
To import 3D into the editor.

30:31.660 --> 30:32.660
And a slate so kids can make 3D apps.

30:33.660 --> 30:34.660
Everything is explained by new teaching videos.

30:36.660 --> 30:37.660
And we have made for teachers the editor.

30:40.660 --> 30:41.660
Yes the editor.

30:42.660 --> 30:43.660
You can save for free all your zaps you're making.

30:44.660 --> 30:45.660
Otherwise you have to download it.

30:46.660 --> 30:47.660
Save it on a place you don't know.

30:48.660 --> 30:49.660
So now you can make zaps.

30:50.660 --> 30:51.660
Zim apps.

30:52.660 --> 30:53.660
Is a combination of zaps.

30:54.660 --> 30:55.660
The name.

30:56.660 --> 30:57.660
And then you can make lists of zaps and share them with your students.

30:59.660 --> 31:00.660
You can also find some demos.

31:00.660 --> 31:01.660
And all that is for free.

31:02.660 --> 31:03.660
So no advertisements.

31:05.660 --> 31:06.660
So this is the other one.

31:07.660 --> 31:08.660
The newer one.

31:09.660 --> 31:10.660
How you can explore.

31:11.660 --> 31:12.660
Zim with demos.

31:13.660 --> 31:14.660
And here you can have a look.

31:15.660 --> 31:16.660
To the.

31:17.660 --> 31:18.660
Editor.

31:19.660 --> 31:20.660
So.

31:21.660 --> 31:22.660
You can also find some demos.

31:23.660 --> 31:24.660
And all that is for free.

31:25.660 --> 31:26.660
So no advertisements.

31:27.660 --> 31:28.660
So this is the other one.

31:28.660 --> 31:29.660
operate seeds and make sure you錢.

31:30.660 --> 31:31.660
Come on.

31:32.660 --> 31:33.660
Got a start.

31:34.660 --> 31:35.660
Good news.

31:36.660 --> 31:37.660
All 2018.

31:38.660 --> 31:39.660
Slowing.

31:40.660 --> 31:41.660
So we have.

31:41.660 --> 31:45.940
the search here, like in DITS.

31:45.940 --> 31:48.060
And as soon as we do all the collapse, all of that

31:48.060 --> 31:50.740
means the results are, but this collapse is also

31:50.740 --> 31:54.300
the opening of my collapse, my result part.

31:54.300 --> 31:58.700
So there's how many we have in so far, 30 seconds of them.

31:58.700 --> 32:00.460
And the fact is that the current one

32:00.460 --> 32:02.300
that I have to put in here.

32:02.300 --> 32:05.740
So if we take a look at the dianobesan,

32:05.740 --> 32:08.580
oh, there's dianobesan, the bactezan,

32:08.580 --> 32:13.220
the grids, the guides, the do-wees, and passing parameters

32:13.220 --> 32:18.020
or object pages, the variables, and so on.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.860
And you go into the slide.

32:19.860 --> 32:22.100
So those are the dits.

32:22.100 --> 32:25.620
And in other words, great, great, we can just hide it that way.

32:25.620 --> 32:29.940
But we do have as well, and this one's called list.

32:29.940 --> 32:32.260
So once again, I'm logged in, which

32:32.260 --> 32:35.580
allows me to keep track of the files.

32:35.580 --> 32:40.060
And then here, what we're going to do is copy the bits.

32:40.060 --> 32:42.060
And I'm going to copy it to my own list.

32:42.060 --> 32:44.060
And I will call it bits.

32:44.060 --> 32:47.540
And note that they're all the names of the bits.

32:47.540 --> 32:49.540
And you work nice and happy with them.

32:49.540 --> 32:50.780
And it's saved.

32:50.780 --> 32:56.500
Now under save, here, see there's the files.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.740
List, OK, so that's right.

32:57.740 --> 32:58.660
That's not a list.

32:58.660 --> 33:03.260
So save is anything that I happen to get plus sign on.

33:03.260 --> 33:05.940
And then save plus my own list.

33:05.940 --> 33:10.100
So here under save, we have my own list.

33:10.100 --> 33:14.100
So you would have your own list.

33:14.100 --> 33:15.580
But we want to look into this.

33:15.580 --> 33:19.220
And then I can have these are my list.

33:19.220 --> 33:23.060
And they are my art, my prepassion, my basics,

33:23.060 --> 33:25.060
and here's my new list.

33:25.060 --> 33:26.780
Wow, take a look at that.

33:26.780 --> 33:27.540
So I have.

33:27.540 --> 33:32.740
OK, so you understand the idea, making lists of all your zeps.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.980
You can share them with the world.

33:34.980 --> 33:41.820
And we can go then for children much more into depth

33:41.820 --> 33:44.140
to learn code, of course.

33:44.140 --> 33:46.100
So we're building, building, building.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.620
And we hope everybody understands

33:48.620 --> 33:52.940
how you can manage and share your zaps, your ZIM apps,

33:52.940 --> 33:56.620
your little code to let children be creative.

33:56.620 --> 33:58.180
For example, this is a blob.

33:58.180 --> 34:03.820
A blob is a shape that is closed with a kbizier curve.

34:03.820 --> 34:08.340
And you need to change the parameters, the lines,

34:08.340 --> 34:12.540
to make all the form of shape.

34:12.540 --> 34:18.020
And this is needed to make, for example, the kids app connector.

34:18.020 --> 34:22.580
So you have to make a path or a blob that is closed.

34:22.580 --> 34:26.340
And when you have the blob, you can make a game of it.

34:26.340 --> 34:28.500
OK?

34:28.500 --> 34:32.300
So I also was thinking if kids can make games.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.420
If I have to make all the games for the kids,

34:34.420 --> 34:35.380
it's a lot of work.

34:35.380 --> 34:36.380
So I made a tool.

34:36.380 --> 34:40.820
Kids can import their own image.

34:40.820 --> 34:46.540
And then they can change the blob themselves.

34:46.540 --> 34:49.580
So you have like this basic blob.

34:49.580 --> 34:51.460
Hide the numbers.

34:51.460 --> 34:53.260
I can say I want to edit a blob.

34:53.260 --> 34:57.300
And I can just drag around the cat, the blob.

34:57.300 --> 35:00.940
Otherwise, you have to program it and drag and drop

35:00.940 --> 35:02.260
with big buttons.

35:02.260 --> 35:03.060
It's very easy.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.860
And then you have saved the new blob.

35:05.860 --> 35:11.260
And you can have the points to code, to use it into your game.

35:11.260 --> 35:14.900
So that is very important for children

35:14.900 --> 35:19.060
that they understand what is a form, of course, of a shape,

35:19.060 --> 35:24.500
to explore a code.

35:24.500 --> 35:27.060
Also, beats are possible.

35:27.060 --> 35:29.340
Beats, for example, stars.

35:29.340 --> 35:31.140
You can make the Europe flag.

35:31.140 --> 35:31.980
We are in Fosdame.

35:31.980 --> 35:32.900
It's Europe.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.660
So 12 stars need to be on the circle.

35:35.660 --> 35:38.620
And then you can add beats.

35:38.620 --> 35:40.140
Also, emojis.

35:40.140 --> 35:43.660
We made a tool to get kids creative with emojis.

35:43.660 --> 35:45.620
So what is the code for an emoji?

35:45.620 --> 35:47.940
They all send emojis on the phone.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.820
But what is the code after an emoji?

35:49.820 --> 35:52.980
So we are going to the depth for the kids and then, oh, wow,

35:52.980 --> 35:54.220
we can make emojis.

35:54.220 --> 35:58.220
So for example, the code for an emoji is new emoji.

35:58.220 --> 36:01.500
We have the code and then 200 pixels width

36:01.500 --> 36:04.660
and then in the middle of our game.

36:04.660 --> 36:09.020
So if you go to the site, the emoji, for example,

36:09.020 --> 36:09.740
this is a tool.

36:09.740 --> 36:16.140
You have like, ah, I want to do a tennis ping pong game.

36:16.180 --> 36:21.980
I want this, I can do copy and I can import it into Zimkits.

36:21.980 --> 36:23.820
Or I want another one.

36:23.820 --> 36:29.060
You can also find one by your own operating system.

36:29.060 --> 36:31.180
So for example, I'm happy.

36:31.180 --> 36:33.460
I'm in love with Fosdame.

36:33.460 --> 36:37.140
So I want to use the code of this emoji.

36:37.140 --> 36:41.300
So this is why kids are loving Zimkits a lot

36:41.300 --> 36:45.740
because there can be real coders.

36:45.740 --> 36:48.100
They can see the code behind.

36:48.100 --> 36:49.260
Also, we have panels.

36:49.260 --> 36:51.220
You can close, open and close.

36:51.220 --> 36:56.980
For example, emojis in the list for teachers, kindergarten.

36:56.980 --> 37:00.780
For example, then they can talk about what is this, what is that.

37:00.780 --> 37:05.500
So in a little time, you have pictures because they are emojis.

37:05.500 --> 37:07.580
And if they want to not anymore on the screen,

37:07.580 --> 37:09.660
you can remove them.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.580
So you can open close.

37:12.580 --> 37:14.340
You can move around.

37:14.340 --> 37:18.300
So you can make whatever you want and let children talk with,

37:18.300 --> 37:19.300
what is this?

37:19.300 --> 37:21.580
Oh, my daddy likes this a lot.

37:21.580 --> 37:22.900
I don't know what it is.

37:22.900 --> 37:26.580
But I think here everybody knows.

37:26.580 --> 37:29.220
I also have a little thirsty.

37:29.220 --> 37:30.020
I'm a little thirsty.

37:30.020 --> 37:31.980
So I will drink something afterwards

37:31.980 --> 37:35.420
because I'm happy and in love with Zimkits.

37:35.420 --> 37:39.580
But also the indicator has love emojis.

37:39.580 --> 37:42.900
So indicators in games, you want to know how many lives you

37:42.940 --> 37:45.460
still have after hitting something.

37:45.460 --> 37:49.260
And then now you can use emojis.

37:49.260 --> 37:55.300
So another tool we launched Zimkits is the emitter.

37:55.300 --> 38:00.780
So Zimkits has lessons.

38:00.780 --> 38:05.180
But the emitter wasn't yet possible to show to people.

38:05.180 --> 38:06.740
So this is the confetti.

38:06.740 --> 38:08.020
You can choose whatever you want.

38:08.020 --> 38:10.500
You can make fire if you want other colors.

38:10.500 --> 38:11.900
You emit something.

38:11.900 --> 38:15.660
And the code you can create by the button.

38:15.660 --> 38:20.140
And this code, you just copy it and paste it into the editor.

38:20.140 --> 38:21.900
So you paste it.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.020
Zimkits is slate.

38:24.020 --> 38:27.860
And we just do this way.

38:27.860 --> 38:31.020
And then we test it.

38:31.020 --> 38:31.900
And we have the code.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.420
You see?

38:33.420 --> 38:38.700
What I also explained to kids is how color works.

38:38.740 --> 38:43.540
Color is a big problem for children how RGB is working.

38:43.540 --> 38:46.060
So I made a tool for kids so they can change the color.

38:46.060 --> 38:50.260
And they understand what is alpha, what is looking through,

38:50.260 --> 38:55.380
what is hue, what is black, white, how does it work.

38:55.380 --> 38:59.900
So they can learn a lot of the techniques about color.

38:59.900 --> 39:02.220
Hexadism, all the thinking.

39:02.220 --> 39:03.980
This is all possible in Zimkits.

39:03.980 --> 39:05.220
Sliders.

39:05.220 --> 39:06.940
It's unbelievable.

39:06.940 --> 39:09.780
So these are tools I really need as a teacher

39:09.780 --> 39:11.820
to explain what is coding.

39:11.820 --> 39:19.540
Also, if you have particles for stars or a snow simulating fire,

39:19.540 --> 39:21.180
we have a website.

39:21.180 --> 39:30.980
And Zimkits has different levels for animating objects,

39:30.980 --> 39:31.780
of course.

39:31.780 --> 39:34.260
I'll show you a little example.

39:34.260 --> 39:38.580
So we go to the parts, events.

39:38.580 --> 39:40.020
Here you have a triangle.

39:40.020 --> 39:42.540
And you click on the triangle, and it goes to the right side.

39:42.540 --> 39:44.060
No problem at all.

39:44.060 --> 39:46.580
I go to the code, and kids can learn the code.

39:46.580 --> 39:47.860
This is a triangle.

39:47.860 --> 39:48.780
It's rotated.

39:48.780 --> 39:51.460
It has a cursor, the hand.

39:51.460 --> 39:55.300
And it has a position at the left center.

39:55.300 --> 39:58.500
So at the left side, in the middle,

39:58.500 --> 40:01.820
it's positioned some pixels on the right side.

40:01.820 --> 40:03.380
So that's the start position.

40:03.380 --> 40:05.940
But if you go to the level two, they

40:05.940 --> 40:11.100
learn about animation with the spacebar of the keyboard.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.900
So that is also possible.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.620
But here, you can click, and the circle is moving.

40:15.620 --> 40:18.980
But what is also possible, the other side,

40:18.980 --> 40:20.580
you can go with the arrows up and down.

40:20.580 --> 40:24.020
And when it's hitting, you get confetti.

40:24.020 --> 40:28.980
So this is why we needed the confetti, the emitter,

40:28.980 --> 40:33.260
to show children what is possible.

40:33.300 --> 40:36.140
Because when they are fighting in a game online,

40:36.140 --> 40:44.380
they also have to see something when they die.

40:44.380 --> 40:47.380
So this is also a possibility.

40:47.380 --> 40:50.020
Confetti, when we shoot something in the air,

40:50.020 --> 40:52.020
it goes to another place.

40:52.020 --> 40:53.980
And this is a little faster.

40:53.980 --> 40:58.140
But we have also the sound with it.

40:58.140 --> 41:00.380
We have a counter of the time.

41:00.380 --> 41:01.540
It goes down.

41:01.540 --> 41:04.340
And then, oh, we have 10 seconds left.

41:04.340 --> 41:06.460
We need some more points.

41:06.460 --> 41:07.420
Come on, come on.

41:07.420 --> 41:09.700
And then when it's finished, we need

41:09.700 --> 41:12.460
to see what do you think, what do you see?

41:12.460 --> 41:14.180
Game over.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.100
So this is a little animation for children.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.820
How can we make a game?

41:18.820 --> 41:21.740
If you want more complex, then we have sprites.

41:21.740 --> 41:27.980
We can really animate like in a real game.

41:27.980 --> 41:32.020
So this is the emitter, why it's used.

41:32.020 --> 41:34.020
You can also catch beats.

41:34.020 --> 41:37.940
So an emitter I used for is my own name.

41:37.940 --> 41:42.580
I learned kids of 12, 30 years how to make their own name.

41:42.580 --> 41:46.220
And a little game for the name is please

41:46.220 --> 41:48.540
raise all the cookies.

41:48.540 --> 41:50.900
And when you're happy, all cookies are coming.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.860
These are pictures into the emitter.

41:52.860 --> 41:56.100
So you can do whatever you want in the emitter.

41:56.140 --> 41:58.660
And if you want to play again, you can launch the button

41:58.660 --> 42:00.980
to play it again.

42:00.980 --> 42:05.260
So creativity is all yours, of course.

42:05.260 --> 42:10.220
Walking onto a path is also something

42:10.220 --> 42:14.300
why we use the path, of course.

42:14.300 --> 42:15.740
Here you have the path.

42:15.740 --> 42:17.940
And on the horse, there's center class.

42:17.940 --> 42:21.780
It's a typical Flemish ritual.

42:21.780 --> 42:25.220
So he comes on the roofs of the houses

42:25.260 --> 42:27.260
to bring presents to the children.

42:27.260 --> 42:32.620
So he's walking in Antwerp above the roof tops.

42:32.620 --> 42:34.700
And you can stop and do help.

42:34.700 --> 42:36.220
What do you have to do?

42:36.220 --> 42:38.340
So there's also a path.

42:38.340 --> 42:41.700
But it's coming back when it's at the end.

42:41.700 --> 42:44.020
OK.

42:44.020 --> 42:48.180
So also I made a game for Saint Martin.

42:48.180 --> 42:51.220
I live in Bevereux, next to Antwerp.

42:51.220 --> 42:54.100
And there is like a candy man.

42:54.100 --> 42:56.780
And the candy man is there at night.

42:56.780 --> 43:00.260
And he has to throw some candy.

43:00.260 --> 43:04.980
So you have to hit the little people to get them candy.

43:04.980 --> 43:07.380
So if they are happy, yay.

43:07.380 --> 43:10.380
And this is creativity.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.700
You can put your own pictures into the background

43:13.700 --> 43:15.140
on characters.

43:15.140 --> 43:19.460
You even can now play multi-pong.

43:19.460 --> 43:24.620
If you are with three screens, so two phones and one laptop,

43:24.620 --> 43:27.660
you can play pong along with your phone.

43:27.660 --> 43:31.340
So I would say test it sometimes.

43:31.340 --> 43:35.100
But I cannot show it now because I have no time anymore.

43:35.100 --> 43:36.500
But it's also working.

43:36.500 --> 43:36.780
OK.

43:36.780 --> 43:39.300
We have also animating.

43:39.300 --> 43:44.380
So if I see something on a classroom,

43:44.380 --> 43:46.140
I want to make it myself.

43:46.140 --> 43:49.500
So animating is with sprites.

43:49.500 --> 43:50.420
This is Dr. Abstract.

43:50.420 --> 43:53.220
He has colons and rows.

43:53.220 --> 43:55.900
And sprite sheets, we call it.

43:55.900 --> 43:58.660
And then we use it also for games.

43:58.660 --> 44:04.180
So for example, this one, we have three layers.

44:04.180 --> 44:05.500
And we can shoot.

44:05.500 --> 44:07.580
So that's what kids also like, of course.

44:07.580 --> 44:11.780
And they want playing games.

44:11.780 --> 44:14.260
But I'm not a shooter man.

44:14.260 --> 44:17.500
So I make it with vortex.

44:17.500 --> 44:24.500
Vortex is a little brave or another way of thinking.

44:24.500 --> 44:29.180
So you can remove somebody standing over there or something.

44:29.180 --> 44:32.780
But there is nothing to do.

44:32.780 --> 44:34.340
It's suddenly walking and jumping.

44:34.340 --> 44:36.620
But you can shoot.

44:36.620 --> 44:37.740
So another ID.

44:40.500 --> 44:41.900
What do I have here?

44:41.940 --> 44:43.780
We have also a video.

44:43.780 --> 44:45.780
Mr. Sander is somebody from Holland.

44:45.780 --> 44:47.300
He makes a lot of videos.

44:47.300 --> 44:50.500
I was asking him, can I do something with your videos?

44:58.020 --> 45:02.060
So he's asking, where do we hear the letter B or something?

45:02.060 --> 45:06.140
So on the left side, the different images has to come.

45:06.140 --> 45:07.860
And then you have to click left or right.

45:07.860 --> 45:08.940
What is the answer?

45:08.980 --> 45:12.540
So this is only the first step that I've shown you.

45:12.540 --> 45:15.380
But we have also Mr. Sander in the 3D space.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.500
So I want to show 3D.

45:17.500 --> 45:18.340
Why?

45:18.340 --> 45:24.060
Because in September, Zim launched the possibility

45:24.060 --> 45:26.420
to go forward into a 3D space.

45:26.420 --> 45:29.220
So everything is 2D, but you walk around.

45:29.220 --> 45:31.980
And you can go with your mouse left to right.

45:31.980 --> 45:33.860
And this is very amazing for kids.

45:33.860 --> 45:35.740
So they want a game.

45:35.740 --> 45:39.660
And they can even play videos in 2D space.

45:39.660 --> 45:40.780
All made by Dan Zain.

45:40.780 --> 45:44.660
So this is also about the science day in Belgium.

45:44.660 --> 45:46.380
This is Mr. Sander again.

46:06.620 --> 46:12.180
So this is playing.

46:12.180 --> 46:12.820
We are moving.

46:24.340 --> 46:25.660
So you can pause.

46:25.660 --> 46:27.660
And you can go forward.

46:27.660 --> 46:30.660
And you can do several interactions

46:30.660 --> 46:33.740
with the several Zim apps.

46:33.740 --> 46:35.700
So everything is a ZAP.

46:36.660 --> 46:38.940
And you can place it wherever you want.

46:38.940 --> 46:39.580
This is the book.

46:39.580 --> 46:41.740
We have an interactive book also in Zim.

46:41.740 --> 46:47.540
So we can go left and right by touching it.

46:47.540 --> 46:49.060
This is unbelievable.

46:49.060 --> 46:51.980
We can do it in 3D.

46:51.980 --> 46:52.900
Interactive books.

46:52.900 --> 46:56.380
So if I put the little people there, I go back.

46:56.380 --> 46:57.780
It's still on ZAP.

46:57.780 --> 46:59.300
So we can make books.

46:59.300 --> 47:00.860
We can path.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.980
We can go like here.

47:02.980 --> 47:03.700
We have a circle.

47:03.700 --> 47:04.500
We make it bigger.

47:04.500 --> 47:05.380
Other right side.

47:05.380 --> 47:09.460
We can animate everything in 3D space now.

47:09.460 --> 47:15.980
So this is a big step forward for people who are 3D makers.

47:15.980 --> 47:17.740
This is another example.

47:17.740 --> 47:20.780
We can even use the VR glasses.

47:20.780 --> 47:23.700
So down you have a button, not support,

47:23.700 --> 47:28.140
because on a website, a computer, Chromebook.

47:28.140 --> 47:29.340
But if you have the glasses on, you

47:29.340 --> 47:35.180
have to push the button below to go.

47:35.180 --> 47:37.740
And then you can go forward, backwards.

47:37.740 --> 47:42.300
You can then animate things, make it bigger, make the solution.

47:42.300 --> 47:44.500
So this is very amazing for me.

47:44.500 --> 47:46.860
So this is for the high school in Belgium.

47:46.860 --> 47:48.460
I made an example.

47:48.460 --> 47:50.620
Thomas Moore in Mechelen.

47:50.620 --> 47:54.860
So this is a big step forward for us.

47:54.860 --> 47:56.620
The game then made.

47:56.620 --> 47:58.820
It's also on the right side.

47:58.820 --> 48:01.580
But it's not with animated panels.

48:01.580 --> 48:04.820
It's only with cylinders.

48:04.860 --> 48:07.580
Also, we have a game module.

48:07.580 --> 48:10.460
So you have to import some modules.

48:10.460 --> 48:14.860
And then you can make a talking people.

48:14.860 --> 48:21.380
We have sensors, ZimCam, for making games interactive,

48:21.380 --> 48:22.940
of playing music.

48:22.940 --> 48:27.900
You can wave to your cam, and it's interactive.

48:27.900 --> 48:30.980
So this is the magic of code.

48:30.980 --> 48:33.660
I put the wrong button.

48:33.660 --> 48:40.420
So if I go to the number 5, demo 5, it's very cool.

48:40.420 --> 48:41.420
We have like a cursor.

48:41.420 --> 48:43.340
But now your cursor is your hand.

48:43.340 --> 48:47.700
You move your hand onto the red button circle.

48:47.700 --> 48:49.940
And it's activated, and you can place it somewhere else.

48:49.940 --> 48:53.660
So this is what I want to say about the magic of Zim.

48:53.660 --> 48:55.620
Zim can do everything.

48:55.620 --> 48:59.500
I didn't push the button just with my hands.

48:59.500 --> 49:00.940
I can move along.

49:00.940 --> 49:03.980
So you can make an Ufu landing on the world

49:03.980 --> 49:08.260
and giving everybody some happiness, love.

49:08.260 --> 49:11.140
But the next thing I want to show is speech.

49:11.140 --> 49:15.060
Speech is launched two weeks ago.

49:15.060 --> 49:18.220
And I did some pioneering work for it.

49:18.220 --> 49:24.340
So this is a little man, a boy.

49:24.340 --> 49:26.340
And of course, I want to talk to him.

49:26.340 --> 49:28.740
So I have a red button.

49:28.740 --> 49:30.060
Hello, everybody.

49:30.060 --> 49:32.820
How are you doing?

49:32.820 --> 49:35.540
And he's typing what I'm saying.

49:35.540 --> 49:38.220
So this is a big applause for Denzen in implementing it.

49:38.220 --> 49:41.980
So in Canada, thank you very much.

49:41.980 --> 49:45.740
All over the world, speech technology is very huge.

49:45.740 --> 49:50.460
And nobody else I've seen implementing it into apps.

49:50.460 --> 49:52.380
And we can do it.

49:52.380 --> 49:58.180
So also, for example, a robot, Basin Adrian, is from the 80s.

49:58.180 --> 50:00.420
I was a lover of Basin Adrian from Holland.

50:00.420 --> 50:05.740
And I made a robot because I was a huge fan.

50:05.740 --> 50:07.300
So I show you.

50:10.300 --> 50:12.860
So I made the finger at the left side

50:12.860 --> 50:14.260
so you know what you have to do.

50:14.260 --> 50:18.580
Hello, I am Robin, the robot.

50:18.580 --> 50:21.020
And then you have to, for the next sentences,

50:21.020 --> 50:24.860
hello, I am Robin, the robot.

50:24.860 --> 50:27.940
Again, hello, I am Robin, the robot.

50:29.180 --> 50:31.060
Yes, robot, of course.

50:31.060 --> 50:33.060
And then you can play it.

50:36.060 --> 50:38.380
And Robin is Robin in the language.

50:38.380 --> 50:40.500
And Robin is Robin in the language.

50:40.500 --> 50:45.940
So the language you can choose the language you want.

50:45.940 --> 50:48.940
Hello, I am Robin, the robot, of Fosdam.

50:50.940 --> 50:53.940
Hello, I am Robin, the robot, of Fosdam.

50:53.940 --> 50:57.420
So, even my name.

50:57.860 --> 51:02.060
Thank you for listening to Carl Roosale.

51:02.060 --> 51:06.140
Thank you for listening to Carl Roosale.

51:06.140 --> 51:07.420
Thank you very much.

51:07.420 --> 51:16.140
So I don't know what to say anymore.

51:16.140 --> 51:17.940
This is what I was liking a lot.

51:17.940 --> 51:21.340
But the problem, at least, is the children

51:21.340 --> 51:23.180
can talk every word.

51:23.180 --> 51:25.340
So what do they want to say?

51:25.340 --> 51:27.340
Words they don't want to hear as a teacher.

51:27.380 --> 51:29.380
So what did I offend?

51:29.380 --> 51:34.700
A list where children can only talk the words of the list.

51:34.700 --> 51:36.300
So he has the center class.

51:36.300 --> 51:36.820
He comes.

51:36.820 --> 51:38.780
He wants to bring presents.

51:38.780 --> 51:41.940
What are the presents that he brings about a Vliegtheug?

51:41.940 --> 51:43.780
So it's a plane, a bear.

51:43.780 --> 51:48.900
And if you talk to the circle, Vliegtheug,

51:48.900 --> 51:52.140
you get the word and you see the image.

51:52.140 --> 51:54.580
But you cannot talk any word.

51:54.580 --> 51:57.860
He only listens to the words I'm talking.

51:57.860 --> 52:00.380
That's extra magical.

52:00.380 --> 52:04.100
So I'm very excited about him.

52:04.100 --> 52:06.500
And we even have the controllers possible.

52:06.500 --> 52:11.020
So you can play with your controllers, also games.

52:11.020 --> 52:18.180
So if you go to heart 2, you can go to mouse for now.

52:18.180 --> 52:21.540
But if you have a Bluetooth connection or a controller,

52:21.540 --> 52:26.700
you can collect all the buttons or the circles.

52:26.700 --> 52:30.020
And when you are finished, you get love.

52:30.020 --> 52:33.940
OK, so I want to inspire my kids of five

52:33.940 --> 52:35.500
and one year and eight months.

52:35.500 --> 52:40.140
So I don't know anymore what more I can expect from the end

52:40.140 --> 52:40.640
end.

52:40.640 --> 52:46.620
But if you have questions, ask him.

52:46.620 --> 52:49.260
He made already the Groovity app.

52:49.260 --> 52:50.380
It's a PWA app.

52:50.380 --> 52:53.380
PWA apps or progressive web apps.

52:53.380 --> 52:56.020
Progressive web apps can be installed on your phone

52:56.020 --> 52:56.740
without internet.

52:56.740 --> 52:57.780
It's working.

52:57.780 --> 53:01.980
So we have like Groovity with many pages.

53:01.980 --> 53:04.140
You know you have seen apps with one page.

53:04.140 --> 53:07.940
Of course, we want to have children of the kindergarten

53:07.940 --> 53:10.940
with multiple games at once.

53:10.940 --> 53:13.860
So these are all stages after each other.

53:13.860 --> 53:15.700
You can play around.

53:15.700 --> 53:16.300
It comes back.

53:16.300 --> 53:19.300
It becomes bigger.

53:19.340 --> 53:21.060
I am on Placement in Belgium.

53:21.060 --> 53:23.620
It's a big website where you can post all the things

53:23.620 --> 53:25.020
about internet, you know.

53:25.020 --> 53:30.540
And it's very liked by the people, the teachers in Belgium.

53:30.540 --> 53:32.860
So now they want to make it theirself.

53:32.860 --> 53:37.740
And that's why I'm making Slate better and better.

53:37.740 --> 53:39.100
Also, the physics.

53:39.100 --> 53:41.580
We have a ball, for example, to jump.

53:44.220 --> 53:46.500
This is a basic example of sim.

53:46.500 --> 53:48.220
So you have to push the ball.

53:48.220 --> 53:50.980
And it can go outside or sim.

53:50.980 --> 53:54.940
So there are no limits for the border.

53:54.940 --> 53:57.460
So you have to push and then it comes.

53:57.460 --> 53:58.220
So now it's cool.

53:58.220 --> 54:02.940
We can add sound to it because we have the speech and the sim.

54:02.940 --> 54:04.540
So the kids know it's a number one.

54:04.540 --> 54:05.540
It's a number two.

54:05.540 --> 54:09.260
He can learn counting to 10, for example.

54:09.260 --> 54:11.340
This is what I show you.

54:11.340 --> 54:13.620
The explosions already.

54:13.620 --> 54:16.020
Sim coding with Slate.

54:16.020 --> 54:20.300
So these are all the websites you can visit.

54:20.300 --> 54:22.860
And also on TikTok, on YouTube, of Instagram,

54:22.860 --> 54:25.500
we are everywhere on all social media.

54:25.500 --> 54:29.540
Just take the time to explore Sim because it's much.

54:29.540 --> 54:33.580
But if you have grown up and about the blocky

54:33.580 --> 54:37.380
and all the blocks dropping, just go and typing.

54:37.380 --> 54:42.500
That's my thing I want to say to everybody.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.540
And last but not least, in March, we

54:44.540 --> 54:48.540
have Flanders Technology and Innovation.

54:48.540 --> 54:52.700
It's a festival about what we invent in Belgium.

54:52.700 --> 54:56.100
We invented the Jeepig compression

54:56.100 --> 55:00.860
by a woman from the university in Limburg, the province.

55:00.860 --> 55:05.140
And I made a little VR glass.

55:05.140 --> 55:11.660
You can see a video playing while we are turning.

55:11.660 --> 55:23.860
We are looking for our own way.

55:23.860 --> 55:26.460
We are looking for our own way.

55:26.460 --> 55:29.580
But above all, we are doing it for the sake of it.

55:29.580 --> 55:31.300
Like one of the first windmills,

55:31.300 --> 55:34.260
which we just saw here, in Zürich,

55:34.260 --> 55:36.260
there is a smartphone that is a little bit

55:36.260 --> 55:38.380
connected to an image in Leuven.

55:38.380 --> 55:42.300
And each one is only available through the game in Limburg.

55:42.300 --> 55:46.180
Strattoch or mitroscopic levels are available

55:46.180 --> 55:48.740
by the name of Strattoch.

55:48.740 --> 55:52.540
Red means order beginning or flight to the next

55:52.540 --> 55:54.700
if we want to make it better.

55:54.700 --> 55:57.740
Really, Flanders is working on it.

55:57.740 --> 55:59.900
But I'm sure even smarter

55:59.900 --> 56:03.580
if we make our own screenings for the big block

56:03.580 --> 56:05.500
if we can speak to each other.

56:05.500 --> 56:10.020
Look at the future.

56:10.020 --> 56:11.420
Or do we need to calm down?

56:11.420 --> 56:13.180
The future.

56:13.180 --> 56:14.620
Because that's exactly what we want

56:14.620 --> 56:17.180
with Flanders Technology in a vision.

56:17.180 --> 56:18.420
Do.

56:18.420 --> 56:20.020
Do it.

56:20.020 --> 56:22.100
Do it.

56:22.100 --> 56:24.900
Here in Flanders and all over the world.

56:24.900 --> 56:28.140
Yes, even this world.

56:28.140 --> 56:32.300
To stimulate, inspire and support talents.

56:32.300 --> 56:36.340
The problem of tomorrow is now solved.

56:36.340 --> 56:38.100
So, please join us.

56:38.100 --> 56:41.820
Thank you for coming to see how the world changes.

56:41.820 --> 56:48.020
And above all, how it started in Flanders Technology in a vision.

56:50.420 --> 56:52.540
So you see the head of the person.

56:52.540 --> 56:53.940
This is Flanders.

56:53.940 --> 56:58.380
By night, the lights on Brussels Antwerp, the coast.

56:58.380 --> 57:00.340
If you know, we have two parts in Belgium,

57:00.380 --> 57:03.340
Boulogne and Flanders of course.

57:03.340 --> 57:07.020
And if you have this in a Zapp,

57:07.020 --> 57:09.540
so you saw a website, I made also the Zapp.

57:09.540 --> 57:12.620
You can go to the full mode.

57:12.620 --> 57:15.540
You click on the QR code, you can do it yourself.

57:15.540 --> 57:18.380
But here I put it into a newer glass.

57:18.380 --> 57:21.860
The quest to reach with an image.

57:21.980 --> 57:23.300
Problems are stuck.

57:23.300 --> 57:24.660
That's what we want.

57:24.660 --> 57:27.140
Experiment, problems.

57:27.140 --> 57:30.900
So you see, you take a 360 degree picture

57:30.900 --> 57:35.220
and you can put whatever you want into the space with Zipp.

57:35.220 --> 57:36.740
Thank you very much.

57:36.740 --> 57:40.340
APPLAUSE

57:40.340 --> 57:42.620
See you online or somewhere else.

57:45.100 --> 57:45.940
Any questions?

57:45.940 --> 57:47.820
We have, I think, one minute for questions.

57:47.820 --> 57:49.580
Yes, or any other questions, please.

57:51.860 --> 57:54.940
You are all amazed about what Zipp can do.
