00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Yes, we just go right on.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.360
Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. I'm Fernando Nubla. I'm a project officer from

00:12.360 --> 00:21.200
the European Commission and I'm going to tell you a story, the story of Leos. So, upon

00:21.200 --> 00:27.720
a time we were in LaGislan and you can imagine LaGislan is not that funny. It's talking

00:27.720 --> 00:34.800
about legislation, you know how complex legislation is. And in this case we had law legislation

00:34.800 --> 00:42.180
that was complicating the life of everyone living in this kingdom. Legislative laws was

00:42.180 --> 00:47.360
enforcing very complex rules to everyone that wanted to create a new piece of legislation.

00:47.360 --> 00:52.800
Rules about the structure of the documents, formatting, etc. He was not taking care of

00:52.800 --> 00:58.880
the versions. We had versions everywhere, in local computers, in surf folders, in everywhere

00:58.880 --> 01:05.600
I can imagine, even in a paper. So it was getting very complicated for the people working

01:05.600 --> 01:10.440
with the legislation. And there were a lot of people and no one was collaborating because

01:10.440 --> 01:18.280
law legislate was not helping them on that. So we went to the round table, we tried to

01:18.280 --> 01:24.800
find a solution. We needed to help these people. So we started by creating a work plan, an idea

01:24.800 --> 01:32.800
of what we need to help them. We were defining more or less the solution that we wanted.

01:32.800 --> 01:37.200
But there was something very important. It was the financing. We couldn't do this without

01:37.200 --> 01:43.480
budget, without any financing. So we used two programs of the European Union, the ISA program

01:43.480 --> 01:51.720
when we started in 2012. And then, right now, the ITA Euro program since 2020. With the

01:51.720 --> 01:56.840
budget, the financing, and with the work plan, and with the idea of the project, then we

01:56.840 --> 02:03.640
created Mr. Leos that you have here, and you have also in our search. Mr. Leos, we wanted

02:03.640 --> 02:10.640
him to be an open tool that is a web application. We wanted to be able to draft tests. We wanted

02:13.640 --> 02:19.360
to have a rich editor where you can put images, formulas, track changes. We wanted to have

02:19.360 --> 02:25.280
collaborative tools to create comments, suggestions, to work with other people, everything centralized.

02:25.280 --> 02:29.320
We take care of all the versions. So now they are not spread everywhere. They are all in

02:29.320 --> 02:35.160
a central place, and you can go and check them. And something very important, we wanted to

02:35.160 --> 02:41.200
use open standards. We didn't want to keep drafting legislation in an unestructured standard

02:41.320 --> 02:48.160
that you can use further. We wanted to create something that is structured. And we are using

02:48.160 --> 02:55.160
the commandos for you standard that is open for everyone, for any administration or government

02:55.640 --> 03:00.760
that wants to use it. And the last aspect is that we wanted to do it open source. That

03:00.760 --> 03:05.960
was something new, the European Commission doing open source projects. We did it. And

03:06.160 --> 03:11.640
we bring with us the community. We are not just alone. We wanted to do this with member

03:11.640 --> 03:18.640
states, with other countries, with academia, et cetera. Whoever wanted to help us is welcome.

03:21.440 --> 03:26.160
And then I know you were waiting for this. There was a battle, of course, between the

03:26.160 --> 03:33.160
Leos project and the legislation. But no one was harmed. So our idea was to convince them

03:33.880 --> 03:40.880
that there was a better way to do the things. So finally we end up with a legislative in

03:41.560 --> 03:48.560
our team. We are running around Europe. We are helping other member states, other institutions

03:50.840 --> 03:57.840
to use this tool that is open source, is available for everyone. And together we are going towards

03:58.320 --> 04:03.680
the future. And the future is leading us to artificial intelligence, machine learning,

04:03.680 --> 04:10.680
imagine drafting legislation just with one click and getting the proper test. And this

04:11.240 --> 04:16.760
is the tool. So everything that I said is true. You can check it out. We had all the

04:16.760 --> 04:21.400
features that I was saying before. We had the structure. We had the versions everywhere.

04:21.400 --> 04:25.720
We had the research with the touch changes. You have on the right the collaboration to

04:25.720 --> 04:31.840
create comments, suggestions, the use of tests. We are using open projects like the CK Editor,

04:31.840 --> 04:38.840
Hypothesis, EUI. So we are creating our software open and using open source projects. You can

04:40.360 --> 04:47.360
check us in this QR code. You can scan also our t-shirts. We are in code.tropa.eu Leos.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.800
All the software is available there. You can check it out. You can contribute while waiting

04:52.800 --> 04:59.840
for you here. Thank you. And this is the end.
