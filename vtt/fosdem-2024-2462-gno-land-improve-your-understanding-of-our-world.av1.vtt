WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.780
So, hello everyone, I'm Alfred Thorn, an engineer and someone with the Earth for open source

00:10.780 --> 00:12.620
and decentralization.

00:12.620 --> 00:17.260
And today I will speak about Noland which is a mix of open source and decentralization

00:17.260 --> 00:24.140
to try to find the truth collectively and to try to basically create new democracies

00:24.140 --> 00:26.300
online.

00:27.300 --> 00:32.980
So, one of the main reasons we want to create Noland is because we consider that right now

00:32.980 --> 00:41.300
we have too many control from governments, from the media, from censorship, we have AI

00:41.300 --> 00:45.460
making a real line between real and fake, between humans and bots.

00:45.460 --> 00:50.780
And what we lack right now is not a way to send and to transfer resources and data but

00:50.780 --> 00:55.900
basically to coordinate on social concerns.

00:55.900 --> 01:00.100
So one of the initial starting point is basically we use Web3.

01:00.100 --> 01:05.780
Web3 today is not helping that much for social coordination but it makes something great.

01:05.780 --> 01:13.260
It allows exchanging data, resources, financial resources, messages between peer to peer people

01:13.260 --> 01:15.060
without intermediaries.

01:15.060 --> 01:18.660
And it brings new level of transparency especially in governments.

01:18.660 --> 01:25.300
So we don't need to trust a source of parties, can be companies, governments, internet providers

01:25.300 --> 01:27.660
or whatever, we just need to trust code.

01:27.660 --> 01:28.660
So that's what brings Web3.

01:28.660 --> 01:34.540
But Web3 has so many problems especially in terms of UI, UX, scalability, simplicity

01:34.540 --> 01:40.820
and that's exactly where we try to improve the problem by working on UX, on scalability

01:40.820 --> 01:48.020
and on basically moving from the financial world to social coordination world.

01:48.020 --> 01:53.260
So the main vision of GNOS, so it's our third project, we started with real blockchains.

01:53.260 --> 01:57.660
The first vision was to create the equivalent of microservices for blockchains because we

01:57.660 --> 02:02.180
believe we won't have a single big one but so many specialized small ones.

02:02.180 --> 02:06.900
So we created Tenamint and Cosmos and with an internet of blockchains you can have specialized

02:06.900 --> 02:09.700
blockchains or geographical blockchains but that can work together.

02:09.700 --> 02:13.220
So you have the mix of independence and collaboration.

02:13.220 --> 02:21.460
And what we want to do now is to say okay, how can we not compete on important bigger

02:21.460 --> 02:25.940
applications so basically not Excel style stuff because blockchains today are mostly

02:25.940 --> 02:32.260
about managing balances, integers, I can transfer a balance from address to another in practice.

02:32.260 --> 02:37.340
When you look at social networks, at democracy, at source, at Wikipedia, it's definitely more

02:37.340 --> 02:38.460
complex.

02:38.460 --> 02:46.420
So we created a new language which is interpreted meaning that open source is not an option,

02:46.420 --> 02:47.420
open source is unforced.

02:47.420 --> 02:52.500
There is no way to run a binary, to run something obfuscated.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.380
You need to upload your source code.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.700
When you upload your source code, all the good things from open source like reading

02:57.700 --> 02:59.900
but also reusing are unforced.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.680
It's not possible to make some things that won't be reusable.

03:03.680 --> 03:08.980
You come from probably the classical world where you publish a binary on an API that

03:08.980 --> 03:10.700
your website.

03:10.700 --> 03:13.540
In practice, all the data is on your server.

03:13.540 --> 03:17.380
Even if your code is on GitHub, the data is on your server.

03:17.380 --> 03:20.900
What we want to create is this concept where open source is not just about code but about

03:20.900 --> 03:24.300
the state, about verifiability and also about the data.

03:24.300 --> 03:28.940
So we have an interpreted data mystic simple language so everyone can code and not only

03:28.940 --> 03:32.220
the most expert, full of data ability.

03:32.220 --> 03:36.860
The last point is about the consensus mechanism.

03:36.860 --> 03:40.820
In blockchains, you are aware of GPU based that cost money and that are batch-oriented

03:40.820 --> 03:42.020
on environment.

03:42.020 --> 03:46.380
You are probably no proof of stake where the goal is to, if you are rich, you have power

03:46.380 --> 03:48.620
and we are creating proof of contribution.

03:48.620 --> 03:53.780
Proof of contribution is a way to basically gain a score based on your contribution, expertise,

03:53.780 --> 03:55.780
alignment.

03:55.780 --> 03:58.740
Everything makes this way more human-centric.

03:58.740 --> 04:05.020
It's not more about trying to be rich but about human coordinating.

04:05.020 --> 04:12.020
So basically our goal is to take all the good things from open source but try to bring new

04:12.020 --> 04:13.020
things.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.020
This is the example of GitHub.

04:14.020 --> 04:20.940
GitHub is definitely not the open source itself but before GitHub you had open source but

04:20.940 --> 04:24.980
it made it better and what we want to do is to make the same with another level where

04:24.980 --> 04:28.100
you mix data where you mix transparency by default.

04:28.100 --> 04:32.060
I need to stop but if you want to discuss, it will be a pleasure.
