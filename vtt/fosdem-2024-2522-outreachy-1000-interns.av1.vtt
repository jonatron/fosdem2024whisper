Hello, folks. Good morning, evening, afternoon, wherever you are. Welcome to the Outreachy

00:15.160 --> 00:29.880
Talk and Celebration of 1000 Interns. So before we start, I just want to see a show of hands

00:29.880 --> 00:37.840
has anyone participated as an Outreachy mentor, a coordinator, an intern before? Woohoo! Thank

00:37.840 --> 00:47.720
you for coming. And for folks who haven't heard about Outreachy before, Outreachy is an internship

00:47.720 --> 00:56.040
program that provides internships in free and open source and open science internships.

00:56.040 --> 01:02.120
And our internships are open to people who are subject to systemic bias, discrimination,

01:02.120 --> 01:09.040
and impacted by underrepresentation in the technology industry of their country. Outreachy

01:09.040 --> 01:16.080
is truly remote all around the world. We have mentors are remote, interns are remote, we

01:16.080 --> 01:21.400
have interns on all the different livable continents, not Antarctica yet, but maybe

01:21.440 --> 01:29.720
soon. And the interns are paid $7,000 total for the internship stipend. And that's a three-month

01:29.720 --> 01:38.520
internship. We run internships twice a year, May to August, and December to March. And as of our

01:38.520 --> 01:54.440
most current cohort, December 2023, we have had 1097 internships. And to celebrate that 1000

01:54.440 --> 02:07.120
interns, we had a bunch of celebrations. Awesome. Okay, so we celebrated milestone in six

02:07.160 --> 02:17.360
countries. We had the celebration in Cameroon, in India, Nigeria, Kenya, and of course in USDSE. And

02:17.360 --> 02:25.680
this celebration is awesome because we had past interns. I mean, folks who have gone through this

02:25.680 --> 02:33.440
program, they were able to like organize, they led the celebration, and they made everybody to feel

02:33.680 --> 02:41.120
included across the celebration. Aside the six countries that we celebrated, we also had the

02:41.120 --> 02:52.160
celebration virtually. We had three sessions, and it was really awesome. I also want to talk a

02:52.160 --> 03:00.240
little bit about our accomplishments. Not only do we have 1000 interns, we have a 96% internship

03:00.240 --> 03:05.680
completion rate. And that's part of because our internships, we consider more of a fellowship. We

03:05.680 --> 03:11.840
want to make sure that the interns complete the internship. If they get sick, if they, you know,

03:11.840 --> 03:16.800
have family issues, we extend the internship. And so we want to make sure that this is more about

03:16.800 --> 03:23.680
them learning about free software and open science than trying to get a particular project done.

03:24.320 --> 03:32.480
And we not only have this great completion rate, we also retain people in free software as well.

03:32.480 --> 03:41.600
So 80% of past interns continue to contribute to free software, and 44% of those interns are

03:41.600 --> 03:49.040
employed to contribute to free software as part of their job. So we want to talk about a little bit

03:49.600 --> 03:57.200
about how did we get here? How did we get to 1000 outreach interns? As we talk about how did we get

03:57.200 --> 04:04.640
here, you're probably wondering who we are. So let us introduce ourselves. My name is Karen Sandler.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.920
I am a co-founder of Outreachy. I'm the executive director of Software Freedom Conservancy, which is

04:09.920 --> 04:18.480
the home of Outreachy. I'm from Brazil, came here from a trip of 11,000 kilometers. It took me a

04:18.480 --> 04:25.360
while to get here. I was a past intern when we came here, and I'm the current information and

04:25.360 --> 04:31.840
process architect of Outreachy. Awesome. And I'm Omotala Eunice Omotayo. I'm from the giants of

04:31.840 --> 04:40.880
Africa, Nigeria, and I'm the community manager at Outreachy. Hi, I'm Sage Sharp. I use Dave M pronouns

04:40.880 --> 04:52.160
and I have one of the Outreachy organizers from USA. So we're going to go back to Outreachy history.

04:52.160 --> 04:58.960
Oh, right. Before I can tell you, I'm going to just quickly introduce why I wanted to help

04:58.960 --> 05:05.200
co-found Outreachy. I have a heart condition. I literally have a big heart. I used to think it

05:05.200 --> 05:10.400
was very rare, but it's actually quite common. I'm at a high risk of suddenly dying, and so I have a

05:10.400 --> 05:15.760
pacemaker defibrillator implanted in my body. I can't see the source code in my own body, and I was

05:15.760 --> 05:20.800
shocked unnecessarily once while I was pregnant, actually more than once, while pregnant because

05:20.800 --> 05:25.120
my heart was doing what a normal pregnant woman's heart does, but my defibrillator thought I was in

05:25.120 --> 05:30.720
distress. The only way to stop it was to take drugs to slow my heart rate down. And this made me realize

05:30.720 --> 05:36.560
that our technology may not be made for us despite the best intentions, and what are we going to do

05:36.560 --> 05:42.800
when that happens? And so I became really passionate about software freedom and learning about,

05:42.800 --> 05:47.760
like, as I've lived with this heart condition and I've participated in the free and open source

05:47.760 --> 05:54.960
software communities, it's become very clear that our software can never be made for everyone,

05:54.960 --> 06:00.480
unless it's made by everyone, unless everybody has a chance to contribute. And so this is where I

06:00.480 --> 06:05.200
sort of entered the role as I found out about my heart condition and started speaking about it.

06:05.200 --> 06:09.920
I became the executive director of the GNOME Foundation, where I met a woman named Marina

06:09.920 --> 06:18.560
Zurahinskaya. So this is a picture of Marina, this is me, ages ago, presenting the award to Marina.

06:18.560 --> 06:25.360
So Marina was a GNOME shell developer, and she was very involved in the GNOME community. And when

06:25.360 --> 06:35.120
the GNOME board evaluated their applications to Google Summer of Code, they noticed that

06:35.440 --> 06:41.120
out of 181 applicants, none appeared to be women, and they realized that there was a problem.

06:41.680 --> 06:50.960
And so the GNOME board eventually brought Marina in and said, what should we do about this? And Marina

06:50.960 --> 06:58.560
wanted to start a program to help address this issue. And so she looked back, and in 2006,

06:58.560 --> 07:03.760
the GNOME board had decided to do a summer outreach program, which they did a few internships,

07:04.720 --> 07:12.880
and it was a one-off thing. It was successful, the interns finished their internships, but none

07:12.880 --> 07:20.080
of those interns continued with the GNOME project, and it was just kind of left behind. And so Marina

07:20.080 --> 07:26.160
decided to reinvigorate that program. She is not on stage now, you're probably wondering. She's not

07:26.160 --> 07:31.840
on stage because she died of breast cancer last year, which is really tragic, but she leaves

07:31.840 --> 07:37.040
this amazing legacy that she created of outreach, and I'm so excited to be able to tell her story to

07:37.040 --> 07:46.240
you. And so in the 2009 guatech, there were so few women attendees that the GNOME board and Marina

07:46.240 --> 07:50.720
decided that this was the moment that we were going to pick this up and we were going to create

07:50.720 --> 07:58.240
this internship program. Raise your hand if you were at that desktop summit in 2009. Nobody!

07:59.200 --> 08:06.640
That's great! I'm so excited to tell you about it. No, it was a really interesting experience,

08:06.640 --> 08:15.360
and so the GNOME board went back with Marina and we decided to launch a new internship program,

08:15.360 --> 08:21.680
and Marina very thoughtfully tried to say, what are all of the ways that women are not participating

08:21.680 --> 08:27.520
in free and open-source software? Why don't they get started? And she systematically tried to address

08:27.600 --> 08:35.360
those issues, connecting interns with mentors and helping them make their first contribution. And so

08:35.360 --> 08:43.280
in 2010, the first outreach round, so this is the beginning of what we considered to be

08:43.280 --> 08:48.720
outreachy, and for a while we did the first round, the second round, and then we started using the

08:48.720 --> 08:54.400
months and years, because saying that you were part of the 13th round or the 15th round didn't

08:55.200 --> 09:00.320
make a lot of sense. So we started with that. If we could just go back to that previous slide.

09:00.320 --> 09:05.840
So if you notice, this program at the time was for women, and so you see we have this logo

09:06.480 --> 09:12.160
of this karate lady sticking her foot out, kicking forward. I love this picture, but it's very much

09:12.160 --> 09:21.280
of how the program started, very, very gendered. It was open to anyone who identified as a woman,

09:21.360 --> 09:28.320
and the program had interns, and it was a really amazing cohort for the next one. So in 2010,

09:28.320 --> 09:35.840
we had eight interns, and then you can see all these pictures that were of the interns at the

09:35.840 --> 09:44.480
different guatechs in the coming years. And so a community was starting to be formed, and one of

09:44.480 --> 09:48.640
the things that Marina did was she created meetups so that people could meet each other before a

09:48.640 --> 09:54.400
conference so that you could walk in there and know that you would have the confidence of knowing

09:54.400 --> 10:06.160
you had met someone before you entered it. So as RIT progressed, the internships again

10:06.160 --> 10:10.160
continued to be all with GNOME, and I was executive director of the GNOME Foundation,

10:10.800 --> 10:14.960
and the internships were so successful. The interns that came through the program

10:15.600 --> 10:21.680
were core contributors to GNOME. We had the GNOME planet, and so the interns would be blogging on

10:21.680 --> 10:26.480
the planet, and we would see their avatars, and people would come to Guantanamo and they would

10:26.480 --> 10:31.840
become so connected, and we realized that this was a program that really needed to expand beyond

10:31.840 --> 10:39.840
the GNOME project. And so I started talking with my friend Bradley Kuhn, who was the executive

10:39.840 --> 10:43.920
director of Software Freedom Conservancy. Now he works with me at Software Freedom Conservancy still,

10:44.720 --> 10:50.720
and Marina connected to Jessica McHeller of the Twisted Project, and Twisted was a Software

10:50.720 --> 10:56.720
Freedom Conservancy member project, and so we decided to do experiment and see if we could

10:56.720 --> 11:03.360
expand the internship beyond GNOME, and so we did, and it was hugely successful, and so we went

11:03.360 --> 11:10.320
from there and offered it to connect it to a lot of other member projects. So now today we tend to

11:10.400 --> 11:16.880
have 35 to 40 different free software communities and open science communities participating in

11:16.880 --> 11:22.240
each cohort. Yeah, we used to have a slide where we put all of the communities on it, but it just

11:22.240 --> 11:32.640
became too difficult to read. Yeah, so as Karen mentioned, originally in 2010, our criteria for

11:32.640 --> 11:39.520
who could participate in the internships was anyone who identified as a woman, and then in 2013

11:39.520 --> 11:46.080
we decided to expand that to make it more trans and queer inclusive, and we said the internships

11:46.080 --> 11:54.080
are open to women, both cis and trans, trans men, and gender queer people as well. I think in 2014

11:54.080 --> 11:59.280
or around around that time, we also started expanding tech companies published a lot of their

11:59.280 --> 12:05.040
data about their employees, and so we realized that in the United States we were able to expand to

12:05.040 --> 12:13.360
people of color who were underrepresented in the US tech industry, and I launched this effort to

12:13.360 --> 12:19.200
kind of try to expand outreach to country by country. I was talking to lawyers in France and

12:19.200 --> 12:25.760
lawyers in Australia, and we were starting to like figure out a way to expand place by place,

12:25.760 --> 12:31.840
and it was a lot of work and very difficult, and you know free software is global, and outreach

12:32.000 --> 12:36.080
participants were always global, the mentors and the interns, and it really didn't make a lot of

12:36.080 --> 12:42.880
sense to try to do that. Yeah, so instead of country by country, the internship criteria we have now

12:43.440 --> 12:50.320
is anyone who faces underrepresentation, systemic bias, or discrimination in the tech industry of

12:50.320 --> 12:58.400
their country. Now, how do we determine that? We've come up with a series of essay questions that we

12:58.480 --> 13:03.840
ask applicants, which is, you know, tell us which country are you going to live in during the

13:03.840 --> 13:10.560
internship? How are you underrepresented in that country? How has your learning environment been?

13:10.560 --> 13:17.040
Did you see people, you know, the last slide, the last talk, talked about role models. Did you see

13:17.040 --> 13:24.320
few role models who looked like you, who represented your identity and background, and then we talked

13:24.320 --> 13:30.400
about, you know, what systemic bias or discrimination have you faced both in while you're building your

13:30.400 --> 13:36.640
skills and if you were to apply for a job in the industry of your country, and so these essays over

13:36.640 --> 13:45.360
time we found ways to evaluate them in a global scale while still being, having, allowing people

13:45.360 --> 13:52.960
to talk about their experiences at a local level. I love this because we don't decide what it means

13:52.960 --> 13:59.040
to be discriminated. We don't decide what counts as discrimination. We don't, like, have a list of

13:59.040 --> 14:03.760
anyone who is subject to systemic bias. We don't have classes of people. We let people tell us

14:03.760 --> 14:09.680
about their own experiences and because we don't presume to understand every single experience

14:09.680 --> 14:16.720
of systemic bias, discrimination, and underrepresentation. So then we get into sort of middle history.

14:16.720 --> 14:21.520
Well, can I do one more ancient history? Because it's so exciting here at Bosnium. I was on this

14:21.520 --> 14:28.480
very stage in 2014 when I announced that Outreachy was coming to, well, it was rebranding, Outreach

14:28.480 --> 14:32.720
Program for Women was rebranding to Outreachy because it was no longer just for women, and we

14:32.720 --> 14:37.440
also announced that it was coming to Software Freedom Conservancy. The project outgrew the

14:37.440 --> 14:42.720
Gnome Foundation. You know, there were still only a handful of Gnome interns and the rest of the

14:42.720 --> 14:48.800
internships were with the Linux kernel and Wikimedia and Mozilla and a ton of other communities.

14:48.800 --> 14:53.760
And so the Gnome board and Software Freedom Conservancy and the Outreachy team all got

14:53.760 --> 14:58.560
together and we moved the program over to Software Freedom Conservancy where it remains today.

15:00.160 --> 15:05.680
So I got involved as part of Outreachy and I think it was was it 2014 or 2015?

15:05.680 --> 15:12.080
One of the two. I think 2014. I think 2014. Yeah. As the Linux kernel coordinator. So I originally

15:12.080 --> 15:19.360
helped find mentors in the Linux kernel. I connected them to Outreachy, got them prepared to

15:19.360 --> 15:28.160
help applicants during the contribution period. And then in 2016, I stepped up to become part of

15:28.160 --> 15:34.240
the actual Outreachy organizer team and passed off the Linux kernel coordinator position to someone

15:34.240 --> 15:45.040
else. So in 2015, we have opened up our program and said, hey, let's write these essays about

15:46.080 --> 15:55.200
the discrimination and bias that we face. We started having issues with reviewing those because we

15:55.200 --> 16:02.400
started to get thousands and thousands of initial applications and also a lot more communities involved

16:02.400 --> 16:12.080
too. So in 2017, I sat down with my spouse, Jamie, and he helped me understand a little bit of Django

16:12.080 --> 16:18.160
and we built Outreachy, a Django based website where mentors could sign up, where applicants

16:18.160 --> 16:26.800
could sign up and it really fits the the customness and fit what our our program was. And so big shout

16:26.880 --> 16:32.160
out to Django and Python and that wonderful community. And I want to say, like, this is a

16:32.160 --> 16:36.560
reflection of, you know, I talked a little bit about Marina and how she founded the program.

16:36.560 --> 16:42.000
One of the things that is the most impressive part of her legacy is that she built up this program,

16:42.000 --> 16:48.960
but then Sage came on board and she worked with them and she was able to transfer that knowledge

16:48.960 --> 16:55.680
and create a program that was robust and that could could exist without her. And so we're here on

16:55.680 --> 17:01.440
stage with this project that Marina really started with her personal passion, but that she thought

17:01.440 --> 17:06.640
about how it would continue without her. And so Sage coming on was this absolutely essential

17:06.640 --> 17:11.920
and then bringing all of this maturing the program. Yes, and I would say my role has been how do we

17:11.920 --> 17:20.480
scale. This is how do we scale. And so the next part was we really need to it to just be more than

17:20.480 --> 17:27.840
me and Karen at this point. And so we brought on Anna. My story about Alt Ritchie starts in early

17:27.840 --> 17:35.920
2017. I heard about Alt Ritchie from an Alt Ritchie intern working with Mozilla, she gave a talk, a

17:35.920 --> 17:43.120
lighting talk at a women technology conference in my city. And at the time I had the so crushing

17:43.120 --> 17:50.400
realization as these mechanical engineering major that as a partially sided person, I wouldn't be able

17:50.640 --> 17:56.880
to find a job in my state and when country, I had too many obstacles to face and to overcome.

17:57.840 --> 18:06.160
So I applied to the December 2017 cohort was accepted in my first try. And I had a really

18:06.160 --> 18:11.200
good experience in my internship. I had mentors who believed in me. And if you're seeing these,

18:12.320 --> 18:20.080
Beno and Johan, thank you. And the community was happy to have me as a member. It was a really

18:20.160 --> 18:26.880
transformative experience as one who faced ableism all my life. I had people who believed in me in

18:26.880 --> 18:34.240
my potential and didn't question whether I was capable or not of doing my job. And when you were

18:34.240 --> 18:40.880
switching careers through a program like this, you will experience something that's called a liminal

18:40.880 --> 18:48.320
moment. You are not the person who you were before it started and you are still not the person you

18:48.400 --> 18:56.800
were about to become. You are in between states. It's disorienting and scary. And you have to find

18:56.800 --> 19:03.120
yourself again at the end of the program. And that can be a really difficult task. Interestingly,

19:03.120 --> 19:10.960
when I joined Outreachy, Outreachy itself was facing a liminal moment. Things were changing. And

19:10.960 --> 19:19.040
we asked ourselves, what is Outreachy exactly? I remember when we created a Zulip server and we

19:19.040 --> 19:25.040
started connecting with interns by running bi-weekly intern chats about career in free and open source

19:25.040 --> 19:33.120
software conferences, et cetera. Interns were no longer experiencing their internship in isolation.

19:33.120 --> 19:37.840
And they were connecting to each other without depending on proprietary software or proprietary

19:37.840 --> 19:46.720
social media. That was when something clicked. What was once something more of a liminal online

19:46.720 --> 19:53.760
space where people would just go through with an adjacent community, it became a communal space.

19:54.560 --> 20:01.440
And with a communal space comes coexistence, the need of permanence and a sense of belonging.

20:02.240 --> 20:08.640
With a thriving community comes management's challenges that were beyond our capacity. At

20:08.640 --> 20:14.160
that time, we were just too few. And we published a call for a community manager.

20:22.640 --> 20:28.160
And I will say that before we posted the call for community manager, we tried to scale by

20:28.160 --> 20:33.760
improving our documentation. We said, okay, if we can't answer everyone's questions, if we can't

20:33.760 --> 20:39.040
answer all the applicants' questions, especially with so many, could we scale our documentation?

20:39.040 --> 20:47.440
And that worked for a while. But eventually, we said, no, we really need an actual person that can

20:47.440 --> 20:56.560
help us. Present day, yeah. So we can... So we're going back. What would you like to do?

20:57.280 --> 21:04.560
We can continue. All right. So present day, one of the things too is as we expanded,

21:04.560 --> 21:07.920
we really need to make sure that we could find additional funding.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.600
Right. So I want to... I do want to start by saying,

21:13.280 --> 21:19.840
Outreach was originally funded by corporate sponsorship, which was great. I definitely want

21:19.920 --> 21:26.640
to give a shout out to Google, which is the company that sponsored the first... Like all the

21:26.640 --> 21:31.840
first rounds and every round since then is the only company that has sponsored every single round

21:31.840 --> 21:38.640
of Outreach. Plus, they gave us a lot of help. The program is modeled in part after Google Summer

21:38.640 --> 21:44.320
of Code. And the Google staff has always been very supportive and helpful and has given us

21:45.280 --> 21:51.360
the information and assistance throughout. And I really also want to give a huge shout out to

21:51.360 --> 21:59.200
Red Hat because Marina worked at Red Hat and Red Hat contributed her time. It's safe to say that

21:59.200 --> 22:04.880
there would be no Outreach-y without Red Hat's contributions early and then continuing in those

22:04.880 --> 22:11.360
years after. But nonetheless, the program is not... We deeply appreciate our corporate sponsorships,

22:11.360 --> 22:20.480
but it is very tough on the program to have to continue to get corporate sponsorships and then

22:20.480 --> 22:25.360
to be responsive to the interests that a lot of companies have and want to put on internships

22:25.360 --> 22:33.040
that they're funding. And so in this period, we shifted a lot more to grant funding to supplement

22:33.040 --> 22:38.960
the corporate sponsorship. And that was really transformative to the program because we were

22:38.960 --> 22:45.280
able to plan a little bit more long term and Ford Foundation, ARDC and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative

22:45.280 --> 22:49.920
were the foundations that came in. I would like to say if any of you work at a company that

22:49.920 --> 22:55.440
want to sponsor Outreach-y, definitely get in touch. We really can use the support. We also

22:55.440 --> 23:00.960
have some individual funding support. And having that mix of funding is really important to be able

23:00.960 --> 23:06.080
to have the internships that we want to have. And honestly, being able to say no without having to

23:06.320 --> 23:11.040
think twice to a company that wants us to have an internship that's too tightly tied to one company,

23:11.040 --> 23:15.200
we're not going to do it. Having an internship that is not going to be a good experience for an

23:15.200 --> 23:20.160
intern, we're not going to do it. And having all that... Having this independent funding,

23:20.160 --> 23:26.000
we would have said no before, but it's even easy. It's very possible and easy to do it.

23:27.200 --> 23:32.640
And one of the interesting things that comes from grant funding is that we can decide, hey,

23:32.640 --> 23:37.680
there might be some initiatives that really need our support. And so one of the things that we did

23:37.680 --> 23:45.760
in 2020 was we started funding humanitarian free software. And so this is things like public lab

23:45.760 --> 23:52.720
that did citizen science and... Mobile lab. Mobile lab as well, which is a open science

23:53.760 --> 24:00.160
hacker space and biomedical research. All peer. Yes. All kinds of interesting things.

24:00.160 --> 24:05.200
And so these are projects that don't necessarily have enough funding on their own

24:05.840 --> 24:10.800
to support an intern. But because we were able to get grant funding, we could offer

24:11.680 --> 24:17.520
both funding for humanitarian open science... open source, and then eventually we moved to funding

24:17.520 --> 24:25.200
open science as well. So again, citizen science, scientific research, we had outreach projects

24:25.200 --> 24:32.640
that were actually looking at COVID at trying to estimate what was the hospital capacity with COVID.

24:32.640 --> 24:40.320
And so it was really a proud moment to be able to fund that kind of research. And then in 2022,

24:40.320 --> 24:46.800
we had our lovely community manager come in. Okay. So a little bit about where I was coming from.

24:46.800 --> 24:53.200
I have past experience working with marginalized population, supporting them, especially when

24:53.200 --> 24:58.960
it comes to their rights, when it comes to them receiving the rights supports that they need.

24:58.960 --> 25:05.600
And I also have past experience empowering people into tech through Sheikot Africa,

25:06.400 --> 25:12.240
coming up with programs, supporting them and standing in gap as an intermediary between them

25:12.240 --> 25:20.000
and also the organization. Then coming into R3C as a community manager, I now stand as an

25:20.000 --> 25:26.400
intermediary between the R3C applicants and the R3C community and the program itself.

25:29.040 --> 25:39.040
So I was veered the R3C social media platforms, supporting and also responding to R3C applicants,

25:39.040 --> 25:45.840
putting out contents that made the applicants, people who were interested in what R3C is doing,

25:45.840 --> 25:52.560
understand what R3C stands for. And also I was able to come up with coffee charts. So via

25:53.280 --> 25:58.320
R3C platforms as well, we were able to have real conversation, real life conversation,

25:59.280 --> 26:05.920
helping R3C applicants to understand the R3C program better and also bringing past

26:05.920 --> 26:14.240
interns, mentors, community coordinators to answer questions that the applicants have and also to

26:14.400 --> 26:21.360
share their experience through the R3C program. And I've also been able to create more awareness

26:21.360 --> 26:27.360
about the R3C program through attending and speaking at various conferences. This has really

26:27.360 --> 26:34.400
been awesome. Especially at different conferences, I was able to empower people, tell them about the

26:34.400 --> 26:45.200
R3C program and that has created a very good awareness about the program. And also this,

26:45.200 --> 26:57.840
I would say, has created a very good and resounding application. We have a big growth about R3C

26:57.840 --> 27:04.080
applicants from especially the African perspective, right? People coming not just to participate and

27:04.160 --> 27:11.280
also to give back to R3C. As you can see, we have zero interns from the African perspective at

27:11.280 --> 27:20.880
2010. And as at the December 23 course, we have over 44 African interns. So which means,

27:22.640 --> 27:30.400
so this way, folks from the African perspective now understand better that there's a space for them

27:30.400 --> 27:36.880
in the open source ecosystem. They are coming into this program to contribute and to improve

27:36.880 --> 27:42.720
open source and open science projects and also to give back to the R3C and the open source ecosystem

27:42.720 --> 27:49.600
in general. I want to say that before we had a solid program, an amazing program, but you gave it

27:49.600 --> 27:57.680
a voice, you gave it faces, the recognition it deserves. Thank you. And I'm grateful for that.

27:57.680 --> 28:04.080
Thank you so much. I would also like to add that since I joined the R3C program,

28:04.800 --> 28:10.640
folks have been, especially the applicants, they now understand the different parts of open

28:10.640 --> 28:16.080
source that they can contribute to, especially the fact that it's not just about the code part.

28:16.080 --> 28:21.760
They don't have to come into open source to maybe be a programmer. They can come into it to

28:21.760 --> 28:27.360
contribute and to give back in various perspective documentation, even event planning, community

28:27.360 --> 28:37.280
management, and so on and so forth. And also that because to the new R3C organizer. Yeah,

28:37.280 --> 28:43.920
we talked about a sense of belonging that comes with finding a community. Another thing that

28:43.920 --> 28:50.400
comes up often is this desire to give back. You offer a great opportunity. You want others to

28:50.400 --> 28:55.360
have access to similar opportunities that has happened to me. This is why I joined the outreach

28:55.360 --> 29:02.400
team back in 2018. We found that many interns come back as mentors, some as new mentors,

29:02.400 --> 29:08.880
some as experienced mentors. Either way, challenging situations require extensive support.

29:08.880 --> 29:14.720
And we decided that we needed someone dedicated to supporting and advocating for our mentors. Yes.

29:16.480 --> 29:23.440
After Omotolo's outstanding year of supporting applicants and interns, we hired Hilda Udufu.

29:23.440 --> 29:28.960
She is someone who has extensive experience with the program. She was an intern. She was a mentor.

29:28.960 --> 29:35.680
She was a coordinator all of it for public lab. And I'm proud to say that in turn I've become her

29:35.680 --> 29:42.080
mentor when she joined team. She's been facilitating conversations with mentors in office hours,

29:42.080 --> 29:47.600
having interviews with them so we can highlight their work, working hard and facilitating relationships

29:47.600 --> 29:53.600
between mentors and interns. And I think all of it is an indication of a phase of

29:53.600 --> 30:01.440
maturity within the program. We are not only looking for always growing. We are looking for

30:01.440 --> 30:08.240
growing sustainably and keeping our community flourishing. And I also love to add that Sage

30:08.240 --> 30:14.560
and Karen has mentioned how Astrochi has grown from, I mean the background of Astrochi and the

30:14.560 --> 30:22.880
growth so far. And with this we can also point out how Astrochi has grown in the aspect of not

30:22.880 --> 30:29.680
just why should we have Astrochi, but now to better support the applicants I come in as a

30:29.680 --> 30:35.440
community manager, right? And also we have Tilda. So Astrochi is not just supporting applicants,

30:35.440 --> 30:40.560
we are also supporting mentors. So because we understand that the program is not just about

30:40.560 --> 30:45.840
interns coming to contribute to open source, the program is also about people staying back in

30:45.840 --> 30:53.280
open source and also working together to give back to open source ecosystem. Yes, this is about

30:53.280 --> 31:00.240
open source sustainability as a whole, like the ability of us continually to exist as a community,

31:00.240 --> 31:05.200
supporting contributions and making sure that software still exists and still maintained.

31:05.840 --> 31:10.320
And I would say that you know you can look at the numbers of the people who find jobs

31:10.320 --> 31:14.160
that are contributing to free and open source software and the number of people who continue

31:14.160 --> 31:19.040
to contribute, but no matter where our interns go after that they always take the values of

31:19.040 --> 31:23.440
software freedom with them and they're exposed to software freedom and they take those values and

31:23.440 --> 31:29.760
they there's a follow-on effect from these internships. And I would say our interns have

31:29.760 --> 31:35.360
won awards, they've joined boards of directors, they've been mentors, grand mentors, great grand

31:35.360 --> 31:45.200
mentors and we see graduates of Outreachy everywhere. All right, so then the question becomes

31:45.200 --> 31:52.320
what's next for Outreachy? What is the future Outreachy? And the future of Outreachy maybe it's

31:52.320 --> 31:59.440
you. Maybe you would like to mentor, maybe you would like to coordinate. If you'd like to know

31:59.440 --> 32:04.640
more about Outreachy you can come and ask questions, but also there's a bough in

32:06.640 --> 32:18.480
AW121 at 1300 or 1pm and if you'd like to come talk with us, figure out how to get involved,

32:18.480 --> 32:23.280
we would love to hear you, we would love to hear what you're doing in free software and

32:23.280 --> 32:28.720
come connect with us. If you're interested in being signing up as a free software community,

32:29.440 --> 32:35.920
the deadline to sign up as a community is February 15th, so please do check out our call

32:35.920 --> 32:42.560
for mentors and communities. This is a celebration, you know, we're celebrating the fact that we got

32:42.560 --> 32:50.560
to this point and we can only do it with you really. We are actually gated generally by the

32:50.560 --> 32:57.760
number of mentors that we can find, so we we shield for funding already, but realistically most of

32:57.760 --> 33:05.440
the time it's finding enough mentors to provide those internships and so you know really that's

33:05.440 --> 33:10.320
that's all of you who are here, you're you're you know enough to be here. Actually raise your hand

33:10.320 --> 33:15.920
if you're here and it's your first FOSDEM. Wow so it's like it's like a third of the room, that's

33:15.920 --> 33:22.880
great. So yeah you know I think one of the things that I'm most proud about Outreachy is that it's

33:22.960 --> 33:28.640
a real grassroots program, like it's something that we started by offering something really

33:28.640 --> 33:35.440
pragmatic, like just offer internships, have that work pair interns with mentors and have them learn

33:35.440 --> 33:43.360
and then we've just been growing it slowly. I remember when when we started back in the day

33:43.360 --> 33:48.640
and I was a new executive director there were a lot of diversity initiatives coming up at the time,

33:48.640 --> 33:55.360
it was like very fashionable to start diversity initiatives and there were like programs getting

33:55.360 --> 34:01.360
millions of dollars based on glossy work you know glossy brochures that they had made

34:02.720 --> 34:08.800
having not done anything in the past, but we found it Outreachy with the different mentality with the

34:08.800 --> 34:14.400
with the bottom up free and open source software mentality of we're going to do the work and then

34:15.200 --> 34:20.960
if people find it valuable then the resources, the time and the money will come after and so

34:21.520 --> 34:30.320
we can't you know it's Outreachy is our thousands of volunteers and I'm proud that it is itself a

34:30.320 --> 34:36.480
free software project. And also we want to like tell folks that are listening to us that you can

34:36.480 --> 34:42.400
support Outreachy in several ways. You can go back to your local communities to tell the story of

34:42.800 --> 34:50.480
Outreachy to become an advocate of Outreachy. Tell folks who can be part of Outreachy as an

34:50.480 --> 34:57.040
intent to apply to the Outreachy program. You can also contribute to Outreachy right through your

34:57.040 --> 35:02.720
various communities, your various projects by bringing your projects as I mean your community,

35:02.720 --> 35:08.800
you can be a mentor, you can come in as a community coordinator right and you can also

35:09.760 --> 35:15.520
support Outreachy by going back to create more awareness about the Outreachy program. So tell

35:15.520 --> 35:20.720
folks about Outreachy, you tell your communities about Outreachy, bring your projects to Outreachy

35:20.720 --> 35:25.040
and you can also partner with Outreachy in various ways. So you can reach out to us if you want and

35:25.040 --> 35:31.040
connect with us right. We have you can connect with us later today to ask us questions, discuss

35:31.680 --> 35:36.720
ways, several ways that you can contribute to Outreachy. Additionally, we may not have the

35:36.720 --> 35:42.800
capacity to work as a mentor, but you may have the capacity of reviewing pull requests, of

35:42.800 --> 35:50.080
reviewing contributions made by the applicants. Communities need it so much, they get so overwhelmed

35:50.080 --> 35:55.280
with our applicants and they will be great help if we could help them. Yeah, even if you have

35:55.280 --> 36:01.680
experience with any particular community that's involved with Outreachy going to help out and

36:01.680 --> 36:07.840
answer questions in the community chat, that is a great way to help those communities.

36:09.200 --> 36:16.400
Questions? No, we're going to the thank yous because there's a lot here. Yeah, so I don't know if we...

36:17.360 --> 36:21.120
I don't think we want to read all the thank yous. No, we're not going to. I want to highlight a few

36:21.120 --> 36:27.680
people though. I definitely want to... We've already talked about the organizers and the reviewers

36:27.680 --> 36:35.920
and all of our volunteers. I definitely need to... We always joke that Outreachy is like a

36:35.920 --> 36:42.240
python swallowing a goat. There is so much logistical work to be done to manage Outreachy.

36:43.120 --> 36:49.680
It is huge and so we want to thank the Conservancy Accounting and Logistical

36:49.760 --> 36:54.880
and Financial staff including Bradley and Roseanne. And also...

36:58.400 --> 36:59.040
They're amazing.

37:01.840 --> 37:09.280
And I also really want to thank Roseanna who is on the... It says Gnome Board. Oh, and the Gnome Board.

37:09.280 --> 37:14.800
Right, Roseanna who did that logistical work at Gnome and helped launch the program. We want to

37:14.880 --> 37:20.560
thank the Gnome Board because there were times when running a program like this is difficult.

37:21.440 --> 37:27.760
It's a lot. Yeah, and we've had our times where there's been misinformation and people attacking

37:27.760 --> 37:34.640
the work that we do beyond calling us names and threatening us. And it's been really stressful.

37:34.640 --> 37:41.360
And the Gnome Board spent a lot of time making sure that they were defending the program and

37:41.360 --> 37:46.400
supporting it. And then I also want to applaud them for realizing that it had outgrown the Gnome

37:46.400 --> 37:53.040
community and that it made sense to move it to another organization. The Outreachy leadership in

37:53.040 --> 38:02.320
the past, Cindy Polaris and also Tony Sebro who is now on SFC's board and was our general council

38:02.320 --> 38:08.400
and is still involved with Outreachy. Justin Colonino who has given us pro bono legal help

38:08.400 --> 38:13.680
actually from Outreachy's inception has been supporting us with legal work. Ropes and Gray

38:13.680 --> 38:24.320
who gives us pro bono legal work, Otter Tech and also Owen Taylor and Jamie Sharp.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.960
I did read most of them, I'm sorry. But they deserve it.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.520
All right, so.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.680
So we can take some questions if anyone has any questions.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.440
All the microphones so we have to share one here.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.280
It is so hard to hear in this room, so you have to speak really loud.

38:54.640 --> 39:01.200
Okay, first of all, a huge big thank you. It's hard to overstate the value of what you do.

39:09.280 --> 39:15.600
And because it is so valuable, my question is, so in the end you kind of dodged the topic a bit

39:15.600 --> 39:24.880
about the future. So my question would be, since it's so valuable, how can you transcend from an

39:24.880 --> 39:31.760
organization that depends like so many others on the efforts of some individuals for survival

39:31.760 --> 39:37.680
into something that is actually hard to stop, that has a life on its own that you couldn't

39:37.760 --> 39:39.120
shut down if you wanted to.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.960
Is that for me? Yeah, that's you.

39:43.520 --> 39:48.320
I mean, they're pointing at me to answer that question, which you know, I'm executive director,

39:48.320 --> 39:54.000
so I have to like be the visionary of this program, you know, like, and give that voice.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.920
But I do have an answer after you.

39:56.640 --> 40:02.400
But Sage will have the answer. No, I mean, I think that the whole point of it being a grassroots,

40:03.200 --> 40:09.600
like free and open source software project is that we grow sustainably, we grow slowly,

40:09.600 --> 40:14.880
and we grow carefully. We bring stability. We've been working for the last five years on redundancy,

40:14.880 --> 40:18.960
so making sure that we have a team that isn't going to completely burn out.

40:19.920 --> 40:24.560
It's so much work to do this program. I don't know how Marina did all of those logistics.

40:24.560 --> 40:29.920
She basically did them herself for a really long time, and she maintained all of these wiki pages

40:30.000 --> 40:34.480
where she wrote down the names of, she just stayed in touch with every outreach intern

40:34.480 --> 40:38.320
and like wrote down where they went to work because she ran into them in a, you know, in the hallway.

40:38.320 --> 40:44.160
So like what we've done is with Anna's help and Sage's help, and now what Matola's told us

40:44.160 --> 40:49.760
is to make that a lot more systematic. So we've got a robustness so that if any one of us is no

40:49.760 --> 40:56.960
longer part of the program, it has a life of its own. I think too, to bring in some of the values

40:56.960 --> 41:05.600
of free software, what we have done in Outreachy is we have talked to different communities and

41:05.600 --> 41:10.800
learned what are the best practices for being inclusive, for onboarding new members,

41:10.800 --> 41:16.560
for designing projects for interns, and we've documented that. So if you look at the Outreachy

41:16.560 --> 41:22.640
documentation for mentors and communities, there's a lot there of knowledge that we have learned

41:22.720 --> 41:30.320
that was siloed across different communities. And so even if Outreachy goes, I think we still have

41:30.320 --> 41:36.720
impact on those communities. Our documentation, our knowledge sharing, the lessons we've learned

41:36.720 --> 41:41.840
will move on. And so I think in the future, we'd like to be a little more vocal about why we design

41:41.840 --> 41:47.120
the program specific ways, how we be more inclusive and coach our communities on that.

41:47.920 --> 41:54.800
And I think too that the grant funding companies that want to fund the Outreachy General Fund rather

41:54.800 --> 42:00.560
than specific internships is going to be the way forward. So we keep pushing our sponsors

42:00.560 --> 42:07.920
towards that and hoping that they'll allow us to make sure that our team continues and also that

42:07.920 --> 42:13.200
we can decide which communities have the strongest interns and allocate funding that way.

42:13.200 --> 42:20.240
We have a dream of having an open mentorship alliance with other mentorship programs. We know

42:20.240 --> 42:25.840
we are not the only ones and there are many, many more that do things differently, but they are as

42:25.840 --> 42:34.560
important and as fundamental to the open source system. I would also say that like historically,

42:34.560 --> 42:40.960
we have improved something about Outreachy every single round. Like the idea is that the whole

42:40.960 --> 42:45.120
point of like free and open source software is that no one and nothing is perfect, right? And so

42:45.120 --> 42:49.120
we've been changing something every round. If you have feedback for us about things that could be

42:49.120 --> 42:52.960
made better, we would love to hear it because we're looking at it ourselves and so we expect to

42:52.960 --> 43:04.080
change and improve. I was also going to add to that, but it's also really nice to see all four of

43:04.080 --> 43:08.960
you on stage and also the diversity of the organizer group as well as really I think a special part

43:09.040 --> 43:13.920
of this, but my question is kind of actually building on what you Anna said about the mentoring

43:13.920 --> 43:18.480
side. So I'm definitely seeing a challenge in a lot of open source communities and projects around

43:18.480 --> 43:23.680
that mentoring side. General on how do you do mentoring and how do you scale mentoring in a

43:23.680 --> 43:30.560
community? So my question is like from your perspective and doing all of this kind of working

43:30.560 --> 43:36.720
so closely with projects and working with mentors, what are the greatest challenges that you see around

43:36.720 --> 43:42.240
mentoring and mentorship and open source? And do you have all the answers? No, do you have any ideas

43:42.240 --> 43:47.760
or tips about what you think the open source movement needs today to grow and scale mentoring?

43:49.760 --> 43:56.000
I can think of some like cultural differences, the way you talk to someone in Brazil may be

43:56.000 --> 44:03.760
different from the way someone talks to another in the United States or in Nigeria. So conciliating

44:03.760 --> 44:09.120
those differences when you are doing asynchronous communication, for example, you can create a

44:09.120 --> 44:16.480
lot of conflict with some. Another one is safeguarding. This is something that some mentors have told me,

44:17.040 --> 44:23.840
especially when we work with more marginalized communities. It's difficult to ensure, it can be

44:23.840 --> 44:30.720
challenging to ensure that everyone is in a safe environment. We had some folks that had some really

44:30.720 --> 44:37.280
challenging lives at home and needed safeguarding. And that can be a difficult situation, both for

44:37.280 --> 44:43.440
the mentor and the intern. So having the psychological support for both of them is important and also

44:43.440 --> 44:54.240
challenging. And I think as well for mentors, I think having a pathway to mentorship is important.

44:54.240 --> 45:02.560
I think a lot of people assume, hey, I have to be a maintainer for five years to be a mentor.

45:02.560 --> 45:09.600
And so finding ways to define a path towards mentorship that doesn't feel like you have to be

45:09.600 --> 45:16.160
an absolute expert. So one of the things we've been trying to do in our outreach chats is talk about

45:16.160 --> 45:22.240
what does mentoring mean? How do you get to be a mentor and emphasize you don't have to know

45:22.240 --> 45:27.360
everything? And so with Outreachy, what we've done is we've encouraged people to co-mentor.

45:27.360 --> 45:33.440
So you've got someone who is more experienced in the project and someone who has just been in

45:33.440 --> 45:39.520
intern, either Outreachy, Google Summer of Code, and they shadow the mentor. They're starting

45:39.520 --> 45:46.960
helping out. We're training mentors. And so figuring out how to create those pathways is going to help.

45:46.960 --> 45:53.040
It's difficult to aspire to be something if you don't even know that is a possibility to be that

45:53.040 --> 46:00.960
something. And also to add to what Sej just mentioned, the Outreachy organizers, especially the mentor

46:00.960 --> 46:09.520
support, to that we have been able to come up with different initiatives to support mentors

46:10.240 --> 46:15.600
from the contribution stage. We understand it's not easy from the contribution stage to

46:16.160 --> 46:22.080
getting feedback at every point during the internship to our mentors office accession.

46:23.360 --> 46:28.880
Because we want to understand the various challenges that the mentors face, we want to be able to

46:28.880 --> 46:36.000
support them. Sometimes we also want mentors to come together through our coffee chats with mentors.

46:36.000 --> 46:41.600
And even of his accession, we want mentors to be able to discuss with one another from different

46:41.600 --> 46:48.240
communities to state the challenges they are facing, to learn from another mentor from another

46:48.240 --> 46:54.560
community, how they've been able to address these challenges. That way, happy mentors learn from one

46:54.560 --> 47:00.880
another. I would say also you commented on our diversity as organizers, but one of the strengths

47:00.880 --> 47:06.640
of the program is recognizing that the burden of bringing diversity to free and open source software

47:06.640 --> 47:10.880
shouldn't rely on the people who are underrepresented. And so,

47:13.760 --> 47:18.480
and so, mentorship is a great way to be an ally, right? It's a great way to shift that burden.

47:18.480 --> 47:23.360
And so, like, you know, I think that's when one of the strengths of the program over time is that

47:23.360 --> 47:28.320
it's a great way to get folks that are not subject to systemic bias who are not underrepresented

47:28.320 --> 47:36.240
to help bring people up. I think, do we, do we have time for one more question? Or are we?

47:37.360 --> 47:44.080
We're done. We're out of time. Thank you so much for joining us. Thanks for supporting our

47:44.080 --> 47:48.800
reach. Have a great bottom. Thank you.
