WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
All right, awesome. Thanks everyone. Thanks for joining us today. So my name is Ruth Cheesy

00:09.800 --> 00:13.680
and I'm going to be talking a bit about how we went through the process of changing a

00:13.680 --> 00:18.480
governance model in the Mortec project. So if you haven't come across Mortec before,

00:18.480 --> 00:22.360
it's an open source marketing automation. We've been around for about 10 years. I'm

00:22.360 --> 00:26.480
going to talk much about what Mortec does, but we've got a stand in H block. So if you

00:26.520 --> 00:31.880
want to come and chat with some of the community will be over there. So yeah, I'm project lead

00:31.880 --> 00:36.960
from Mortec. I'm also co-founder of the Women in Open Source community. You can connect with me

00:36.960 --> 00:41.560
on LinkedIn by zapping that QR code, but the slides should also be on the FOSDEM website

00:41.560 --> 00:46.600
afterwards. So if you need to check something, you can check all the links that I mentioned

00:46.600 --> 00:51.680
and everything is up on the FOSDEM website. So let's start off by talking about what we

00:51.680 --> 00:56.240
actually mean by governance. So in open source for me, governance can be something as

00:56.320 --> 01:00.880
simple as like a few paragraphs on a piece of paper or in a bigger project. It can be a lot

01:00.880 --> 01:06.880
more complicated, but ultimately it's about talking about how power structures operate

01:06.880 --> 01:12.800
within your projects, how decisions are made, how interaction happens within the project

01:12.800 --> 01:18.600
and also ultimately talking about steering the human collaboration and software evolution

01:18.600 --> 01:25.600
in your project. So where do we come from Mortec as a project? Well, we were originally

01:26.400 --> 01:31.760
what I call a corporate backed open source project and what I mean by that is one company

01:31.760 --> 01:37.760
backing the project and all of the governance is around that one company backing the project.

01:37.760 --> 01:44.760
So we were founded in 2014, GPL3 and in 2016 the founder created a SaaS company providing

01:44.760 --> 01:50.720
the software to Enterprise. In 2018 we had our first ever community lead release, so

01:50.800 --> 01:56.000
it was the first time someone led a release who wasn't an employee of the SaaS company.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
2019 the SaaS product was acquired by a company and rolled into their marketing suite along

02:03.280 --> 02:08.000
with the brand, the trademark and everything to do with the project and community. And

02:08.000 --> 02:13.320
then in 2020, so soon after that, we started to make a governance model to make it clear

02:13.320 --> 02:17.800
what actually the company involvement was, what the community involvement was and how

02:17.880 --> 02:23.160
we made decisions collaboratively. And this is what that first model looked like. So you

02:23.160 --> 02:29.660
can see at the top here, these pale blue are, they must be a member of the company, the

02:29.660 --> 02:35.480
dark blue colors are, they must be a member of the community and then the gray ones here

02:35.480 --> 02:40.200
are anyone. So it could be company, it could be community. So there was quite a lot of

02:40.200 --> 02:44.600
corporate involvement in there mainly because the company wanted to steer the project and

02:44.640 --> 02:49.080
support the project. This was developed in collaboration with the community but very

02:49.080 --> 02:56.080
much designed by the company to make sure that they had still had a say in the project.

02:56.600 --> 03:02.080
So the key decision making structures we had here was the company. So the company actually

03:02.080 --> 03:07.520
owned the trademark and they gave the community the ability to use those trademarks. And they

03:07.520 --> 03:13.160
also employed the project lead, which was me at the time. And they chose the company

03:13.200 --> 03:20.200
representatives of the council. The project lead was hired by the company and the job was

03:21.400 --> 03:27.120
to kind of steer the project in the right direction to organize the community, to remove

03:27.120 --> 03:33.620
any roadblocks but also be the bridge between the company and the community. And then we

03:33.620 --> 03:37.960
also had a community council which I showed there. So four people from the company, four

03:37.960 --> 03:42.440
people from the community dealing with issues that went across the project. So they weren't

03:42.480 --> 03:46.800
just to do with one particular team but there were things that were slightly more complex

03:46.800 --> 03:51.600
or maybe needed a bit more thought before they were interacted. But for all intents and

03:51.600 --> 03:58.280
purposes those community representatives were the team leads when we first started.

03:58.280 --> 04:03.040
So we didn't have enough people active. We just kind of said if you show up then you

04:03.040 --> 04:10.040
can be the team lead really. So in April this last year, the company informed of the company

04:12.520 --> 04:15.960
that they weren't actually able to support us at the same level that they were supporting

04:15.960 --> 04:22.480
us to that point. And so things needed to change basically. And because of that we needed

04:22.480 --> 04:28.160
to find a way to go forwards that wasn't going to involve being backed just by one company.

04:28.160 --> 04:32.000
So the first thing we needed to decide was what's the fiscal structure going to look

04:32.000 --> 04:38.440
like for the project? How are we actually going to organize ourselves? How are we going

04:38.480 --> 04:44.680
to manage the governance? Things like that. So the way we made this decision was initially

04:44.680 --> 04:49.440
going away and doing an awful lot of research, looking at what other open source projects

04:49.440 --> 04:53.760
are doing, what other projects have changed their governance models over time and how did

04:53.760 --> 04:59.680
that work out for them? And bringing that all together in an idea of some proposal that

04:59.680 --> 05:03.880
I would take to the council. And at this point it was only me who knew that this was happening

05:03.920 --> 05:09.480
with the company. So some of the options were maybe looking at joining a foundation or joining

05:09.480 --> 05:14.240
an umbrella organization that could support us. But what was important with this is that

05:14.240 --> 05:18.400
we were able to still be autonomous, that we still had the ability to decide how we

05:18.400 --> 05:25.400
did things and what tools we used and so forth. So there were pros and cons to that approach.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.920
Another option that was in front of us was we were at that point using Open Collective

05:31.960 --> 05:37.240
to manage finances. So if we ran an event, we had somewhere for the money to go. We were

05:37.240 --> 05:42.920
only using it for finances. So there was also the option of expanding what we were using

05:42.920 --> 05:48.800
them for to provide some of the services that the company gave us. So like holding trademarks,

05:48.800 --> 05:53.480
holding our assets, employing the project lead, providing legal support. So that was

05:53.480 --> 05:59.680
another option that was open to us. And then also creating our own nonprofit organizations.

05:59.720 --> 06:06.720
Creating something ourselves that was maybe a 501 or a nonprofit CIC in the UK that would

06:07.160 --> 06:10.680
deliver all of those things that I just talked about and we would be able to do that from

06:10.680 --> 06:16.720
our open source project. Put them on nonprofit organizations, sorry. So some of the resources

06:16.720 --> 06:22.000
that I found useful in this process that are up here. So governing open is a really great

06:22.000 --> 06:25.760
starting point. If you're having to think about governance, there's got lots of resources

06:25.800 --> 06:30.480
and links off there that can get you going. There's also a really great one from the

06:30.480 --> 06:37.120
Python organization, PEP 802, which explains the governance models of lots of different

06:37.120 --> 06:42.560
open source projects. How they've changed over time. What went well, what went wrong,

06:42.560 --> 06:47.120
what was difficult. That was a great source of, they're not all the same kind of projects

06:47.120 --> 06:52.680
as us, but they were encountering similar kind of problems. And FOS governance, if you need

06:52.720 --> 06:57.240
any kind of document, whether it's a code of conduct, a privacy policy, what don't

06:57.240 --> 07:02.240
agents we accept, a governance model, there's absolutely loads of awesome resources there

07:02.240 --> 07:07.560
and you can also upload your resources. So you can share your resources as a to do for

07:07.560 --> 07:12.720
me to actually upload the new governance model, come done like that. And also don't underestimate

07:12.720 --> 07:16.080
if you're going through thinking about this, the power of the network. There's just so

07:16.080 --> 07:21.880
many people who took my calls when I was like, I need to speak to people about this to get

07:21.920 --> 07:28.920
some ideas. Gave me some good contacts, pointed me towards specific things that would help

07:28.960 --> 07:33.560
in this process. So if any of you are those people who I spoke to, thank you so much because

07:33.560 --> 07:38.280
it really did help. So once I'd kind of come up with, well, those are the three things

07:38.280 --> 07:43.400
that we could go for. And as project lead, these are the pros and cons, I think, for

07:43.400 --> 07:49.080
those things. I shared it with our council and then later shared it with our team lead.

07:49.120 --> 07:53.640
So the council and then the assistant team leads as well. So we're at 10 of us at this

07:53.640 --> 07:57.480
point tossing around the ideas of what are we going to do and what do we think is going

07:57.480 --> 08:02.840
to work for the project. The challenge of course with anything in open source is reaching

08:02.840 --> 08:07.840
a consensus. People had views on what was going to be best for now, what's going to

08:07.840 --> 08:13.200
be best for the long term. But ultimately we were able to come to a consensus together.

08:13.200 --> 08:18.000
And that consensus was that we wanted to actually become an independent open source project

08:18.040 --> 08:24.280
to use open source collective more and to refactor our governance model accordingly.

08:25.480 --> 08:32.000
So that news was shared in April. You can read the independence blog post there. And

08:32.000 --> 08:35.760
actually it was one of those moments where you hit publish and you're not quite sure

08:35.760 --> 08:39.920
what the response is going to be because you all believe in it, but you're really hoping

08:39.920 --> 08:46.200
everyone else is going to too. And it was a really positive response. So some of the

08:46.240 --> 08:50.240
things that we learned from this is language really matters. We're a massive international

08:50.240 --> 08:57.120
community and we are invited people who we trusted from our main communities to translate

08:57.120 --> 09:01.360
that important announcement so that people in the local communities could understand

09:01.360 --> 09:05.560
actually what that meant in their local language. And they really valued the fact that we'd

09:05.560 --> 09:11.920
taken the time to do that. So major communications it was really helpful. We also had a lot of

09:11.960 --> 09:17.480
people who either did not care at all, which I couldn't really understand, but some people

09:17.480 --> 09:21.080
don't care about governance. They just want to use your product. Some people who work

09:21.080 --> 09:25.560
the other end of the spectrum who really cared a lot and were extremely passionate. And then

09:25.560 --> 09:29.800
some people in the middle. So I guess I'd say that the lesson learned is like you've

09:29.800 --> 09:34.160
got to be prepared for all of them, not just the positive, but also the negative criticism

09:34.160 --> 09:40.040
that comes with that. And also being available. So in this stage it was really helpful to

09:40.080 --> 09:45.320
have opportunities. We had webinars with a translator for our Brazilian community, for

09:45.320 --> 09:51.000
our German speaking community, where people could actually hear what the changes were,

09:51.000 --> 09:56.280
what it meant for them. And then they had the chance to ask questions. It also was really

09:56.280 --> 10:00.200
helpful to have an open door office hours where people could literally just drop into

10:00.200 --> 10:04.960
a Zoom call and talk with me or talk with the team leads directly about whatever they

10:05.000 --> 10:06.480
wanted to talk about.

10:09.920 --> 10:15.320
Okay, so one of the features we had to think about when we were actually creating this

10:15.320 --> 10:20.480
governance model, once we decided what the structure was going to look like, was do we

10:20.480 --> 10:25.080
actually need a hierarchy at all? So someone in the community was saying, actually, I think

10:25.080 --> 10:29.680
we should have a completely flat organization structure. I don't think we need to have leadership

10:29.680 --> 10:33.960
and councils and things like that. We did a lot of research on that. We couldn't actually

10:34.000 --> 10:41.000
find any organizations in larger open source projects that had that structure. We didn't

10:41.360 --> 10:46.040
think that was going to be practical for us over the long term to not have some kind of

10:46.040 --> 10:51.040
organizational hierarchical structure. So we did investigate that, but we actually decided,

10:51.040 --> 10:56.320
yeah, we do think we still want to have structure. But we decided that some of the structure we

10:56.320 --> 11:00.080
already had was actually working alright. So like the teens and the working groups was

11:00.120 --> 11:05.440
working alright. The council was working okay, but it wasn't democratically elected. It was

11:05.440 --> 11:11.440
chosen. And so we wanted to change that so that it was actually chosen by the community.

11:11.440 --> 11:16.040
We didn't have a step in between the council and the teams where the community got to discuss

11:16.040 --> 11:21.280
and debate changes, which then go to the council to be introduced. So that's what we introduced

11:21.280 --> 11:28.280
with the general assembly, which is a collaboration of members who can decide and debate, and then

11:28.520 --> 11:33.160
things go to the council to be enacted. So that was the structure that we kind of came

11:33.160 --> 11:38.800
up with for the project. But the next step was if we vote in a council, how do we make

11:38.800 --> 11:42.080
sure they don't all disappear at the same time? Because we're going to be doing this

11:42.080 --> 11:47.720
at a specific moment in time. And for this, we took inspiration from the Python Software

11:47.720 --> 11:52.760
Foundation. So we did an election. We had people voting, and then we ranked them. So

11:52.760 --> 11:57.640
the top three people did three year terms. The next two people did two year terms, and

11:57.640 --> 12:02.320
the next two people did one year terms. So that worked really well. The community found

12:02.320 --> 12:06.860
that really positive. We did have two people right on the border who got the same number

12:06.860 --> 12:10.480
of votes. So we just had a conversation who wants to do three years, who wants to do two

12:10.480 --> 12:16.240
years. But that seemed like a really good way of us kind of making sure that we have

12:16.240 --> 12:21.360
fresh blood coming into the council as well. And then who actually manages the project

12:21.360 --> 12:26.000
lead? Because they were employed by the company, and now they're employed by the community.

12:26.040 --> 12:31.040
So who manages that? And ultimately, we decided that that would be managed by the council.

12:31.040 --> 12:37.440
So that would be like they would be reporting into the council, basically.

12:37.440 --> 12:41.000
Some of the things we also had to think about was how do we make decisions? Because although

12:41.000 --> 12:46.520
we made decisions, obviously we've made decisions. It wasn't really explicitly clear how long

12:46.520 --> 12:52.120
we give for what different types of decisions and what methods we use. This was also a subject

12:52.200 --> 12:56.760
that we did lots of research on. We did need to find a way to do voting and to make the

12:56.760 --> 13:02.240
voting fair and to make it a system that we could easily roll out a vote for anything,

13:02.240 --> 13:07.680
basically. So we ended up using an open source tool called Decidim, which we've implemented

13:07.680 --> 13:13.320
at community.mortic.org, which allows you to have a voting system. It also lets you do

13:13.320 --> 13:17.920
events and meetings with transparent notes using EtherPad. And that's actually worked

13:18.000 --> 13:24.080
really well. So that's the tooling that we actually implemented to do the practical voting.

13:24.080 --> 13:27.880
And then once you have voting, it's like, well, who gets to vote? And this again was

13:27.880 --> 13:34.160
quite a contentious subject. What we decided was that we would have different ways of you

13:34.160 --> 13:39.480
being eligible to vote. One is financial. You throw some money, you get to vote, $100

13:39.480 --> 13:44.720
a year, or you can use the Big Mac index, which proportionately reduces the amount based

13:44.760 --> 13:49.320
on the comparative cost of a Big Mac. You can Google it as by the economist. We already

13:49.320 --> 13:53.400
use that in other places in the project and people find it helpful. So we just use the

13:53.400 --> 13:59.360
same system we were already using. Contribution based approximately five hours a month, consistently

13:59.360 --> 14:04.840
over three months. They can apply to be contribution based member. Corporate based where we have

14:04.840 --> 14:11.840
tiers from $1,200 a year up to $30,000 a year. An honorary membership for people who've

14:12.800 --> 14:18.400
done extraordinary contributions to the project. So those are the membership types that we

14:18.400 --> 14:24.000
decided on. So once you've got the types and what have you, people then started saying,

14:24.000 --> 14:30.120
but I do more contribution than him and I want to have more say. So here be dragons,

14:30.120 --> 14:36.560
like this is a really difficult thing to get your head round. It can get very complex very

14:36.640 --> 14:43.240
quickly. It can be exploited very easily. So we just decided one member, one vote. So whether

14:43.240 --> 14:49.760
that's a human individual member or a corporate, they get one vote. And that works because

14:49.760 --> 14:55.480
they have one account on our community portal and there's one member in our membership list.

14:55.480 --> 15:01.840
And the membership list is who has the ability to vote. So that kind of simplified it. People

15:01.880 --> 15:07.160
wanted to get really complicated, but we have to start somewhere. And then how are decisions

15:07.160 --> 15:12.160
made? This one we actually decided, well, trivial decisions, we don't want to rat red tape

15:12.160 --> 15:18.160
random. If it's trivial and you don't, it's not going to impact many people and it's reversible,

15:18.160 --> 15:22.800
just make the decision. Talk about it amongst yourself, make the decision. If it's non-trivial,

15:22.800 --> 15:28.080
like how many tracks should we run at a conference or who should we invite as a speaker? Or if

15:28.120 --> 15:31.880
there's a code situation where there's a few different options, but they don't have

15:31.880 --> 15:36.960
major impact if you take one or the other and it can be reversed. Then we say that's

15:36.960 --> 15:43.280
a 36 hour time box, taking into account holidays and things like that, but generally 36 hours.

15:43.280 --> 15:48.400
And if it's a significant decision, which impacts several teams or the whole project

15:48.400 --> 15:54.080
or it has financial impact or it's not easy to reverse without there being significant

15:54.120 --> 16:01.120
consequences, at least two weeks time box. And those decisions happen on the portal.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.360
So that everybody who's on the portal sees things happening, they see the discussions,

16:05.360 --> 16:10.920
they can be involved in the decision making process. And then ultimately we try to get

16:10.920 --> 16:17.480
to a point where we come to a consensus. We default to lazy consensus. So if nobody has

16:17.480 --> 16:22.640
given an opinion and the time box that elapses, decision is made. If they have, we try to

16:22.680 --> 16:27.600
find a way to bring their feedback in so everyone feels like they're on board or they can at

16:27.600 --> 16:34.600
least disagree and commit, you know, the best thing. So how do we come to the final version

16:35.360 --> 16:42.360
of the governance model? Discussions happen very, very fast. So we had a channel on Slack

16:42.360 --> 16:46.840
for the governance discussions. I could go in there in the morning and there'd be like

16:46.840 --> 16:51.520
250 more messages in a thread and you're just like, how on earth can I keep up with this?

16:51.560 --> 16:57.240
If you come in completely fresh, it's really hard. So we tried to summarise this in a Google

16:57.240 --> 17:01.960
doc and each day someone would take on to write who had given what views and what the

17:01.960 --> 17:06.680
discussions were. So it made it easier for someone coming in to actually get an overview

17:06.680 --> 17:12.160
of where we were at. When we got to a point where there was a first draft, I posted it

17:12.160 --> 17:17.160
up on the forums. I explained that this is a first draft of a governance model. Anyone

17:17.200 --> 17:21.680
else is welcome to submit another one. This is the one that we've been working on. And

17:21.680 --> 17:26.280
the important bit is that we could see down here, we chunked each section of the governance

17:26.280 --> 17:32.600
model, which was quite lengthy, into separate forum topics. So you could go and discuss

17:32.600 --> 17:37.600
the membership section or you could go and discuss the council section and provide your

17:37.600 --> 17:42.360
feedback there. And then based on the feedback and suggestions, we could update that initial

17:42.400 --> 17:48.280
thread and people could see where we were at. And then we collated all of those back.

17:48.280 --> 17:53.000
So this was time box. We did actually have to extend it by two weeks because people said

17:53.000 --> 17:58.080
there was too much to discuss and too much to make decisions on in two weeks. So we extended

17:58.080 --> 18:03.800
it to four weeks. And then once that was done, the positive thing about having it on the

18:03.800 --> 18:10.120
forums is our community are marketers predominantly. So on Slack, they won't be following it. But

18:10.160 --> 18:14.440
when they go and say, my mortar can sense is broken, or I can't send this email, they're

18:14.440 --> 18:19.080
going to the forums. So they're coming past this post in the forums. So we actually got

18:19.080 --> 18:22.960
more people involved that wouldn't normally be involved in these discussions.

18:22.960 --> 18:28.920
Then we posted the final version basically for two weeks for people to review the whole

18:28.920 --> 18:33.920
thing. And if there's still things that they were worried about, they could respond to this

18:33.920 --> 18:39.400
thread. And I highlighted all the bits that had changed from the first draft and why they

18:39.440 --> 18:44.360
had changed. So some had changed from the forum. Some had changed from a panel that we did at

18:44.360 --> 18:51.280
our conference, but it was easy for people to check. So in this stage, long live the time box.

18:51.280 --> 18:57.680
I think it was Angie Webchick who was like, time box everything when I first started as community

18:57.680 --> 19:02.920
manager. And that's so true. Like giving people a fixed window and saying, we will make a decision

19:03.200 --> 19:09.320
at the end of this time box. Delegating the research as well. So delegating research, if

19:09.320 --> 19:14.280
somebody's really interested in something, ask them to go and research it and bring it back.

19:14.280 --> 19:18.360
And then you haven't got to do it yourself. So we've had some people who are super passionate

19:18.360 --> 19:25.240
about decision making, and they went and did all of the research on that. I am the worst person

19:25.240 --> 19:30.520
for complicating things. So keep it simple. Yeah, with governance, it can easily get really

19:30.560 --> 19:36.760
complicated. But we kept on saying, what's the core of what we're trying to achieve with this?

19:36.760 --> 19:43.200
And how can we get rid of some of the fluff that doesn't need to be there? And also these ones,

19:43.200 --> 19:47.840
go where they are. So as many places as you can, talk about this governance stuff that you're

19:47.840 --> 19:54.720
trying to do. Social media, sending emails, talking at conferences, talking in person. We

19:54.720 --> 19:59.760
actually had some code of conduct infringements because of this, because people got so emotive

20:00.200 --> 20:06.680
about something that they really believed in. It doesn't mean that you don't obey the code of

20:06.680 --> 20:11.800
conduct. And I think modeling the behavior you want to see is really important. So when someone

20:11.800 --> 20:16.280
was disagreeing with something, one of the most useful things I learned to say was, you know what,

20:16.280 --> 20:22.880
I'm about six out of 10 that we keep this because x, y, z. Or I'm two out of 10 about this. I think

20:22.880 --> 20:28.160
it's kind of nice, but I'm not too worried. And then people have the language to understand and

20:28.200 --> 20:34.280
communicate themselves how passionately they are thinking about this thing and why. So you can

20:34.280 --> 20:40.600
then kind of get into dialogue. And yeah, draft early, iterate often, be ready to chuck it in the

20:40.600 --> 20:45.760
bin, but get something on paper because otherwise it just turns into this big nebulous discussion

20:45.760 --> 20:52.560
that never actually becomes anything. And it can be very frustrating. So where are we at now? It's

20:52.560 --> 20:57.560
been a longer process than I would have hoped for, mainly because of the community engagement. It

20:57.680 --> 21:02.640
takes time to get people to engage, to get people to give you thoughts, and then to kind of go

21:02.640 --> 21:08.880
through that process. But actually we've done all right. So we published the final draft at the

21:08.880 --> 21:14.720
end of July. We launched our membership model where people could become a member in August. In

21:14.720 --> 21:20.400
October, the community portal came out of Beta. So it was in Beta for about a month where a couple

21:20.400 --> 21:27.000
of teams were using it. And then in December, we had our extraordinary general meeting where we

21:27.240 --> 21:32.800
inaugurated the council who had been voted through the nominations process and we adopted the new

21:32.800 --> 21:41.560
governance model formally. So far we've had about 150-ish people joined the portal. We've had 44

21:41.560 --> 21:48.960
financially contributing and 14, actually it's more like 48 now, 14 practically contributing who

21:48.960 --> 21:53.040
have joined us members who have a practical contribution route. We've also got people who've

21:53.080 --> 21:59.240
paid and they're eligible practically, you know, but whatever if they want to pay them, great. We

21:59.240 --> 22:04.720
had the voting on the portal which was really successful. And also what we do is all of our

22:04.720 --> 22:09.840
meetings. So team meetings, working group meetings, everything happens on the portal. People can

22:09.840 --> 22:14.160
join on the portal. They get the link. The notes are taken there so people can see the notes from

22:14.160 --> 22:19.920
the meeting when they finish. And it's been really good actually. It's really been like a central

22:19.960 --> 22:27.200
place for all things community. So going forward for us as an open source project, what's next is

22:27.200 --> 22:32.000
financial stability. This is the biggest thing that we're working on right now because we don't

22:32.000 --> 22:36.720
have the backing of a big corporate anymore. We need to do this all ourselves. So we're exploring

22:36.720 --> 22:41.760
lots of different revenue streams, membership, but also having a trial system where people can

22:41.760 --> 22:46.240
try the software for two weeks. And if they wish to continue, they go into a contract with a

22:46.240 --> 22:52.240
provider, but we get a 40% revenue share for the first year and the 30% for the second and so forth.

22:52.240 --> 22:58.480
It decays down. So we're trying to be creative in exploring ways that we can offer value and also

22:59.040 --> 23:04.960
get the money. We're very much focusing on product adoption. So our kind of adoption is like this,

23:04.960 --> 23:10.880
which is great to see, but we need to continue. It is a competitive sector in the proprietary world.

23:10.880 --> 23:15.440
There's not much competition in the open source world, but we're still kind of moving forwards.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.800
And also from the product development process, we're 10 years in, but we're dealing with an

23:20.800 --> 23:26.720
immense amount of technical debt. So it's also kind of making the product more stable and introducing

23:26.720 --> 23:32.560
many more features. And then finally, what we're really trying to move towards is transparent by

23:32.560 --> 23:38.560
default. We do do that quite well and we have done that quite well since 2019, but basically

23:38.560 --> 23:44.000
every time a leadership role expires, it's voted on through the portal. Every time we have to make

23:44.000 --> 23:50.160
a decision, let's take that debate to the portal instead of having it in Slack, on GitHub, wherever,

23:50.160 --> 23:56.160
have it on the portal and then it's centralized. And also, yeah, making use of voting. So any

23:56.160 --> 24:01.280
time we need to actually practically have a vote on something, we now have a system that we can do

24:01.280 --> 24:08.640
it through. So that's me done. I think I'm just in time. Hooray! Yeah. Thank you.

24:16.400 --> 24:21.200
If you have a stand, as I said, on HBlock, so if you want to know anything about Morte, come and

24:21.200 --> 24:28.720
chat. Questions? Any questions? I'll come back up. Oh, Lord. You're going to get your steps in today.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.560
So thank you for your talk. I would like to ask you, how do you manage

24:37.600 --> 24:46.080
like liability against law? And how do you, who is deciding the salaries, like the

24:46.080 --> 24:52.480
levels, the salary levels and stuff like that? So one of the biggest expenses we've had in this whole

24:52.480 --> 24:59.040
process is legal. So we had to, an open source collective who was our fiscal host, have legal

24:59.120 --> 25:03.440
experts who are specialists in open source. So we use their services to get the right contracts

25:03.440 --> 25:07.680
for transferring the trademarks and all of that stuff. And they also review all of our trade,

25:07.680 --> 25:12.000
all of our contracts that we sign because they have to be signed by the fiscal host, not by us.

25:12.800 --> 25:18.240
In terms of what was the other question? How do you deal with? Salaries. Salaries. Okay. Yeah.

25:18.800 --> 25:23.280
How do we deal with salaries? Yeah, thorny subject because I'm paid by the community and I set the

25:23.280 --> 25:30.560
salary. And I did that like three years ago, not knowing this is going to happen. What we did,

25:30.560 --> 25:35.520
we did lots of research at that point about what open source projects paid as an hourly rate

25:35.520 --> 25:40.480
and also comparing them with what we could actually afford to pay. It was when we were

25:40.480 --> 25:45.920
migrating from symphony four to five, we had big projects that needed a contractor to do because

25:45.920 --> 25:51.200
we couldn't find people in the community. And we just set an hourly rate and it's very low compared

25:51.200 --> 25:56.640
to big projects. It's $40 an hour, but that's what everyone gets paid in the project. We want to

25:56.640 --> 26:01.200
use the sliding scale at some point. There's a proposal being put to the council soon to investigate

26:01.200 --> 26:06.240
that. But yeah, with that comes a warning because I live in the UK and that will probably end up

26:06.240 --> 26:11.520
being a lot more for the project. So do we really want to do that? But that's how we've done it.

26:11.520 --> 26:19.920
So yeah, anyone else? Hello. Thank you for your presentation. I was wondering

26:20.800 --> 26:26.160
what is the emotional impact of going through a process like that? And if you have any tips or

26:26.160 --> 26:31.760
tricks, how to navigate it? The emotional impact? Yeah, because I'm guessing you will have to have

26:31.760 --> 26:39.440
some difficult talks. Yeah. Because I think you care about having a fair governance.

26:41.840 --> 26:45.520
I think you need to have your own house in order if you're going through this kind of,

26:46.080 --> 26:50.160
like in terms of you need to be able to know yourself well, because it does get

26:50.160 --> 26:56.320
emotive, especially if you are the founder or if you are involved. In terms of dealing with

26:56.320 --> 27:01.680
other people, in dialogue with other people, I think a lot of it is people are very passionate.

27:01.680 --> 27:07.360
So it's trying to understand what it is that they are getting emotional about and why they're

27:07.360 --> 27:12.240
passionate about it. And how can we find a way for that to come into something if it's not

27:12.240 --> 27:17.040
constructive, come into some constructive way of taking the bits that are really helpful.

27:19.120 --> 27:25.520
But yeah, just trying to be mindful of your own stuff and not projecting that onto other people

27:25.520 --> 27:30.160
when they're coming to you with ideas you don't agree with. I don't know if that is,

27:30.160 --> 27:38.000
it's kind of a non-answer, but yeah, sorry. Scott, one more question. I'm fascinated by the

27:38.000 --> 27:45.520
voting system that you have. Projects have problems with people coming in and leaving quickly.

27:45.520 --> 27:50.000
You said one person, one vote. How do you make sure they stick around? Do you have any way of

27:50.000 --> 27:54.320
like saying, hey, we're doing this, but like, can you speak more to the voting process to it? Because

27:55.040 --> 28:02.960
projects always have a problem with that type of system. Yeah, so part of the thing that we've

28:02.960 --> 28:08.080
done is like for voting, you need to be a member and that is linked to a financial benefit to the

28:08.080 --> 28:13.440
project because you need to either pay or contribute so the project's benefiting. Do you mean in terms

28:13.440 --> 28:18.480
of how do you get people to care enough to vote? Yeah, I kind of like, I mean we put money into it,

28:18.480 --> 28:24.000
but sometimes it's cool that I don't really care, but I need your voice to suggest or know.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.960
Yeah, so like people have said they've joined but then they don't really care enough to vote.

28:31.040 --> 28:36.240
A lot of it is to do with one-to-one engagement or not one-to-one but one-to-small engagement,

28:36.800 --> 28:41.040
making sure that people are aware why it's important to vote on that thing and you've got to accept

28:41.040 --> 28:46.640
that some people won't care. But it's, I think it's like using that emotive language and trying to

28:46.640 --> 28:51.920
explain like this is your opportunity to have a say in this thing. We actually had probably

28:51.920 --> 28:57.520
20 people become individual members because they wanted to vote for their favorite candidates in

28:57.520 --> 29:01.760
our election for example. Another thing we're going to do is a template contest where you have

29:01.760 --> 29:06.240
to be a member to upload the template for example. So we're trying to do things like that to get them

29:06.240 --> 29:13.440
into the system, understanding how it works so it's very easy to use. So thank you very much,

29:13.440 --> 29:16.720
Shavu, they really appreciate that. And if you've got any other further questions I know you gentlemen

29:16.720 --> 29:20.880
do, but they'll have to be outside in the hallway after the transfer bit to spot over the room. So

29:20.880 --> 29:29.360
thank you very much.
