WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:34.520
Alright y'all.

00:34.520 --> 00:38.520
We are going to start here in just a moment.

00:38.520 --> 00:41.720
I'd like to introduce you to Nahara.

00:41.720 --> 00:45.000
Nahara, I tried, I really did.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.140
She is coming from Estonia.

00:47.140 --> 00:51.360
She loves some free software, data protection, geopolitics, and wondering about different

00:51.360 --> 00:53.480
cultures and countries.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.320
She also spends some time doing photography and some perfumery.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.080
Now that's interesting.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.000
She's a certified scuba diver.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.840
We've got multiple athletes today.

01:02.840 --> 01:03.840
This is awesome.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.560
This is truly awesome.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.560
Take it away.

01:06.560 --> 01:07.560
Thank you.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.800
Thanks everybody.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.880
And welcome to Vostim.

01:11.880 --> 01:12.880
Good evening.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.200
My name is Nahara Ika.

01:14.200 --> 01:18.840
And I work as project manager at Free Software Foundation Europe.

01:18.840 --> 01:24.000
And today I'm going to also be speaking as a consortium member of the Zoom project, which

01:24.000 --> 01:26.400
is funded by the European Commission.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.400
And it basically aims to integrate the three O's.

01:30.400 --> 01:36.320
Open hardware, open data, and open software into an innovation-driven policy.

01:36.320 --> 01:40.560
So first off, I'm going to set the agenda for today.

01:40.560 --> 01:47.320
Since my talk is based on the AI license proliferation, based on ethical considerations, I'm going

01:47.320 --> 01:53.160
to start with how openness is also an ethical consideration, followed by the reasons for

01:53.160 --> 01:58.560
engaging with free software, and what open AI should mean in practice versus its current

01:58.560 --> 01:59.880
state.

01:59.880 --> 02:05.320
And finally, I'll end with what are the imposition of additional behavioral restrictions by licensing

02:05.320 --> 02:08.280
and the implications.

02:08.280 --> 02:15.720
So first of all, the concept of openness is subsumed in the definitions provided by Free

02:15.720 --> 02:21.160
Software and Open Source by FSF and OSI respectively.

02:21.160 --> 02:26.520
And Free Software provides you with four freedoms, that is, the freedom to study, use, share,

02:26.520 --> 02:27.520
and improve.

02:27.520 --> 02:34.000
So essentially, anybody can use and distribute Free Software by way of a license, a software

02:34.000 --> 02:39.080
license, in a non-exclusive manner.

02:39.080 --> 02:43.280
Then there are multiple reasons for engaging with Free Software.

02:43.280 --> 02:49.520
Primarily, proprietary licenses, as you know, are fundamentally incompatible with each other.

02:49.520 --> 02:54.680
But Free Software licenses are well standardized, well documented, and have widths to the complex

02:54.680 --> 02:56.240
legal issues.

02:56.240 --> 03:05.360
And so the C2Ca tail the problem of license proliferation by making it more legal interoperable

03:05.360 --> 03:09.840
and also by making license adoption easier.

03:10.560 --> 03:19.120
Yeah, and if you're talking about ethics, then Free Software also helps in providing,

03:19.120 --> 03:21.840
or rather, promoting digital garments.

03:21.840 --> 03:31.760
It helps to promote altruism, democratization of knowledge, and reciprocity, most importantly.

03:31.760 --> 03:38.480
And now, if you just put this concept into AI systems, then Free Software also helps in

03:38.480 --> 03:45.960
promoting accessibility, transparency, fairness, explainability.

03:45.960 --> 03:46.960
So yeah.

03:46.960 --> 03:53.760
Okay, so then AI systems don't really operate as traditional software.

03:53.760 --> 03:59.600
There are multiple interconnected components, as you see, training data, model architecture,

03:59.600 --> 04:06.680
and they require distinct development process and rely mostly on specialized resources in

04:06.680 --> 04:09.840
the hands of a few big tech companies.

04:09.840 --> 04:17.080
So the ideology of Free Software is essentially mapped into the concept of open AI, but we

04:17.080 --> 04:24.080
must be wary about the fact that AI is built differently than a traditional piece of it.

04:24.080 --> 04:27.840
And so there are a lot of components at play here.

04:27.840 --> 04:33.200
So sometimes the code around the model could be open source or Free Software oriented,

04:33.240 --> 04:36.760
but say the model isn't open source.

04:36.760 --> 04:43.240
So it's fundamentally not the same as a traditional software.

04:43.240 --> 04:48.880
And so what is particularly concerning is the popularization of the term open when it

04:48.880 --> 04:51.840
comes to AI systems.

04:51.840 --> 04:58.080
If you must apply the spirit of the traditional definition of Free Software and open source,

04:58.080 --> 05:05.000
then we must not forget the key pillars that actually make it open, which are transparency,

05:05.000 --> 05:08.160
reusability, oversight, and enablement.

05:08.160 --> 05:13.400
So now transparency in the context of AI could mean the ability to access the source

05:13.400 --> 05:16.480
code or read the source code.

05:16.480 --> 05:24.040
Reusability could mean to enable any third parties to reuse the code, the data or documentation.

05:24.040 --> 05:31.040
Reusability is basically enabling the ability to inspect and verifying the source code or

05:32.640 --> 05:39.640
the documentation or rather even data about configuration of the AI system.

05:39.680 --> 05:46.080
And enablement is basically by disclosing sufficient details of how the AI is built in order to

05:46.080 --> 05:53.080
enable a third party to rebuild the same AI system provided that given the fact that

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
necessary computational resources are provided and these should be identified by the community

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
building of the AI.

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
Now as you know, the concept of open AI is pre-encombered.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.400
That is primarily due to the fact that the definition of AI systems itself is not clearly

06:16.400 --> 06:20.720
defined, which would change of course with the AI Act.

06:20.760 --> 06:26.480
But the concept of openness in AI is also not clearly defined.

06:26.480 --> 06:33.480
Now OSI has taken a great initiative in this regard by defining open source AI and while

06:34.400 --> 06:40.440
doing so, then not only endorsing the four traditional freedoms as provided by FreeSoft

06:40.440 --> 06:47.040
Fed, as you can see from the definition itself, but they're also trying to widen the spectrum

06:47.040 --> 06:54.040
of the definition by including diverse types of AI technologies.

06:54.360 --> 07:01.360
And as you see, it also says that they support the efforts on these issues, including appropriate

07:01.800 --> 07:08.300
government regulation when it comes to having ethical component built into the definition

07:08.300 --> 07:10.300
itself.

07:10.300 --> 07:17.300
So until a really important addition to this is the fact, and I take immense pride in saying

07:19.180 --> 07:25.780
this, that leading members of the Zoom consortium are also cooperating and collaborating towards

07:25.780 --> 07:27.100
this effort.

07:27.100 --> 07:34.100
So I'm hopeful that we would have a comprehensive definition of openness in AI, which would

07:34.380 --> 07:41.380
really enable all AI users to use licensing schemes appropriately.

07:41.900 --> 07:48.900
So until we have a definition that's been finalized as regards openness in AI as concerned,

07:50.460 --> 07:56.500
what we see is that AI labeled as open actually exists on a long gradient.

07:56.500 --> 08:03.500
Now on one end of this gradient, as you see, we have a handful of maximally open AI systems

08:03.540 --> 08:06.900
such as Luther AI.

08:06.900 --> 08:12.900
It's a nonprofit and it has licensed its model under Apache 2.0.

08:12.900 --> 08:18.100
There's also GPT-New York that is built and developed by Luther AI.

08:18.100 --> 08:22.500
And it's also made all its model weights and parameters.

08:22.500 --> 08:29.500
Also the documentation and the data around its training and configuration absolutely

08:29.700 --> 08:31.220
publicly accessible.

08:31.660 --> 08:38.660
Whereas on the other hand, you have AI systems like Lama 2, which basically claim themselves

08:40.260 --> 08:45.340
by Meta, which claim themselves to be open source.

08:45.340 --> 08:52.340
But Ashley Forbid uses from its use to build other language models.

08:53.460 --> 09:00.460
They also provide meaningless or rather not a very meaningful description of the language

09:01.220 --> 09:08.220
definition or some kind of transparency regarding the data that's being used to build the AI system.

09:09.540 --> 09:16.540
So yeah, well, now given the fact that there's any lack of definition, what we see is that

09:16.540 --> 09:19.420
openness actually exists on a long gradient.

09:19.420 --> 09:26.420
And if we need to use the term open or free, we need to actually conform to the principles

09:27.340 --> 09:34.340
provided by free software and open source software, which take with them a rich history

09:34.540 --> 09:40.540
of 40 years of success in having control over software.

09:40.540 --> 09:47.540
So, in the last decade, what we observe is that there's been few diverse groups and individuals

09:49.900 --> 09:56.180
who've departed from using free software licenses exclusively to creating certain licenses

09:56.180 --> 10:03.180
that actually prioritize restrictions on the use and distribution of software.

10:03.980 --> 10:08.860
And this primarily relate to field of endeavor, behavior, community management, commercial

10:08.860 --> 10:11.980
practice and ethical compatibility.

10:11.980 --> 10:18.980
So for instance, in 2021, there was Hippocratic License 3.0, which was developed and released

10:19.980 --> 10:26.980
by OES, and this specifically prohibits its use for the use of free software in violation

10:29.180 --> 10:32.700
of the universal standards of human rights.

10:32.700 --> 10:37.860
And this practice has now also spilled over to creation of sewer motor ethic codes for

10:37.860 --> 10:44.860
AI systems, and that has led to the creation of AI licenses with restrictive additional

10:45.740 --> 10:47.540
behaviors.

10:47.540 --> 10:53.900
For example, we have Lama 2 by Meta, and as you see, they have an entire appendix dedicated

10:53.900 --> 10:58.820
to a lot of prohibitory uses.

10:58.820 --> 11:04.660
There's also a similar list by Big Science Opal Rail M license.

11:04.660 --> 11:10.780
And so essentially, what are the implications of use of these licenses with additional behavioral

11:10.780 --> 11:11.940
restrictions?

11:12.380 --> 11:19.060
Now, as I see, it also basically creates barriers against use and reuse.

11:19.060 --> 11:24.540
As I've just displayed, there are certain terms and conditions which are absolutely

11:24.540 --> 11:31.540
ambiguous, and what happens is that the use of these wake terminologies create a very

11:31.740 --> 11:38.460
overarching prohibitory use for downstream integration and application of AI systems.

11:38.500 --> 11:44.060
And hurdles to adaption and improvement, this is basically by unauthorizing derivative

11:44.060 --> 11:47.900
work or by prohibiting copy left licenses.

11:47.900 --> 11:51.140
Hindrance to control over technology.

11:51.140 --> 11:58.140
So the consequence of this long gradient of openness of AI has led to the users not having

11:59.540 --> 12:06.060
appropriate control over the technology because of, you know, by blocking interoperability.

12:06.060 --> 12:10.980
And yeah, a weakening of oversight and transparency.

12:10.980 --> 12:16.740
So proprietary AI systems could also be transparent, but free software basically provides the ability

12:16.740 --> 12:22.140
to rep the source code and also improve it.

12:22.140 --> 12:27.620
And this also helps to minimize the discriminatory effects of AI systems.

12:27.620 --> 12:34.620
So in conclusion to our contribution to the Zoom project, we majorly recommend for recommendations

12:36.340 --> 12:40.460
to everyone first is preserve openness in AI.

12:40.460 --> 12:44.820
Now there's been a dissonance amongst the marketing pitch of these AI efforts versus

12:44.820 --> 12:50.900
restriction to software freedom, and this disables control, transparency, and oversight

12:50.900 --> 12:52.380
over technology.

12:52.380 --> 12:56.860
So there is an imperative need to preserve the openness.

12:56.860 --> 13:02.300
Then we talk about keeping licenses interoperable with free software licenses.

13:02.300 --> 13:08.780
Now the emergence of dedicated AI licenses is perceived as a national progression and

13:08.780 --> 13:11.100
a well-desired phenomenon.

13:11.100 --> 13:17.700
We only plead in the bargain is that these licenses should actually be interoperable

13:17.700 --> 13:24.540
with the free software licenses so that we actually make the AI systems reusable, accessible,

13:24.540 --> 13:26.820
and sustainable.

13:26.820 --> 13:30.180
And yeah, talking about ethical compliance.

13:30.220 --> 13:35.780
Ethics is actually deeply rooted in societal values, which actually differ from jurisdiction

13:35.780 --> 13:37.540
to jurisdiction.

13:37.540 --> 13:48.540
So in order to actually apply any ethical restrictions, we need to be very, very careful before embedding

13:48.740 --> 13:51.540
these into technologies.

13:51.540 --> 13:57.100
Any kind of restrictive practices based on ethical considerations should be under the

13:57.180 --> 14:01.140
purview of law and regulation and not licensing.

14:01.140 --> 14:07.140
Schemes because licenses aren't a substitute for regulation and they cannot be a substitute

14:07.140 --> 14:11.260
for good governance and for legislation.

14:11.260 --> 14:14.140
So yeah, with this I'd like to wrap up my talk.

14:14.140 --> 14:19.820
I hope it was insightful and I hope the message is loud and clear.

14:19.820 --> 14:27.180
If you call yourself as an open, licensed, following the principles of open-source software

14:27.180 --> 14:35.180
or free software, we should and we must respect the freedoms that it comes or it rather provides.

14:35.180 --> 14:36.180
So yeah, thank you.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.380
Unfortunately, we don't have time for time for any questions.

14:45.380 --> 14:46.380
Yes.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.380
Yes.

14:48.380 --> 14:52.220
All right, we will be starting with Steph here in just a couple minutes.

14:52.220 --> 14:53.380
So don't go in too far.

14:59.380 --> 15:00.380
Yes, sir.
