WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:25.000
Welcome to the first VIP room for Boston.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Yeah, cheers.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
There we go.

00:29.000 --> 00:39.000
Our first speaker today is William Jones. He comes from the South Hampton, Utah.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
Believe it or not, he loves someone half the house of strong men, so that's all really cool.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
And he's recently taken up some bouldering to site really hurting someone the first time he ever did it.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
I've got to say, I am very interested in this talk and please, will take it away.

00:58.000 --> 01:20.000
Applause

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
Right here, right here, over here. I think I'm just trying to hear it.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Even louder.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
No, that's even worse.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
Over here, maybe sound, sound better. Here, let me see here.

01:50.000 --> 02:02.000
I think it's better to be loud.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
I just want to say, I'm really really interested in this talk.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I'm really curious.

02:08.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm just wondering, but Ken is close to the door because people are coming in like so much more than he's already in his room.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm not sure if the door doesn't lock.

02:20.000 --> 02:24.000
So if you were here first, you could drag and hit the little button to open it.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
So if you want people to keep knocking on the door, it will lock you in.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
So let's start to hear.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
I think it's better to be loud.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
No, I'm just wondering.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
I'm just wondering.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm just wondering.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm just wondering.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
I'm just wondering.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
I'm just wondering.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
I'm just wondering.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I'm just wondering.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
I'm just wondering.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I'm just wondering.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm just wondering.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
I'm just wondering.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
I'm just wondering.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
I'm just wondering.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
I'm just wondering.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I'm just wondering.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm just wondering.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
I'm just wondering.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I'm just wondering.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I'm just wondering.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm just wondering.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
I'm just wondering.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
I'm just wondering.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
I'm just wondering.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I'm just wondering.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I'm just wondering.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
I'm just wondering.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
I'm just wondering.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I'm just wondering.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I'm just wondering.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm just wondering.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I'm just curious?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
I'm just wondering.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
I'm just wondering.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I'm just wondering.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
How well have you been talking to habenson recently.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Can you share your thoughts on y한테 Lancer Boiq announced?

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Which cablebomber maybe?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
I was concerned for the end of the day,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
which was when Linda had talked about lived and lost.

03:52.000 --> 03:59.000
So let's have a look at what we did today.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.000
So we've got A, we've got schedule day at Torse,

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
there's a little gap between our Torse,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
so possibly using it for me,

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
and then have a finish up,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
taking a web page and just checking

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
if we're finding any of us involved.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
We've tried very hard to keep this beginning better than we did today.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
I think it's about just focusing on everybody

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
and all the other systems who we need to walk away with something to do.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
And we also really want to keep it in the resource areas.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
We've done just one or a bunch of tools,

04:24.000 --> 04:27.000
which we like to use in AI, but we like to exhaust it.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
That's the normal goal of today.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
In terms of the design of the day,

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
we've done it the day after this is over three months.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
We have some technology and technique talks at the start.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
We have some of the sort of schooling talks in the middle,

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
slightly in there.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
And we have some centre like community talks at the end.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
So, that's what we're doing today.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
That's five minutes from my 30th install.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
So, we're the best discussion we've ever had to talk to,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
said that we wouldn't be able to save

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
the three new productions to AI, which is very...

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
And I still have some innovations of why this is the one

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
that I want to do this.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
And what I'm very interested in is the not start

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
with a set of innovations, something like AI,

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
which is a television, which is like that.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
These people obviously have their own business,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
but I just don't think it's much of a thing to do

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
or do anything at the time.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
So, what I like to do is then,

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
or move the technical point of interest

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
through this, where this kind of thing is important at the moment.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
So, to do that...

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
Yeah, well, I don't think it's this,

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
but I was just wondering,

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
so, how could we, from that to today,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
look at AI and AI, which is a core of what we're doing

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
as we're doing this in the world?

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It's not going to be what it's not going to be.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
And what we're going to try to do is understand things.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
But especially, what is it all about what we do

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
with AI and AI, which is a new giant,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
that's about the large,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
it's a data-all-like-large population data

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
from a small size of data.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
And I don't think having to go to AI

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
is a more complicated thing to do in general,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
if I give you the time,

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
because I want to understand how hard-working

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
all sorts of engineers are in the world, then.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
That's quite an evil thing to do,

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
the population of software engineers is high,

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
that's quite mean.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Even if I could ask them how hard they go,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
if I'm going to give them an answer,

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
I'll use the last thing.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
So there is a fully-invented times

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
when we want to do this,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
actually we might want to give it up now,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
just a while.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
It's understanding about large populations,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
large size of data,

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
it's just a niche,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
it's something we have to do in the most every case,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
and it's still a problem that we're solving

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
with AI and AI.

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
And the motivation is

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
that sort of thing,

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
if you find that in the case of all the

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
sustainability problems of explosion,

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
and what this is about,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
is about how

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
even data sets with not many innovations

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
not always exist in there,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
will, because of the way these inventions

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
are defined in the total way,

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
and are made absolutely massive,

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
and they can be at a small scale.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
So, let's do an example of that,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
and let's see,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
in the case where the man tonight

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
has an idea of where he needs to work on.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
So, okay, I want to understand

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
how the artist is going to get to work on.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
That's something that's unsaid

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
and it's difficult to measure,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
because I'm going to tell you honestly.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
But, what I can do is that

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
I need to know how you can do that

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
in a way that's, okay,

08:02.000 --> 08:03.000
there's a lot of people on the internet

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
who have been there,

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
which is because they work with art,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
so maybe what you do to do it

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
how hard the solution is to work,

08:09.000 --> 08:12.000
is to see if you want to see those

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
sort of a new job,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
and, okay, I can propose this

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
by the digital age, okay.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
But, then, I need to understand

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
how the solution works,

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
and I could either guess that

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
as something I could do,

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
or I could do, say,

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
I'm a digital learning,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
which I'm learning how the solution is.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
And, if I could do that,

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
that's okay, that's something I could do.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
I probably want to make it go on,

08:42.000 --> 08:43.000
but then I have to do power

08:43.000 --> 08:44.000
to get the solution up something.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
So, I want to make it go on,

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
but if I propose this,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
you can literally do a,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
and how hard it would work

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
if I at least had something

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
that was not made,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
or I made a problem

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
with what kind of a band

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
maybe it's something that's been

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
made by me,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
or maybe you know what I'm saying.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
That's, and all of these things

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
would be perfectly possible,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
and they would be a huge commitment.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
However, when I unfortunately go away,

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
and I find that shockingly

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
actually the most important thing

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
that people find is that

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
you're not working hard,

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
so you're not doing this

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
in a relationship to your job.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
And, this is a whole line

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
of explaining, but I still want to

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
continue to invite those to do this one way.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
And I'm adding in a second minute

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
something that might be a little bit different again,

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
and I've seen a lot of what the people say,

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
and if you do that,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
I do hope that you can see

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
the sound of the band,

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
although I won't mention it,

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
but I think it is a different thing.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
But I'm genuinely

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
not working with this sound of the band,

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
so I think you get that

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
through maybe the slow doing

09:42.000 --> 09:45.000
in something that it takes time.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
And the problem I might do this is that

09:49.000 --> 09:52.000
I suddenly don't need to

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
find the point of doing this,

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
because you can't find the power

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
of the music in my head,

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
you know what I mean?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I don't just need to see

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
the people who are actually

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
using this division

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
and the single-boxing combinations.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
I'm not doing that with the sound of the band,

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
which that sound is different,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
but for any other music

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
I don't need to put the sound of the S.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
So I'm going to be doing this

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
with people that have not been

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
made to perform in ten minutes,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
because I don't need ten people

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
having a hundred people.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And I'm just going to put the ten minutes

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
soon on the speaker,

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
and I'll have to do that

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
with the speaker and the sound of the band.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
I'm just going to put the sound of the band

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
in the studio.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
And in my house in

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
the village today,

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
I just suddenly like,

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
I notice a lot of something

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
that's something that's changed,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
something that's changed

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
what you think it is.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
And I notice that any minute

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
I notice how my mother,

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
the things that we get,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
what we get,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
I never just see

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
98.74,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
98.74,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
98.74,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
98.74,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
and this is

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
what we're going to do

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
with a

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
music that

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
is something that we've got on the music outside.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
And I think that this problem is

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
that

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
the music that's on the music outside

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
is something that we should

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
get very, very good.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
And it's really remarkable.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
It's really useful

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
to look at the music

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
outside the music outside the music

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
because the only thing we can do

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
is understand about the life

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
and the existence of the music

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
outside the music.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And then I notice that the music is so large

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
that we have to see what it is

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
in the art of all innovation.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And the music is so large

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
that we have to see what it is.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
And then I notice that the music is so big.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
We know

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
and this is something that

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
allows even more of our

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
exciting

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
modern music

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
and other modern music

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
that we learn about

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
and we use for all of us

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
what we do

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
and we use for all of us

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
the amount of things that we can do

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
to do that.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
And we're going to be able to

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
make this music outside the music

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
outside the music.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
And we're going to be able to make

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
this music outside the music

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
outside the music.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And we're just waiting

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
for the music to finish.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
So, we'll just stop here.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Okay, wind, wind, wind.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
This is

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, and this is why

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
I'm issuing

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
this.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Suddenly so popular because

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
it's a massive cliché but we are in

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
an increasingly data-driven world

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
and we need the way of managing that data

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
and by just

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
the argument I've just given you, there's only one way to do it

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
and that is to use things like AI,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
machine learning and statistics.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
We also have

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
a nice little

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
a side benefit from all of this

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
is that AI and machine learning do allow us

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
to automate a set of tasks which are otherwise

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
very, very difficult to do.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
There are many tasks like

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
for example the ones I just gave

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
where it's extremely difficult to come up

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
with a solution directly. For example,

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
if I wanted to

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
look at a picture

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
and tell you whether it has a cat or a dog in it,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
that's not something like

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
if you put me in a room and said I couldn't leave until I'd done that

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
you'd come back to a skeleton 10 years later.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
It's just not possible to solve that problem directly.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
But to solve that problem

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
indirectly by

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
learning a solution from a set of

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
examples, that's something I could do.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And in fact, modern tooling is so good, I could probably do that

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
in five minutes recently.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
It's really easy these days.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
So,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
where open source fits into this?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
So,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
we have to do our AI somehow.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
We've obviously

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
sort of got to do it with software. It's not really a problem

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
that can be solved at other scales. So we have

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
open source software as thankfully actually

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
these days a very big part of AI.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
And

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
that's good, that's great, that's

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
something we all know quite a lot about.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
But alongside this

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
we also have

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
thank you,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
we also have open source

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
data and open source

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
models. And this is

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
another great thing that we can share when we're doing

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
AI and machine learning.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
We can share not just the software we use

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
to do things,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
we can share the models that we use.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
So, I posted earlier this

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
slightly silly

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
but I think it's a great thing.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
So, we can share the

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
relationship between

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
what I say,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
income or pay,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
beard length

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
and seniority

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
and how hard people work.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
yeah,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
perfect.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Yay, cool.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
Thank you.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Thank you.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
Okay.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
What was I saying?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
Open source data.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
Open source data

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
and open source models.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
Yep, sorry.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
So, as well as open source software

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
we have open source data and open source models.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
These are,

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
this is another lovely extra thing we can do.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
I think

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
Michelle is going to be talking

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
quite a lot about this later.

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
And

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
yeah, another

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
lovely, other thing we can do.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Again, it's another quite a big

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
cliche but obviously with all these

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
benefits that we get from AI and machine learning,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
we get a lot of challenges as well.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
We have some

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
big challenges at the moment.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Explainability is one of these.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
We have,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
I think, quite a lot of difficulty

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
getting our more

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
advanced models,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
particularly to tell us

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
about why they work,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
how they're coming to the solutions

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
that they do.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
And this is a big

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
problem in

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
applications which directly relate to

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
people's lives like automotive

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
or healthcare

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
not being able to understand

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
why we've just run that poor, old

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
lady over is a big issue.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
And this is a real issue.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
The automotive industry at the moment has

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
these

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
wonderful self-driving cars

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
that are in many ways and by many

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
metrics are better than humans.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
But

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
the regulators

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
aren't letting any of this

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
happen because there's no

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
accountability for them. There's no way of

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
having to behave well and there's no

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
way of proving

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
that they do what they should do.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
We also

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
have issues of bias.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
AI and machine learning models

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
are ultimately a reflection of the data

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
that they were trained on and

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
that can be

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
a problem when the data

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
has been

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
scraped from the internet.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
The internet

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
is a very wonderful thing

18:10.000 --> 18:14.860
but I think we all know that not all of the concepts on the internet is great and

18:16.420 --> 18:19.880
Models that are trained on this come to reflect the biases inside of it

18:20.720 --> 18:26.760
this has been sort of very publicly the case in a few examples and with

18:28.560 --> 18:32.400
Hiring AI is where people have trained these on data sets

18:33.040 --> 18:35.780
of their historical hiring practices and

18:36.180 --> 18:42.100
This has turned out not particularly well and being quite biased for example against the women

18:42.100 --> 18:46.020
that was quite a high profile case in the last few years and

18:47.300 --> 18:49.900
Yeah, this is this is not a great issue either

18:51.380 --> 18:55.420
Privacy is also a final difficult issue

18:56.460 --> 19:05.420
With a demand for AI and machine learning models comes a demand for data and this data doesn't always respect people's privacy

19:05.420 --> 19:07.420
as it should and

19:08.580 --> 19:17.140
Even when it does models themselves often leak things about the data they were trained on either intentionally or unintentionally

19:19.100 --> 19:21.180
Anyway, that is the end

19:21.180 --> 19:26.460
I think I did it quite early which should give us plenty of time to fix things and switch over

19:26.780 --> 19:28.820
Do we have any questions?

19:35.420 --> 19:39.420
If you can raise your hand

20:05.420 --> 20:07.420
I

20:13.700 --> 20:15.700
So it was a bit difficult for me to hear that

20:35.420 --> 20:37.420
What

20:41.580 --> 20:46.100
I'd not to pass the buck here, but I actually think our next speaker's got quite a lot to say about that might be

21:05.420 --> 21:08.300
Really more

21:36.420 --> 21:40.140
Again it was a little difficult to hear that was that security

21:43.540 --> 21:45.700
Yeah, it's it's a tricky thing I

21:47.020 --> 21:53.220
Think the main difficulty here is that we do know how to do security well in some respects with things like differential privacy

21:53.220 --> 21:56.140
but it's what cost we put what price we pay to do this and

21:56.900 --> 22:01.860
Doing security and also having things run at the speed they want to we want them to go out

22:01.900 --> 22:04.740
That's that's a tricky thing. Just answer your question

22:06.340 --> 22:09.920
It's just that I see a lot of focus on

22:16.620 --> 22:20.060
Yeah, no, that's I mean, I think that's a perfectly fair comment

22:21.900 --> 22:27.340
Honestly people do really focus on these three things and it's really tempting to well like I just did

22:27.900 --> 22:30.780
Focus on things like differential privacy

22:31.380 --> 22:35.700
Information leakage because they're interesting, but yeah basic cyber security really

22:36.540 --> 22:38.540
Should be the first port of call for these things
