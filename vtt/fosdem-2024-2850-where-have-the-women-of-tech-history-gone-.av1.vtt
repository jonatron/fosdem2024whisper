WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Good morning everyone.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
Hope everyone is settling down.

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
We can get started with our first talk.

00:20.000 --> 00:32.000
Our first talk is where have the women of tech history gone.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Our speaker is Laura Dury.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
She has been a developer for six years and awarded at World Scales Belgium in Web Technologies category.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
She has been doing monthly YouTube live discussions on latest tech developments in tech industry.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
Additionally, she has also started a career of Fourier in France.

00:58.000 --> 01:06.000
The talk is mostly about where have women of tech history gone.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Addaa Lovelace, Hedji Lamar, the Enoch Girls, Grace Hopper, John Clark.

01:12.000 --> 01:20.000
Stemming from the role of calculator, the profession of developer has initially considered a woman's job while hardware design was seen as a man's job.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
However, who are these women who have shaped the world in tech?

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Why don't we hear more about them with Laura?

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
You'll attempt to see the record straight bit by bit and provide role models in the tech you've always needed.

01:33.000 --> 01:40.000
Thank you.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Hi, can you hear me right?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Hi everyone, thank you so much for coming today.

01:46.000 --> 01:55.000
I just wanted to say that at first I try to do my talk on Sunday because this is way too much for me to handle.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Please be kind to me, thank you so much.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
We're going to talk today about the women in the tech history.

02:05.000 --> 02:14.000
First of all, I wanted to talk to you about a little anecdote that happened to me when I was in college.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
During my first year I had a North History class and I was kind of sad to see there were maximum two women represented.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
I decided to send an email to my teacher and to ask him why he presented so few women.

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
He answered kindly, honestly, that he didn't have enough time to add more artists to his syllabus.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
Because of that, some students may not have the required basis for their future career.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
We think about students in illustration, in painting, art, etc.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
At first I didn't really pay attention to it, I didn't really see the huge problem behind this.

02:59.000 --> 03:09.000
Then when I started to realize that this is kind of weird, that this is not normal, this is not fair, I had two questions in my mind.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
The first one is why are women not considered as the required basis? Why do they have less than men?

03:17.000 --> 03:27.000
The second one is who is the person or the group of persons who decide what someone deserves more than another to be in a syllabus?

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
Spoiler alert, I don't have the answer to this question, I have ideas, I have theories.

03:33.000 --> 03:49.000
This is not the aim of this talk, but I hope that this question you can yourself think about it and maybe try to think about it.

03:49.000 --> 04:04.000
What I can do is to pay tribute and give a place to women who did a fantastic word to revolutionize the computer science field.

04:04.000 --> 04:14.000
This is something I have had in my mind for many years, in fact it's only natural that I'm here today in front of you to speak about that.

04:14.000 --> 04:25.000
The problem is present in the majority of fields, but today we're going to concentrate and talk only about computer science, the reason why we are all here today.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Of course we're going to do that.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
Personally, if you go home and you remember two names of women you learned about today, it's a huge win for me.

04:38.000 --> 04:44.000
What about you? Do you know some names of women in the tech history?

04:44.000 --> 04:48.000
Adelovelle.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
Kathleen Booth.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
Margaret Hamilton.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Belinda Pearson.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh sorry I can't hear.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Belinda Pearson.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Belinda Pearson, yeah that's true.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I don't think you know anything about that.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Okay I have a lot of names, that's really nice.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Okay thank you so much for that.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
So let's go discover together the stories through the computer science history.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
And for that we need to go back in time and we're going to begin at the age of enlightenment.

05:22.000 --> 05:32.000
So the ancestors of computing machines were human computers and especially in the astronomy fields.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
So basically computer was a job.

05:35.000 --> 05:50.000
And it was about mathematical calculations and very often the job was divided, the computers were divided into groups

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
to compute long and difficult calculations.

05:53.000 --> 06:01.000
And the job was done in a way that the calculations were executed at the same time in parallel.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
And I wanted to talk to you about that because this is really funny,

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
but because still today this is something that we are looking at in our computer.

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
How many operations my computer can execute at the same time.

06:14.000 --> 06:23.000
And it was already something that people created, a way of working that was created a long time ago already.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
So like every profession was dominated by the men.

06:27.000 --> 06:38.000
However the first woman to be quoted in articles about the computer science history is Nicole Ren LePote, co-corrigor pour les FranÃ§ais.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
So she is one of the most famous astronomers of the age of enlightenment.

06:44.000 --> 06:58.000
And she is famous because with two other men she calculated the return date of the Hallease comet for April 13 in 1756, 59.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Almost exactly as it returned on March 13 in the same year.

07:03.000 --> 07:14.000
So I don't know if you understand, we are in the 18th century and they calculated by hands the return date of the comet with only one month of error.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
So it's really amazing.

07:16.000 --> 07:24.000
Maria Mitchell also made a splash for discovering the first telescopic comet, which means it's invisible for the eyes.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
It will be named after her and she will receive a gold medal for this achievement.

07:30.000 --> 07:39.000
So during the 19th century there were a few barriers and contradictions regarding women in the scientific fields.

07:39.000 --> 07:48.000
So despite the fact that they had access to degrees, they were forced to resign as soon as they get married.

07:48.000 --> 07:55.000
A kindly reminder that a woman that is not married at that time doesn't exist in the eyes of society.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
So yeah.

07:58.000 --> 08:11.000
The history of computer science starts in 1840 with a woman that you obviously know and if you don't know her you should ask yourself some serious questions.

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
Who is that Pokemon? Well of course it's Ada Lovelace.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
So I think that everyone in this room know who is Ada Lovelace.

08:20.000 --> 08:30.000
But for me she is not only the first programmer and this is my thought and I wanted to speak to you with you about that.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
So for that I need to explain you something.

08:34.000 --> 08:41.000
So Charles Babbage is the person who built the difference engine and the analytical engine.

08:41.000 --> 08:48.000
However he was messy and he couldn't stand back from his machine he was building.

08:48.000 --> 08:54.000
So he had ideas but he didn't have a concept that embraced his machine.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
Hence the arrival of our sweet and dear Ada.

08:59.000 --> 09:08.000
She invented the concepts behind the analytical engine by providing the first algorithms.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
And I have something to say more and I forgot about it.

09:13.000 --> 09:19.000
So she invented the concept of the analytical engine by providing the first algorithm.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
And ladies and gentlemen computer science was born.

09:22.000 --> 09:33.000
So this is why I think for me that Ada Lovelace isn't just the first programmer but she is the mother of computer science by giving these first algorithms.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.000
And by the way you can find the first notions of loops and functions in these algorithms.

09:42.000 --> 09:49.000
So despite this extraordinary invention it was way too innovative for that time.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
I remind you to tell you again where we are in 1840.

09:56.000 --> 10:06.000
So it was way too innovative and the analytical engine was forgotten for lack of funding.

10:06.000 --> 10:16.000
Before being rediscovered in 1937 to inspire the Mach 1 the first general purpose electromechanical computer.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
But let's take it easy.

10:18.000 --> 10:29.000
Alright we are in the end of 19th century and Edward Charles Pickering is the founder of a group of women called the Harvard computers.

10:29.000 --> 10:36.000
These women listed over 10,000 stars and developed a system to describe them.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
But a woman, a particular woman stood out, Aynie Jump Cannon.

10:43.000 --> 10:53.000
So she pioneered, this is hard to remember this one, she pioneered a new spectral type classification system

10:53.000 --> 10:59.000
and she developed the Harvard classification scheme which is still in use today.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
No sorry, which is the basis of the system used today.

11:04.000 --> 11:14.000
Between 1911 and 1915 she classified over 5,000 stars a month at a rate of one star per 3 seconds.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I don't know what you can do in 3 seconds.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
I mean I can chug a beer in 3 seconds but that's all I can do, right?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Okay girl, you have my respect.

11:30.000 --> 11:39.000
And in the 19th century the growth of industries opened up opportunities for women to join the field of technology.

11:39.000 --> 11:55.000
One notable woman, Great Hermann, made significant contributions with her advanced work in mathematics and physics.

11:55.000 --> 12:02.000
She played a key role in her early philosophical work on the foundation of quantum mechanics.

12:02.000 --> 12:20.000
But in 1920s her doctoral thesis led the groundwork for computer algebra and it first established the existence of algorithms for many of the basic problems of abstract algebra.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
So we are going to see a little more of computing here.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I promise it's coming.

12:29.000 --> 12:38.000
Between computer algebra, I don't know if you know this app or a definition over there if you want to look at that after.

12:38.000 --> 12:48.000
So between the 1940s and the 1970s women were widely hired as coders and there are numbers of reasons.

12:48.000 --> 12:57.000
The first one is that coding programming was an emerging field so you didn't need a diploma to be hired.

12:57.000 --> 13:09.000
As new hires only had to pass a straightforward test, logic test, sorry, to work in a computer science job.

13:09.000 --> 13:30.000
Another factor was that despite the fact that women had diplomas degrees in scientific field, they faced a lot of challenges like finding a job or even advancing in their career.

13:30.000 --> 13:35.000
So they decided to turn to opportunities in the IT field.

13:36.000 --> 13:47.000
The last one is the shortage of manpower during this time and the fact that women cost very little.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
Grace Hopper.

13:52.000 --> 14:05.000
So during the World War II Grace Hopper, a 36 years old mathematician, decided to serve her country.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
This is very American.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I'm sorry for the Americans over there.

14:09.000 --> 14:25.000
She decided to let her job, her teaching position at Vassar College to enroll in the US Navy expecting to decode enemy messages and serve her country.

14:25.000 --> 14:35.000
Surprisingly, the US Navy sent her to Harvard where she became the third programmer of the Mark I.

14:36.000 --> 14:51.000
If you remember, earlier I mentioned the analytical engine and how it was rediscovered to inspire Howard Aiken to create the Mark I in 1937.

14:51.000 --> 15:04.000
Well, the Mark I is a versatile, punchcard, programmable calculator and it was Grace who has the honor or rather the heavy burden of taming this machine.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
She wrote her 521 page user manual from scratch with any help of nobody.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.000
Like they said, okay, this is the machine. Go yourself and yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
See you next time.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Okay.

15:17.000 --> 15:26.000
So this is really impressive to know that and with her work she was engaged in top secret calculation crucial to the war efforts.

15:27.000 --> 15:37.000
Involving past like determining rocket trajectories, generating range tables for new anti aircraft guns and calibrating minesweepers.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Now look at your computer.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Look how easy it is to code.

15:42.000 --> 15:51.000
Now imagine doing this with a big, big computer like doing this for day long, for day long and for night long also.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
This is not the right page.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah, this is.

15:57.000 --> 16:08.000
We continue in the history and we are in 1940 and this year marks a milestone in the history of computing.

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
The first fully electronic computer, the ENIAC.

16:13.000 --> 16:20.000
It was developed to automate and speed up the work of calculators and computers who was first humans.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Right.

16:21.000 --> 16:29.000
But even if it was faster, it still needed a human intervention called the operator.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
And this job was largely performed by women.

16:35.000 --> 16:44.000
So the operator is the person who will enter manually questions into the machine through switches and cables.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
So you have a little, I don't know, overview.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Can you see it?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
Well, it's kind of dark.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm sorry about that.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Yeah, you have a lot of cables over there.

16:55.000 --> 17:09.000
And six astounding women, Kathleen, Marlene, Betty, Francis, Betty and Ruth were the first six ENIAC programmer and the first programmer by extension also.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
So they had to install and assembling this machine.

17:15.000 --> 17:20.000
You have to know that the operator was the programmer of today.

17:20.000 --> 17:32.000
And even if this is the case, even if this is the programmer of today, at that time it was, it didn't receive a lot of credits.

17:32.000 --> 17:40.000
And it was very often belittled because it was performed by women.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
And hardware was the main job.

17:45.000 --> 18:01.000
Yet the line between these two jobs wasn't really clear cuts because women, so operators, needed to have little or in depth hardware knowledge to do it.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.000
To control this machine, to program these machines.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Because this is still hardware.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.000
We didn't have in graphic interface or things like that.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
You needed to touch the hardware to use the cables, the switches.

18:15.000 --> 18:23.000
So this is where we see there is a big difference between a job description and what these women really had to do.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
Hello.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
I have a little anecdote.

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
So first of all ENIAC for those who didn't know, means Electronical, Numerical, Integrator and Computer.

18:35.000 --> 18:40.000
So all these six women had a mathematics degree in common.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.000
They were responsible for installing and assembling the ENIAC.

18:44.000 --> 18:49.000
And the most important thing, they were the ancestors of the debugger.

18:49.000 --> 18:56.000
So look again to this machine and imagine you have a bug but you don't know where it is.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
So there were six.

19:00.000 --> 19:07.000
There were a group, so they had to work together to try to understand where a bug come from.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
And why is it a bug?

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
So they created a system to work together as a debugger when there is a bug.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
And this is quite impressive.

19:18.000 --> 19:25.000
I don't know if there is people in this room already saw a machine like that or not.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, okay.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
That's so nice.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I'm jealous.

19:30.000 --> 19:43.000
So now we are in 1942 and a significant innovation emerged unintentionally driven by Hedila Marm, a renowned movie star.

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
So to understand what happened, we need to rewind a little bit and delve into her background.

19:50.000 --> 19:59.000
So Hedila Marm is really famous for her role in the first non-pornographic film featuring a nude orgasm scene,

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
which is really like, people were, oh my God, oh my God, this is so, yeah.

20:05.000 --> 20:14.000
And she also recognized, she recognized as the face of Disney's animated film Snow White.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
I don't know if it made sense.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
So, yeah.

20:19.000 --> 20:26.000
But she was facing a troubled marriage and Lamar decided to fled from Austria.

20:27.000 --> 20:32.000
But she had a really interesting alter ego.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
Like she was super duper into war and technologies, advancements.

20:37.000 --> 20:44.000
Well, it was influenced by her former husband who was a prominent Austrian art manufacturer.

20:44.000 --> 20:52.000
And during that time, she crossed path with a pianist named George Entail.

20:52.000 --> 21:04.000
And together they created, they invented top secret communication for radio-controlled torpedoes called, if I remember,

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
Frequency Hoping Spread Spectrum.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
Is it right?

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Yes, it is right.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Okay, Arda FHSS.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
Thank you, thank you.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
Okay, let me correct this.

21:18.000 --> 21:25.000
And so they patented this idea in 1942 and what is surprising, singly,

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
what is really awesome is that to see that this technology is still in use today.

21:30.000 --> 21:37.000
And for all those who are on social network right now on the web, you can think,

21:37.000 --> 21:43.000
Adi Lamar, because of her that we have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth today.

21:43.000 --> 21:49.000
And a little thing that I have to say is that when it comes to unusual career changes,

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
I think that we are reaching new heights.

21:55.000 --> 22:00.000
At the same time, a new way of thinking could emerge in the 50s.

22:00.000 --> 22:08.000
So the programming was involving way faster than hardware, which is still the case today.

22:08.000 --> 22:15.000
And so they begin to think because they had to begin to optimize their algorithm.

22:15.000 --> 22:30.000
And this lead to an image of the singular creative genius who wielding a form of black magic.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
And with that, the first stereotypical of the programmer emerged.

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
So the white, hairy, antisocial men.

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
And even if this is more to the realm of fantasy,

22:47.000 --> 22:54.000
studies in the 60s showed that it was a profile sewed after

22:54.000 --> 23:00.000
and it was more easily hired by companies.

23:01.000 --> 23:05.000
So you thought you were done with Grace Hopper?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Now she's back.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
And you have to know that after the war, she worked on the Univac.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
So it was the more powerful computer at that time.

23:13.000 --> 23:21.000
And when she was put in charge of the automatic department, sorry,

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
when she was put in charge of the automatic programming department,

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
she had the idea of the compiler.

23:30.000 --> 23:35.000
So this person, this one there, she saved our life

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
because now our computer can understand languages that we can read.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
We don't have zeroes, one or very low, low, low level languages.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
So thank you, thank you Grace Hopper for that.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.000
And as the idea was revolutionary,

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
she started to observe that every manufacturer,

23:56.000 --> 24:02.000
every brand of computer was started to develop their own compilers.

24:02.000 --> 24:11.000
So in 1969, sorry, this is not the right date.

24:11.000 --> 24:21.000
In 1959, almost, in 1959, she faced a potential chaos that it could be.

24:21.000 --> 24:27.000
She decided to call on her old Navy connections to organize a meeting

24:27.000 --> 24:30.000
with every manufacturer of the country.

24:30.000 --> 24:37.000
And when they came out of the meeting, they all agreed on a simple universal language.

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
The common oriented business language or COBOL was invented,

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
which is still in use today in banks.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.000
Who do COBOL? Who can code in COBOL?

24:49.000 --> 24:52.000
Here, some people not a lot, okay.

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
Are you happy with that?

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
Okay, that's nice, the love man is in there, thank you.

25:03.000 --> 25:08.000
So I have two little anecdotes about Grace Hopper.

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
I mean like this woman, like who didn't know Grace Hopper before coming today?

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
You're gonna love her, okay?

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
I mean, I already, we can love her, but the first anecdote I have about her is that

25:20.000 --> 25:25.000
she was also the person who think about the software portability.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
So before, we had to rewrite every program on every computer.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
And she then had the idea of why?

25:34.000 --> 25:41.000
Why we couldn't compile the code to just put a software in between computers

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
without having to rewrite them?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Thank you Grace, thank you so much, oh my god.

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
And the second thing is like a little bit funny is that she is the one who decided to call

25:52.000 --> 26:02.000
the process of writing instruction, coding, coding, coding, coding, coding.

26:02.000 --> 26:07.000
And it's funny to know that this term replaced by programming

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
because you know this is a woman, so no coding, we're gonna say programming.

26:12.000 --> 26:20.000
Today is coming back to our vocabulary and today is way more cool,

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
cooler to say coding than programming.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
Okay, now look at this graph.

26:26.000 --> 26:32.000
So this is the percentage of women majors by field.

26:32.000 --> 26:38.000
So we have the medical school, low school, physical sciences and computer science.

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
And what we can see, I was going to speak in French,

26:44.000 --> 26:51.000
what we can see is that there is a kind of rupture between women and computer science

26:51.000 --> 26:55.000
between 1980 and 1995.

26:55.000 --> 27:00.000
So this is a big question and I think that if you are interested in,

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
by women in computer science, I think that you already heard about that,

27:04.000 --> 27:08.000
about this thing and what happened and why.

27:08.000 --> 27:14.000
This is not the aim of the speak but I think it's still important to speak about that.

27:14.000 --> 27:21.000
And this is, so there are a lot of reasons, there are a lot of theories about that.

27:21.000 --> 27:28.000
And I really invite you to discuss about that with people, older people, younger people

27:28.000 --> 27:37.000
and to see what can be done to try to make this curve up again, really higher.

27:37.000 --> 27:49.000
But today one of the reasons I saw when I did my research is the arrival of the personal computer in 1981.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
Woohoo, PC.

27:53.000 --> 28:03.000
Before the PC, the thing is that university students had little to no exposure to computer

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
because they were rare, expensive and oh my god, it was like the size of a house.

28:09.000 --> 28:14.000
So they were relatively on equal foot.

28:14.000 --> 28:21.000
However, with the introduction of the PC, a new stereotype emerged and I love this one.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
This is a joke.

28:23.000 --> 28:33.000
The perception arose that to be a proficient programmer, you have to spend countless hours obsessively on a computer,

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
which is still the case today.

28:36.000 --> 28:46.000
So leading to the notion of the real programmer who sported a computer screen tan from constant screen time.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
This is my case.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
I don't know if I'm good, but this is my case though, sadly.

28:52.000 --> 29:02.000
Funny thing is many men in the business didn't even fit the stereotypes and it could be a little bit controversial.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
And however for the women it was different.

29:07.000 --> 29:13.000
You couldn't have this kind of stereotype on women because either they were not tough enough

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
or they were too tough and then annoying.

29:16.000 --> 29:24.000
So many women begin to doubt about their ability to code and dropped out school.

29:24.000 --> 29:36.000
And the last thing I have to say about that is the fact that when households acquired a PC, a personal computer,

29:36.000 --> 29:49.000
it was mostly put in the boys room with the father taking a coach role and trying to push his son to explore programming.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
Does people here live that?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Or not?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.000
Yeah?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.000
Okay.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.000
Okay.

29:58.000 --> 30:10.000
And this is one of the multiple reasons why there is the wear, sorry, a gap gender who began.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
It's not the only one.

30:12.000 --> 30:17.000
I'm not saying that because people after my conference were, no, this is not the only reason.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.000
No, I know I didn't say that.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
I'm sorry.

30:20.000 --> 30:29.000
And so before I said, like they were relatively on the equal foot and with that they weren't because the women, the girls,

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
wasn't pushed to, not a majority, so there are exceptions, all right?

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
A majority of girls wasn't pushed to try the computer or programming.

30:40.000 --> 30:49.000
And so at the end, before university, the boys were more experienced than women.

30:49.000 --> 30:57.000
So today we hear every day, we hear every day about Chagipiti and AI.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.000
That's so cool.

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
I'm sick of it.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
Thank you.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
Thank you.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.000
That's cute.

31:09.000 --> 31:17.000
And during my research, I discovered several women who have advanced the field of artificial intelligence,

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
including Alice Chocock and Karen Spark Jones.

31:22.000 --> 31:27.000
And today we're going to speak about Karen Spark Jones because I had to do a choice.

31:27.000 --> 31:34.000
Scientists and researchers in computer science, Karen Spark Jones' work focuses on natural language processing

31:34.000 --> 31:39.000
or NLP and information retrieval.

31:39.000 --> 31:48.000
So this is a good anecdote to say when you are with your friends in a party with your friends from programming and everything.

31:48.000 --> 31:53.000
She developed the, you know, to seem intelligent, smart.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.000
She developed the TF IDF.

31:56.000 --> 32:01.000
I don't know if people know that.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.000
Perfect.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.000
Yes, some of you.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.000
Okay, nice.

32:04.000 --> 32:05.000
Okay.

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
So this is the term frequency, inverse document frequency.

32:09.000 --> 32:17.000
And if you may let me read this because this is impossible to read by heart because this is not my field.

32:17.000 --> 32:24.000
This is a weighted relevance measure that is still used today by most search engines.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
And it's an important tool for SEO.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
So if you are doing web, if you are web developers,

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
it's kind of important to know it.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
And this is this woman who developed it.

32:35.000 --> 32:44.000
This method combined the physical presence of a word in a text with the weight of its importance in general.

32:44.000 --> 32:52.000
It does make it possible to define the relevance of a specific keyword in a text.

32:52.000 --> 33:02.000
So finally, this is kind of charge PD due to understand what you're saying when you are writing a prompt in big.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
I don't know.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.000
I'm bigger.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
Oh my God.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
What did I say?

33:08.000 --> 33:18.000
And then after she decided to work with Margaret mastermind and they wanted to do, to have a little challenge to challenge themselves.

33:18.000 --> 33:24.000
So she decided to program a computer to understand words with multiple meaning.

33:24.000 --> 33:33.000
And the result of that was a dictionary of synonyms.

33:33.000 --> 33:46.000
Karen published an article in 1964 that is considered as a fundamental document and the foundation in the field of natural language processing.

33:46.000 --> 33:54.000
I think that if you are interesting in that, if you are working, if you are coding in this field or just interested,

33:54.000 --> 34:03.000
I think this is really, could be really nice to read more about her and to let people know about her work.

34:03.000 --> 34:13.000
So her ideas was little appreciated at that time, but they are implemented today and continue to inspire.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.000
Okay, I'm going to say something now.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.000
Please don't stay here.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.000
Okay.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.000
People go out because I'm saying that is going to be a little bit.

34:22.000 --> 34:32.000
She also mentored a generation of researchers, both men and women, and she coined the slogan, computer is too important to be left to men.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
Thank you.

34:37.000 --> 34:41.000
Thank you to her.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Nobody is living?

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
Perfect.

34:44.000 --> 34:48.000
Okay.

34:48.000 --> 34:57.000
I also discovered something really interesting is that there are no sexism in hacking.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
Why?

34:58.000 --> 35:10.000
Because the philosophy of the hacker is that only the work of the hacker is judged in the hacker itself and not the hacker itself.

35:10.000 --> 35:24.000
So it means that we don't care about where you come from, your age, your gender, what you look like, or anything, or your orientation.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
It's hard to say this one.

35:27.000 --> 35:32.000
This is, you are only judged by your work.

35:32.000 --> 35:48.000
However, I had the luck to type, to do a research on Google in French and trying to search the top 10 female hackers of the world.

35:48.000 --> 35:55.000
So, yeah.

35:55.000 --> 36:01.000
The funny thing is that if they are French speakers here, it's written,

36:01.000 --> 36:09.000
Le dit plus belle accuse du monde qui te font chaud, which is a literal translation from another language.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
So it makes sense, but a half is not really making sense.

36:13.000 --> 36:17.000
So this is the 10 hottest female hacker in the world.

36:17.000 --> 36:25.000
So I watched the article and they were quite impressive for their work.

36:25.000 --> 36:34.000
Well, this is true they were impressive for their work, but sad to be to finish inside that.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.000
And what I wanted to say is that, yeah.

36:38.000 --> 36:45.000
So we see a will of progress, of progressments in, is it English?

36:45.000 --> 36:54.000
No, we see a will of doing better about all these ethics things.

36:54.000 --> 37:09.000
But, however, we see that in the society, the female hacker still is a fantasy, like this, or we have a lot of stereotypes of women female hackers.

37:09.000 --> 37:19.000
So the woman I would like to highlight here is Joanna Ruckowski, sorry for my pronunciation, a Polish computer scientist and security expert.

37:19.000 --> 37:31.000
She's best known for her research on low level security and still malware.

37:31.000 --> 37:34.000
This is a conclusion.

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
So I can go hours and hours about women.

37:38.000 --> 37:46.000
To be honest with you, my first version of this conference, I think I had like 20 women.

37:46.000 --> 37:52.000
And they said to me, come down, okay, okay, okay.

37:52.000 --> 38:02.000
So today, many actions and associations are being set up to give a place and a voice to women in IT.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
And this conference is one of them.

38:05.000 --> 38:13.000
The reason I'm glad, no, this is not, I'm glad, but no, okay.

38:13.000 --> 38:20.000
I have some questions, like have you ever had a role model in your life?

38:20.000 --> 38:25.000
And this, sorry, I don't remember.

38:25.000 --> 38:37.000
And did this role model help you to dream and give you the motivation to project yourself and believe in your dreams?

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
Yes, no, okay.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Yes, okay.

38:41.000 --> 38:46.000
Did it allow you to say to yourself, I can do it?

38:46.000 --> 38:53.000
Well, role model, like I would like now to speak a little bit about my own experience.

38:53.000 --> 38:57.000
Sorry, this is my conference, okay, so you're here to hear me now.

38:57.000 --> 39:02.000
I would like to talk a little bit about my experience of discovering my own role model.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
So this is really weird to say like that.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.000
The role model have a lot of consequences and all of them are positive.

39:12.000 --> 39:21.000
Not only they can make us think that we can have that kind of dream, dream of reaching great heights, just as they do,

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
but above all, we allow ourselves to think that we have the right to do so.

39:26.000 --> 39:32.000
It may sound weird and simplistic, you know.

39:32.000 --> 39:39.000
Often when I suggest to my friends, female friends, you know, because I'm passionate of what I'm doing

39:39.000 --> 39:43.000
and I don't have a lot of co-dra friends.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
I don't know, I have Twitch, okay, it's good.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
So I'm like, oh, do you want to learn a little bit?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
You know, HTML, CSS, it's really funny.

39:52.000 --> 40:00.000
You don't have to, you know, to do a trigger warning is going to be a lot of flash colors, okay, trigger warning.

40:00.000 --> 40:06.000
You know, the little rotations and colors, CSS animation, this is so funny.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
I love to do that.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
And this is really funny.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Okay, it's going away, trigger warning is done.

40:14.000 --> 40:22.000
And they always said to me like, oh, no, no, I don't want to because I'm not good at math.

40:22.000 --> 40:31.000
So even if computer science have a basis of mathematics, depending on the field,

40:31.000 --> 40:39.000
it doesn't like require a lot of mathematics, depending on the field.

40:39.000 --> 40:51.000
And I love this sentence and you'd be surprised by how many of my buddies who were not brilliant at math at all

40:51.000 --> 41:00.000
have gone on to study computer science or engineering without ever asking themselves whether they're good or not at math.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
I love that, I love that.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
And this is kind of a sad situation, all right.

41:06.000 --> 41:19.000
So now we all agree and I think we all agree in the room here today that the fact that women and men are smart to do mathematics.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
I don't know.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
What did I write?

41:21.000 --> 41:28.000
Okay, stereotypes linked to women in mathematics no longer put people in agreement.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.000
And I think that we are all agreed today to say that.

41:31.000 --> 41:38.000
But the fact is that they persist unconsciously in society.

41:38.000 --> 41:47.000
A woman will often feel inferior to her male peers in math because of conditionings and stereotypes that persist.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
I know that this is not the case of everyone.

41:50.000 --> 42:02.000
So I had this case, I felt that until maybe I was 15 and then after I met people who let me learn math and say,

42:02.000 --> 42:05.000
okay, no, I'm good at math and I love it.

42:05.000 --> 42:14.000
So personally, when I discovered my role model, it was maybe two years ago and her name is Aureligeant.

42:14.000 --> 42:18.000
I don't know if you know her here in the room.

42:18.000 --> 42:29.000
Okay, so yeah, she's from France and she, I never know how to describe what she's doing, all right.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
She's a numerical physicist.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
I don't know how to explain.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
She's doing AI.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
She's a physicist.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
She's doing a lot of things and she's really impressive.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
She wrote a lot of books.

42:43.000 --> 42:49.000
She's like trying to help people to understand the AI.

42:49.000 --> 42:55.000
And I just fell in love with what she's done, her background, her career.

42:55.000 --> 43:00.000
When I read her book, I don't have the translation.

43:00.000 --> 43:07.000
If you want to read the book, you should really read her book, her first book.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.000
Where is the mic over there?

43:10.000 --> 43:20.000
Okay, and if you want to know a little bit more, like for the book, don't hesitate to come after and to ask me.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
I can show you the book.

43:22.000 --> 43:26.000
So like that you can see if you want to buy it or not.

43:26.000 --> 43:34.000
And discovering this woman let me think that, okay, no, even if I was already a programmer, you know, I was already working.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
I was already having, did my studies and everything.

43:39.000 --> 43:46.000
But it made me think that I can do more because I wanted to do more, but I was afraid.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
I was like, what do I have to say?

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
What can I say?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I'm like, I mean, I'm a woman.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
I'm afraid.

43:53.000 --> 43:57.000
It's sad, but I think that this is what I thought unconsciously before.

43:57.000 --> 44:06.000
And meeting this woman, like being in the highlights, being in front of people, writing books and being known,

44:06.000 --> 44:15.000
and give me the courage, give me the, it opened the door for me to go in to say, okay, I can do it too, and I have the right to do it.

44:15.000 --> 44:24.000
So the aim of this conference is to highlight women who have changed the course of IT history

44:24.000 --> 44:31.000
and who can inspire young girls today or women or all the people like.

44:31.000 --> 44:38.000
But I ask you to those who have patiently listened to these stories,

44:38.000 --> 44:49.000
when you get home to write down at least two names you discovered today and spread the word, the word, the word.

44:49.000 --> 44:57.000
To share the stories of these women with your daughters, with your students, with your friends, with your cousins,

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
your niece, with the people in the street.

44:59.000 --> 45:02.000
I don't know, your bar mate, well, I don't know.

45:02.000 --> 45:05.000
And create them to show these women.

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
These girls don't have to become, they don't have to become programmers,

45:11.000 --> 45:20.000
but you can open their horizon and show that being a girl, being a girl doesn't have to limit the choices and their dream.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
So please narrate and create and propagate.

45:31.000 --> 45:32.000
Thank you.

45:41.000 --> 45:47.000
It's literal translation of French, so if you have better translation, don't hesitate to tell me.

45:47.000 --> 45:59.000
So to finish my talk, my, why, I didn't, oh no, this is internet.

45:59.000 --> 46:04.000
Oh no, oh no internet.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.000
Go buddy.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Okay, try again.

46:13.000 --> 46:18.000
So I know you have talk to see, I hope I'm gonna do it faster.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Oh.

46:23.000 --> 46:26.000
Okay, we're gonna do it like that.

46:26.000 --> 46:31.000
So, nice to meet you, my name is Laura Durieux, a.k.a. Deaf Girl.

46:31.000 --> 46:37.000
So I'm a full stack web developer, WorldSkills Belgium Gold Medal in 2020 and 2021.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.000
I am a streamer on Twitch and we are doing code on Twitch, so don't hesitate to come and say hi.

46:42.000 --> 46:50.000
I'm also the show presenter of On est pas des Yankees on RTBS X-Pay, which is the national media of Belgium.

46:50.000 --> 46:58.000
So here you can take a picture and see, and come to see me on my social media.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.000
