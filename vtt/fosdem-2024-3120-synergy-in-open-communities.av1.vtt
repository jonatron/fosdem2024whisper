00:00.000 --> 00:16.260
Hello. This is an open community, synergy and online partnership. So my name is William

00:16.260 --> 00:22.200
Brasik Ray. I'm a senior software engineer with the Linaro Developer Service. Linaro

00:22.200 --> 00:28.040
you can see on the top left corner. Although I'm probably most likely to work on the Linux

00:28.040 --> 00:36.960
Carod's kernel counter subsystem maintainer. And during my time I'm contributing to both

00:36.960 --> 00:44.240
submitted patches and been a maintainer for some time. So I've come across a number of,

00:44.240 --> 00:51.520
I'd say pitfalls perhaps that we can get in when we're doing what's open communities.

00:58.480 --> 01:06.560
So I think it's useful to consider the engineering sector before we, because the

01:06.560 --> 01:34.520
orient is towards where we're from. So. Hello. Hello.

01:36.880 --> 01:47.560
This right? Right. So the engineer mindset. So engineers are very objective oriented.

01:47.560 --> 01:54.640
So I want to get things accomplished. It's kind of orientation on a very pragmatic orientation

01:54.640 --> 02:01.480
to your objectives. You try a streamlined process where you can see, expand through.

02:01.480 --> 02:07.840
But there's this idea of brief. It's beautiful. You want to reduce sort of the redundancies of

02:07.840 --> 02:14.920
your actions and try to get things done faster and basically build on mistakes so you don't make

02:14.920 --> 02:22.320
them again. You're building up on previous knowledge. And the key worry for an engineer is

02:22.320 --> 02:30.200
the mistakes of your past. So that creates this idea that a novice is a liability. And I think

02:30.240 --> 02:36.360
that's sort of the wrong mindset to have when you're dealing with maintenance because maintainers

02:36.360 --> 02:44.760
have to mitigate both established engineers in your community as well as the beginners who are

02:44.760 --> 02:53.360
just not joining. You don't want novices to feel pushed away from that. So you heard the big,

02:54.120 --> 03:01.760
too big challenges that online maintenance have. First of all, written speech. Typically when

03:01.760 --> 03:06.880
you're dealing with an online community, you're not. You don't always interact in person. And a lot

03:06.880 --> 03:16.000
of language nuances are lost in written speech. For example, in just simple tone, take the phrase,

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
that's a great idea. When it's written down, you're not sure is that being sarcastic or is it

03:22.000 --> 03:31.080
being sincere? Are they serious or is it a joke? That can create miscommunication and you end up

03:31.080 --> 03:38.880
with a lot of problems. To that end, you can mitigate that by becoming familiar with people.

03:38.880 --> 03:48.560
And that's since a certain amount of respect is earned when you interact with people. Strangers

03:49.560 --> 03:57.320
are normally very apprehensive to something new. So to be able to communicate with strangers,

03:57.320 --> 04:03.480
you need to build up a certain amount of trust before you can actually get on a personal level.

04:03.480 --> 04:10.840
So how do you build trust? Trust can be built traditionally through a gift. So gifts are

04:11.160 --> 04:18.880
tools towards establishment of trust. What is that for the maintainers in online community? That's

04:18.880 --> 04:26.200
typically going to be in the form of some sort of work. For example, helping bring up novices to

04:26.200 --> 04:33.280
the environment that they're in for the community. Once you've established this trust as a baseline,

04:33.720 --> 04:38.840
then you can actually move forward to producing the product that you're trying to complete.

04:38.840 --> 04:47.640
Criticism becomes more easily acceptable. If you're trying to criticize a stranger than that

04:47.640 --> 04:52.000
apprehension that they normally have is going to build up a wall and not going to be able to address

04:52.000 --> 04:57.720
the core problem with what they're delivering. The criticism is going to be taken on a more

04:57.760 --> 05:04.160
personal level than what you intended. When you go back to the top of where meaning is lost in the

05:04.160 --> 05:11.000
text, your criticisms might be for the work, but the person on the other end is interpreting it

05:11.000 --> 05:19.000
not the way that you want them to. So what I like to do is I'm a very visual kind of person.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.440
So how about we walk through some scenarios? Here's one that probably a lot of people have been

05:27.080 --> 05:34.120
through. You have a friend, right? Perhaps you're eating out together and you notice they have

05:34.120 --> 05:40.680
something in their mouths. Maybe it's a piece of food in their teeth. So you say, hey, I think you

05:40.680 --> 05:46.000
have something there and perhaps you should go check it out in the mirror and fix it up. You have

05:46.000 --> 05:51.160
a certain amount of previous relationship with that person and the trust has already been built.

05:51.400 --> 05:57.640
So the person trusts you and they go and take care of the issue that they seem. But think about it

05:57.640 --> 06:03.480
from the perspective of a stranger. If you go up to a stranger in the same situation, say, hello,

06:03.480 --> 06:09.800
madam, you're very ugly. Why don't you go back home and change your face? It's taken in a very

06:09.800 --> 06:15.920
different way than you would as a person you've known before. And the reason why is because you

06:15.960 --> 06:24.160
have an established trust. So your words are interpreted in different contexts than they would

06:24.160 --> 06:32.640
be as friends. And that's the core issue with an online community, that impersonal nature of

06:32.640 --> 06:41.200
communication results in misunderstandings like that. Engineers going back to start are very

06:41.280 --> 06:48.160
pragmatic. Engineers want to be able to focus on the core issue. But without the established trust

06:48.160 --> 06:56.560
beforehand, then the misinterpretation comes up and we end up creating a noise in a sense in terms

06:56.560 --> 07:03.640
of what we're trying to achieve. And then there's always something worse when we started. So let's

07:03.640 --> 07:09.800
go over something more specific to online communities and that's the reviewing patches. This is in

07:09.840 --> 07:17.960
the context of perhaps programming work. But I think it could apply more generally. So let's

07:17.960 --> 07:22.800
cover the wrong ways. So you might have come across before. I mean, if you were to say no,

07:22.800 --> 07:29.200
just deny something but not give an explanation. They're taking again a pragmatic approach as

07:29.200 --> 07:35.920
yes or no. But without that understanding in mind, the previous trust, then it comes off as too

07:35.960 --> 07:44.440
abrupt. And again, that person, the novice, might just be taken back by it and I want to

07:44.440 --> 07:51.960
contribute. Another one that we come across perhaps is RTFM. If you've never come across that,

07:51.960 --> 08:00.800
that's read the manual. It's not very useful to you. So please don't respond that way. And I

08:00.840 --> 08:08.520
understand why. You want the person submitting to go through the steps of trying to research

08:08.520 --> 08:14.880
previous solutions and understand the system before trying to propose a change. And that's

08:14.880 --> 08:20.120
understandable but that should be communicated because when we tell them to just read the manual,

08:20.120 --> 08:28.120
it's if you ever interacted with certain manuals, they might be very large to put as an

08:28.160 --> 08:34.480
understanding. So it's a ton to read the manual. It's not very helpful to finding the exact solution

08:34.480 --> 08:41.840
of what you want completed. So if you respond in ways like, what even is this one earth or you're

08:41.840 --> 08:49.040
trying to do, again, you need to be more specific. And these kind of words, they end up taking a

08:49.040 --> 08:55.800
very personal way. In fact, sometimes maintenance do in fact take it personally. This goes bad

08:55.920 --> 09:06.440
and you should feel bad. That ends up now moving the topic from a very technical discussion to now

09:06.440 --> 09:14.680
a relationship discussion. And I think the last one is very sad. I'm not going to reply to you

09:14.680 --> 09:21.200
anymore. I think at that point, we've started on a common ground of trying to produce something good.

09:21.720 --> 09:28.840
And now we've ended in a destruction of the relationship. The reason I've used synergy as a

09:28.840 --> 09:36.920
topic of discussion is because synergy is two more agents coming together in interaction that

09:36.920 --> 09:41.280
produces something greater than what they can produce alone. When you burn the bridges that you've

09:41.280 --> 09:46.440
made by replying in these ways, you've produced something worse than what you would have done

09:46.800 --> 09:53.840
independent. So you've actually ended up worse than when you started. By the way, I really love

09:53.840 --> 09:58.040
this picture here because I think it encapsulates the relationship that maintenance should have

09:58.040 --> 10:05.160
with a submitter. On the left, you have someone using the wrong tool to try to achieve something.

10:05.160 --> 10:12.520
And on the right, same situation. I think maintainers should be mentors in a sense. They should

10:12.960 --> 10:18.480
guide an office to the correct procedures to accomplish what they're trying to do. And then

10:18.480 --> 10:24.720
together, we can produce something greater. So here's what I propose for the right way. Let's

10:24.720 --> 10:30.400
try these again. But it's something that I think communicates better in an online discussion.

10:30.400 --> 10:36.600
Hi, William. Thank you for taking your time to send your patch. You address their work and you

10:36.600 --> 10:40.360
thank them for what they're doing. This is great for a draft, but we have some comments and questions

10:40.400 --> 10:46.240
below. So this sets up a premise where you appreciate their work, but you're prepared to

10:46.240 --> 10:52.840
provide criticism. You're establishing trust so that you can then criticize. So let's continue on.

10:52.840 --> 10:58.560
Unfortunately, this hardware doesn't support that function. This function is set from page 42 of

10:58.560 --> 11:05.240
the manual. And there you point them to where they should go to try to solve it in a different way.

11:05.320 --> 11:10.960
You start them off in the right direction and you let them take over. So you're not becoming

11:10.960 --> 11:15.800
consumed with the task yourself as a maintainer. You're guiding them to produce what you need.

11:15.800 --> 11:21.400
Then perhaps you might say, I'm confused about this part. Would you explain it some more? Let's

11:21.400 --> 11:27.040
work together to figure this out. You're making sure that the discussion, the problems that you're

11:27.040 --> 11:33.880
having is not with the relationship between them. It's with technically what they've produced. You

11:33.920 --> 11:40.160
want to know on a technical aspect what's going wrong. You can also provide your experience as

11:40.160 --> 11:45.360
guidance. This is a common error that I made in the past too. Here's how you can fix it and why

11:45.360 --> 11:52.520
it's better. There are good ideas here. A little more work will be able to merge this. You keep

11:52.520 --> 11:59.440
providing this guidance and motivation to continue on and you welcome them into the community in

11:59.480 --> 12:05.440
that sense. I believe this becomes more effective by building up that trust progressively. They're

12:05.440 --> 12:11.000
able to take the criticisms later on when you do have to criticize the code. A maintainer's job

12:11.000 --> 12:19.960
isn't just to merge. As that goes, a maintenance job is to say no. It's very difficult in that sense.

12:19.960 --> 12:27.120
Here are some guiding principles. As I mentioned before, maintainers should be mentors. No one

12:27.160 --> 12:33.080
starts out an expert, so you can't expect that from every new patch submitter. Remember how you

12:33.080 --> 12:38.920
felt when you were in office. You didn't know the procedure or everything. It's very overwhelming.

12:38.920 --> 12:45.400
The maintenance should be there to guide them through that process. In fact, maintenance should

12:45.400 --> 12:54.120
serve as ambassadors of the code. The focus should be on the code itself, not the personal issues

12:54.200 --> 13:03.400
that you have with someone. Of course, you come across issues where sometimes submitter might be

13:03.400 --> 13:09.280
very abrupt. What you should do in those sorts of instances is pivot back to technical discussions.

13:09.280 --> 13:15.120
Don't get thrown off into a thread of interpersonal relationships because, again, that doesn't have

13:15.120 --> 13:21.560
anything to do with the code in question. Boat of trust and established respect. If you acknowledge

13:21.560 --> 13:27.320
the efforts of the patch submitter, they're more open to taking into criticism. If you do the

13:27.320 --> 13:33.160
favor for them, they'll continue to do the favor for you. Take for tax situation. You're working

13:33.160 --> 13:37.680
towards a common goal, so treat it as that. You're both families towards that. It's a cooperative

13:37.680 --> 13:45.120
effort to improve the code. Not a fight for acceptance. If the disagreements are focused on

13:45.120 --> 13:50.000
technical issues and not personal issues, then you're able to focus on improving the code. In

13:50.040 --> 13:57.680
other words, you shouldn't have discussions about UUU, all these problems. This, this, and this are

13:57.680 --> 14:06.120
the issues. Together, you work towards something external to produce something better. Thank you

14:06.120 --> 14:16.360
for that. These are hard issues to take on. I think in general, people want to produce good

14:16.400 --> 14:20.240
things. That's why they're submitting the patch in the first place. People aren't going there to

14:20.240 --> 14:25.160
pick fights. Of course, there are people that are like that, but the vast majority are trying to

14:25.160 --> 14:30.640
produce something. I think if we orient ourselves towards that, then we can produce an environment

14:30.640 --> 14:37.360
that produces better things. We can increase the synergy in this sense. If you have any comments

14:37.360 --> 14:44.240
or questions, please send me a message. I'm very open to that. I truly believe this is something

14:44.280 --> 14:50.080
important. We should be discussing and trying to find solutions to those problems. That's my GPG

14:50.080 --> 14:59.720
key. If you're wrestling, that needs to be signed. I'll leave it with this. I think that we can

14:59.720 --> 15:05.880
work together to produce something better. I think that that should be our focus. Not in

15:05.880 --> 15:09.560
terms of fights, but just focus on the code. Thank you.
