WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.520
All right, please take a seat.

00:08.520 --> 00:13.240
We get in towards the end of the conference, so this is a presentation on the highlights.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.120
Hope you enjoy.

00:15.120 --> 00:20.920
Hi, everyone.

00:20.920 --> 00:22.600
My name is Diego.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.120
This is very impressive.

00:25.120 --> 00:30.120
You all look very beautiful from down there.

00:30.120 --> 00:34.680
I'll be very quick, so these are the highlights.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.720
I am, oh, this vibrates.

00:36.720 --> 00:42.840
I am one of the managers of the Open Research Dev Room.

00:42.840 --> 00:50.240
We feature research tools, open tools and technologies in research context.

00:50.240 --> 00:57.080
It means academia, but it also means journalism, it can mean citizen science and also beyond

00:57.080 --> 00:59.600
that.

00:59.600 --> 01:02.440
We, I'm too far away.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.480
Yeah, forget it.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.560
I hate those.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.440
So this works.

01:08.440 --> 01:12.400
No, it's fine.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.400
It's fine.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.960
Yeah, look, it works.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.520
We had a great day yesterday.

01:16.520 --> 01:23.520
We had a whole day pack full of great talks, but obviously I'm not here to talk about that.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.080
You might have gotten that.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.640
So here I am.

01:27.640 --> 01:33.720
Some people might already know me as the annoying French guy with the camera running around

01:33.720 --> 01:40.320
Fosdemme asking people if I can take their picture, saying everybody looks so great.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.200
So yeah, here I am.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.680
My name is Diego and I'm here to show you pictures.

01:47.680 --> 01:55.840
These are portraits I've been taking for years now at the Fosdemme, and it's a project that's

01:55.840 --> 01:57.960
a bit pixelated.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.200
No, it's cool.

01:59.200 --> 02:08.760
It's a project that's called, it's not called, that's called, jeez, that was a spoiler.

02:08.760 --> 02:11.120
It's a project that's called Faces of Fosdemme.

02:11.120 --> 02:13.800
It's my long-term photography project.

02:13.800 --> 02:20.240
It's been going for a while now, 2015, I've started, and until today.

02:20.240 --> 02:26.440
It's hosted on a French co-op that's called Ouvaton, and this is the URL.

02:26.440 --> 02:30.520
About me, I am a research engineer in social sciences.

02:30.520 --> 02:35.440
I work at Sciences Po in Paris, and this is my email.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.360
Do reach out.

02:38.360 --> 02:44.880
About the project itself, well, it got really funny really quickly because it's actually

02:44.880 --> 02:50.600
fun trying to catch up with people and catch them year after year and put those people,

02:50.600 --> 02:53.720
those pictures next to each other.

02:53.720 --> 02:57.360
So here I want to thank a very special person.

02:57.360 --> 02:58.360
You might know him.

02:58.360 --> 03:06.680
It's Alasdair, so Alasdair, thank you for everything.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.440
Thank you.

03:10.440 --> 03:15.800
But actually there are really dozens of people that I want to thank with this project, probably

03:15.800 --> 03:16.880
many of you.

03:16.880 --> 03:18.600
I have a lot of these pictures.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.440
So here, I saw Holger this morning.

03:22.440 --> 03:26.280
He's not here today, so I can show his face in really big on the screen.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.400
He won't mind, but he'll be watching the stream later.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.560
So hi Holger.

03:31.560 --> 03:36.640
You really helped start it all at the beginning in 2015.

03:36.640 --> 03:42.160
About the project, it's still ongoing, and I'm actually open to collaboration just to

03:42.160 --> 03:47.640
keep the project going because I think it's important and it would be funny.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.000
Do reach out to me.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
This is my email.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.440
If you have a camera and IDs about what we should or shouldn't do, taking pictures here,

03:56.440 --> 03:58.440
I'd be open.

03:58.440 --> 04:03.040
Do visit the website, but do not DDOS the Ouvaton service.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.240
They're cool.

04:05.240 --> 04:11.600
I really need to keep that under five minutes, but I just wanted to say that I think we have

04:11.600 --> 04:15.680
a, the first name is Great Community of People.

04:15.680 --> 04:20.640
It's a beautiful community and a diverse one, and we really need to take care of that.

04:20.640 --> 04:25.920
I think taking pictures is taking care because it helps.

04:25.920 --> 04:32.800
It shows how cool we are, and that's actually important.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.360
I don't know what to say.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.840
I should really keep it simple.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.320
Just the website, next slide please.

04:40.320 --> 04:45.240
The website is a really simple shelf of yearly project.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.720
Do visit it.

04:46.720 --> 04:52.480
There are good years and bad years, years with IDs, and years with beautiful people.

04:52.480 --> 04:53.480
That's all the years.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.240
You're always all beautiful.

04:57.240 --> 04:59.440
That's basically it.

04:59.440 --> 05:07.640
I just wanted to say that I met a lot of cool people here, and I am really glad to be finally

05:07.640 --> 05:09.960
able to share those with you.

05:09.960 --> 05:14.400
So thank you very much, and see you next year, I guess.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.400
You should have another slide.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.400
I'm missing two slides.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.400
You missed the dedicated one.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.400
Just show it one.

05:24.400 --> 05:34.400
Yeah.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.120
We are going to have a lot of switchovers.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.920
This is all very last minute.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.760
Next we have Alberto P. Marti.

05:41.760 --> 05:47.840
Also, if all the speakers could come into this area, it would make it easier logistically.

05:47.840 --> 05:52.160
If you're a speaker for this segment, please just come here.

05:52.160 --> 06:11.280
I don't know what IPC or ICIS is, but I'm looking forward to finding out.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.280
That's the one.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.280
Okay.

06:13.280 --> 06:14.280
So hello, everyone.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.520
My name is Alberto Marti.

06:15.520 --> 06:20.120
I'm the VP of open source innovation at OpenMimola Systems.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.120
Thank you.

06:21.120 --> 06:25.000
Well, thank you all for being here, obviously, and many thanks for the organizers to keep

06:25.000 --> 06:31.920
organizing this, and also giving me this couple of minutes to explain to you this project.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.920
Louder.

06:32.920 --> 06:33.920
Louder.

06:33.920 --> 06:34.920
Louder.

06:34.920 --> 06:35.920
Much louder.

06:35.920 --> 06:36.920
Much louder.

06:36.920 --> 06:46.400
Okay, so very quickly, there was some mislines, but don't worry.

06:46.400 --> 06:47.400
Stay there.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.400
The podium.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.400
That's true.

06:49.400 --> 06:54.680
So, very quickly, two minutes.

06:54.680 --> 07:08.200
I'm going to present today, I'm going to present today what's going to become the largest

07:08.200 --> 07:13.560
open source project in the history of the European Union.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
And I know what you're thinking.

07:14.560 --> 07:18.120
This is bullshit.

07:18.120 --> 07:26.480
There might be something, but so the EPSI, say hello to the EPSI, as we call it, this

07:26.480 --> 07:33.120
is, means in EU jargon, means the an important project of common European interest on next

07:33.120 --> 07:36.840
generation cloud infrastructure and services.

07:36.840 --> 07:46.440
So imagine if you had 3,000 million euros to do open source in Europe, what would you

07:46.440 --> 07:47.440
do?

07:47.560 --> 07:49.560
Found foster.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.060
Found foster.

07:51.060 --> 07:54.120
Okay, we might do that.

07:54.120 --> 08:00.640
The thing is, we have actually got 3,000 million euros to build a European cloud and

08:00.640 --> 08:14.480
its computing platform in Europe, and it is going to be open source.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.000
So it's not my merit alone.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.080
I'm just one of the, a representative of one of the 19 European companies that are behind

08:22.080 --> 08:27.760
this, supported by 12 member states, 12 countries in Europe with EU funding, coming with help

08:27.760 --> 08:34.880
from the European Commission, to invest initially 1,200 million euros from next generation EU

08:34.880 --> 08:35.880
funding.

08:35.880 --> 08:42.360
We are starting actually in January, so last month, plus another almost 2,000 million euros

08:42.360 --> 08:46.560
from companies in a co-investment program to develop together.

08:46.560 --> 08:51.880
Finally, European industry developing open source.

08:51.880 --> 08:58.240
When they say industry, it's telcos, cloud providers, technology providers, end users,

08:58.240 --> 09:00.160
railway companies, a lot of different people.

09:00.160 --> 09:07.200
So look at the website, EPSI CIS, it's starting this month, it's going to be running for 3,

09:07.200 --> 09:11.920
4, 5 years, and we're finally hopefully changing the mindset in Europe that we can actually

09:11.920 --> 09:17.560
develop the critical strategic technology that we need for cloud and edge, and avoid

09:17.560 --> 09:21.040
vendor locking and other things that you know perfectly well.

09:21.040 --> 09:26.640
So I leave it to you to check this out, stay in contact, and we'll see you around next

09:26.640 --> 09:27.640
year.

09:27.640 --> 09:28.640
Thank you.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.640
Thank you.

09:29.640 --> 09:40.720
Next up we have Boris Dolly talking about energy.

09:40.720 --> 09:42.720
I don't have more details.

09:42.720 --> 09:47.720
Yes, all yours.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.720
Hey.

09:50.720 --> 10:01.320
Okay, thank you.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.120
Hello everyone.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.720
Is there any energy at FOSDEM?

10:04.720 --> 10:06.520
Oh yes, I have to stay there.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.520
Is there any energy at FOSDEM?

10:10.520 --> 10:13.120
Thank you guys.

10:13.120 --> 10:19.640
So I'm very, very proud to be here with you guys and trying to make highlights on what

10:19.640 --> 10:22.080
was the energy dev room.

10:22.080 --> 10:26.640
Of course it was about open source, but it was focused on energy.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.240
Please come back.

10:28.240 --> 10:29.720
Thank you.

10:29.720 --> 10:35.440
The first occasion we had to be here with you at FOSDEM was last year, 2023.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.840
We had half a day online.

10:37.840 --> 10:45.280
It was very interesting, and we had half a day on site for eight presentation.

10:45.280 --> 10:48.160
It was a small room, but it was full, full, full, full.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.680
I managed the entrance.

10:49.680 --> 10:52.160
It was impossible to say, I'm sorry, you have to get out.

10:52.160 --> 10:58.160
And this year, thank you so much FOSDEM staff, because we had a lengthy day yesterday.

10:58.880 --> 11:07.880
There was a lot of people in it, 100 places, and some guys were standing up on the corridor.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.080
So thank you so much.

11:09.080 --> 11:12.400
It was a very unbelievable day.

11:12.400 --> 11:16.480
So, what was the topics?

11:16.480 --> 11:21.760
Of course it was energy, but when we speak about energy, we of course speak about our

11:21.760 --> 11:25.320
future, prosperity for people on the planet.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.720
We had a panel session just here.

11:28.720 --> 11:33.880
Some of you guys maybe were there, but there was a lot of questions, so a lot of interest,

11:33.880 --> 11:41.800
of course, for this convergence between energy and software through open source.

11:41.800 --> 11:47.440
So the topics were there, our future of course, but smart metering, smart changing, solar,

11:47.440 --> 11:49.560
winds, and grids.

11:49.560 --> 11:54.200
Not so much of you should be comfortable with the concept of grids, because it's a really

11:54.240 --> 12:00.000
industrial thing, but it becomes a public thing, because you are more and more producers

12:00.000 --> 12:04.720
as consumers, so we say prosumers.

12:04.720 --> 12:11.800
So we spoke of course about open source software, but also about open source hardware.

12:11.800 --> 12:16.160
And there was a lot of questions on it, and thank you so much for guys working on that.

12:16.160 --> 12:21.440
Open data of course, about knowledge, science, and research, and of course communities.

12:21.480 --> 12:25.960
And I think it's about this, and if I can send you a message, please join.

12:25.960 --> 12:30.480
We need everyone to work on this project for the future.

12:30.480 --> 12:34.840
So a few pictures.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.840
First, thank you so much for the staff.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.480
Thank you, and maybe you can applause them.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.480
Thank you.

12:46.480 --> 12:50.080
And now concerning energy, we have a real ecosystem.

12:50.120 --> 12:56.200
It exists, and feel free to join, even if it's only for making documentation, translation,

12:56.200 --> 13:01.880
or bug fix, or maybe deeper contribution to the core code.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.760
So join us, here you have a few stickers.

13:05.760 --> 13:11.640
We have a lot of projects in this LFMG community.

13:11.640 --> 13:12.640
An incredible turnout.

13:12.640 --> 13:17.040
I spoke about that before, and open hardware also.

13:17.040 --> 13:24.560
And last but not least, Future of Energy is really willing to see you next year.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.560
Thank you so much.

13:27.560 --> 13:36.080
Just, if I have the time, may I take a picture for my daughter, because I miss her, and she's

13:36.080 --> 13:39.280
asking me, why are you away, bad?

13:39.280 --> 13:40.280
So please.

13:40.280 --> 13:45.280
Thank you so much.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.320
See you next year, I hope.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.320
Thank you.

13:49.320 --> 13:54.160
Next we have Shirley Bales with an update of the community deaf room.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.160
I hope so, at least.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.160
Just a slide, I think, on that one.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.160
Oh, okay.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.160
I think that I just need a slide.

13:59.160 --> 14:00.160
Okay.

14:00.160 --> 14:05.160
Apparently we only have a slide from this deaf room, but I can do this.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.160
Where?

14:06.160 --> 14:08.160
There it is.

14:08.160 --> 14:11.680
There it is.

14:11.680 --> 14:34.360
Next we have Chris Simmons with the embedded deaf room.

14:34.360 --> 14:35.360
Can you hear me now?

14:35.360 --> 14:36.360
Yeah, that's better.

14:36.360 --> 14:41.640
Yeah, so I'm here to give you a quick flavor of what we were doing in the embedded deaf

14:41.640 --> 14:44.240
room all day yesterday.

14:44.240 --> 14:48.000
Skip that.

14:48.000 --> 14:55.960
So embedded software is transforming the world, has been for a long time, and FOS embedded

14:55.960 --> 14:57.760
software is leading the way.

14:57.760 --> 15:01.240
So everything is, that's better.

15:01.240 --> 15:06.080
Everything is, everything you touch that has electronics inside, it has open source software

15:06.120 --> 15:15.360
inside, and we, the people in this room and others are producing that software.

15:15.360 --> 15:21.360
The embedded deaf room has been part of FOSDEM pretty much since the beginning.

15:21.360 --> 15:23.320
Since 2003 was the first embedded deaf room.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.920
There's been one every year.

15:24.920 --> 15:29.680
Apart from one year where for administrative reasons, nobody quite got around to applying

15:29.680 --> 15:33.640
for a deaf room, so we didn't have one.

15:33.680 --> 15:37.240
These things happen.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.840
So this year we had the deaf room for the whole of Saturday.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.160
We had 18 really fantastic talks.

15:43.160 --> 15:48.440
I don't know if any of the speakers are in the room right now, but if you are, thank

15:48.440 --> 15:49.840
you all very much.

15:49.840 --> 15:51.720
It went really well.

15:51.720 --> 15:59.280
And we were lucky enough to have one of the bigger deaf rooms, so we had 446 places.

15:59.280 --> 16:06.400
So guess which talk filled the deaf room?

16:06.400 --> 16:10.480
Anybody want to advance on beer?

16:10.480 --> 16:21.680
Well the answer is of course is beer.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.560
So we had this really great talk from John, John Britton.

16:25.560 --> 16:28.840
Brewing free beer with ESP Home and Home Assistant.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.360
It's a very good talk by the way.

16:30.360 --> 16:35.360
Highly recommend you check it out and you learn not only about beer, but also about

16:35.360 --> 16:41.800
Home Assistant, Home Automation and embedded systems.

16:41.800 --> 16:47.360
One of the great things about working with embedded staff is you get cool things to play

16:47.360 --> 16:50.480
with, including a nose.

16:50.480 --> 16:59.840
So you see that is a robot nose and the talk there is how to build an Arduino which can

16:59.840 --> 17:05.280
sample, use that nose to sample smells and detect for example the difference between

17:05.280 --> 17:11.840
whiskey and coffee which it was able to do with 99% accuracy, which is good.

17:11.840 --> 17:16.560
You wouldn't want to get them confused.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.640
And we also had an actual robot.

17:18.680 --> 17:23.280
Unfortunately this picture I've chosen isn't that great, but the robot is on the little

17:23.280 --> 17:24.800
white table underneath.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.640
Yeah, okay.

17:26.640 --> 17:30.400
That's my photography skills for you.

17:30.400 --> 17:35.520
And we also had a lot of fun.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.600
But all good things come to an end.

17:37.600 --> 17:42.720
So at the end of the day, there should be another, okay, my slides are mixed up.

17:42.720 --> 17:48.160
So this is the end of the deaf room and I just want to say thank you for all the people

17:48.160 --> 17:56.440
who turned up and we hope to do the same thing again next year with the provision of the

17:56.440 --> 17:57.920
of the foster developers.

17:57.920 --> 18:01.880
So once again, thank you all very much and we've had a great time.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.240
Thank you.

18:12.240 --> 18:17.520
Next up we have the monitoring of the deaf room and it's not the same name.

18:17.520 --> 18:18.520
It's Anna.

18:18.520 --> 18:23.520
That's the one.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.520
Hi, everybody.

18:26.520 --> 18:29.520
I'm Anna from monitoring.

18:29.520 --> 18:35.520
Hi, I'm Anna.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.240
I have a complicated surname.

18:38.240 --> 18:44.520
I'm from monitoring and the observability of the room and yeah, it's, should I?

18:44.520 --> 18:46.200
Okay, cool.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.200
It's one of the oldest deaf rooms here at FOSM.

18:49.200 --> 18:54.520
We actually started in 2017 and we are still here.

18:54.520 --> 19:02.680
And yeah, this year we had 12 talks but in total we had 97, which is pretty cool.

19:02.680 --> 19:07.960
And yeah, the talks increased, the number of room managers decreased.

19:07.960 --> 19:15.200
So now we are down to three but we are still very happy and still things are going smoothly.

19:16.200 --> 19:26.320
In this year's deaf room the team was kind of getting more about current ideas and how

19:26.320 --> 19:33.600
to implement them correctly than new shiny ideas which we see as a maturity sign and

19:33.600 --> 19:35.200
that's great.

19:35.200 --> 19:39.120
And we thank all the speakers who participated.

19:39.120 --> 19:46.280
We had talks from nine different organizations, another healthy signal for OSS as open source

19:46.280 --> 19:48.160
community.

19:48.160 --> 19:57.040
And yeah, and big thanks to audience for not getting up during Q&As and sitting and getting

19:57.040 --> 20:00.720
squeezed when we yelled at them even it was hot.

20:00.720 --> 20:02.920
And yeah, and that's all.

20:02.920 --> 20:07.680
And our sites are very short in the spirit of FOSM I guess.

20:07.680 --> 20:11.560
And we made on the go because the deaf room was today.

20:11.560 --> 20:18.080
A couple of pictures, a big Q and yeah, sorry, mic problem.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.080
That's it for us.

20:19.080 --> 20:20.080
Thank you very much.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.080
Hi.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.080
Hi.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.080
Hi.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.080
Hi.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.080
Hi.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.080
Hi.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.080
Hi.

20:27.080 --> 20:28.080
Hi.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.080
Hi.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.080
Hi.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.080
Hi.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.080
Hi.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.080
Hi.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.080
Hi.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.080
Hi.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.080
Hi.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.080
Hi.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.560
GCC is next.

20:40.560 --> 20:43.920
Which is, which is just the slide.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.240
David Malcolm with GCC.

20:45.240 --> 20:51.160
Yeah, just as you can see this was a very last minute idea.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.160
GCC.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.560
One more, one more.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.060
That's okay.

20:55.060 --> 20:56.300
That's fine.

20:56.300 --> 20:57.800
Junior now.

20:57.800 --> 21:01.520
FOSM junior with Peter Madison.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.980
Another round of applause, please.

21:04.980 --> 21:17.020
Hi, first I'm very uncomfortable with doing this, so let's see what happens.

21:17.020 --> 21:22.900
I was a deaf room manager for the Fosdam Junior track, together with my son Bart, who is a

21:22.900 --> 21:25.180
software developer.

21:25.180 --> 21:27.020
So that's great.

21:27.020 --> 21:29.020
Yeah.

21:29.020 --> 21:36.940
I don't know if you noticed there were a lot more children at Fosdam than all the years

21:36.940 --> 21:37.940
before.

21:37.940 --> 21:39.940
Anybody notice it?

21:39.940 --> 21:41.940
No?

21:41.940 --> 21:43.940
Oh.

21:43.940 --> 21:48.580
So for a couple of years I'm a visitor.

21:48.580 --> 21:54.220
I had a couple of stands at Fosdam and I always noticed that there were only a few children

21:54.220 --> 22:00.860
attending, mostly with their parents, mostly walking past the stands, collecting the stickers.

22:00.860 --> 22:02.420
And that was it.

22:02.420 --> 22:08.380
So before COVID, I already thought about the idea we should do something for them.

22:08.380 --> 22:15.460
So I talked about it with the Fosdam organizers and we organized Fosdam Junior together with

22:15.460 --> 22:19.260
Kododojo and I hope you know what Kododojo is.

22:19.260 --> 22:21.180
Ever heard of Kododojo?

22:21.180 --> 22:22.180
Yeah?

22:22.180 --> 22:29.420
Kododojo is a worldwide computer club where children learn how to program for free.

22:29.420 --> 22:36.420
So together with a lot of collaboration and with a lot of developers that were also giving

22:36.420 --> 22:43.380
presentations in the educational deaf room, we made the first workshops for children here

22:43.380 --> 22:45.900
at Fosdam.

22:45.900 --> 22:50.220
So I don't know if you know all the developers, all the software packages.

22:50.220 --> 22:58.060
I guess you know MIT Appaventure and MicroBlocks and Snap and Haiti and Zim.

22:58.060 --> 23:01.420
And we also had Raspberry Pi workshop.

23:01.420 --> 23:04.740
And then the following, it's only one picture.

23:04.740 --> 23:10.420
This is the picture of the first workshop given at Fosdam for children.

23:10.420 --> 23:12.740
And it was the turnout.

23:12.740 --> 23:13.740
So this is wonderful.

23:13.740 --> 23:16.740
Yeah, you should let them dance.

23:16.740 --> 23:17.740
Yeah?

23:17.740 --> 23:23.540
Oh, Haiti, thank you.

23:23.540 --> 23:28.260
This is the MicroBlocks workshop where they can play with micro-bits.

23:28.260 --> 23:33.460
Not every workshop was visited by so many children, but that was not a problem because

23:33.460 --> 23:37.220
when we had less children, we could give more attention to them.

23:37.220 --> 23:39.340
So that was also good.

23:39.340 --> 23:43.060
So what have we learned from this?

23:43.060 --> 23:44.060
It worked.

23:44.060 --> 23:47.100
My dear, for many years ago, worked.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.460
Developers liked it, giving presentations.

23:49.460 --> 23:52.220
The children liked it.

23:52.220 --> 23:55.300
And what we also learned, stickers for everyone.

23:55.300 --> 24:00.540
Not the stickers from Fosdam, but we should give stickers to the children, at least what

24:00.540 --> 24:06.380
their name is, what language they speak, because we had children from French, from Belgium,

24:06.380 --> 24:09.020
from Germany.

24:09.020 --> 24:14.900
So we had to talk English, German, Dutch, French, and that's sometimes a problem.

24:14.900 --> 24:19.260
So it's easier to know what they can speak, what they understand.

24:19.260 --> 24:25.180
And the same goes for all the Code of Dojo volunteers that came to Brussels to help.

24:25.180 --> 24:28.700
We also need to give them stickers.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.140
Then we had a problem.

24:30.140 --> 24:37.100
Also, if 30-stickets is too much or was the room too small, that is something we have

24:37.100 --> 24:41.460
to discuss with the organizers at Fosdam.

24:41.460 --> 24:43.020
So that's it.

24:43.020 --> 24:48.620
So I hope, personally, I hope we have another Fosdam junior next year with a lot more children,

24:48.620 --> 24:51.740
a lot more workshops, but let's see what happens.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.740
Thank you.

24:52.740 --> 24:53.740
Thank you.

24:53.740 --> 24:54.740
This one?

24:54.740 --> 25:05.740
Next one, do you have the first content, man?

25:05.740 --> 25:10.420
We're going back to Mike.

25:10.420 --> 25:13.940
Just copying slides.

25:13.940 --> 25:16.140
We can play some holding music.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.940
This is already for next time.

25:17.940 --> 25:19.860
When we do the cutover, please stay seated.

25:19.860 --> 25:23.460
Of course, after this one, we still have the closing talk, and please stay seated until

25:23.460 --> 25:25.980
the final thing of the closing talk.

25:25.980 --> 25:27.340
We had issues with this last year.

25:27.340 --> 25:30.180
So please keep seated until it's obvious that things are over.

25:30.180 --> 25:33.820
Hi, folks.

25:33.820 --> 25:38.540
So confidential computing, Dev Room, we're pretty sure that about 98% of you have no

25:38.540 --> 25:41.340
idea what any of these words mean.

25:41.340 --> 25:45.180
So they asked me to spend five minutes just to explain very briefly what confidential

25:45.180 --> 25:49.220
computing is, why you should care, and why open source.

25:49.220 --> 25:51.580
So first of all, why should you care?

25:51.580 --> 25:54.260
Well, we all know how to do data in transit, right?

25:54.260 --> 25:56.660
We all know how to do data in storage.

25:56.660 --> 25:59.220
What about data when it's in use?

25:59.220 --> 26:03.420
That's the difficult bit, protecting that, and that's what confidential computing can

26:03.420 --> 26:04.420
do.

26:04.420 --> 26:11.380
So we assume that you folks care about privacy and about security, and that means that you

26:11.380 --> 26:13.260
should be thinking about protecting data.

26:13.260 --> 26:18.060
And there's all sorts of lots of different types of data you might want to be protecting

26:18.060 --> 26:22.660
or your employers might want to be protecting or your governments, whoever it might be.

26:22.660 --> 26:27.100
And one thing I want to dispel is it's not about DRM.

26:27.100 --> 26:29.900
So confidential computing, when it first came along, people were very worried about it in

26:29.900 --> 26:34.100
the open source community because concerns about DRM, that's not what we're talking about

26:34.100 --> 26:37.180
now, we can move on.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.020
Honest.

26:39.020 --> 26:42.900
So it's really widely available, but not many people know about it.

26:42.900 --> 26:44.820
Pretty much all the major clouds have it.

26:44.820 --> 26:49.980
You can buy server-grade hardware right now with it so it's there, it's coming, and we

26:49.980 --> 26:53.180
open source folks need to know about it.

26:53.180 --> 26:57.820
So this is a definition from the confidential computing consortium, of which I'm the exact

26:57.820 --> 26:58.820
director.

26:58.940 --> 27:05.780
So it's protecting data in use using hardware-based, attested trust execution environment.

27:05.780 --> 27:10.460
Lots of words, and I'm going to try briefly to explain what some of them mean.

27:10.460 --> 27:14.260
So normal protection of data, right?

27:14.260 --> 27:17.100
You can stop workloads messing with each other.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.340
Containers messing with each other, VMs messing with each other.

27:19.340 --> 27:20.540
That's fine, we know how to do that.

27:20.540 --> 27:21.540
That's not so difficult.

27:21.540 --> 27:22.540
Type one.

27:22.540 --> 27:23.540
Type two.

27:23.540 --> 27:27.180
That's stopping your workload from messing with your host.

27:27.180 --> 27:28.180
That's a bad thing.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.180
We know how to do that.

27:29.180 --> 27:33.980
But it's much, much more difficult to do this last type.

27:33.980 --> 27:38.580
Stopping your host messing with your workload, right?

27:38.580 --> 27:43.980
Because of how memory pages work and virtualization and all those sorts of things in containers.

27:43.980 --> 27:50.260
And so confidential computing is about using hardware-based, chip-based CPU, GPU capabilities

27:50.260 --> 27:52.540
to enforce that.

27:52.540 --> 27:56.540
It's one of a bunch of things called PETs, Privacy Enhancing Technologies.

27:56.540 --> 27:59.060
You've probably heard of things like fully homomorphic encryption.

27:59.060 --> 28:01.820
That's another example.

28:01.820 --> 28:04.540
So why does this need to be open source?

28:04.540 --> 28:10.740
Well, think of a stack in the cloud, right?

28:10.740 --> 28:13.300
You don't want to trust any of these.

28:13.300 --> 28:18.500
If you don't fully trust your cloud provider, and you should not fully trust your cloud

28:18.500 --> 28:20.380
provider, right?

28:20.380 --> 28:25.300
So you want to be able to protect the stuff on the left.

28:25.300 --> 28:26.860
And that's what TEs do.

28:26.860 --> 28:34.020
A trusted execution environment is the capabilities that a CPU, a GPU, whatever provides to protect

28:34.020 --> 28:40.300
the confidentiality and the integrity of the stuff in there.

28:40.300 --> 28:44.340
So meeting very, very quickly on, what is attestation?

28:44.340 --> 28:50.220
Well, it's all very well if I give my workload, my application, my data to the cloud provider

28:50.220 --> 28:51.220
and say, make it safe.

28:51.220 --> 28:53.100
They say, oh, I've made it safe.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.100
Yeah, right.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.100
OK.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.660
So we need to make sure that's actually the case.

28:57.660 --> 29:01.660
So what we do is we use cryptographic measurements to make that happen.

29:01.660 --> 29:06.420
So we create a T instance, which is basically a set of memory pages, which are protected

29:06.420 --> 29:08.140
by the CPU.

29:08.140 --> 29:12.820
And we say to the CPU, measure me.

29:12.820 --> 29:16.820
Do a cryptographic hash of the stuff in there, right?

29:16.820 --> 29:18.020
And it does that.

29:18.020 --> 29:22.780
And it signs that cryptographically with a key embedded in the chip, which was put

29:22.780 --> 29:28.100
there by Intel or AMD or NVIDIA or whoever it may be.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.860
And you have an attestation services.

29:29.860 --> 29:30.860
You know what?

29:30.860 --> 29:31.860
That looks good to me.

29:31.860 --> 29:33.260
That's what I expect to be in there.

29:33.260 --> 29:34.620
I've done this measurement before.

29:34.620 --> 29:38.060
I've got a list of known good examples.

29:38.060 --> 29:39.060
It's good.

29:39.060 --> 29:40.060
So you know what?

29:40.060 --> 29:43.140
You can put your application now into the TE.

29:43.140 --> 29:44.300
And now it's a tested.

29:44.300 --> 29:46.380
So you can have much better trust.

29:47.060 --> 29:48.060
Right.

29:48.060 --> 29:49.980
Oh, and you want that to be open source too, right?

29:49.980 --> 29:53.860
Because otherwise how can you be trusting that?

29:53.860 --> 29:58.620
So if you want to know more about all of this beautiful stuff, you should go to any of these

29:58.620 --> 29:59.620
resources.

29:59.620 --> 30:04.380
It used to be called Hardware Aided Trust Computing Dev Room.

30:04.380 --> 30:05.380
It isn't anymore.

30:05.380 --> 30:08.180
It's now called Confederation Computing Dev Room.

30:08.180 --> 30:11.700
There's a whole bunch of white papers, a book.

30:11.700 --> 30:12.940
And that's me.

30:12.940 --> 30:13.940
And we're done.

30:13.940 --> 30:14.940
Thank you.

30:14.940 --> 30:29.100
This is the one which I got.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.260
So I don't know.

30:30.260 --> 30:33.140
Do we have Matthias Bolt Lendzirk here?

30:33.140 --> 30:35.140
If yes.

30:35.140 --> 30:36.140
No.

30:36.140 --> 30:37.140
Okay.

30:37.140 --> 30:44.820
Then over to Justin V. Florey for the Distribution Staff Room.

30:44.820 --> 30:47.700
Or not.

30:47.700 --> 30:50.100
Then Michael at nlnet.nl.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.100
Good.

30:51.100 --> 30:56.100
No, no, you need to stay up front.

30:56.100 --> 31:01.100
This works if you stay close enough.

31:01.100 --> 31:07.100
You have to stay with me when you're done.

31:07.100 --> 31:08.100
Okay.

31:08.100 --> 31:11.020
So, okay.

31:11.020 --> 31:12.380
Is this loud enough?

31:12.380 --> 31:17.380
So as has been mentioned before, okay, I have to stay here.

31:17.380 --> 31:22.540
So as has been mentioned before, Falsam is a bit of a sticker heaven.

31:22.540 --> 31:26.780
So we decided to do this Hexmas because, well, we make Hex stickers.

31:26.780 --> 31:30.980
So we bought a shitload of them.

31:30.980 --> 31:34.340
We bought about 140,000 hexagon stickers.

31:34.340 --> 31:40.620
And with each sticker taking roughly 1673 square millimeters, that means that we have

31:40.700 --> 31:48.060
through 34 square meters of stickers, which should be enough to cover 3750 laptops in

31:48.060 --> 31:49.060
full.

31:49.060 --> 31:51.380
And this is the classic thing, Pat, right?

31:51.380 --> 31:55.300
So if you put all of these behind you, you can make a cover, a trailer, about six pounds

31:55.300 --> 31:58.860
for one kilometers.

31:58.860 --> 32:02.980
And that is shit.

32:02.980 --> 32:06.020
I missed out on one of the...

32:06.020 --> 32:13.020
I think we measured something like 3,700 tractors protesting against...

32:15.180 --> 32:21.420
So we bought 160 different designs and you can do these nice things with it.

32:21.420 --> 32:28.180
And so people did actually, you can make these really cool color tiling because, well, this

32:28.180 --> 32:29.820
becomes a thing, right?

32:29.820 --> 32:33.860
So getting more aesthetics into computing.

32:34.140 --> 32:37.700
Obviously our main goal is not to grant lots of cool projects.

32:37.700 --> 32:38.940
I heard some ambitious things.

32:38.940 --> 32:41.620
So it's a challenge to the people that have the billions.

32:41.620 --> 32:42.620
We don't have the billions.

32:42.620 --> 32:45.860
We have a nice amount of money as a grand maker.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.860
But I challenge you, we had 49 talks.

32:47.860 --> 32:51.180
So that means that they have to do 80 times as much.

32:51.180 --> 32:57.860
So I expect 4,000 talks at the next false dem from the cloud computing group that was

32:57.860 --> 33:02.500
announced in the first talk.

33:02.660 --> 33:07.900
So, like with Hexmas, you can have this father Hex to appear.

33:07.900 --> 33:12.700
And in this case, is the man who wrote the Hex spec, visited...

33:12.700 --> 33:14.420
There's an official spec for this.

33:14.420 --> 33:15.620
And the man visited our booth.

33:15.620 --> 33:21.140
He was called on by some of the gods on the internet and he was summoned in our place.

33:21.140 --> 33:23.940
And so he mastodoned.

33:23.940 --> 33:25.780
Mastodon's a project that we funded.

33:25.780 --> 33:27.860
So we were proud to see that in place.

33:27.860 --> 33:33.420
He mastodoned the source code that we printed out for everybody to follow on our footsteps.

33:33.420 --> 33:39.220
So hopefully next time there will be lots more Hex stickers and the kids will be happy.

33:39.220 --> 33:42.780
They will have the name tags, but they will also each of them have hundreds and hundreds

33:42.780 --> 33:44.740
of stickers to take home.

33:44.740 --> 33:46.060
And that's basically it.

33:46.060 --> 33:49.740
By the way, if you haven't applied to Inelna, you're doing a cool project.

33:49.740 --> 33:51.260
Inelna.nl.

33:51.260 --> 33:54.100
Ask us for money and we work on cool stuff.

33:58.820 --> 34:02.820
Next up, we have Steven Goodwin on Magic.

34:10.820 --> 34:12.820
Okay, so thank you everybody.

34:12.820 --> 34:15.940
As you can maybe be able to tell, my name is James Merlin.

34:15.940 --> 34:19.380
And as you can tell from the name, I am a magician.

34:19.380 --> 34:24.020
Now, when you become a magician, you get given four envelopes.

34:24.180 --> 34:28.180
Now, there's one of me, so I need three people from maybe the first or two.

34:28.180 --> 34:30.180
Can I have three people from maybe this side?

34:30.180 --> 34:32.180
Because these are speaker people.

34:32.180 --> 34:34.180
So obviously, can't trust them.

34:36.180 --> 34:37.180
Even you.

34:37.180 --> 34:40.180
So can I get one more person, please?

34:40.180 --> 34:41.180
Yep, I'll come down.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.180
Okay, fantastic.

34:42.180 --> 34:44.180
So now we've got three people.

34:44.180 --> 34:46.180
So we've got three people.

34:46.180 --> 34:49.180
And as a magician, you get given four envelopes.

34:49.180 --> 34:50.180
There is.

34:50.340 --> 34:53.340
And as a magician, you get given four envelopes.

34:53.340 --> 34:59.340
There is a number one, which is in nice, bright yellow.

34:59.340 --> 35:03.340
We have a number two, which is nice and brown.

35:03.340 --> 35:08.340
There's a number three, which is pink, and a number four.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.340
So we'll start at the left.

35:10.340 --> 35:13.340
Would you like number one, two, three, or four?

35:13.340 --> 35:14.340
Number one.

35:14.340 --> 35:15.340
Number one.

35:15.340 --> 35:17.340
Everyone goes for number one.

35:17.340 --> 35:18.340
That's yours.

35:18.340 --> 35:19.340
Don't open it just yet.

35:19.340 --> 35:20.340
No surprise.

35:20.340 --> 35:23.340
Next up, you have a number two, number three, or number four left.

35:23.340 --> 35:24.340
What would you like?

35:24.340 --> 35:25.340
You would like number four.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.340
No.

35:26.340 --> 35:27.340
No.

35:27.340 --> 35:32.340
I can't get the stuff.

35:32.340 --> 35:35.340
Can't get the stuff.

35:35.340 --> 35:38.340
And finally, you have two or four.

35:38.340 --> 35:39.340
You would like number four.

35:39.340 --> 35:40.340
Okay.

35:40.340 --> 35:44.340
Would you now all please open your envelopes?

35:44.340 --> 35:48.340
You may open them at the top, be very polite, or just tear them open.

35:48.340 --> 35:53.340
If you tear them and you look like a ruffian, I'll assume you use windows.

35:53.340 --> 36:00.340
I'm seriously not going to work at Microsoft after that.

36:00.340 --> 36:04.340
So inside the envelope, you should find a piece of paper.

36:04.340 --> 36:09.340
Throw the rest of the envelope away.

36:09.340 --> 36:12.340
We have people for that.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.340
Probably Alistair.

36:14.340 --> 36:21.340
So for the start off, would you tell me what's in your envelope on your piece of paper that you chose?

36:21.340 --> 36:24.340
It says yours.

36:24.340 --> 36:29.340
What's in your envelope on your piece of paper that you chose?

36:29.340 --> 36:33.340
What's in your piece of paper in your envelope that you chose?

36:33.340 --> 36:41.340
Well, in the envelope that you left me is a piece of paper that happens to be a 50-pound note that says mine.

36:41.340 --> 36:42.340
Thank you all.

36:42.340 --> 36:49.340
I can do that from here.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.340
Thank you.

36:50.340 --> 36:53.340
Now, that's quite a nice little thing.

36:53.340 --> 36:58.340
But what on earth is a magician doing at Fozdem?

36:58.340 --> 37:07.340
Well, spoiler alert, cover your ears if you don't want to know, but my real name is not James Merlin.

37:07.340 --> 37:11.340
Oh, some people were actually shocked by that.

37:11.340 --> 37:14.340
It's not. My real name is Stephen Goodwin.

37:14.340 --> 37:15.340
I'm an open source developer.

37:15.340 --> 37:17.340
I've been for the last 30 years.

37:17.340 --> 37:19.340
I'm an incredible geek.

37:19.340 --> 37:22.340
As in, I do a lot of really weird stuff.

37:22.340 --> 37:27.340
I was speaking about generating music from algorithms earlier today.

37:27.340 --> 37:31.340
So why was I talking about magic yesterday?

37:31.340 --> 37:35.340
We closed out this room yesterday evening with a talk about magic.

37:35.340 --> 37:39.340
Magic is almost the antithesis of open source.

37:39.340 --> 37:42.340
Magicians deal in secrets.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.340
Things you're not meant to know.

37:44.340 --> 37:47.340
How do magicians share secrets?

37:47.340 --> 37:49.340
How do you reserve them?

37:49.340 --> 37:57.340
Basically, what we found is you can copyright the script of a magic show, but you can't protect it.

37:57.340 --> 38:04.340
You can't put a license on it because then it becomes an end user license agreement, and we know how those don't work.

38:04.340 --> 38:10.340
We talked about how patents can protect the secret of a magic trick if it's inventive enough.

38:10.340 --> 38:12.340
But how do patents work?

38:12.340 --> 38:18.340
You have to file it with the patent body, which it means to protect the secret of a magic trick.

38:18.340 --> 38:23.340
You have to tell everybody exactly how it works.

38:23.340 --> 38:26.340
Oops.

38:26.340 --> 38:29.340
And that was the essence of what I was here to do.

38:29.340 --> 38:39.340
By the way, you realize there's a whole group of other people who have these same issues, and maybe there's a completely different problem to be solved.

38:39.340 --> 38:45.340
And it was a nice talk. I enjoyed giving it. People laughed in the right places most of the time.

38:45.340 --> 38:55.340
And we came away not knowing much more than we came in with, which was protecting stuff, making sure the people have the information they need.

38:55.340 --> 39:01.340
It's really difficult when your whole infrastructure relies on secrets.

39:01.340 --> 39:10.340
We are just so used to openness that when you suddenly look at it from the other side, you realize, actually, we might be in the right here.

39:10.340 --> 39:15.340
So with that, I say thank you. My name is either James Merlin or Stephen Goodwin. Thank you and good night.

39:15.340 --> 39:30.340
Next up, we have open source and European legislative landscape with Simon Phipps.

39:30.340 --> 39:36.340
Thank you.

39:36.340 --> 39:45.340
So my apologies. I have no slides. We had to cut the dev room closed early so I could make it here. And so we haven't made them yet.

39:45.340 --> 39:52.340
So I've been coming to Fosden since 2006 and done a bunch of stuff.

39:52.340 --> 39:57.340
But last year, I made friends with a guy called Martin Ertson.

39:57.340 --> 40:10.340
He works at NLNet Labs and he had accidentally fallen in with a bad lot, a load of policymakers at the Dutch government and the European parliament.

40:10.340 --> 40:13.340
And he decided that he would bring them to Fosden.

40:13.340 --> 40:25.340
And so last year, you will remember there was a keynote with two European policymakers explaining the Cyber Resilience Act and the Product Liability Directive.

40:25.340 --> 40:31.340
And many of us found that presentation very alarming.

40:31.340 --> 40:42.340
And so a group of people, me from OSI, some folks from Free Software Foundation Europe, from Eclipse and from Open Forum Europe,

40:42.340 --> 40:54.340
got together and started pestering policymakers at the European Commission into changing the CRA so that we could still have open source in Europe.

40:54.340 --> 41:01.340
So I'm pleased to say that towards the end of last year, it seemed that they had listened to us.

41:01.340 --> 41:07.340
That actually you can do open source in Europe. Thank goodness.

41:07.340 --> 41:21.340
So here at Fosden this year, we asked them if they would come back and tell us how it had gone.

41:21.340 --> 41:29.340
So Benjamin, who was the guy that wrote the CRA, asked me whether the Fosden audience normally eggs people.

41:29.340 --> 41:38.340
And I assured him that there had been very little fruit or eggs thrown in previous years, although this year could be an exception.

41:38.340 --> 41:42.340
But he did wear old clothes anyway, just in case.

41:42.340 --> 41:51.340
And he came along and gave us a main track talk yesterday along with Omar Energy, who wrote the Product Liability Directive.

41:51.340 --> 41:55.340
And they told us how it was now, very carefully.

41:55.340 --> 42:01.340
We then got them and quite a number of their closest friends into a dev room today.

42:01.340 --> 42:10.340
And we invited you to come and tell them how you felt about the Cyber Resilience Act and the Product Liability Directive.

42:10.340 --> 42:20.340
And you did. The dev room has been completely full for the entire day from 9 until just before 5 when we closed it.

42:20.340 --> 42:27.340
We have had a queue outside and we're going to write four reports which are going to be very pretty,

42:27.340 --> 42:32.340
which we're going to give to the European Commission so that they know that we exist.

42:32.340 --> 42:36.340
Because, you know, they didn't know we did until last year.

42:36.340 --> 42:46.340
They went and asked SMEs about the Cyber Resilience Act, but they didn't bother to ask any open source developers.

42:46.340 --> 42:52.340
And that's why the CRA last year just had one mention of open source in it.

42:52.340 --> 43:00.340
And that's why the CRA at the end of last year had about 20 to 25 mentions of open source in it.

43:00.340 --> 43:10.340
And additionally creates an extra new category in law called a software steward to whom different rules apply to a software manufacturer.

43:10.340 --> 43:16.340
Now Alistair asked me to say roughly what the effect of the CRA and the PLD is.

43:16.340 --> 43:26.340
The CRA as it stands now pretty much exempts open source developers from any mandatory action.

43:26.340 --> 43:33.340
If you are all feeling fellow human kindness towards your downstream,

43:33.340 --> 43:39.340
you might want to provide them with the documentation they need to comply with the CRA.

43:39.340 --> 43:43.340
But there's nothing that you actually have to do.

43:43.340 --> 43:52.340
Additionally, we found during the process that some open source foundations accidentally turned out to be treated as manufacturers.

43:52.340 --> 44:01.340
And that's why Mike Malinkovich from Eclipse wrote some corresponding blogs last year about how the world was ending.

44:01.340 --> 44:07.340
Now Mike then in December wrote a blog saying how the world was no longer ending.

44:07.340 --> 44:15.340
And the reason for that was because there is a new lightweight set of responsibilities for open source foundations and charities,

44:15.340 --> 44:21.340
which additionally do not attract any legal penalties if they accidentally forget to do them.

44:21.340 --> 44:28.340
So to give you the TLDR, it's inaccurate as Benjamin keeps on telling me.

44:28.340 --> 44:34.340
Now it is true that open source development is exempt from the CRA.

44:34.340 --> 44:40.340
It is people who are your monetizing downstreams to whom the CRA applies.

44:40.340 --> 44:45.340
And you could ask them for lots of money to help them comply with the CRA.

44:45.340 --> 44:59.340
So this was all a crazy experiment.

44:59.340 --> 45:02.340
We applied for our dev room two days before the deadline.

45:02.340 --> 45:08.340
I wrote the application in about an hour just before the deadline.

45:08.340 --> 45:13.340
And unexpectedly we rewarded it and so we had to make it happen.

45:13.340 --> 45:37.340
Thank you very much for that trust. Please can we have a room double the size next year?

45:37.340 --> 45:45.340
Next up we have Blaine Garst.

45:45.340 --> 45:52.340
Thank you.

45:52.340 --> 45:55.340
I'm not used to this.

45:55.340 --> 46:04.340
So I put the free in FreeBSD and I forgot the staging instructions.

46:04.340 --> 46:07.340
I'm the wizard of many things.

46:07.340 --> 46:14.340
I'm a wizard in the sense that I gave you POSIX through work at Bell Labs because they ran out of gas.

46:14.340 --> 46:19.340
So I started hooking up with OpenBSD, Bill Joy.

46:19.340 --> 46:21.340
I crossed paths with him several times.

46:21.340 --> 46:28.340
They bought our sources for OpenSTEP and derived Java out of it.

46:28.340 --> 46:35.340
So Java is a derivative work of mine because I put interfaces into Objective C and retooled everything.

46:35.340 --> 46:41.340
I put closures into our Objective C language and it retooled all the APIs that Apple sells.

46:41.340 --> 46:42.340
You cannot do that.

46:42.340 --> 46:48.340
I hired Chris Lautner and took LVM out of my alma mater and put it into Apple.

46:48.340 --> 46:52.340
I just had kind of epic level impact.

46:52.340 --> 46:56.340
So that was the POSIX.

46:56.340 --> 46:59.340
That's the first one, Act 2.

46:59.340 --> 47:01.340
That was kind of the closures.

47:01.340 --> 47:04.340
The closures were called that up arrow blocks.

47:04.340 --> 47:05.340
They came from small talk.

47:05.340 --> 47:07.340
I took over that language.

47:07.340 --> 47:10.340
I didn't even have to look at this.

47:10.340 --> 47:13.340
I put an underbar atomic into the CLO and committee.

47:13.340 --> 47:15.340
It was the wrong way to do concurrency.

47:15.340 --> 47:16.340
I knew that at the time.

47:16.340 --> 47:18.340
The correct way to do concurrency is actors.

47:18.340 --> 47:21.340
And that's what I talked about this week.

47:21.340 --> 47:22.340
Spacebar.

47:22.340 --> 47:23.340
What do I do here?

47:23.340 --> 47:25.340
There we go.

47:25.340 --> 47:27.340
This is what I talked about yesterday.

47:27.340 --> 47:29.340
I have a system version of rewriting everything.

47:29.340 --> 47:32.340
Because security is an architecture.

47:32.340 --> 47:36.340
You have to start with architecture to accomplish it.

47:36.340 --> 47:40.340
I went to a few of your security talks and stuff.

47:40.340 --> 47:44.340
I asked Chris Stoffer in here.

47:44.340 --> 47:45.340
A fundamental question.

47:45.340 --> 47:47.340
If you don't track the hardware,

47:47.340 --> 47:51.340
you have no chance of actual security.

47:51.340 --> 47:53.340
I'm consulting to some space guys.

47:53.340 --> 47:56.340
I've consulted to some grid energy operators.

47:56.340 --> 47:59.340
They need unhackable.

47:59.340 --> 48:03.340
And the way you do it is with open source protocols,

48:03.340 --> 48:07.340
peer to peer people to people networks.

48:07.340 --> 48:11.340
I'm trying to get a modem that's super secure into everybody's home.

48:11.340 --> 48:14.340
You sign up your friends.

48:14.340 --> 48:16.340
They are the ones who know your identity.

48:16.340 --> 48:19.340
So we solve identity first.

48:19.340 --> 48:20.340
With your friends.

48:20.340 --> 48:24.340
You can keep track of your thousand friends, you know, public keys.

48:24.340 --> 48:28.340
And they're generated on super secure hardware that you guys are just talking about.

48:28.340 --> 48:32.340
Well, anyway, a few years ago I got set up with this guy.

48:32.340 --> 48:35.340
He builds a hardware that solves all these problems.

48:35.340 --> 48:39.340
You can read about it in my FOSSTEM talk from 222.

48:39.340 --> 48:45.340
I signed an LOI to buy chips from him on Friday before I came here.

48:45.340 --> 48:50.340
My life has been a little difficult.

48:50.340 --> 48:53.340
I say I'm a wizard.

48:53.340 --> 48:58.340
I do illusions as the Great Merlin did.

48:58.340 --> 49:00.340
I have some with me, but I don't know.

49:00.340 --> 49:02.340
I can only tell one story.

49:02.340 --> 49:05.340
So I transform myself in my other talk.

49:05.340 --> 49:07.340
What else did I do?

49:07.340 --> 49:11.340
All right, so here's the basic idea.

49:11.340 --> 49:15.340
Code is actually math when you look at it from a...

49:15.340 --> 49:17.340
It's math.

49:17.340 --> 49:18.340
Math is algorithms.

49:18.340 --> 49:20.340
They can't be patented.

49:20.340 --> 49:22.340
Math is not source code.

49:22.340 --> 49:25.340
It's algorithms.

49:25.340 --> 49:26.340
So look at this.

49:26.340 --> 49:28.340
I'm going to get rid of every...

49:28.340 --> 49:32.340
I may be the last programmer is the way I think about it.

49:32.340 --> 49:34.340
I am building...

49:34.340 --> 49:39.340
I have a plan to end the patriarchy.

49:39.340 --> 49:44.340
To free you all, free everybody from wage slavery.

49:44.340 --> 49:47.340
I'm buying the chips.

49:47.340 --> 49:49.340
I've got a plan.

49:49.340 --> 49:52.340
I invite you to follow it.

49:52.340 --> 49:56.340
The next update will likely be at OpenFest in November.

49:56.340 --> 50:00.340
And I brought pen and paper to select anybody who wants to follow along.

50:00.340 --> 50:02.340
I'll add you to my sub-stack.

50:02.340 --> 50:04.340
You can track along, participate.

50:04.340 --> 50:06.340
I'm going to... I'm the wizard.

50:06.340 --> 50:10.340
And I will offer one-on-one, lead one-on-one code reviews and stuff

50:10.340 --> 50:12.340
as I elevate my software.

50:12.340 --> 50:14.340
I got 30,000 lines of code.

50:14.340 --> 50:16.340
It compiles and runs on ESP32s.

50:16.340 --> 50:20.340
I ran the Batman mesh network so we could build dynamic networks

50:20.340 --> 50:22.340
in my neighborhood in case everything went out.

50:22.340 --> 50:26.340
I know I'm going to try to get a polar fire chip

50:26.340 --> 50:30.340
on the Linux laptops with a SESTIR radio.

50:30.340 --> 50:35.340
So they're emergency responders, so you are not subject to your ISP going down.

50:35.340 --> 50:39.340
Okay? I am badass. I'm sorry.

50:39.340 --> 50:43.340
I'll show you one token for my career.

50:43.340 --> 50:45.340
This is a good one. Okay?

50:45.340 --> 50:47.340
I got a little box here, you know?

50:47.340 --> 50:49.340
I still got the sticker on it, you know?

50:49.340 --> 50:50.340
And you know what's in it?

50:50.340 --> 50:52.340
It's a metal.

50:52.340 --> 50:56.340
They gave me a metal because I was at Bell Labs, pre-divacature.

50:56.340 --> 50:58.340
And by God, they were splitting us off

50:58.340 --> 51:00.340
because they were going to build the Internet of Internet.

51:00.340 --> 51:01.340
They were trying to build the Internet.

51:01.340 --> 51:05.340
It's called the Bell Data Network.

51:05.340 --> 51:06.340
And I got this little metal here.

51:06.340 --> 51:07.340
They gave me a metal.

51:07.340 --> 51:10.340
It says, Blaine Gilles, first to be chosen.

51:10.340 --> 51:12.340
And do you know what?

51:12.340 --> 51:16.340
It was the pioneer of the AT&T logo.

51:16.340 --> 51:17.340
It's pure silver.

51:17.340 --> 51:19.340
I don't know, a couple hundred bucks.

51:19.340 --> 51:22.340
They didn't have stock options.

51:22.340 --> 51:25.340
The spring guys, sorry.

51:25.340 --> 51:29.340
The Java guys, they were the first person.

51:29.340 --> 51:32.340
They took my kernel team because we got out of the hardware business.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.340
And I put Objective C into the kernel, you know,

51:34.340 --> 51:36.340
a little object-oriented language that had interfaces in it

51:36.340 --> 51:38.340
because that's where they started out.

51:38.340 --> 51:40.340
I got Gosling on stage admitting it.

51:40.340 --> 51:43.340
Am I out of time?

51:43.340 --> 51:44.340
All right, what?

51:44.340 --> 51:45.340
Okay.

51:45.340 --> 51:46.340
I'm not shouting loud enough.

51:46.340 --> 51:48.340
Okay.

51:48.340 --> 51:55.340
Thank you.

51:55.340 --> 51:58.340
You guys, people love working for me because I just,

51:58.340 --> 52:01.340
I inspire them and get out of the way.

52:01.340 --> 52:03.340
And that's what I intend to do.

52:03.340 --> 52:09.340
I know how to leverage and leverage and leverage as Monomoto Masashi did.

52:09.340 --> 52:15.340
That's what I wrote and read aloud at the beginning of my FOSTA talk last time.

52:15.340 --> 52:16.340
I'm inspired.

52:16.340 --> 52:19.340
You gotta take me away.

52:19.340 --> 52:21.340
They're coming to take me away?

52:21.340 --> 52:22.340
No, we're not.

52:22.340 --> 52:25.340
This is good.

52:25.340 --> 52:27.340
I'm a wizard of chocolate.

52:27.340 --> 52:29.340
You gotta keep up with me, though.

52:29.340 --> 52:31.340
That's hard for most people.

52:31.340 --> 52:33.340
But I'm nice about it.

52:33.340 --> 52:35.340
You can imagine I'm nice about it.

52:35.340 --> 52:39.340
This is the chip I'm gonna put into Modems.

52:39.340 --> 52:45.340
I'm gonna put into Radios because to prove the correctness,

52:45.340 --> 52:47.340
we need everything in the open.

52:47.340 --> 52:49.340
It needs to be algorithms.

52:49.340 --> 52:54.340
Okay, next slide.

52:54.340 --> 52:56.340
I have a sheet of paper.

52:56.340 --> 52:59.340
You want to help me out?

52:59.340 --> 53:01.340
Join me.

53:01.340 --> 53:02.340
Sign up.

53:02.340 --> 53:06.340
Here, I'll put you on my bog list and we'll,

53:06.340 --> 53:09.340
I can teach you how to code in algorithms.

53:09.340 --> 53:13.340
Christoph is gonna teach me how to turn those algorithms into fun

53:13.340 --> 53:16.340
drag and drop software to make this happen.

53:16.340 --> 53:18.340
Maybe, if I could talk a little bit.

53:18.340 --> 53:19.340
Not Christoph.

53:19.340 --> 53:20.340
Yes, I did.

53:20.340 --> 53:23.340
Christopher.

53:23.340 --> 53:25.340
I don't know.

53:25.340 --> 53:29.340
I brought, the magic I do is I make chocolate, ethical chocolate.

53:29.340 --> 53:32.340
If we could have supply, if we got unhackable supply chain,

53:32.340 --> 53:35.340
then we could make choices about where our stuff comes from

53:35.340 --> 53:37.340
because we're over consuming the resources

53:37.340 --> 53:39.340
that are planned by Factor 1.8 every year.

53:39.340 --> 53:42.340
This ain't gonna last.

53:42.340 --> 53:44.340
We've got to track the resources.

53:44.340 --> 53:45.340
Money isn't the answer.

53:45.340 --> 53:47.340
By first degrees in economics.

53:47.340 --> 53:49.340
I came over to high school of a thousand.

53:49.340 --> 53:50.340
We have to go to the next slide.

53:50.340 --> 53:52.340
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

53:52.340 --> 53:54.340
Thank you.

53:54.340 --> 53:56.340
Thank you.

53:56.340 --> 54:02.340
Thank you.

54:02.340 --> 54:05.340
So, please bear with us.

54:05.340 --> 54:08.340
We need to switch out the laptop, but we are not yet done.

54:08.340 --> 54:10.340
You are going to see something nice.

54:10.340 --> 54:13.340
We are trying to break something live to,

54:13.340 --> 54:16.340
or test it to breaking point.

54:16.340 --> 54:17.340
Okay.

54:17.340 --> 54:18.340
Hi everybody.

54:18.340 --> 54:22.340
I think it forced me to have the solemn responsibility

54:22.340 --> 54:25.340
to encourage you to break the network.

54:25.340 --> 54:28.340
Now, if we were doing this in the horrible pandemic times,

54:28.340 --> 54:29.340
it would probably be over matrix.

54:29.340 --> 54:32.340
We would probably be using Element call these days

54:32.340 --> 54:34.340
as a way to do communication.

54:34.340 --> 54:36.340
Element call looks like this.

54:36.340 --> 54:39.340
It is a selective forwarding unit powered by LiveKit,

54:39.340 --> 54:41.340
which is a wonderful open source project.

54:41.340 --> 54:44.340
And then you have matrix clients that connect to it

54:44.340 --> 54:47.340
to do video conferencing, which is now end to end encrypted

54:47.340 --> 54:50.340
and scalable connecting to a matrix home server.

54:50.340 --> 54:53.340
So, let me actually go to one I made earlier,

54:53.340 --> 54:56.340
and that was the QR code that I just checked up.

54:56.340 --> 54:58.340
And I am going to join that.

54:58.340 --> 54:59.340
Like so.

54:59.340 --> 55:03.340
I am going to take that link and check it into the Janssen room

55:03.340 --> 55:05.340
or the Janssen room.

55:05.340 --> 55:07.340
Let me just find it.

55:07.340 --> 55:09.340
Key notes.

55:09.340 --> 55:12.340
Blunk in the logo, the URL and that.

55:12.340 --> 55:14.340
And if you look carefully, you will see the URL has a password in it,

55:14.340 --> 55:17.340
which is the end to end encryption URL for that room.

55:17.340 --> 55:19.340
And I am hoping that somebody is going to join.

55:19.340 --> 55:20.340
Yes.

55:20.340 --> 55:23.340
So, shall we get everybody in the room onto this

55:23.340 --> 55:25.340
and see what horrors happen even to the network?

55:25.340 --> 55:27.340
Or the SFU itself?

55:27.340 --> 55:31.340
So, the way this thing works...

55:31.340 --> 55:33.340
Well, what?

55:33.340 --> 55:35.340
OK, OK.

55:35.340 --> 55:36.340
Sorry.

55:36.340 --> 55:37.340
Yep, yep, yep.

55:37.340 --> 55:38.340
There we go.

55:38.340 --> 55:40.340
Go boring.

55:40.340 --> 55:43.340
So, the way this thing works is to only subscribe to the streams

55:43.340 --> 55:46.340
that you need at the resolution that you are requesting

55:46.340 --> 55:48.340
for the streams which are on the screen.

55:48.340 --> 55:50.340
So, in theory, it should go quite well.

55:50.340 --> 55:52.340
We are only using one instance here.

55:52.340 --> 55:54.340
We are not actually federating through to others.

55:54.340 --> 55:56.340
But, oh, hello, we are up to 17 users.

55:56.340 --> 55:58.340
Come on, you can do more than that.

55:58.340 --> 56:00.340
I do all hands of work.

56:00.340 --> 56:01.340
It's like 100 people.

56:01.340 --> 56:03.340
So, we know it can go that far.

56:03.340 --> 56:06.340
But the question is, will the network crap out first?

56:06.340 --> 56:08.340
Now, by the way, you can double click on people

56:08.340 --> 56:10.340
and like zoom them in.

56:10.340 --> 56:12.340
There's Andy at home and Amandine.

56:12.340 --> 56:15.340
And there's Timo who makes a conduit matrix server up to 21.

56:15.340 --> 56:17.340
How high can we go?

56:17.340 --> 56:20.340
Let me put the QR code back up to passively, aggressively.

56:20.340 --> 56:23.340
We are in fact actively, aggressively ask you to follow the QR code

56:23.340 --> 56:26.340
and see whether we can melt something.

56:26.340 --> 56:29.340
Okay, we are up to 25.

56:29.340 --> 56:31.340
By the way, if you have AluminX installed,

56:31.340 --> 56:33.340
it will open in AluminX.

56:33.340 --> 56:35.340
Okay, I'll just keep the QR code up.

56:35.340 --> 56:37.340
You and your scientific logic.

56:37.340 --> 56:39.340
Let me go and put it on the side.

56:39.340 --> 56:41.340
And we can do both.

56:41.340 --> 56:43.340
If I knew how to use a windowing manager,

56:43.340 --> 56:45.340
then we could literally do both.

56:45.340 --> 56:48.340
Yeah, actually, look, it's a black hatch.

56:49.340 --> 56:51.340
All right.

56:51.340 --> 56:56.340
Oh, you can see all the amazing relay outs on Element Cool here.

56:56.340 --> 56:59.340
By the way, one of the fun things here is that if I open a different tab,

56:59.340 --> 57:02.340
then you can see my network usage is going to drop right down,

57:02.340 --> 57:04.340
where it should drop right down,

57:04.340 --> 57:06.340
because it's no longer subscribing to the feeds.

57:06.340 --> 57:08.340
Likewise, if people scroll off the bottom,

57:08.340 --> 57:10.340
then you just stop subscribing to them.

57:10.340 --> 57:12.340
Listen, come on, how do you got 28 people?

57:12.340 --> 57:15.340
It seems to already start breaking for people

57:15.340 --> 57:17.340
and the audience, they can't join anymore.

57:17.340 --> 57:19.340
So we broke it through.

57:19.340 --> 57:21.340
Oh, you're asking that we have actually melted it?

57:21.340 --> 57:23.340
We have to...

57:23.340 --> 57:25.340
Well, clearly, it's not the...

57:25.340 --> 57:27.340
It must be the network or something.

57:27.340 --> 57:29.340
Hopefully, it's not on our side.

57:29.340 --> 57:31.340
But anyway, there we go.

57:31.340 --> 57:33.340
This was the demo that I was asked to redo again,

57:33.340 --> 57:35.340
because we did it earlier and the recording didn't work very well.

57:35.340 --> 57:37.340
But thank you, everybody, for following along.

57:37.340 --> 57:39.340
There's one other very quick thing,

57:39.340 --> 57:43.340
which is what we're talking about European Union stuff.

57:43.340 --> 57:45.340
Outside of CRA and PLD,

57:45.340 --> 57:48.340
there's also the DMA, the Digital Markets Act,

57:48.340 --> 57:51.340
and the big announcement we had on the main stage talk this morning

57:51.340 --> 57:55.340
is that we've been working Matrix and Aliment with WhatsApp

57:55.340 --> 57:58.340
as one of the gatekeepers defined by the EU

57:58.340 --> 58:02.340
in order to try to figure out how we can interoperate

58:02.340 --> 58:05.340
in an open fashion with them once DMA hits on March 7th,

58:05.340 --> 58:08.340
where they are obligated to open their APIs

58:08.340 --> 58:10.340
and their network to anybody who asks.

58:10.340 --> 58:14.340
So watch the space for March 7th to see what that looks like.

58:14.340 --> 58:16.340
I think that's it from me.

58:16.340 --> 58:18.340
APPLAUSE
