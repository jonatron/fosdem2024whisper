00:00.000 --> 00:11.360
Hello everybody. My name is Eli Malin and I'm here to talk about the conspiracy to solve

00:11.360 --> 00:17.880
video for everybody forever. It's top secret. Don't tell anybody. Definitely don't live

00:17.880 --> 00:22.760
stream this talk or anything like that. This is a conspiracy. We don't want to let anything

00:22.760 --> 00:30.160
out. My name is Eli Malin. Like I said, I've got socials there. I'm a director of engineering

00:30.160 --> 00:34.920
at Live Peer, actually very close to my five year anniversary at Live Peer, which is longer

00:34.920 --> 00:47.240
than I've done anything. Today I want to talk about what motivates me and what I think we

00:47.240 --> 00:52.920
can do to make video better for everybody in the world. I'm also going to talk about

00:52.920 --> 00:58.080
Live Peer Catalyst, which is software we put out, a media server that I think is going

00:58.080 --> 01:06.560
to help us toward this end. I've been working in decentralized video since 2016. I quit

01:06.560 --> 01:13.000
my job to try and go start my own company and from there all the experience I gained

01:13.000 --> 01:18.200
in that led me to Live Peer. This is the best life advice I've ever gotten from Dominic

01:18.200 --> 01:23.840
Tarr who founded Secure Scuttlebutt. If anybody is familiar with that project, I asked him

01:23.840 --> 01:26.960
how I could contribute to Scuttlebutt and he said, figure out what you are uniquely suited

01:26.960 --> 01:32.240
to do and then do it. I think since this tweet that's been approximately what I'm doing is

01:32.240 --> 01:37.600
I happen to know a lot about video tech. I thought I could think of ways to improve the

01:37.600 --> 01:46.480
lives of people using it. That's what motivates me and that's what causes the mission to try

01:46.480 --> 01:53.400
and solve video for everybody forever. We've had a lot of nice state of the union talks

01:53.400 --> 02:00.160
in this room about how things are going. This will be the state of the union for our conspiracy

02:00.160 --> 02:06.080
to solve video for everybody forever. There have been some setbacks. Video is not yet

02:06.120 --> 02:12.320
solved for everybody forever. I'm going to talk about a few of them here. The first I want to talk

02:12.320 --> 02:22.200
about is corporate centralization. This is an analysis of game stream platforms, actually

02:22.200 --> 02:30.920
like all live streaming platforms of a certain category here. You can see we sort of live in a

02:30.960 --> 02:37.360
world where it would seem to send out video to people. You need to be a mega corporation. We've

02:37.360 --> 02:43.520
got YouTube owned by Google and Twitch owned by Amazon. Everybody else add up every other

02:43.520 --> 02:51.920
competitor and they don't come close to those two. While these platforms have enabled a lot of

02:52.080 --> 03:02.720
people to get started with video, there's also been some problems. In order to make these platforms

03:02.720 --> 03:07.760
work at these scale and make it work with all the different content producers, these platforms

03:07.760 --> 03:13.880
tend to be extremely strict about things like having copyrighted music. Even when we're talking

03:13.880 --> 03:21.760
about a clip that you put in years ago, if that gets reported, you can get your Twitch account or

03:21.840 --> 03:27.040
YouTube account permanently banned. This has happened to a lot of people. Basically, it wrecks

03:27.040 --> 03:33.440
their entire careers. They build entire careers on top of Twitch, on top of YouTube. Basically,

03:33.440 --> 03:39.760
these backroom deals that Twitch and Amazon, that Amazon and Google rather, have had to sign

03:39.760 --> 03:46.800
with different folks, causes them to, in order to make the copyright holders happy, in order to

03:46.800 --> 03:50.200
these deals they sign with the big music labels and that sort of thing, they have to permanently

03:50.240 --> 03:55.120
ban these streamers. I want to point out this isn't a law or anything like that. This isn't the

03:55.120 --> 03:58.520
rules about how you're supposed to use copyright. You're not supposed to use copyrighted content,

03:58.520 --> 04:05.560
but in terms of permanently deleting things, that's something that they just negotiated

04:05.560 --> 04:10.360
amongst themselves. But it basically, given this chart here, it basically has the force of a law.

04:10.360 --> 04:17.600
That's people's entire livelihoods going away. This is one group of people for whom we have not

04:17.640 --> 04:21.400
solved video for everybody forever. Another one would be, of course, Twitch streamers in South

04:21.400 --> 04:27.480
Korea, where Twitch has said, nah, it's too expensive to operate networks there, some sort of

04:27.480 --> 04:36.120
contract dispute between local Korean ISPs and Amazon. You just can't stream on Twitch in South

04:36.120 --> 04:40.600
Korea anymore, or you've got to go around in VPNs and that sort of thing, which is probably fine

04:40.600 --> 04:45.040
for the people in this room, but not fine for most people that are wanting to actually go about

04:46.000 --> 04:55.800
having a live streaming platform. YouTube, same deal. If you get three copyright strikes in 90 days

04:55.800 --> 05:01.120
per the contracts they've signed with the big record labels, yeah, just gone, gone forever.

05:01.120 --> 05:07.920
Here's another one. This came up in my research for this just recently. I used to do a little bit

05:07.920 --> 05:12.920
of Twitter live streaming, because it was a fun way to show, especially like the coding I was doing.

05:13.120 --> 05:19.160
I've got a local archive of all my stuff, because I'm a video engineer, and that's how I operate.

05:19.160 --> 05:26.760
Most people wouldn't, and so this is Twitter saving a little bit of money, post deal on acquisition,

05:26.760 --> 05:33.920
and then, of course, Tumblr's ban, which was on adult content, but there's sort of algorithms,

05:33.920 --> 05:39.000
just sort of ended up nuking a lot of people's old Tumblr libraries, things they had spent years

05:39.080 --> 05:48.160
cultivating and building, and that's just all gone now. I would contend that video has not been

05:48.160 --> 05:56.280
solved for everybody forever for these people. Oh, yeah, here's a fun one. Yeah, so a lot of people,

05:56.280 --> 06:00.560
if you build up a PlayStation and you buy an episode of Mythbusters, because you like Mythbusters,

06:00.560 --> 06:06.120
then you have Mythbusters and you want to watch that. Yeah, it's just gone now. You don't get to

06:06.160 --> 06:11.480
watch it anymore. Why? Some agreement between Sony and Discovery that happened in some boardroom

06:11.480 --> 06:20.880
somewhere that will never be privy to, and that's just gone. The concept of buying a piece of digital

06:20.880 --> 06:28.480
content apparently is just not something that really exists. Here's one in the news recently.

06:29.480 --> 06:37.480
Deepfakes, Taylor Swift was briefly blocked from being searched for on Twitter X, which is kind of

06:37.480 --> 06:43.600
funny because there is a ton of explicit Deepfakes being made of her and they didn't have any way to

06:43.600 --> 06:50.280
get that under control other than to block her from search entirely. This is an emergent problem.

06:50.280 --> 06:54.560
This has actually gotten worse. Some of this other stuff is long-standing problems, but this,

06:54.800 --> 07:00.080
technology continues to develop. This is an emerging problem that's making video less solved for

07:00.080 --> 07:09.480
people, so that's not very encouraging. This next one is just a little pet peeve of mine, but have

07:09.480 --> 07:17.240
you ever had a video on your phone and you want to put it up on a TV? Yeah, that's like impossible.

07:17.240 --> 07:23.160
You can get a Chromecast. The best ways to do that are Chromecast, which is of course,

07:23.520 --> 07:28.800
you can have this proprietary Google framework built into every app on iOS and Android in order to

07:28.800 --> 07:34.280
make that happen, which is not super impressive. Some very heroic efforts to reverse engineer that,

07:34.280 --> 07:38.560
but I don't think it's quite to the point where it would work in all cases. Or if you have an

07:38.560 --> 07:46.560
iPhone, you can pay Apple 130 bucks for an Apple TV. This is to get, think of the cumulative

07:46.560 --> 07:53.280
video knowledge in this room. That TV knows how to play an H.264 video, I guarantee it. It shouldn't

07:53.280 --> 08:03.680
be a problem, but to this very day it is. Curious if anybody, this is maybe my personal pet peeve,

08:03.680 --> 08:09.640
but I've worked in video adjacent startups for a little bit. I'm going to take it out on B2B

08:09.640 --> 08:15.720
SAS a little bit. This is the fate of every video startup if you don't actively combat against it.

08:16.200 --> 08:21.280
You might start with high ideals and all the stuff you want to open source and make a really

08:21.280 --> 08:29.040
accessible product to everybody, but then the big client comes along and they've got specific

08:29.040 --> 08:35.000
requirements, specific demands, and your company basically just turns into doing whatever they

08:35.000 --> 08:40.040
want. I've been around in the video industry for a little bit. This is very common pattern that's

08:40.040 --> 08:45.080
happened with friends of mine, and I think it's sunk a lot of other really promising products.

08:45.800 --> 08:52.120
More on that at live here in a little bit. That's the depressing part of the talk. Let's talk about

08:52.120 --> 08:58.040
some successes. There have also been some things that have gone really, really well. One thing that

08:58.040 --> 09:03.160
really took off during the pandemic is like masses and Plex servers. I don't know if anybody has got

09:03.160 --> 09:10.040
like a Plex login or a Synology login for a friend's mass or that sort of thing. My group of friends

09:10.040 --> 09:15.560
got really into this in the pandemic where anybody could access this. Shout out to my mom who I

09:15.560 --> 09:21.240
think has ripped more DVDs than anybody in America. I bought her a NAS for Christmas a few years back

09:21.240 --> 09:28.120
and she's, they just talked her and my stepdad through doing a raid on the NAS in order to get

09:28.120 --> 09:35.720
more storage on there. That was maybe the best Christmas present I've ever given. Yeah, this has

09:35.720 --> 09:42.120
been, these don't go away. Like Mythbusters on Discovery does when you buy it on PlayStation.

09:42.760 --> 09:49.480
Take a DVD, you put it on this and this keeps working. Little self-explanatory.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.280
This works. This has worked since it came out. BitTorrent is arguably the most

09:56.280 --> 10:01.880
successful decentralized project of all time. It works consistently. You can get everything on it

10:01.880 --> 10:09.160
and your content doesn't get yanked when somebody else, when there's some weird contract negotiation

10:09.240 --> 10:15.400
that happens. This is a popular one, maybe an unpopular one, but I did some work with video

10:15.400 --> 10:23.080
NFTs at Live Pier and these still work. On OpenSea, the video is all backed up on Filecoin there.

10:23.080 --> 10:28.920
You can play it on this and there's actually entire like crypto platforms that this, your

10:28.920 --> 10:34.200
creator library, you can upload this and it's an NFT collection associated with your crypto address.

10:34.280 --> 10:39.800
They could decide not to mirror that content for you, but in terms of like having your own content

10:39.800 --> 10:44.600
library compared with the YouTube and Twitch and Tumblr cases where they're like the company

10:44.600 --> 10:50.840
could just yank it from you. Yeah, no, this, you have to have some faith in the blockchain

10:50.840 --> 10:56.120
that you're running on of course, but other than that your library is your own.

10:57.720 --> 11:02.280
So those are some good ones. There's also some emergent projects I want to talk about

11:03.240 --> 11:05.880
that I think are going to help us sell video for everybody forever.

11:08.280 --> 11:12.280
The first is that decentralized social is going to become a thing. I put some of my favorite ones

11:12.280 --> 11:19.240
up here. I am a big fan of Blue Sky and the At Protocol. I worked with Scuttle, actually got

11:19.240 --> 11:25.000
my sort of my start in decentralized tech pre-crypto working with Scuttlebutt from Dominic Tar,

11:25.000 --> 11:30.680
who you saw earlier there. Some stuff on the farcastered lens in the Ethereum ecosystem.

11:30.760 --> 11:37.720
Activity pub and mastodon. I sort of give half credit. I have a lot of love for people in those

11:37.720 --> 11:42.520
ecosystems. I think there's a lot of incredible work happening. I think they, a lot of them,

11:42.520 --> 11:47.960
would acknowledge that the weakness there is the sort of the lack of a portable user

11:48.760 --> 11:56.280
that could move between servers like a concept of like a user with a key that can sign data

11:56.280 --> 12:03.640
and own that with what they're working for, which allows them to own their own media library

12:03.640 --> 12:09.480
and not be nuked when a corporation signs some deal or whatever. It's consistent with what I

12:09.480 --> 12:13.080
call the fundamental principle of decentralization, which is that user actions are sovereign.

12:14.120 --> 12:21.960
If I upload a video, I should have access to that no matter what else happens. They could decide to

12:21.960 --> 12:27.320
take my videos down from their servers, but in terms of like the definition of my content library,

12:27.320 --> 12:32.440
what videos are associated with me. That shouldn't be something that anybody can take away from me.

12:35.960 --> 12:40.360
Yeah, some of you may be familiar with this. There's a group called the Coalition for Content

12:40.360 --> 12:45.400
Providence and Authenticity. It's a bunch of companies now. It's started by Adobe and the BBC.

12:46.200 --> 12:50.920
This does a couple things. This was a little bit, these companies getting ready for a world full

12:51.000 --> 12:58.600
of deep fakes where to combat in a world where these models proliferate and anybody could

12:58.600 --> 13:02.520
generate any video that says, whatever, how do you ever trust the video you're looking at?

13:03.800 --> 13:07.720
And the answer here is actually pretty similar to the blockchain answer, which is you do so

13:07.720 --> 13:14.360
with signing chains. So you've got a C2P enabled camera, which has a little encoding chip on there.

13:14.920 --> 13:20.920
It's got a private key associated with that. That signs the video as soon as it's created.

13:20.920 --> 13:26.520
That goes to some editing software that makes some transformations to that and signs that it did so.

13:27.480 --> 13:33.000
And then by the time you get to a user on the web, they could theoretically click in the corner and

13:33.000 --> 13:38.520
say, okay, here, this video is created at this time and edited by this person. And it's not perfect,

13:38.520 --> 13:45.000
but especially with the provenance chain back to the original camera, you can have more confidence

13:45.000 --> 13:49.560
that you're looking at the right thing. This isn't in wide adoption yet, but I'm very excited about

13:49.560 --> 13:53.880
it. And I think it has an answer to some of the things I'm talking about here.

13:56.360 --> 14:02.120
So yeah, the goal in my mind for that to leverage this in the social case would be like,

14:02.120 --> 14:06.680
I could livestream on Blue Sky, transcode that video on the LivePeer Network,

14:06.680 --> 14:11.240
more on that in a second, and then somebody else could post a clip to their mastodon.

14:11.960 --> 14:16.120
And you could look at that clip and be like, oh, I'm looking at a clip from Eli's livestream,

14:16.120 --> 14:22.440
right, through the magic of signing and deterministic transformations and that sort of thing.

14:24.120 --> 14:29.080
Yeah, this is a really crude example that we came up with for how that could look,

14:29.720 --> 14:34.200
like a little button you can press in the corner of the video to get information on that.

14:37.160 --> 14:44.600
Yeah, so let's talk about, so that's me talking about some problems and solutions in

14:45.160 --> 14:50.920
video as a whole. Let's talk about what LivePeer has contributed to this. I'm going to give a

14:50.920 --> 14:56.360
really fast overview of what LivePeer is and the LivePeer Network. LivePeer's mission is to build

14:56.360 --> 15:01.880
the worlds open video infrastructure. We started out doing that with the decentralized network

15:01.880 --> 15:06.920
of video transcoders. Most people in this room has probably run into the concept that video

15:06.920 --> 15:11.880
transcoating is very expensive. Doing this kind of processing can cost as much as like a dollar

15:11.880 --> 15:21.800
per hour video on different cloud services. The LivePeer Network instead has this group of

15:22.920 --> 15:29.240
decentralized orchestrators, basically people running in video cards in lots of sort of

15:29.240 --> 15:34.680
unconventional spaces, not in data centers as people might be accustomed to.

15:37.960 --> 15:43.560
Because of that, we can offer sort of this radical low-cost transcoating solution

15:45.000 --> 15:53.400
that's much cheaper than existing approaches to this. But we got caught in some of our own traps

15:53.480 --> 16:02.440
here. We had the decentralized network. It worked really well, but as we stepped into the video

16:02.440 --> 16:06.840
industry, people didn't want to hear about loading up an Ethereum wallet with funds and

16:06.840 --> 16:10.120
transcoating on the network and that sort of thing. They're like, hey, can I log in with an

16:10.120 --> 16:16.920
email and password? We're like, so just sort of because it's what you do, we ended up building

16:16.920 --> 16:22.920
a SaaS product, which I'm really proud of. We did a lot of really good work. Shout out to the

16:22.920 --> 16:27.880
MIS server team who MIS server makes sort of the core streaming engine for the live streaming parts

16:27.880 --> 16:37.320
of this. But it got to the point where engineers at LivePeer couldn't even boot this up on their

16:37.320 --> 16:43.320
own laptops. This was just so chaotic, so many different microservices. It's a globally distributed

16:43.320 --> 16:47.960
team, so it tended to be like one person had their own service that only they knew how to operate

16:48.040 --> 16:54.360
and that kind of thing. My work for the last six months in particular started out as something

16:54.360 --> 16:59.240
called LivePeer in a Box, where we take all of this and we put it all in a single Docker image

16:59.880 --> 17:05.400
with a single point of configuration management and that product became what we now call LivePeer

17:05.400 --> 17:13.000
Catalyst. There's the LivePeer Studio hosted product. We've been using the phrase get lab model

17:13.000 --> 17:18.520
a lot. There's LivePeer Studio hosted product and there's LivePeer Catalyst, which is the

17:18.520 --> 17:26.840
self-hostable version that anybody can run on a laptop. I'm just going to give a really quick

17:26.840 --> 17:38.040
demo of this. Let's see if it'll cooperate. There we are. There's instructions for this on

17:38.040 --> 17:43.800
doc.livepeer.org. I intended to have this running when I started, but ended up having to restart

17:43.800 --> 17:57.560
this laptop here. Good, good. We should get a ridiculous amount of spam here. Shout out to

17:57.560 --> 18:02.360
MistController booting everything up here. Okay, okay. As I mentioned, lots of different services

18:02.440 --> 18:10.120
that are all crash looping until everything is set up and running here. We'll go over to...

18:14.120 --> 18:22.120
This is local host. I just have it as my URL here for the purposes of putting a TLS cert in there.

18:24.920 --> 18:32.040
This is a full self-hostable version of LivePeer Studio. I can step into a stream and hopefully

18:32.040 --> 18:39.160
this will work. I can go live right from here. Nice. We support WebRTC, ingest, RTMP, SRT,

18:39.160 --> 18:45.480
and then RISC as soon as the Mist server project that was mentioned ships. We'll have that.

18:46.840 --> 18:54.280
I'll stop the broadcast here. It's got scalable live streaming that can be fan out to as many

18:54.280 --> 18:59.560
nodes as you want. We've scaled up to... We tested most recently with 200,000 concurrent viewers

19:00.120 --> 19:08.600
all over the world. We've got assets. There's one I recorded when I was testing this. This is my

19:08.600 --> 19:13.880
live stream when I was sitting there finishing my slides. This is an asset associated with that.

19:15.160 --> 19:19.560
We've got lots of different features here, multi-streaming, so you can push out to Twitch and

19:19.560 --> 19:31.000
YouTube, stuff like web hooks and signing keys. Going for this freely distributable,

19:31.000 --> 19:38.840
full-featured server here. I want to leave some time for questions, so I'm going to jump back over here.

19:42.840 --> 19:47.800
Concluding thought, what do you take when you put all these things together? We've got the rise

19:47.800 --> 19:52.200
of decentralized social. We've got stuff like the C2PA, which is going to provide content

19:52.200 --> 19:57.800
provenance about video, so we know it came from. We've got this freely distributable

19:59.640 --> 20:05.080
MIT licensed server with all these different capabilities. What do you get when you put

20:05.080 --> 20:12.840
all those things together? The answer is I don't know yet. This is all emerging very quickly.

20:13.640 --> 20:20.600
I can see the future a little bit. I can see a world where some of these decentralized social

20:20.600 --> 20:25.160
projects start to take off, and of course any social thing is going to have live streaming

20:25.160 --> 20:30.840
eventually. In order to make all of that work, it cannot just be assertions by a particular server.

20:30.840 --> 20:38.120
We want to have signing mechanisms and that sort of thing. I'm looking forward to that world.

20:38.120 --> 20:41.880
I'm looking forward to building it. If any of you are interested, you can join the conspiracy here.

20:43.160 --> 20:48.440
That's the Live Peer Catalyst community page on the QR code on the right there, if anybody wants to.

20:48.440 --> 20:59.400
We're hosting a party this evening at Market Bar at 7 p.m. Feel free to stop by that,

20:59.400 --> 21:01.800
and we'll talk about solving video for everybody forever.

21:02.680 --> 21:13.400
I've got a couple minutes for questions, if anybody.

21:22.440 --> 21:25.160
Other than that, I can just give you some time to scan some QR codes.

21:32.280 --> 21:37.000
How can people contribute?

21:37.000 --> 21:43.720
How can people contribute was the question. There's a landing page over there talking about how to

21:43.720 --> 21:51.560
get started. Actually, if you go to docs.livepeer.org here, there's a whole catalyst section now,

21:52.520 --> 22:03.720
talking about both how to boot up your own catalyst node locally and how to develop on it.

22:03.720 --> 22:07.080
If you want to make changes to things internally, if you want to change some of the internal

22:07.080 --> 22:13.800
microservices, that sort of thing. Yeah, we also have, I didn't do it yesterday because I was here,

22:13.800 --> 22:18.920
but every other week we have the Catalyst Hackers Group on the Live Peer Discord.

22:19.880 --> 22:25.960
So, discord.gg.invite.livepeer, or you can just google it and figure out how to get there.

22:27.560 --> 22:32.440
That's all the people that are helping us build this sort of thing, coordinate there.

22:39.000 --> 22:46.120
Cool. Thanks, everybody.
