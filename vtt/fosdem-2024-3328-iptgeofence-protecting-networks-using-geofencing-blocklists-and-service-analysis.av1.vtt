00:00.000 --> 00:12.440
Today I'm going to talk about an open source project designed for protecting the network.

00:12.440 --> 00:17.600
In particular using some concepts such as geofencing, block list and analysis of service

00:17.600 --> 00:18.600
networks.

00:18.600 --> 00:23.480
I will tell you a little bit the idea behind this project.

00:23.480 --> 00:28.880
So in a sense this work started mainly when the war in Ukraine started and we have seen

00:28.880 --> 00:34.480
a really spiking in attacks towards servers.

00:34.480 --> 00:39.760
And so we wanted to do something that was easier to maintain than what we had in the

00:39.760 --> 00:40.760
past.

00:40.760 --> 00:41.960
So we said let's do something.

00:41.960 --> 00:48.560
And this is a work that we have started to develop with some students at the university.

00:48.560 --> 00:54.000
And we said to ourselves we need to handle a little bit IP firewalling a little bit better

00:54.000 --> 00:57.920
because you know a firewall is great if it is static.

00:57.920 --> 01:01.360
So in the sense that you put some rules inside the firewall and they stay in the firewall

01:01.360 --> 01:02.360
for a while.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.200
It's not continuous, add or remove, add or remove.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.920
This is not a nice thing.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.560
And a typical example is geofencing.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.800
Geofencing is the ability to block traffic from specific countries.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.040
We know that it is not a solution.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.960
Definitely it is not a solution.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.360
But for specific protocols it makes sense.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.360
Let's make an example.

01:19.360 --> 01:25.120
Suppose that you have a VPN server that it is used by your company to simply to connect

01:25.120 --> 01:27.200
you to your corporate site.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.760
So what do you want to leave it open for everybody?

01:30.760 --> 01:34.920
You can claim that today you are in Belgium maybe tomorrow or after tomorrow you will

01:34.920 --> 01:36.640
be back to your home country.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.080
So probably it is not a good idea.

01:38.080 --> 01:42.040
But in general some sort of geofencing is necessary.

01:42.040 --> 01:48.640
If you manage a service on the internet you will see that most of the logs inside your

01:48.640 --> 01:54.440
Pashi.log or Postgres or whatever are generated by people that are not really interested in

01:54.440 --> 01:57.880
what you do but are interested in breaking you or trying to find a way to break your

01:57.880 --> 02:00.440
system to go somewhere else.

02:00.440 --> 02:04.160
So it makes sense for us at least to circumvent.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.280
When I say geofencing it doesn't mean a specific country.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.160
It doesn't mean Belgium for instance.

02:08.160 --> 02:12.920
We must say Europe for sure, not South America.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.240
And another problem is encryption.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.280
Encryptions is a very nice thing to have.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.720
We are not going to remove it.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.200
It should be present everywhere.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.080
But the problem is that if you look at this problem from the network and we are in the

02:25.080 --> 02:29.320
network in that room you would see that encryption creates a problem.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.800
Not just the analysis of the traffic per se.

02:32.800 --> 02:38.240
So when you say the initial handshake, the way people are contacting you, if the fingerprint

02:38.240 --> 02:43.560
of this guy is a good fingerprint or is not a fingerprint used by a previous attacker.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.480
These things are very nice to have but they are not enough because you don't know after

02:47.480 --> 02:50.680
the handshake what is this guy asking you to do.

02:50.680 --> 02:52.440
So this is another problem.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.720
So this has been the motivation.

02:53.720 --> 02:58.520
So the idea was to create a single open source tool because you can use many tools to do

02:58.520 --> 02:59.520
that.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.520
Okay, ready.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.520
Very simple.

03:01.520 --> 03:02.520
I will show that in this presentation.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.520
But the problem is that you have one.

03:03.520 --> 03:05.720
So to have something simplified in one place.

03:05.720 --> 03:10.600
And also to do this for the next thing that we show in a second.

03:10.600 --> 03:11.920
So geofencing.

03:11.920 --> 03:17.040
So this is a typical example of how you can block a country on Linux.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.080
So this is a simple script.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.080
You have a country.

03:20.080 --> 03:21.240
You have a country where you want to ban.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.880
So you download from a certain place.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.880
This is a typical example.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.800
The list of networks that belong to such countries.

03:28.800 --> 03:35.160
You have to make sure that this is updated because you have to do it from time to time.

03:35.160 --> 03:39.280
Because countries in particular, sometimes there is a network that is sold or acquired

03:39.280 --> 03:41.840
by the companies belonging to a country or another.

03:41.840 --> 03:47.480
And you have in essence to download that didn't occur, but I hope that it is not upset with

03:47.480 --> 03:48.480
me.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.840
download the file and then put it into the file.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.680
And this is the way it works.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.120
And every day, you have to do it every week.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.080
General from time to time, you have to do that.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.680
And if you have several countries,

04:01.680 --> 04:03.960
it's a country, one, BCN, whatever,

04:03.960 --> 04:08.960
so you lose here track of what this is in this country.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.200
So you have to remove everything and start over.

04:13.240 --> 04:14.920
So this was how I understand that

04:14.920 --> 04:17.080
configuring this is complicated.

04:17.080 --> 04:19.560
Even though solutions exist.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.480
Again, geofencing is not the way

04:21.480 --> 04:22.920
to solve cybersecurity problems,

04:22.920 --> 04:25.760
but it's a nice way to mitigate them, for sure,

04:25.760 --> 04:27.800
at least for specific protocol.

04:27.800 --> 04:32.800
So this was one of the motivations.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.720
The second thing I told you before is so-called block list.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.840
Block list means I want to block specific people

04:38.840 --> 04:40.440
based on something, okay?

04:40.440 --> 04:42.200
It's usually based on black list.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.160
So a set of IP addresses that, as I said,

04:45.160 --> 04:48.120
have been pre-labeled, or if you want to use

04:48.120 --> 04:51.120
the machine learning word that today is very popular,

04:51.120 --> 04:53.040
or if you want to say, there are some people

04:53.040 --> 04:55.760
that for some reasons have put in some list,

04:55.760 --> 04:58.800
some security guys, that have done something nasty

04:58.800 --> 05:02.560
to other people in a few days before or the previous week.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.280
Usually these are created by putting

05:05.280 --> 05:07.400
honeypots on the internet.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.080
And when you see the violations that people

05:09.080 --> 05:11.640
are trying to break to those honeypots,

05:11.640 --> 05:15.440
you will see that these guys are labeled as bad guys.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.200
The nice thing is that there are several

05:18.200 --> 05:20.000
black lists available on the internet,

05:21.080 --> 05:23.720
but this is not good news all the time.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.280
Unfortunately, because some of those black lists

05:27.280 --> 05:29.160
are run by volunteers, okay?

05:29.160 --> 05:33.200
So some of them are good, some of them are not maintained.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.640
So in particular, if you imagine the free VPS services,

05:37.640 --> 05:40.480
so those that you can buy for five euro a month,

05:40.480 --> 05:42.640
they are constantly moving.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.800
So today this IP is bad, tomorrow it's not bad anymore,

05:45.800 --> 05:48.920
and the thing happens to the reverse.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.720
So the reputation is something that is dynamic.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.400
So you need to find black lists that make sense.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.640
So for instance, these days we are using the,

05:58.640 --> 06:00.000
one of the black lists that we are using,

06:00.000 --> 06:01.880
the Stratosphere IPS black list.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.240
That is a very good black list.

06:03.240 --> 06:04.920
But unfortunately, since some days,

06:04.920 --> 06:07.080
they are black listing for instance, Google,

06:07.080 --> 06:08.920
or they are black listing with GitHub,

06:08.920 --> 06:11.240
or they are black listing 888.0999,

06:11.240 --> 06:12.760
so they are the public DNS servers.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.960
But if you don't have some regional knowledge,

06:14.960 --> 06:17.480
so something on the place where you live,

06:17.480 --> 06:18.560
that doesn't mean the town,

06:18.560 --> 06:21.400
but it means the network operators, or your neighbors.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.360
So let's put it another term.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.600
If you take a black list that is coming from the US,

06:25.600 --> 06:27.960
it will be 70% effective to you,

06:27.960 --> 06:31.960
but it will not protect you for the rest of the problem.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.360
So we need something that are created here.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.000
Also some of the black lists, please read the paper,

06:37.000 --> 06:39.320
use very large CIDR.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.680
And I don't believe that everybody is bad.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.480
Maybe in this room there is somebody that is bad,

06:43.480 --> 06:45.960
but I don't think that 99% of the people are bad.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.840
So it put a slash, whatever, slash two or three,

06:48.840 --> 06:51.580
this room and everybody's bad.

06:51.580 --> 06:53.840
So this to say that they're good,

06:53.840 --> 06:55.760
if you use high quality black list.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.560
But if you want to take something on the internet

06:57.560 --> 07:00.920
and put it, the longer is the better,

07:00.920 --> 07:02.600
so this is the wrong way of doing it.

07:03.600 --> 07:07.360
Also we have the problem of attacking on services.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.960
The problem of the service is that most of the time,

07:10.960 --> 07:14.160
it is encrypted.

07:14.160 --> 07:18.440
If it is not encrypted, very often it is becoming encrypted.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.220
And this again, it's good news.

07:20.220 --> 07:24.100
So the black list is a way to prevent nasty people

07:24.100 --> 07:28.120
from contacting you, but then the rest of the group,

07:28.120 --> 07:29.680
that should be the majority,

07:29.680 --> 07:32.460
can still create problems to you.

07:32.460 --> 07:34.020
This is what I wanted to say.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.820
So the black list are not the solution.

07:35.820 --> 07:37.260
They are nice to have.

07:37.260 --> 07:40.220
They are nice to have a solution to put in place,

07:40.220 --> 07:41.860
but they are not enough.

07:41.860 --> 07:44.700
So if you look at log servers,

07:44.700 --> 07:47.260
this is an example from the log server I did

07:47.260 --> 07:49.500
when I did this live two days ago,

07:49.500 --> 07:51.620
it's one of them, it's full of them.

07:51.620 --> 07:53.740
Most of the logs are like this.

07:53.740 --> 07:57.020
So you would see good people contacting you,

07:57.020 --> 07:58.900
but most of the logs are attempts like this.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.420
So authentication, authentication,

08:00.420 --> 08:02.220
authentication error, too many attempts.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.620
This is the email and this is the web.

08:04.620 --> 08:07.100
So if you look at the WordPress, it will be even worse.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.300
I tried to break, you see,

08:08.300 --> 08:11.860
they tried to put a single config file for everything.

08:11.860 --> 08:13.740
Okay, you put everything in one place.

08:13.740 --> 08:16.140
And because it's designed for security,

08:16.140 --> 08:18.740
we have also put some security features, okay?

08:18.740 --> 08:21.260
That spans from the network side,

08:21.260 --> 08:22.260
but also to the service side.

08:22.260 --> 08:24.540
So we have something we call watcher.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.740
So tools that are watching log files

08:26.740 --> 08:28.500
and searching for anomalies.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.100
It can block and block people, very good.

08:31.100 --> 08:34.420
And they call so refresh a blacklist automatically.

08:34.420 --> 08:36.780
So you don't have to create complicated scripts

08:36.780 --> 08:40.460
that sometimes they break and put several countries into it.

08:40.460 --> 08:43.500
And the result can be shared first of all through Telegram.

08:43.500 --> 08:47.820
So we receive messages from wherever there is something wrong.

08:47.820 --> 08:50.100
You can execute actions, okay?

08:50.100 --> 08:51.700
Or you can send them through Xerion Q

08:51.700 --> 08:54.260
and we are adding additional brokers,

08:54.260 --> 08:56.260
so for example QTT to distribute them.

08:56.260 --> 08:59.260
So to have them into a single location.

09:00.180 --> 09:02.820
And the config file, it is very simple.

09:02.820 --> 09:05.260
So you specify first of all the market.

09:05.260 --> 09:08.140
I think links mean drop or pass, okay?

09:08.140 --> 09:10.460
You can hear them, but it can also mean slow down.

09:10.460 --> 09:15.260
So you can mitigate certain traffic based on that.

09:15.260 --> 09:17.780
You can specify the policy.

09:17.780 --> 09:20.020
For the policy, you can specify what you want to do.

09:20.020 --> 09:22.700
So in this case, if the policies drop,

09:22.700 --> 09:24.860
allow these countries, okay?

09:24.860 --> 09:28.180
Or this continent, North America, okay?

09:28.180 --> 09:30.420
You can say everybody from this place can connect.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.860
If you, for instance, pass, it's the other way around.

09:32.860 --> 09:37.180
So block, allow everybody except those countries, okay?

09:37.180 --> 09:40.980
And you can specify what part you want to monitor,

09:40.980 --> 09:43.980
so what part you want to enforce your rules,

09:43.980 --> 09:46.140
and what part you don't want to look at all

09:46.140 --> 09:47.740
because they have to be open.

09:47.740 --> 09:48.940
So something to ignore.

09:48.940 --> 09:50.860
So for instance, this is 10TP.

09:50.860 --> 09:53.300
In addition to that, you can put some honeypot ports.

09:53.300 --> 09:56.180
So it means that if you want to say, okay,

09:57.180 --> 09:59.420
these are the list of my services, good.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.260
But if somebody connects to another port,

10:01.260 --> 10:03.900
that is not one of the ports, so why is it doing that?

10:03.900 --> 10:06.060
Is it a mistake, so it does it once?

10:06.060 --> 10:08.460
Or it is an attempt, it's a scanning,

10:08.460 --> 10:10.940
so we have seen before, so network discovery.

10:10.940 --> 10:13.580
So once we made the decision,

10:13.580 --> 10:16.060
we marked the traffic as good or bad,

10:16.060 --> 10:17.140
and the Linux does the rest.

10:17.140 --> 10:18.740
No more packets are sent to user space.

10:18.740 --> 10:21.060
So very little, you know, CPU usage,

10:21.060 --> 10:23.980
and everything is happening inside the,

10:24.020 --> 10:26.940
inside the kernel, in VST, it's a little bit different.

10:26.940 --> 10:30.100
And watch it suspend by the tool,

10:30.100 --> 10:33.500
so when you do this control, start, start and stop,

10:33.500 --> 10:35.620
everything is done by that, you do reload,

10:35.620 --> 10:37.620
that's the automatic.

10:37.620 --> 10:40.140
And automatically it refreshes the blacklist

10:40.140 --> 10:41.900
or blocklist every night for you,

10:41.900 --> 10:44.060
so you don't have to do anything.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.540
And this is a typical example.

10:45.540 --> 10:48.340
So look at the time, again, this is when I did my slides

10:48.340 --> 10:49.540
a couple of days ago.

10:49.540 --> 10:50.980
If you look at the time, you'll see,

10:50.980 --> 10:52.340
and these are just two servers.

10:52.340 --> 10:53.380
It's always like that.

10:53.380 --> 10:56.740
Most of the problems are created by some people

10:56.740 --> 10:59.700
that are spending their time to do things

10:59.700 --> 11:00.740
that they should not do.

11:00.740 --> 11:05.540
So our service, for instance, is in the Netherlands.

11:05.540 --> 11:09.420
So we see some time, very simple patterns

11:09.420 --> 11:12.900
that they are moving from one server to another to do that.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.580
So this is all, but what's next?

11:15.580 --> 11:16.660
So what is the idea?

11:16.660 --> 11:18.980
As I said, one of the motivation was not just to create

11:18.980 --> 11:21.660
a simple administrative tool so that in one place,

11:21.660 --> 11:23.060
everything happens.

11:23.060 --> 11:26.380
But we want to create something that it is used

11:26.380 --> 11:28.860
to secure services for everyone

11:28.860 --> 11:32.540
with one single config file, very simple, in JSON.

11:32.540 --> 11:34.980
But we would like to do something next.

11:34.980 --> 11:39.300
So what we are creating, we are creating a sort of cloud.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.060
So in essence, we would like those tools

11:41.060 --> 11:43.940
that are deployed to be put in a way

11:43.940 --> 11:45.780
so that they can speak each other.

11:45.780 --> 11:48.420
The cloud doesn't mean that you send everything to Amazon.

11:48.420 --> 11:50.140
Send your data to the party people

11:50.140 --> 11:52.140
that you don't know what type of use they will do,

11:52.140 --> 11:55.860
what that can pollute your data with probably some IPs

11:55.860 --> 11:57.820
that are wrong, maybe simply because they want

11:57.820 --> 11:59.260
to block other people.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.020
But the idea is that you can run your own server,

12:02.020 --> 12:03.300
especially if you are a service provider,

12:03.300 --> 12:04.940
so you have many services,

12:04.940 --> 12:07.380
or you can put this service also on a laptop,

12:07.380 --> 12:09.700
okay, on a Linux laptop that you can bring home.

12:09.700 --> 12:11.060
If you see something bad happen,

12:11.060 --> 12:13.020
you can report this to the central server.

12:13.020 --> 12:14.620
And this is what we want to do.
