WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.120
So how many people here are worried about, say, climate change?

00:10.120 --> 00:12.380
And yeah, a little bit of a concern.

00:12.380 --> 00:15.920
There's definitely issues, crazy weather, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.200
What does that have to do with open source and my talk?

00:18.200 --> 00:20.600
Well, let me tell you.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.520
We live in a finite world.

00:22.520 --> 00:28.680
And as much as we want to believe that the cloud is green, it's not.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.640
Everything that's digital is tied to an atom.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.160
So as I say here, if you don't measure it, it still matters.

00:35.160 --> 00:41.040
It still matters because we're looking at the environmental footprint of our digital lives,

00:41.040 --> 00:42.040
and it's significant.

00:42.040 --> 00:46.840
It's about the same size as the airline industry, and it's growing exponentially.

00:46.840 --> 00:53.880
So when we're thinking about our digital infrastructure, every piece, every bit is tied to an atom.

00:53.880 --> 00:59.680
So whether that's electricity and whether it's hardware, it all comes from somewhere.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.840
It all has an impact.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.240
Think about the lifecycle of our products.

01:04.240 --> 01:08.960
There's not just the process of these devices that we have around.

01:08.960 --> 01:14.320
It's also the question of the creation and disposal of them as well.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.280
There's a lot of systems that are interrelated, and they have a huge impact.

01:18.280 --> 01:22.160
So when you're developing code, or if you're doing open hardware, think about what is the

01:22.160 --> 01:23.640
ecosystem you're working in.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.520
It's so interrelated.

01:25.520 --> 01:29.760
Whether you're a JavaScript person who's working on the web, you're a PHP person who's building

01:29.760 --> 01:35.880
content management systems, whether you're a Python person that's involved in creating

01:35.880 --> 01:39.880
other data processing tools, all of these things that have communities rely on networks

01:39.880 --> 01:44.160
of other pieces of code and a lot of people to maintain and organize them.

01:44.160 --> 01:51.080
So think about that ecosystem of people and code that our projects work on.

01:51.360 --> 01:59.200
So so much of this is thinking about sustainability like a measure of quality.

01:59.200 --> 02:04.440
So how do we make sure that good code is both accessible, because I have to say that I'm

02:04.440 --> 02:09.280
an accessibility person, but also is sustainable, that we're trying to minimize the impact that

02:09.280 --> 02:10.840
we have on the planet.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.000
And that that is baked into the definition of quality.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.280
We're thinking about it early in the process.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.120
We're not waiting until the very end to evaluate it.

02:19.160 --> 02:24.240
We're trying to build it into our CI CD pipeline so that we're catching errors and we're looking

02:24.240 --> 02:31.840
to minimize our website or we're minimizing the impact of our code on a spring by spring

02:31.840 --> 02:33.840
basis.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.560
And you're having a livable planet is not a feature request.

02:37.560 --> 02:38.560
We need to have that.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.080
This is a bare minimum that we need for our society.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.720
We need to start working together around that.

02:44.720 --> 02:49.680
So there's so much to learn and so much that's happening in this space right now.

02:49.680 --> 02:53.440
20 years ago, this was not something that was generally thought of.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.520
People were like, well, just don't print out the web and don't print out your web pages

02:56.520 --> 02:57.880
and your emails and you'll be fine.

02:57.880 --> 03:01.320
It's like, no, that's not good enough.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.400
The information is changing very quickly.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.760
There's a lot to learn in the space.

03:05.760 --> 03:09.800
And I think it's really important to try and think about sort of learning that, but also

03:09.800 --> 03:11.400
finding ways to contribute.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.920
So where can you give back?

03:13.920 --> 03:15.480
Where are the experiences that you've had?

03:15.480 --> 03:21.000
How can you get involved in measuring your project's impact and moving ahead on that?

03:21.000 --> 03:26.360
How do we look up at leveling up our expectations, encouraging more people to discuss and to

03:26.360 --> 03:29.760
learn about this?

03:29.760 --> 03:32.320
So it's really important to have these talks.

03:32.320 --> 03:38.000
There's a whole section of talks here at FOSTAEM on energy as there was last year and

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
that's wonderful.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.720
If you're going to the State of Open Conference, last year they had a whole sustainability

03:43.720 --> 03:44.720
track as well.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.560
In making sure that there's some conversation about sustainability as part of your project

03:48.560 --> 03:50.160
is really important.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.160
Getting people engaged and doing something about sustainability is a good way to go

03:53.160 --> 03:57.640
off and keep optimistic about it and keep our attitudes that we can make a difference,

03:57.640 --> 03:58.640
we can make a change.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.280
This is something that is doable.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.520
So getting people involved.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.360
And this is a huge problem.

04:04.360 --> 04:09.440
But everything that we do in the end is going to be insignificant as an individual contribution.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.220
But as Gandhi said, it is important that we do it.

04:12.220 --> 04:17.500
We need to go off and find ways to contribute and to play our small part to move things

04:17.500 --> 04:18.500
ahead.

04:18.500 --> 04:22.820
There's lots of best practices and best standards out there.

04:22.820 --> 04:30.980
There's one from the Web Sustainability Guidelines that was just launched as a draft in September.

04:30.980 --> 04:33.700
There's so evaluation and development on that.

04:33.700 --> 04:39.180
That's the Sustee Web Group or the Web Sustainability Guidelines.

04:39.180 --> 04:42.140
There's also the Green Software Foundation that's done some really good work.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.700
I'm building infrastructure around that.

04:44.700 --> 04:49.820
The Green Web Foundation is another one that has infrastructure and information about that.

04:49.820 --> 04:54.460
Also the IETF and the IEEE I think also have sustainability projects as well.

04:54.460 --> 04:58.760
So there's lots of different ways no matter how you're involved in the tech world to look

04:58.760 --> 05:04.540
at best practices and sustainability that you can work with and extend.

05:04.540 --> 05:06.540
And that's all I have.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.540
Yeah, any thoughts?

05:07.540 --> 05:08.540
Okay, any questions?

05:08.540 --> 05:09.540
Does anyone here have a sustainability?

05:09.540 --> 05:10.540
Go ahead.

05:10.540 --> 05:21.540
Any kind of practical tips that make matters good?

05:21.540 --> 05:23.500
Look at how much processing there is.

05:23.500 --> 05:26.180
Sorry, any practical steps.

05:26.180 --> 05:30.940
One practical step is to sort of look for where there is time and transfer.

05:30.940 --> 05:37.260
So how do you try and minimize the efforts and try and make sure that you're counting

05:38.220 --> 05:39.780
the milliseconds used to process it?

05:39.780 --> 05:43.380
What are the process heavy things that your code is using?

05:43.380 --> 05:43.880
Yes?
