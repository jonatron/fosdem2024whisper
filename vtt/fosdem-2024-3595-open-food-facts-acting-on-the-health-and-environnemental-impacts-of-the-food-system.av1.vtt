WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.040
Welcome everybody. We're going to start the next session now. It's my pleasure to introduce

00:14.040 --> 00:19.160
Pierre Slamish who will be speaking on open food facts, acting on the health environment

00:19.160 --> 00:27.280
impact of the food system. Hello everyone. I just have a quick question. Have any of

00:27.280 --> 00:34.400
you in the room used NutriScore to choose food products by raise of hand? Okay. So you'll

00:34.400 --> 00:43.280
see that open food fact has played a little part in getting NutriScore out. So let's start

00:43.280 --> 00:47.520
and let's dive right in. There's a lot on the menu. So for those who don't know open

00:47.520 --> 00:52.960
food fact, I'll briefly introduce it. I'll have a section on what's new in the project

00:52.960 --> 00:59.960
this year, what's cooking for next year, and also we'll be able to do Q&A probably outdoors.

00:59.960 --> 01:08.840
So about open food fact, it's a project that we started 10 years ago. So it's an NGO and

01:08.840 --> 01:14.680
it tries to answer how do you choose the best product in the supermarket? A lot of information

01:14.680 --> 01:19.600
and it's not legible. I've never been able to understand the nutrition table. It's abstract

01:19.600 --> 01:28.040
out to me. So a long ingredient list as well. And yet food has a massive impact on public

01:28.040 --> 01:40.280
health. To give you an idea, obesity and overweight wipes 3% of our GDP due to the cost of treating

01:40.280 --> 01:46.760
obesity and overweight. And the same goes for the planet. One quarter of food emission

01:46.760 --> 01:54.680
is food. One quarter of carbon emission. So the idea of open food fact is to empower

01:54.680 --> 01:59.240
users and contributors who have an impact on their own health, on the environment, and

01:59.240 --> 02:07.640
on the health system at large. Our slogan, if you will, is don't panic but organize. So

02:07.640 --> 02:14.720
crowdsourcing is a way to do that mobile crowdsourcing. And if Wikipedia was able to build the largest

02:14.720 --> 02:20.440
on the planet, open street map, the largest map, why not build the largest database of

02:20.440 --> 02:26.360
food products on the planet? Two days, 10 years in, we have 3 million products from over

02:26.360 --> 02:33.680
160 countries. Main sources, crowdsourcing, so you and me using mobile. But also the food

02:33.680 --> 02:40.920
industry which has started to realize that transparency in the end wins. So the mobile

02:40.920 --> 02:44.880
app of open food fact allows you to choose products that are good for you and the planet.

02:44.880 --> 02:50.960
You scan barcodes, you get NutriScore and EcoScore. You also have a personal scan for those of

02:50.960 --> 02:57.640
you who have food allergies or want to go vegan. It will help you on the journey. It's

02:57.640 --> 03:04.400
of course privacy preserving. So it's privacy by design. We don't require any login. And

03:04.400 --> 03:09.920
if you don't have a NutriScore in your country yet, you can get it on any products in a couple

03:09.920 --> 03:16.160
of seconds. You answer a few questions in the app and you get the scores instantaneously.

03:16.160 --> 03:21.840
So you can take your health to the next level with NutriScore and which is about the nutritional

03:21.840 --> 03:27.040
quality and NOVA which is about food ultra processing. So avoid NOVA for products as

03:27.040 --> 03:34.200
much as you possibly can. We also do additives and labels. And we make it simple to understand

03:34.200 --> 03:43.120
all of that. With NutriScore, we started computing it in 2015 when it was a scientific paper.

03:43.120 --> 03:47.920
It was called the five color score. And now we compute it in every country including Mexico

03:47.920 --> 03:55.360
and the United States. Everyone can get it even if a producer don't want you to get it.

03:55.360 --> 04:00.680
So we recompute it. We create an ecosystem around it. And the nice thing is that as you

04:00.680 --> 04:06.120
all experienced, it's now in supermarkets in Europe. It's still not compulsory though.

04:06.120 --> 04:12.480
And producers are beginning to improve their products. And we also show EcoScore which

04:12.480 --> 04:18.320
is about the planet. So same principle. We use something called life cycle analysis which

04:18.320 --> 04:24.080
are very precise analysis of food products. So it's an average. And then on top of the

04:24.080 --> 04:33.160
average, we make the computation more precise to the products using specific data. With

04:33.160 --> 04:39.080
EcoScore, the great news is that France will have an EcoScore despite all the trouble you

04:39.080 --> 04:44.800
are seeing right now in France. It's in low. So that's the cool news. It's beginning to

04:44.800 --> 04:51.720
be experimented in Belgium, in Colbert. And it's also available in many European countries

04:51.760 --> 05:01.760
and the US. And so yeah, we are having a more global discussion around it. In terms of impact,

05:01.760 --> 05:10.080
OpenFoodFact has quite a lot. Because we are open data, over 250 projects, application

05:10.080 --> 05:20.840
services reuse the data to inform users from questions on pregnancy, allergies, etc. Even

05:20.920 --> 05:28.840
big corporations use it. In terms of impact, it's a simple circle. We collect data using our

05:28.840 --> 05:35.800
mobile phone. People are more and more reusing that data to do many things including scientific

05:35.800 --> 05:44.680
research. People get more educated, more mindful about what they eat. They start changing their

05:44.680 --> 05:50.280
behaviors, their purchase behavior. And the whole industry actually starts to follow. The

05:50.280 --> 05:56.840
producers are taking notice and they are changing their recipe as a result and everyone benefits.

05:56.840 --> 06:06.240
And the circle goes on and on. So from those kind of Photoshop or GIMP images that we did a couple

06:06.240 --> 06:15.080
of years ago, we went straight to this where the NutriScore is everywhere. So yeah, you go from

06:15.240 --> 06:22.840
Perl code to real life impact where basically all products, all newly introduced products start to

06:22.840 --> 06:29.200
change for the better. What you can also see across Europe is for instance the differences

06:29.200 --> 06:35.360
between In The Food Offer. We take photos across space and time for 10 years and we found out that

06:35.360 --> 06:42.680
the Fanta Recipes change across Europe. So for instance, Italy 12% fruit, Serbia 3% fruit,

06:43.480 --> 06:50.600
Portugal 8% fruit plus high fructose corn syrup and 0% fruit in the French island of

06:50.600 --> 06:59.240
RÃ©union. So that's the kind of thing you can do with data. We can also have a giant map of food

06:59.240 --> 07:05.640
factories in Europe. So that's may near me. And all the packaging code you see on food products,

07:06.280 --> 07:12.360
we actually collect and we can map them. You can do benchmark if you're liking to data,

07:12.440 --> 07:19.880
if you want to choose a perfect year old. No, you can. So it's highly customizable. In 20 seconds,

07:19.880 --> 07:27.560
you can do your own charts. We also have a platform for the food industry. So whoops, sorry. Yeah,

07:27.560 --> 07:33.160
for the food industry to help them actually reformulate, we say, okay, here's an opportunity to

07:33.160 --> 07:37.560
reduce a little bit sugar and then you will get a better NutriScore. So we compute all of that.

07:38.360 --> 07:42.520
And brands have started playing the game. Some of the brands you consume every day are actually

07:43.400 --> 07:48.600
doing open data and sending open data to open food fact. Even the big ones like Unilever,

07:48.600 --> 07:54.680
even Ferrero from Nutella are doing that. So they're starting to realize that consumer pressure

07:54.680 --> 08:02.680
is important. In terms of milestones, so as I said, we launched NutriScore in 2015. We launched

08:02.760 --> 08:09.960
EcoScore more recently and ultra processing in 2018. So the project is a bit over 10 year old.

08:12.040 --> 08:16.440
And this year, we cross the three million products threshold, which is a nice milestone.

08:18.200 --> 08:26.280
We are now at 3.1 million monthly visitors on the websites and the app and contributors together

08:26.280 --> 08:32.520
have made 28 million edits since 2018 and it's growing, it's still growing.

08:33.640 --> 08:40.280
The permanent team is growing. The community is much more engaged this year than it used to be.

08:41.560 --> 08:51.320
We were doing European meetups. We had our second open food fact days this fall. And we are also

08:52.200 --> 09:02.120
getting more people into coding. This year, we also scaled app marketing so that new users

09:02.120 --> 09:08.920
discover about open data, open source and open food fact to 40 languages. And we started getting

09:08.920 --> 09:16.280
into European events and trying to get a European committee off the ground and not just be a French

09:16.280 --> 09:24.280
project. In terms of manufacturers, we introduced a few new features as well. Manufacturers are

09:24.280 --> 09:32.600
getting on board. And even more important to us, as scientific use and reuse, we have 30 scientific

09:32.600 --> 09:41.960
paper in nutrition, in machine learning based in 2023. And we have increased the reuse a little bit

09:41.960 --> 09:49.400
as well. So what's cooking for 2024? It's going to be a big year. First and foremost, because

09:49.400 --> 09:55.800
the new score is going to change. The formula is going to become more strict. You know that there's

09:55.800 --> 10:02.360
Italy is trying to block it at the European level. And the scientists are overwhelmingly

10:02.360 --> 10:07.960
supporting new three score. Seven countries have adopted it. And now it's the question of whether

10:07.960 --> 10:13.960
it will become the European score. The new formula is going to be more stringent, like seven out of

10:13.960 --> 10:20.520
10 products are going to lose a grade. Most of them are going to lose a grade. And it will be a

10:20.520 --> 10:25.560
two-year transition in real life. But as soon as we start deploying it on open food fact, it will

10:25.560 --> 10:30.680
be on every, the new computation will be on all products directly in open food fact, even before

10:30.680 --> 10:37.800
producers do the transition. On mobile, it's going to be a big year. I'm going to go very fast

10:38.520 --> 10:44.600
because there are only four minutes left. So we did a lot of user interview this fall.

10:45.160 --> 10:53.080
And so we are going to make the app more pedagogical and to improve search. So here's a

10:53.080 --> 10:59.320
screenshot of all the ideas by the community. So we are going to improve the onboarding so that

10:59.320 --> 11:05.000
people better understand the scores. We are going to make the personalization engine more intuitive.

11:06.600 --> 11:13.640
We are going to make all the information more legible, guides even to go further for French

11:13.640 --> 11:21.480
people. We are going to try and tackle the mineral water scandal. And improving search. Also,

11:21.480 --> 11:26.920
thanks to the support of NGI, NGI search, we are going to have a live search in open food fact.

11:27.480 --> 11:36.040
And this year, we are going to go beyond food. So the thing is, we have had an impact on food.

11:37.080 --> 11:43.320
But there are many objects like, I know, this projector or this chair, which have a life cycle.

11:43.880 --> 11:50.600
And then at one point, the owner decides it's not worth keeping anymore. And as a result,

11:50.600 --> 11:56.040
we are surrounded by object, but some of us no longer serve us or please us. And they end up in

11:56.040 --> 12:02.600
the incinerator because we fail collectively to give them a second, a third life to repair them,

12:02.600 --> 12:09.720
to fix them. And so open product fact is all about that. Giving open data to power of circular

12:09.720 --> 12:15.960
economy. So today, this year, we are going to merge open food fact with open product facts,

12:15.960 --> 12:22.120
beauty facts and pet food facts so that you can scan anything on the planet and get solutions for it.

12:22.680 --> 12:30.360
And yes, people have asked us for that for years. We are getting into price collection this year.

12:31.880 --> 12:38.360
People, we started open food fact once, so what's in my food? But no, people want to know at what price.

12:39.000 --> 12:46.360
So we are starting open prices. Currently, it's only a web app. It's only five weeks old. So it's

12:46.440 --> 12:50.360
still a very experimental project. Even the logo is experimental.

12:53.080 --> 12:59.400
But basically adding a price takes 20 seconds. You scan the barcode, you put the price details,

12:59.400 --> 13:04.360
you put the location. It remembers the two or three locations you inputted previously.

13:04.920 --> 13:10.120
And then you start to realize weird stuff. Like for instance, price variation in the same city

13:10.120 --> 13:15.640
for the same products, for the same supermarket chain, and nobody is able to explain why.

13:16.840 --> 13:24.280
We are also thinking that we could kickstart a European price collection and build the first

13:24.280 --> 13:31.880
European Nutella price index. So we already have a few prices in Europe, but you'd be very welcome

13:31.880 --> 13:39.800
to add the prices nearby at your favorite shop. We are also, this is more experimental, but we

13:39.800 --> 13:46.360
also would like to help people free their data from receipts. So now at this point, you are

13:46.360 --> 13:53.880
asking how can I get involved in my country? So we have a broad European coverage that's already

13:53.880 --> 14:00.360
there, but there's still a lot of work to do. So how can you contribute? Scan and add new products.

14:00.360 --> 14:05.880
That's the most basic, but the most vital way to contribute to open food facts. Translations,

14:06.600 --> 14:14.360
word spreading, taxonomies and design. So a lot of knowledge about food required. And if you

14:14.360 --> 14:23.160
develop in any programming language, hacking and fixing is welcome. We have many programming

14:23.160 --> 14:28.040
language you can contribute. So the mobile app is in Flutter. We have some machine learning,

14:28.040 --> 14:33.720
robot off in Python. So we're even experimenting with LLMs and 60 seconds on the clock.

14:34.040 --> 14:42.600
Perl, Python, you name it. There's really something for you in there. So that's the QR

14:42.600 --> 14:47.560
code. If you want to become a volunteer, you can scan this QR code or go to openfac.work.com.

14:50.040 --> 14:57.880
Also, if you're a student or an adult, you have a Google Summer code we are going to apply. So if

14:57.880 --> 15:03.400
you want to become a mentor, a mentor or refer a mentor, feel free to do so. It's nice to have

15:03.480 --> 15:10.120
a large impact on food. We are independent from the food industry, by the way. We're not

15:10.120 --> 15:14.840
like a startup or anything. So we'd like to thank all the sponsors that are supporting

15:15.640 --> 15:21.640
some part of open food fact. So thank them for enabling infrastructure or everything.

15:22.200 --> 15:27.640
So I guess let's get in touch. Eight seconds on the clock. You have the contact email, my

15:27.640 --> 15:40.680
personal email, and you can install the app right here. Thank you.
