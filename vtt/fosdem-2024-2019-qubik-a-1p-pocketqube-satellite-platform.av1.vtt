WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.760
Okay. Our next talk will be from Ilyas and this is the first of a dual of talks that

00:12.760 --> 00:19.640
we'll have on a similar topic, so you are in for a treat on the future of space flight

00:19.640 --> 00:22.000
in open source. Thank you.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.680
Thank you Ilyas.

00:24.680 --> 00:33.720
So my name is Ilyas. I am a core contributor at the Libre Space Foundation and my job

00:33.720 --> 00:41.800
title is doing space stuff. So before we move on, let's get the audience up to speed.

00:41.800 --> 00:47.000
In the title, I think there are like two words that may be unfamiliar. So does anyone know

00:47.000 --> 00:55.360
what a pocket cube is? Okay. A pocket cube is a really small satellite. It's like five

00:55.360 --> 01:07.200
centimeters, a cube of five centimeters size. So it's this. It's really small. And the one

01:07.200 --> 01:16.120
P, the one P is the one unit for pocket cube. So this is one P. If you go to two P, you extend

01:17.120 --> 01:23.680
one time the size three P, you extend two times the size four P, it makes no sense. You just go to

01:23.680 --> 01:33.800
a bigger satellite. Do you know what a deployer is? Most of you. Okay. So rocket people do not like

01:33.800 --> 01:39.440
to put your satellite with duct tape on the rocket. So they want a fancy box to put everything in.

01:40.120 --> 01:47.360
That's a deployer. And the last term, do you know what Leo is? Leo is low earth orbit. Start from

01:47.360 --> 01:56.040
around 200, 300 kilometers and go up to like 1200. So this is the terminology. Let's start our story.

01:56.040 --> 02:09.400
So this is the story of cubic. So it was, I think, three years ago, summer time. And we got a phone

02:09.440 --> 02:15.920
call with, it was actually an email. And they told us, you know, we have a spot on the rocket in a

02:15.920 --> 02:23.920
deployer for one P satellite. And it's free. And this matters because the cost for launching one of

02:23.920 --> 02:32.280
these could be like 15,000 years, maybe more. So that's a great opportunity. And we said yes. And

02:32.320 --> 02:40.760
they said, okay, you have a few months to get it ready to go. Okay. So let's see what we have. We

02:40.760 --> 02:50.040
looked around on the space staff we have. And we have a comms board. That's important. Because

02:50.040 --> 02:54.560
like a basic satellite, you need something to communicate with. And you need someone, some

02:54.600 --> 03:06.840
source of power. And that's what we had. So it was quite capable. It can do all this modulation

03:06.840 --> 03:12.480
and stuff. I won't bore you with it. But it was a starting point. It needed a bit of tweaking.

03:12.480 --> 03:23.400
And that's it. So where are we going? They told us you're going to an orbit of 300 kilometers.

03:23.840 --> 03:31.680
That's nice. For the weight of these satellites, you expect to be up there for one to two weeks. Good

03:31.680 --> 03:44.880
enough. And it was the first flight of the rocket. Not good enough. So we came up with the plan. There

03:44.880 --> 03:50.800
was lots of hardware that had to be done. So we had to test the comms board we had. And then we

03:50.800 --> 03:56.920
needed a way to add power to it. And even it would be even nicer to be able to not just have a

03:56.920 --> 04:03.320
battery that will die and have some solar panels to get extra power. And then all these had to be

04:03.320 --> 04:12.320
somehow bind together to form a satellite. And then put all this on a plate that can go into the

04:12.320 --> 04:16.600
deployer because there are some kind of specifications that require you to have like a specific

04:16.720 --> 04:23.160
shape that goes in there. And then there were some testings where you put this in an oven and some

04:23.160 --> 04:30.280
materials that may evaporate. They do that in your oven and not on the lens of the satellite next to

04:30.280 --> 04:36.640
you that messes everything up. And then there is some campaigns where you torture your satellite and

04:36.640 --> 04:44.160
shake it and hit it. So you make sure that nothing will come loose during the launch. And then you

04:44.200 --> 04:51.720
just send it to the rocket people and you have pizza. On the software side there was some software

04:51.720 --> 05:01.320
that could do communications but it needed to be tested and evolve a bit. And then once we were

05:01.320 --> 05:06.920
happy with what we have we flashed the final firmware in the satellite and then we have pizza. And

05:07.560 --> 05:15.560
on the bureaucracy department we had to coordinate frequencies. So what's that? Let's say you have a

05:15.560 --> 05:23.160
radio and you decide that you duck deep push the button and then you put a tape recorder next to it

05:23.160 --> 05:30.400
and say I am Joe. I am Joe every second. And then you just pick a frequency. Let's say I just put my

05:30.400 --> 05:38.240
birthday in. And you just start transmitting. And then you get some kind of military band and local

05:38.240 --> 05:45.840
people around the country don't like it. Imagine that but the whole planet will not like it. So you

05:45.840 --> 05:51.320
need to get a frequency allocated to you. And then there are some managerial staff for exporting

05:51.320 --> 05:56.560
this and what is this and what is that. And customs people are not happy and then you have to make

05:56.560 --> 06:03.840
them happy with lots of paper work. They love paper work. And then have pizza. So all this is good. We

06:03.840 --> 06:20.760
can do it or we think we can do it. But why? So what should this satellite do? And we realize that

06:20.840 --> 06:28.720
there is some kind of a problem that we could try to address. So imagine this. When you, your

06:28.720 --> 06:35.360
satellite and many other satellites and for this size it could be like 50 or 100 go out in space. It's

06:35.360 --> 06:42.600
the equivalent of going on the top of a hill, have like a jar of marbles, just throw it down hills, go

06:42.640 --> 06:51.400
to the next city and try to pick one which is yours. So there are raiders for this thing and there are

06:51.400 --> 06:58.800
like military services that do track all this stuff. But during the first weeks it's like a blob of

06:58.800 --> 07:06.960
stuff. So in order to be able to communicate you need to think. You need to know which one is yours

07:07.080 --> 07:13.720
and you need to know where is it. So the first part is quite easy. Because you just wait for the

07:13.720 --> 07:22.440
lands, satellites go out and then you wait, you look up and at some point you say, you pick. Hey,

07:22.440 --> 07:31.440
it's me. Nice. Can you hear me? Hey, it's me. Okay, where are you? Hey, it's me. Can you tell me your

07:31.440 --> 07:44.760
position? Hey, it's me. And then no contact. Luckily the play me part, it's identifiable. Because you

07:44.760 --> 07:51.360
would have some kind of ID beacon, whatever that you design. So you know that's, that's yours. The other

07:51.360 --> 08:00.160
part not so easy. But we thought that if we exploit the Doppler effect, because these things go really

08:00.200 --> 08:06.200
fast and really fast is like seven to eight kilometers per second and to give you like a sense of how

08:06.200 --> 08:16.480
fast this is, I will go to the center of the city and come back. So I'm going and back that fast. So the

08:16.480 --> 08:23.240
Doppler shift that happens to the transmission from the satellite can help you start identifying the

08:23.240 --> 08:30.600
orbit. There are some, we call them orbital elements which define the orbit. I won't bore you with that. But

08:31.600 --> 08:43.320
there is a way that you can do that. So that's the experiment. So on the hardware, we started designing a

08:43.320 --> 08:55.600
power system. And so we got really popular solar harvesting chip that doesn't PPT that's the SPV 1040 with

08:55.600 --> 09:04.440
some solar panels. We also added the battery management chip. So it actually it's a battery goes so knows how

09:04.440 --> 09:15.320
many. Can't go in goes out. And you can get a good sense of what's going on your power system. Some minor

09:15.320 --> 09:26.200
modifications to the comms, the communication board. And then we we designed all the structure that will keep

09:26.200 --> 09:35.640
everything together. So again, the power budget. We wrote a tool to do that because commercial ones are not open

09:35.720 --> 09:44.840
and they're very expensive. So this is what this tool produces. You just enter how much solar panels you have. And

09:44.840 --> 09:50.720
then you get a really nice plot, which is for each side of the satellite, how much power you're getting. And this is

09:50.760 --> 09:59.000
awesome. But the thing is when your satellite is kicked out of the box, because it is kind of mounted on the bottom,

09:59.640 --> 10:02.120
just flips around. So the reality is something like that.

10:05.760 --> 10:09.280
So the structure, that's a structure. We designed this

10:11.920 --> 10:19.520
in the concept of having the PCBs that mount the solar panels and everything to be structural element. And this is an

10:19.520 --> 10:25.760
exploded view. And this is how the systems fit in there.

10:27.840 --> 10:38.480
There was a lot of room because we can have like four PCBs in there based based on the standard we tried to follow. But we

10:38.480 --> 10:45.200
only had like a power board and the comms board. So we had two batteries just to be on the safe side. And then just to

10:45.200 --> 10:50.880
add weight. So the more heavy you are, the longer you stay up there. And the more you pay to go over there.

10:52.320 --> 11:03.040
So there's a ballast board, which has some weight to like reach the top weight you can have on these things. The

11:03.040 --> 11:10.920
antenna on the bottom, it's a measuring tape. It's really good on unfolding itself back to shape, whatever you do to it.

11:11.320 --> 11:17.240
And there are actual numbers on that, as you can see. Actually, let me pass this around.

11:23.480 --> 11:29.560
So the antenna, we did some simulation for the antenna and the radiation pattern. On the right hand side, you can see how

11:29.560 --> 11:34.520
this thing is tied down to the satellite in the stored configuration.

11:34.600 --> 11:44.840
And then we get another goal. And they say, you know what? We have an extra slot for you and say, okay,

11:45.960 --> 11:54.680
instead of building one, we just build two. That's great. And then there's the thing with a deployer where you were going in.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.760
So can you build it for us?

11:57.480 --> 12:09.320
So we said yes for some reason and we came up with the revised plan. So the revised plan also includes the deployer. I

12:09.320 --> 12:19.320
won't go into that because that's the next talk. But this was the birth of PicoBus, the deployer we built. So you have to wait

12:19.880 --> 12:21.320
15 minutes to hear about this.

12:23.320 --> 12:31.720
Moving on. We had all the circuits and the PCBs ready. You need to add some kind of conformal coating to protect the stuff.

12:32.200 --> 12:39.800
So you spray this and then you inspect it with UV light and it glows and where it doesn't glow, you have to apply more.

12:40.840 --> 12:47.000
Quite simply. This is an almost finished structure. It's a photo from the, during the assembly.

12:47.000 --> 13:00.600
And these are the two assembled satellites ready to go. So in the ballast board where it's nothing, we thought we could go like,

13:01.640 --> 13:14.120
let's put some ideas in there instead. So this is a small board with like the four principles that we believe in regarding space and the openness in space.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.440
We moved on to the bakeout procedure. So that's like

13:22.520 --> 13:30.920
upside down jar that goes on the vacuum machine thingy and it goes to really, really big, low vacuum.

13:33.000 --> 13:38.120
And then there's like a flat light on the right that does infrared

13:38.840 --> 13:45.480
heating of everything there. And what you do is you measure the mass before you bake it.

13:46.440 --> 13:53.240
You measure the mass after and you have to be within some specs or something really important evaporated in there. So it's an ago.

13:55.080 --> 14:05.560
And the final step was to do the proto flat campaign. This is where you put everything in the deployer and then you just torture it.

14:06.520 --> 14:14.120
And it hope, you hope that when you open the deploy again, you don't get sand coming out.

14:16.680 --> 14:26.280
On the software side, we built some drivers for the hardware as a standalone project so it can be used for other things.

14:27.480 --> 14:34.680
We built the elementary and telecommand. There was a finite state machine for orchestrating of what the satellite should do.

14:35.320 --> 14:44.520
And then because there was a delay on the launch, the software people, we had like more time in our hands. So we decided, okay, let's add another project.

14:45.240 --> 14:54.680
So there was a new project called open space data link protocol. And it's a way to structure your data and telemetry that goes up and out to the satellite.

14:54.760 --> 15:03.240
And we also built some kind of ground station telecommand software to operate the whole thing.

15:04.040 --> 15:11.800
Another interesting aspect of the development was that while the hardware was ready and the software was written,

15:12.680 --> 15:20.680
we were using the actual ground station software that was going to be used during the mission, which was part of satnav.

15:20.920 --> 15:28.760
So during development, we had like a satnav dashboard that would give us the state of the satellite. So everything is good and nice because it's next to us.

15:30.680 --> 15:38.280
But the good thing is that this is ready. So when satellite goes up, you just reopen this and you have your data.

15:39.240 --> 15:47.480
So these are like the final steps, final firmware is going in. Everything goes into the deploy for the last time.

15:48.280 --> 15:54.280
And then you wait for the launch. The launch provider was firefly aerospace.

15:56.280 --> 16:02.280
Like the dream payload was like the mission we were invited to join.

16:03.080 --> 16:13.480
And a few months has passed and there's the moment that you actually wait to happen.

16:14.280 --> 16:23.080
And it's a very stressful moment because sometimes from firefly things can go to fireball.

16:25.480 --> 16:26.280
And that's what happened.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.480
As you can imagine, there were feelings.

16:32.280 --> 16:44.280
And the only thing you can do since you know that since the thing blew up, they will probably going to build another.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.480
So we build more cubics.

16:50.280 --> 17:00.280
And a few months later or almost a year later, here we go again, biting nails, hadging teddy bears.

17:02.280 --> 17:06.280
And then you get this picture.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.480
So that's our deployer in the other satellites.

17:18.280 --> 17:26.280
Firefly did a good job to interrupt the stream just before we were deployed and then do a playback but not say that it is a playback.

17:27.080 --> 17:31.080
So they said all payloads are deployed and you get a video with this thing closed.

17:33.080 --> 17:37.080
And they said, okay, what happened? But there's a switch there that says, you know, the door has opened.

17:37.080 --> 17:42.080
So hopefully things go good and they did.

17:43.080 --> 17:49.080
So we started receiving telemetry from the satellites.

17:49.080 --> 17:56.080
It's cubic three and four because one and two kind of disintegrated or something.

17:57.080 --> 18:05.080
There was a minor issue with the A2C bus on one of the satellites, but the reset solved this.

18:05.080 --> 18:11.080
It's not a really nice way to do that. It's kind of windows you like, but at least it worked.

18:12.080 --> 18:16.080
We attempted some telecommand and control.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.080
The command was received.

18:21.080 --> 18:24.080
We wasn't able to get the reply.

18:24.880 --> 18:27.880
And the telemetry was received by the satellite network.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.880
So these are like real space data here.

18:30.880 --> 18:33.880
The power system kind of overworked.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.880
So the battery was like continuously full, which is good.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.880
So what do we get out of this?

18:42.880 --> 18:45.880
The platform, the cubic platform was a success.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.880
It is considered now Terral 9.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.880
Terral 9 is like the view of the space and it works.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.680
So it's like the top level. There is no pen there.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.680
So that's good.

18:57.680 --> 19:01.680
Firefly did not reach the target orbit.

19:01.680 --> 19:08.680
So this affected the mission life because it was reduced to three to four days.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.680
We managed to do orbit determination.

19:14.480 --> 19:21.480
But since the orbit was decaying really fast, it was unusable.

19:21.480 --> 19:28.480
The information was there, but you could not verify it because the next orbit was totally messed up.

19:28.480 --> 19:33.480
And this gave life to four more projects.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.280
PicoBus.

19:36.280 --> 19:44.280
See, look, you should listen about that in 1630, which is exactly what the experiment is,

19:44.280 --> 19:48.280
but in a more commercial way.

19:48.280 --> 19:53.280
And we have the simulator and the space data protocol.

19:53.280 --> 19:59.280
So the platform is one P-Pocket Cube bus, the one that's going around.

20:00.080 --> 20:09.080
If you use one battery and you do not use a ballast, you have room for one or two payloads to put in there.

20:09.080 --> 20:14.080
You get 350 to 500 milliwatts of generation for your staff.

20:14.080 --> 20:17.080
There's battery monitor and management.

20:17.080 --> 20:20.080
We have a really good documentation.

20:20.080 --> 20:26.080
It's currently coming together from the various wiki pages and issues, but it's really detailed.

20:26.880 --> 20:32.880
And it's a cost-effective solution for research, education, radio amateur or whatever you can imagine.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.880
So what's the future?

20:36.880 --> 20:41.880
We need to move comps to like version one and call it that.

20:41.880 --> 20:48.880
Create a better power board, finalize a standard and then create a document about it.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.880
And go bigger and fly more cubics.

20:53.680 --> 20:57.680
This is all the software that we used. It's all open software.

20:57.680 --> 21:03.680
And these are the people that helped this thing to become reality.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.680
Thank you very much.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.680
So if there is time for questions.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.680
Yeah, yeah, I have minutes for questions.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.680
Five minutes for questions.

21:18.480 --> 21:27.480
How many ground stations and passages do you need to like estimate the orbital elements of the satellite?

21:27.480 --> 21:35.480
So how many ground stations and passages you need to determine an orbit?

21:35.480 --> 21:37.480
Okay.

21:38.480 --> 21:46.480
Obviously the more the better, but with two or three ground stations and a single passage, you get a really good estimate.

21:46.480 --> 21:52.480
And then with the following ones, you just kind of nail it actually.

21:52.480 --> 22:01.480
So the other results, actually you can get more info on the SID look, talk about it, which is quite extensive.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.480
Yeah.

22:03.480 --> 22:09.480
Since you're using CCSDS, you also know the pain of CCSDS, I hope.

22:10.480 --> 22:19.480
Have you thought about looking at other like open source space protocols that are already out there instead of writing a new?

22:19.480 --> 22:22.480
Actually it is based.

22:22.480 --> 22:30.480
So the question is whether we thought for existing space protocols instead of implementing a new one.

22:30.480 --> 22:35.480
The CCSDS provides some compatibility with commercial equipment.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.480
So we thought it was a good idea to go that way.

22:38.480 --> 22:47.480
So there is an open solution that exists that is compatible with this kind of protocol.

22:47.480 --> 22:51.480
Okay. Thank you very much for an amazing talk.

22:51.480 --> 22:53.480
Tiedelini.

22:53.480 --> 22:56.480
Oh, you've got it. Nice.

22:56.480 --> 23:02.480
If I can ask one last question, or at least one more in any case.

23:02.480 --> 23:11.480
Did you have any considerations for radiation effects in your design of the hardware and any mitigations in that sense?

23:11.480 --> 23:19.480
Okay. So the question is whether we had any consideration for the radiation effects on the hardware.

23:19.480 --> 23:26.480
When you fly what we call commercial of the self components, you know that they're not space hardened.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.480
So there is always a chance for something going wrong.

23:29.480 --> 23:36.480
But you can go around by designing in a like more clever way.

23:36.480 --> 23:41.480
For example, MOSFETs may latch themselves.

23:41.480 --> 23:54.480
But if you have a monitoring circuit that detects that and your power cycle and I think most of the times you get you can get out of this situation.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.480
For the software, which is also quite important.

23:57.480 --> 24:09.480
There was like a triple storage technique implemented for all the variables and information in the satellite.

24:09.480 --> 24:15.480
So also there was an ECC RAM used from the microcontroller.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.480
And there was a polling.

24:17.480 --> 24:20.480
So you read three values and you choose like the two that match.

24:20.480 --> 24:21.480
And this is it.

24:21.480 --> 24:28.480
And there is also scrubbing frequently scrubbing where you read everything and you rewrite it.

24:28.480 --> 24:36.480
So even there is an error, you have corrected it and then put the correct information in all places.

24:36.480 --> 24:39.480
Okay. So illness will be available for questions outside.

24:39.480 --> 24:40.480
Of course.

24:40.480 --> 24:41.480
We have three more minutes.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.480
Great.

24:42.480 --> 24:43.480
Excellent.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.480
Then maybe maybe maybe two more questions we had.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.480
We had one right before.

24:48.480 --> 24:50.480
It's all the way.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.480
Yeah, but the ground stations.

24:58.480 --> 25:09.480
Did you build your own ground stations or there's like a network that you can use or how this works because it looks like the most expensive part of the project is like you have to grab, you know, whole planet.

25:09.480 --> 25:10.480
Okay.

25:10.480 --> 25:15.480
So the question is, did we build our own ground station or did we use the session network?

25:16.480 --> 25:18.480
The simple answer is sat mugs.

25:18.480 --> 25:26.480
The more detailed answer is that we actually our first really first project was a ground station network.

25:26.480 --> 25:31.480
It now has around the five, five hundred stations around the world.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.480
It's operated by contributors.

25:33.480 --> 25:41.480
So we have like a really good coverage in the UJF band and also on upper bands too.

25:46.480 --> 25:47.480
Hello.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.480
Thank you for the talk.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.480
Two brief questions.

25:51.480 --> 26:03.480
Did you have an attitude control system for the cubic or it was not needed and same thing for thermal management was important or in the design.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.480
Okay.

26:04.480 --> 26:10.480
So the question is, did we have an attitude control system and was there any thermal management?

26:10.480 --> 26:14.480
So the first question is no, we just toss it out there and let it spin.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.480
It was not important for the experiment.

26:19.480 --> 26:25.480
So and also there was no time as you might have realized for the thermal management.

26:25.480 --> 26:36.480
There were some tests in vacuum chambers and we saw that it would survive without needing like an extra provision for that.

26:36.480 --> 26:45.480
Of course, the PCB design is built in a way where you dissipate all the heat from the components to the PCB.

26:45.480 --> 26:49.480
But that's kind of best practice anyway.

26:49.480 --> 26:56.480
And the temperatures we got from the telemetry were actually well within the automotive limit.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.480
So we were good.

26:58.480 --> 26:59.480
Okay.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.480
Thank you.

27:00.480 --> 27:03.480
Any additional questions we can go on the hallway.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.480
Thank you.
