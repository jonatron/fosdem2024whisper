00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Welcome to FOSSTEM 2024.

00:07.000 --> 00:26.000
I'll start with a reminder to be kinder.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
We lost quite a few volunteers over the pandemic.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
We lost muscle memory. We lost stuff. We lost everything.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Last year was pretty rough in the background.

00:37.000 --> 00:42.000
From what I've heard, it was not super noticeable for the attendees, which was nice.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
But still there were a few words.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
We hope that we are basically almost back to pre-pandemic levels of efficiency and effectiveness.

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
We'll see. But if something breaks, ideally tell Infodesk about it and just move on.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
Can't do anything else anyway.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Speaking of losing a lot of hands, please volunteer.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
As of right now, we still have plenty of opportunities for volunteering open.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
You'll find a bunch of QR codes so you can just take photos of the thing if you want to and you'll have everything.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
We still need more hands to help.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
As per usual, if you help with cleanup, A, any of the network cable, which is not that much anymore,

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
because we have been pretty good at using UB infrastructure these days,

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
any network cable which you take out under all supervision you can keep.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
I'm going to repeat this in the closing talk.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
Also, there is food for everyone who stays until the end.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
Historically, sometimes this went until midnight.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
But the last few years, we were always done-ish at 10, and more hands, more better.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
So if you are around and if you have time, please help.

01:56.000 --> 02:03.000
If you need help yourself, well, yellow shirts or jackets mean Steph.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
Blue shirts mean deaf room managers.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
Those are the people who basically run the conference in a conference in the various rooms.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Green shirts are video team.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
There are a few back there.

02:13.000 --> 02:19.000
You also see orange shirts, which are general purpose volunteers for all the things.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Speaking of not everything being super smoothly just now,

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
the supplier didn't send all the t-shirts which we ordered, and we noticed too late.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
So a long story short, we don't have enough of the shirts.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
As you can see, I'm wearing a black one, not a yellow one.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
So not every volunteer might have a shirt.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
If in doubt, given the benefit of the doubt, they are probably a volunteer if they claim so.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
This is ULB. This is not according to True North.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
You see True North down below, but also we have the navigation.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
If you need to go around, this is way, way better than just five years ago when we didn't have this,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
and everyone got lost all the time.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.000
So those QR codes all now go into this precise system if you need anything.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
From a t-shirt or a hoodie, if you want to have a printed map, if you want to give us a donation,

03:11.000 --> 03:19.000
if you just want to say hi and thanks, whatever Infodesk is your main landing spot,

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
as per usual, extra large, extra small might be gone sooner than later,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
so going there sooner than later might be good.

03:27.000 --> 03:32.000
We are also on Matrix, and you can also email us at all times,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
and all of those are monitored, not 24-7, but almost.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
So this is the difference between last year and this year,

03:41.000 --> 03:45.000
and there is more than a person a week of work between those two photos,

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
and more than 10K in investment.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
So as a reminder for those who don't know,

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
we have on the FOSTA network, it is IPv6 only on the Wi-Fi,

03:59.000 --> 04:07.000
and it is net6.4 and DNS6.4, so all the translation to IPv4 happens for you automatically,

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
except for, I believe it was ripe, we are the first conference to actually do this,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
and we found a bunch of bugs.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Learning in the public, full transparency, we just found a bug in internal Grafana tooling with IPv6.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
Anyway, so primarily use this network please,

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
and if you maintain any software and something breaks, this is great, of course now you can fix it.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.000
At the same time, if you want the more legacy taste of internet in your devices,

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
you can use the dual stack one, and you will get full IPv4.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
But we have been doing this for years, it is pretty stable, just try it,

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
and you will just see, hey, this IPv6 stuff actually works.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
We also have a lightning talk, or longer than a lightning talk in the infrastructure view, as per usual,

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
the QR code goes there, and as a reminder, because we have funny people who think they are funny when they try and attack stuff,

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
A, we are going to find you and shut you down, but B, please encrypt all your traffic,

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
because some people are just maybe not as nice as they should be.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
Social interactions, well, hallway track, that is the main thing while we are here at FOSTA,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
because we can't get into the rooms anyway.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
There is also lots of new joiners, because as you would have loved.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
Anyway, we have Matrix as the primary thing, we also have IRC with reasonable effort,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
but there is no bridge this year, if you don't know what that means, doesn't matter,

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
just go to Matrix, long story short, yeah.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
Also, go to Mustadon and look at stuff.

05:41.000 --> 05:52.000
If you need to register for, well, Brain's Matrix on, chat FOSTA or you click on the upper left,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
and then on the create account and you are done.

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
If you want to toot about those things, which you see, ideally with consent of the people who are in the picture,

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
use the hashtag FOSTA, there is our main account, we also have other social media,

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
but we try to ignore this, so that's the main one.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
You will find this with the QR code.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
Anyone who doesn't want to be in the picture now is a good time to hide your face,

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
and everyone else just raise your hands for a second and say hi.

06:27.000 --> 06:32.000
Those are going to be posted on Mustadon in a few.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
So, schedule.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
You probably know this, but this is the schedule, it builds dynamically,

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
but we are pretty much settled, but if any deaf room manager needs to still change something,

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
someone fell sick, whatever, it will update within minutes,

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
so this is the absolute source of truth for everything regarding schedule.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.000
And I still don't think anyone told us about an Apple-compatible thing for the...

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
There is one? Okay.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
Can you send us to info at FOSTA, so next time I can put this on the slides?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Thank you.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
Just say Ritchie H or 2Ritchie H and it will find its way.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Thank you.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
So, the stats, we have even more events crammed into these old buildings.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
We have even more speakers.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
We do have more tracks and deaf rooms, but I forgot the old number, so you don't see the diff.

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
We managed to cram even more stands into the building

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
and maybe we will be able to do even more next year.

07:32.000 --> 07:39.000
We don't yet know, because we are always out of space, as you know, and fewer lighting talks.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
These are all the deaf rooms.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
You won't be reading all of those right now, but just to give you a rough idea of scale,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
this is only page one, this is page two.

07:48.000 --> 07:56.000
And for those who don't know, yes, this is the largest open source conference on Earth.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
We have a bunch of stands.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
We rejuggled them quite a bit.

08:12.000 --> 08:19.000
So, if you are walking to that place there for the last three or five years, you always saw that one thing.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
Look online.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
Some of them didn't make it, but most we just rejuggled them and tried to organize them with a new system.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
So, there might just be somewhere else.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
Yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
We don't have a hacker room this year.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
We needed this for basically for staff and for boxes of stuff.

08:40.000 --> 08:46.000
So, please go to the cafeteria in the main, or next to the food area in the main campus.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Please don't go into the old room.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Even if you know where the old room is, please just go.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Don't go in there, because there's going to be people in there who are working and trying to make FOSTA happen.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
So, yeah, please don't.

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
Speaking of being nice about things, when, not if, you need to queue here, because you will need to queue.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
Please form an orderly queue.

09:07.000 --> 09:14.000
Don't skip, blah, blah, blah, the usual, but also don't block any of the pathways and don't block any of the fire exits.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
We are literally filling this campus to capacity and maybe a little bit to breaking capacity.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.000
So, please try and keep the pathways free.

09:25.000 --> 09:33.000
If staff and volunteers come with requests or instructions or, hey, this is a fire hazard or whatever, please don't discuss.

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
Just do it, because they probably have a good reason why they do it, why they tell you.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
If staff or volunteers are running, make way.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
We are not running often, but when we are running, we mean it, so please just make way.

09:45.000 --> 09:51.000
In the food queue, please consider letting people skip ahead if they have one of the color-coded t-shirts,

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
but also if you have one of those, don't abuse it and don't use it when you actually would have time.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
Also happens sometimes.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
It goes both ways.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
The one exception, we are doing food runs for the actual teams which are stuck in rooms all day, like myself,

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
and those, we will just skip the queue and go to the front.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
If you see this sign, you saw a green one on the sides or on the doors as you came in, which was nice.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
All of them on the back have this one.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
If there is a sign that the room is full, that means the room is full.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
It does not mean that because you have a really good reason and really wanted to see that one talk

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
and your friend is speaking, you can sneak in.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
It means the room is full.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
This sucks, but it means the room is full.

10:41.000 --> 10:48.000
Maybe it's going to work this time, but please, that sign means do not enter.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
Also if you try to open the door, sometimes they are a little bit broken,

10:53.000 --> 11:00.000
but if you try to open the door and someone pulls back, that means the volunteer has a reason why the door is currently closed.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Usually of course it's super loud inside.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Maybe also I should have put this there.

11:04.000 --> 11:12.000
When you leave and enter a building, please don't talk and try to not bump the chairs and everything.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
It's incredibly loud up front and also quite a few defferums try to optimize for Q&A,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
but this means the audience needs to be quiet while entering and leaving.

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
I know it's unusual, but those buildings are super, super, super loud, in particular for anyone up front.

11:27.000 --> 11:33.000
This is literally built to echo everything from me up to you, but also everything from you down to me.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
It's super loud and this is true for quite a few buildings.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
So please be quiet when entering and leaving.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
I need to put this on the slides for next year.

11:40.000 --> 11:45.000
If you have any feedback, send it there.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
We don't get enough feedback.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
If you say nice things, that's also appreciated.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
That happens almost never.

11:51.000 --> 12:01.000
If you want to say crazy things, maybe don't, but anything you want to send us, send us, we like reading your stuff and we read everything.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
If you need first aid, we have one first aid station in K Building on the second level

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
and for most of the entryways to the second level, it would be on the right end of the thing

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
or if you're the one end and then it's at the other end, if you don't see it.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
There's also the net link here.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
I'm just going to wait a little bit longer for people to take a picture of this slide,

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
because if you need it, you will need it, so now is a good time to take a picture of this.

12:29.000 --> 12:38.000
We also have both professional security and the rec course walking around campus randomly,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
like they have their own schedule and everything.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
They are the professionals, we are not.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
If you need anything, go there.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
A bit about health and safety.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
You hear the coughing all around of you.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
Some of you are sick right now, some with COVID.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
Some of you will fall sick while here and some of you will fall sick at home.

13:04.000 --> 13:09.000
If you are currently infected, ideally go home.

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
At the same time, I recognize that this might be harsh if you're only coughing,

13:15.000 --> 13:18.000
but in this case, please just wear a mask.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.000
We have free masks at the infodesk.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I also see a few people with masks here.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
You will also see me with a mask when I'm not talking about stuff.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Also for the first-timers and for those who might not have been here so often,

13:32.000 --> 13:39.000
Fostem Flue, Chaos Grippe, Oktoberfest, those are mass spreader events.

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
A statistically significant amount of people will come home sick.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Done. Plain statistics in science.

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
You can get sick if you want to, but maybe don't.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
This is the Mozilla death room.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.000
I saw this on Masteron, not on any other social network, which is nice.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.000
The left one is 20 years ago, 2004, I think they said,

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
and they are almost in the same place by pure accident this year.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
The wall changed color, but beyond this it's the same.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Why am I bringing this up?

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
Well, next year we will have the 25.

14:17.000 --> 14:27.000
So, if you have old shirts, which you have from as old as possible, ideally,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
please do bring them.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Even if they don't fit, still bring them.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
Someone might be able to wear them, or you can just pull them over your belly,

14:36.000 --> 14:40.000
or maybe you slim down so much so you can just get a second person into the shirt,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
depending which way it went.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
But please bring the old stuff.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
If you have an old hoodie, if you have an old sweater,

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
if you have this one project shirt from like ages ago, whatever.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Bring the old stuff.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
We are going to figure something out for next year.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
Maybe take a picture here or outside, or we'll see.

15:00.000 --> 15:04.000
Most likely Sunday next year, because then we can gorge on Saturday how many people come.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
Anyway, if you have anything old, which you think might be nice on a photo, bring it.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
We also have a code of conduct, and we followed a code of conduct both ways.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
Anything which happens, I need to put a QR code here, just realized.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
Yeah, this is the code of conduct. Please read it, but the short version is nice.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Anything happens, conducted for StemOrc.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
If anything is really like currently ongoing, there is a cell phone,

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
and the cell phone is going to wake people up.

15:39.000 --> 15:44.000
So anything really bad happens, call this number, and wake whoever, poor soul.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.000
Probably Michael is currently carrying this thing.

15:47.000 --> 15:55.000
Or anyone who has a yellow shirt, well, with stuff on it, or a jacket or something, just go to them.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
By proxy, if you can't find someone else in green, blue, or orange shirt,

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
but primarily ideally go to the yellow shirt, or InfoDesk and K also works.

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
To the thank yous, to all the volunteers, all the deaf room speakers, all the deaf room managers, all the staff, all everyone. Thank you.

16:14.000 --> 16:30.000
APPLAUSE

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Also, thank you to all the sponsors.

16:35.000 --> 16:44.000
APPLAUSE

16:46.000 --> 16:52.000
If you want to give thanks the other way, donations can be made at InfoDesk in HOK or online.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
So for those who don't know, of course, I don't know how many are in...

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Oh, for who is this the first foster?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Wow, good!

17:03.000 --> 17:10.000
APPLAUSE

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
So for those who don't know this, we limit the amount of sponsors, basically.

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
The reason is we don't want to depend on anyone, any one company, or on any long-standing support or anything.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
We deliberately finance ourselves substantially through donations and t-shirt sales and things like these.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
Well, that's basically it.

17:33.000 --> 17:42.000
So yeah, this is why we call for donations, because we don't want to be depending on the corporate overlords, and like they pull funding or something.

17:42.000 --> 17:48.000
We want this to be a grass-rootsy thing, not only on the organizing side, but also on the financial side.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
And thank you!

17:51.000 --> 17:58.000
APPLAUSE

17:59.000 --> 18:02.000
To be clear, also thank you, even if you don't donate.

18:02.000 --> 18:08.000
Also, for those who don't know, it's really loud up here, so even if you just whisper, like two, five, twenty people...

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Thank you.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.000
Whispering is super loud.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
You cannot imagine how good or bad, depending on your vantage point, these rooms are.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
It's insane how loud is up front for the speakers if you even mumble.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Person who's over there on the right.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
Yeah, so, have fun, and as always, be excellent to each other.

18:31.000 --> 18:41.000
APPLAUSE

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
.
