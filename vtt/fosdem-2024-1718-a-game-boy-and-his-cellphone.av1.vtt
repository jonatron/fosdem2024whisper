WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
So, ready to start?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Yeah.

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay, so we have now Esteba with Game Boy and his cell phone.

00:16.000 --> 00:27.000
Hello, and thanks for being here for this talk about Game Boy peripheral that I think

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
is very interesting and versatile.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm Esteba and I've been working to emulate and restore this peripheral on and off for

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
the last six years or so.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
But first, I should tell you what it is.

00:42.000 --> 00:50.000
The mobile adapter GB is a peripheral that allows you to connect your Game Boy up to

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
your cell phone, allowing games to make and receive calls in part to also call an internet

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
service provider and connect to the internet, allowing for all sorts of online connectivity,

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
like sharing scores and getting updates for various things.

01:10.000 --> 01:19.000
It was one of the very first attempts by Nintendo to have any sort of online connectivity for

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
consoles, but what makes this one very interesting in my opinion is that it supported a few rather

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
high profile games.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
There were actually a few variations of this adapter made for several different phones.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
You have a blue, a yellow and a red one.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
The green one for PHS was also planned but never released.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
But what you will notice is that none of these actually work for any non-Japanese phones.

01:50.000 --> 01:59.000
So this service never left the island and unfortunately it was sunset very early, almost

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
two years into its life in December 2002.

02:05.000 --> 02:12.000
But to give you a better idea of what this peripheral could do, we will talk a little bit about the

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
games that supported it.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
So first of all, you got the mobile trainer with the adapter.

02:18.000 --> 02:25.000
It was used to configure the adapter and you had to use this before you could connect to the internet.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
It also came with a very useful usage manual but it also had some very interesting utilities,

02:32.000 --> 02:39.000
which were a mail client which supported both SMTP and POP and could communicate with the outside

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
world so you could actually receive real emails.

02:42.000 --> 02:52.000
And a very minimal web browser which was hard-coded to one website to read news about Nintendo games

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
and games for this peripheral.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
Now, the very first game that was released for this thing was Pokemon, a very popular franchise

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
that I'm sure you're familiar with.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
But it was actually one of the very first time you were able to battle and trade online with your friends

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
or at very large distances at least.

03:14.000 --> 03:23.000
Besides that, it also featured a battle tower which allowed you to fight people who have entered that tower previously.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
It got localized with NPCs in the west but the Japanese version worked with this adapter.

03:29.000 --> 03:37.000
You also had a trade corner which is a bit of a prototype of the global trade station which appeared back in Generation 4.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
And you had a news machine which I think is the most interesting part because you could download scripts which had news items

03:45.000 --> 03:54.000
but also many games, questionnaires and you had rankings to show off your friends how big your Magikarp is.

03:55.000 --> 04:06.000
Another very interesting game in my opinion is Net the Get which was one of the only titles which used the MBC6 on the Game Boy.

04:06.000 --> 04:15.000
It's a minigame collection that came with 15 built-in minigames which could download more and more would be released over time

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
though they never reached the titular 100 minigames unfortunately.

04:22.000 --> 04:31.000
A few other games that were very interesting, Mobile Golf which is a sequel to Mario Golf which never got localized

04:31.000 --> 04:38.000
but it came bundled with the adapter later in its life to help sell the adapter.

04:38.000 --> 04:48.000
Starcom which is a sort of pet simulator, Game Boy Wars which was part of the Wars series known for Advanced Wars and Famicom Wars

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
and Mario Kart which allowed you to upload and download ghost data.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
So let's tell you a little bit about how this project got started and where we are now.

05:01.000 --> 05:12.000
Somewhere in 2016, Haki posted a thread on GlitchCelapse which explained a little bit about how the mobile adapter protocol worked.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
From there we spun up the Python script which communicated with the BGB emulator

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
allowing you to have a proof concept that this thing actually worked.

05:25.000 --> 05:38.000
Somewhere in 2018, a guy named Shinumi who is known for emulating various peripherals including suing machines and phishing sonars which were made for the Game Boy.

05:38.000 --> 05:49.000
Also emulated the mobile adapter and specifically Net-to-Get and created very comprehensive documentation that we are updating and keeping track of to this day.

05:49.000 --> 06:01.000
And at some point people wanted to actually bring a real Game Boy to connect to the internet and that's kind of where I stepped in and we started doing stuff.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
So fast forward to today, we have a group called Rion.

06:07.000 --> 06:18.000
We are a group of preservationists, developers and enthusiasts who want to preserve this system and make it usable to the common user as it used to be.

06:18.000 --> 06:27.000
For that we are making emulators, servers and translations for a few of the games so that they can be enjoyed by a wider audience.

06:28.000 --> 06:39.000
So to give you an idea of how this all fits together, I will explain a bit about how the system connects together.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
So this is a connection diagram.

06:42.000 --> 06:56.000
On the left side you have the user's Game Boy which communicates through a custom link protocol with the adapter which further communicates with a proprietary protocol with a mobile phone.

06:56.000 --> 07:06.000
The mobile phone is connected to the phone network but depending on who you call you can either call a friend and communicate with their phone directly.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
And this was used for example for the Pokemon trading and battling.

07:11.000 --> 07:23.000
Or you could call the internet service provider and use the point-to-point protocol to tunnel your connection through TCP and UDP to the official Nintendo servers.

07:24.000 --> 07:34.000
Now most of this stuff is kind of irrelevant when we are emulating this because when we are emulating it we can kind of make big black boxes depending on what you are doing.

07:34.000 --> 07:45.000
This is how it would look if you have a simple microcontroller that connects to your Game Boy and then further connects through USB to your computer.

07:45.000 --> 08:05.000
Your computer will communicate to either the game server or if you want to call a friend then we have set up a relay to punch through router firewalls and that sort of thing which allows you to connect to any other player on the world.

08:05.000 --> 08:18.000
And this can either be hardware or these blocks can either be full emulator which also emulates like the Game Boy itself and the adapter so it's a little bit more variable.

08:18.000 --> 08:30.000
So we have full documentation and emulation of the peripheral itself or at least the part that communicates with the Game Boy.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
And for that we have made a library called LibMobile.

08:35.000 --> 08:44.000
This library can be integrated into all sorts of projects from software emulators to hardware emulators and back.

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
We've integrated thus far into the BGB emulator which is a Game Boy Color emulator.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
We've integrated into the MGB emulator.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
We've made a little fun interface to configure it as well.

08:57.000 --> 09:10.000
And some people have been playing around with making it work on the Raspberry Pi Pico and communicating over Wi-Fi for example or the Arduino Uno which is mostly what I've been using.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
There's also the GBE plus emulator which was made by the Shonumi which I mentioned before.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
This is more of a local only emulator but it's for some games that we don't yet.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
And of course full documentation of this is available in Dandox.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
So these are a few of the examples of things of setups that people have put together.

09:32.000 --> 09:42.000
On the far left you've got the simplest one which is just breaking out a few wires and connecting them to the Arduino and then just plugging that into your computer and doing it like that.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Some people have made PCBs.

09:44.000 --> 10:00.000
The central one is able to communicate over Wi-Fi and Xenaro really active user lately has made a 3D print version of it as well.

10:00.000 --> 10:04.000
Now of course you don't need to connect it directly to a computer.

10:04.000 --> 10:11.000
You can also just use a modern phone which are basically computers these days.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
We've also of course started emulating the server side of things.

10:16.000 --> 10:23.000
We have the relay server which I've mentioned before which gives you a phone number and allows you to call someone else.

10:23.000 --> 10:35.000
We have a mail server which is implemented in Node.js and stores in SQL so we can manipulate the emails more easily.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
And we have a few complete game servers for Pokemon Crystal which supports actually everything at this point.

10:43.000 --> 10:59.000
And a very driven person called Winter who has fully emulated Mario Kart and Monopoly though Monopoly doesn't have many features unfortunately.

11:00.000 --> 11:17.000
Also GBE plus has emulated a few games in particular Net-to-Get Game Boy Wars, All Japan GT Championship and Hello Kitty's Happy House which allows you to send emails with items to your friends which is very cute I think.

11:18.000 --> 11:28.000
And of course we've also made a few translations in particular Pokemon Crystal of course was already localized but we've restored all the functionality for it.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
And we've also ported all of those changes to the four other languages that the game was released for.

11:35.000 --> 11:47.000
Mark Max came to us asking if we were interested in his mobile golf translation and most of it has been translated but not the mobile features because we don't have any support for it yet.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.000
And the mobile trainer which of course is a cornerstone of this whole thing.

11:52.000 --> 12:00.000
If you want to get into it or make an emulator for yourself or develop a game that supports this thing.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
We have of course the mobile which allows you to emulate the adapter itself.

12:05.000 --> 12:17.000
We have the re-enrollable story which you can extend with other games or if you want to emulate those though I would suggest if you make homebrew that you make your own server behind this.

12:17.000 --> 12:30.000
And unfortunately we still don't have a client library the library that runs in the Game Boy itself though we have reverse engineered the library from the Nintendo SDK.

12:30.000 --> 12:36.000
If you don't care about licensing problems.

12:36.000 --> 12:47.000
So in conclusion most of the things that you'd want to see are already there.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Of course we don't have all the games yet.

12:49.000 --> 12:59.000
The problem that we're mostly struggling with right now is authentication and getting this useful for actual people who aren't very techie.

13:00.000 --> 13:14.000
So if you want to help with any of that documentation making tools websites whatever you can reach us on unfortunately discord only.

13:14.000 --> 13:26.000
We have if you want to make a matrix server and bridge that I would be very happy but unfortunately right now it would be the only person who would use that.

13:27.000 --> 13:36.000
Our github is over there and show numies block with a lot of more peripherals and funky things that he's emulated with the Game Boy.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
Can be reached through his github pages.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
That was it.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Thank you.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
Thank you.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
We have time for one or two quick questions.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
I have a very quick question.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Thanks for the talk.

13:59.000 --> 14:05.000
Do you know how the original games that you could download of the Internet back in the 2000s how those were captured.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
How those have been like captured like that's like 22 years ago.

14:11.000 --> 14:19.000
So one of the things that we actually sometimes need help with is if you have any of the games that supported the mobile adapter.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Don't run them dump the save directly.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
If the battery still lives then we might be able to restore some of the games that were supported back then.

14:29.000 --> 14:37.000
Thankfully though we have the 15 built in games which serve as an example to make more so that helps a lot already.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
Another quick question.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Yes.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
No.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
No.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Okay.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Well then.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Thank you.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
You can get prepared.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
It was really interesting.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
Thank you.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Thank you.
