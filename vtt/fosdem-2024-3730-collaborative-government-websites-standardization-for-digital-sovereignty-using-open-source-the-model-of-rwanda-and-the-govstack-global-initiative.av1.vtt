WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
Back to the Open Web Alliance Dev Room at FuzzDem 2024.

00:09.800 --> 00:15.440
Now I have the great pleasure of introducing a Type 03 friend, Daniel Homer-Adan, who runs

00:15.440 --> 00:22.280
the Type 03 Community Expansion Committee, which makes it part of his actual job to go

00:22.280 --> 00:24.960
around the world helping people with open source software.

00:24.960 --> 00:28.040
And he's got some really cool stories to tell today.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.040
Please, one more time.

00:30.040 --> 00:34.040
Thank you very much.

00:34.040 --> 00:40.040
Actually the organizers of the agenda were inspired to put me after Owen, because I will

00:40.040 --> 00:43.040
follow on the idea of building up the narrative.

00:43.040 --> 00:49.040
You know, Owen was mentioning that he would very much like to also get a call from Burkina

00:49.040 --> 00:54.040
Faso or another country to go there.

00:54.040 --> 01:02.040
While we somehow did get that call from Rwanda, as Matias was saying, the matter from then

01:02.040 --> 01:11.040
on was for us to create the frame into which we can actually receive calls from all over

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
the place.

01:12.040 --> 01:20.040
And we are actually doing it and it's a matter, I think, of positioning and of building up

01:20.040 --> 01:26.040
this ability of ours to transform our capacity into value.

01:26.040 --> 01:30.040
Value, which is not necessarily something that we need to have a lot of money.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.040
We didn't have a lot of money when we started.

01:32.040 --> 01:38.040
We don't have a lot of money now, but we believe that it's a matter of value.

01:38.040 --> 01:42.040
So the value in which we believe and the value in which we create.

01:42.040 --> 01:50.040
I'm going to talk about the strategic approach, which while was developed by our

01:50.040 --> 01:59.040
Type 3 community, is actually, I really believe that actually working very well for any open

01:59.040 --> 02:00.040
source community.

02:00.040 --> 02:07.040
And definitely for any of the technologies and communities which are forming the open

02:07.040 --> 02:09.040
website alliance here.

02:09.040 --> 02:18.040
So I'm not going to delve into the technical parts of the Type 3 CMS technology itself,

02:18.040 --> 02:23.040
but go into the principles of what we've done and what we're planning to do.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.040
I'm Daniel from Oroden.

02:25.040 --> 02:32.040
I'm coordinating the community expansion committee in the Type 3 association.

02:32.040 --> 02:37.040
So it's a very important working because here we're talking about the expansion of the

02:37.040 --> 02:38.040
community.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.040
What does it mean?

02:40.040 --> 02:49.040
It was the committee was created in 2018 in order to take care of bringing the community

02:49.040 --> 02:55.040
and our technology in countries where Type 3 was not yet known.

02:55.040 --> 03:02.040
So Type 3, maybe you know it, was developed in the central Europe and most of the market

03:02.040 --> 03:09.040
was and still is into the German speaking countries and the countries around it.

03:09.040 --> 03:18.040
We've started to go into other geographies, into Africa, Latin America and so on.

03:18.040 --> 03:25.040
And while we are doing this, the committee itself actually is concentrating on several types

03:25.040 --> 03:26.040
of activities.

03:26.040 --> 03:32.040
It's engaging communities of web developers, looking to support them to understand and

03:32.040 --> 03:39.040
to learn the Type 3 technology and is also working with the market, say potential clients

03:39.040 --> 03:43.040
of various kinds and that was the initial idea.

03:43.040 --> 03:50.040
We have run for several years a program which was called the International Type 3 Mentorship

03:50.040 --> 03:51.040
Program.

03:51.040 --> 03:57.040
What it means is that through volunteer mentors or technical mentors from the Type 3 association

03:57.040 --> 04:05.040
community, we are supporting people who wanted to learn Type 3 from countries like Botswana,

04:05.040 --> 04:13.040
Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Uganda, Cuba, Chile, Bosnia and so on, keeping in mind that these are

04:13.040 --> 04:17.040
countries where Type 3 was not yet known or not yet embraced.

04:17.040 --> 04:24.040
Yet we really found out that through running these type of programs, while the people there

04:24.040 --> 04:32.040
got the basics of the Type 3 technology, there was still something very important which was

04:32.040 --> 04:39.040
missing, which was the access to work, the actual ability of them to earn their living

04:39.040 --> 04:46.040
using Type 3 and that was something that we realized we have to fix and that changed a

04:46.040 --> 04:47.040
lot of things.

04:47.040 --> 04:53.040
So we are now moving towards our approach into going from technology first towards market

04:53.040 --> 04:56.040
first or towards client first.

04:56.040 --> 05:03.040
I'm going to talk about the way into which this story evolved from the Rwandan story and

05:03.040 --> 05:09.040
our engagement with the Rwandan government, then the development of some principles which

05:09.040 --> 05:16.040
we are following and which we have developed into a strategy that is now going to be embraced

05:16.040 --> 05:18.040
by various other countries.

05:18.040 --> 05:25.040
In Africa but also beyond, we had the chance, the chance that we actually made ourselves

05:25.040 --> 05:27.040
to travel around the world.

05:27.040 --> 05:35.040
So last year, for example, we've reached physically governments far away from Oceania, for example,

05:35.040 --> 05:44.040
from Papua New Guinea and many, many governments from Africa as well.

05:44.040 --> 05:49.040
So how did Rwanda story came to being?

05:49.040 --> 05:53.040
Rwanda is a relatively small country in the middle of Africa.

05:53.040 --> 06:04.040
It has 12 million people and throughout the recent time, it has positioned itself as the

06:04.040 --> 06:08.040
digitalization line or the digital transformation line of Africa.

06:08.040 --> 06:12.040
Or some people say the Singapore of Africa.

06:12.040 --> 06:18.040
It's not just in relation to digitalization but in relation to the entire economical development

06:18.040 --> 06:24.040
that happened in the past, let's say, 10, 15 years.

06:24.040 --> 06:33.040
And due to a very, very strong, very coherent political alignment and political will, it

06:33.040 --> 06:37.040
managed to make strides into this logic of development.

06:37.040 --> 06:46.040
So it's not somehow necessarily a surprise, the fact that Rwanda, with some support from us, as you will see,

06:46.040 --> 06:55.040
has managed to establish itself as the first country which has set up an open source community-based

06:55.040 --> 07:02.040
content management system as a national standard for all the websites of all the public institutions

07:02.040 --> 07:11.040
in the country, starting from government, to national agencies, to regional administration, to embassies, everything.

07:11.040 --> 07:21.040
So this type of model actually is now going to be taken over by other governments and I'll get to that.

07:21.040 --> 07:29.040
In 2018, the websites of the government of Rwanda were running on a very old, even though type of tree,

07:29.040 --> 07:36.040
it was a very old version of it. It was easy for us to connect with them because of that.

07:36.040 --> 07:47.040
But actually, as Matias was mentioning about the call about upgrading the websites, those websites which were old and abandoned

07:47.040 --> 07:51.040
were not upgradable per se and they were not upgraded.

07:51.040 --> 08:01.040
Actually, when we first engaged, we saw the state of lack of maintenance, both in the terms of technology,

08:01.040 --> 08:11.040
but also in the terms of content, the fact that many were running without HTTPS, that each was running on a different server,

08:11.040 --> 08:19.040
that some didn't have editors at all, and a lot of many other problems. Some were crashing constantly.

08:19.040 --> 08:25.040
We realized that the problem is not just about upgrading some websites.

08:25.040 --> 08:30.040
So we've started by asking questions which at that point were hard questions.

08:30.040 --> 08:44.040
Now for us, they are normal. They are part of, let's say, receipt of approach, saying that aside from your perceived need of having the websites upgrade,

08:44.040 --> 08:51.040
do you actually have the knowledge in the country? Do you have the knowledge in the government to manage this type of projects?

08:51.040 --> 08:55.040
Do you have the knowledge in the market to develop this type of projects?

08:55.040 --> 09:05.040
Do you have the methodologies to host them, to deploy them, to monitor them, to ensure their security, to ensure their performance,

09:05.040 --> 09:15.040
to tune them? Do you have the capacity to actually train the editors in all the public institutions, ministries, city halls and so on,

09:15.040 --> 09:26.040
who can really maintain the websites? And when the answers definitely at that point were no, then we said it's not about the technology,

09:26.040 --> 09:32.040
it's about the process. So first of all and foremost, we need to have a plan.

09:32.040 --> 09:43.040
You have to have a plan as a government to develop this coherent approach of your new project, which of course it was typo 3,

09:43.040 --> 09:54.040
but it was not about the technology itself, it was about the approach at the national level to build up the capacity and to build up a plan on the long run.

09:55.040 --> 10:06.040
Two years and it took us four trips until we actually together with the government of Rwanda managed to set up a plan,

10:06.040 --> 10:13.040
a plan of what we need to do, of what they need to do and how we need to approach the process.

10:13.040 --> 10:27.040
They've managed to receive funding from the German cooperation agency, GIZ, in order to support them to actually train people,

10:27.040 --> 10:34.040
both in the government and in the private sector, and to deploy and set up the capacity there.

10:35.040 --> 10:45.040
At that point, and you see some of the pictures of these workshops that we did, on one hand to present, well the technology, the typo 3,

10:45.040 --> 10:56.040
but also to work together with them on the plan itself, so how the training or the knowledge acquisition has to be done and so on.

10:57.040 --> 11:10.040
And after the initial plan was set, a coaching phase began, a coaching phase which initially the government and the sponsor was thinking that it's about typo 3 technology.

11:10.040 --> 11:24.040
While it was about typo 3 technology, I would say that a lot of the activity was given to other type of aspects which for any developing country are super important.

11:24.040 --> 11:37.040
We might not see or might not perceive directly that a lot of support and a lot of knowledge gaining has to be taken in the methodology.

11:37.040 --> 11:46.040
So in the way that you're coding, in the way that you're organizing, in the tools that you're using, think that in many countries in the world,

11:47.040 --> 11:54.040
they did not benefit of university degrees or university level as we have in Europe.

11:54.040 --> 12:02.040
Maybe the ways into which they've approached coding so far was not structured, was not organized.

12:02.040 --> 12:06.040
They didn't know how to use properly the ideas.

12:06.040 --> 12:13.040
They didn't know how to use a management, a task management tracker.

12:14.040 --> 12:25.040
The methodology, for example, so Edge Island Scrum methodology, for example, was known as principle for them, but not as a practice.

12:25.040 --> 12:29.040
And one important aspect, the deployment.

12:29.040 --> 12:42.040
So continuous integration, continuous deployment, that was something that we've put a lot of emphasis on in order to build a proper methodology which has to be described, has to be understood, and then followed.

12:43.040 --> 12:48.040
Before and after the coaching is ending.

12:48.040 --> 13:03.040
So a CICD pipeline which would prevent by design, the local developers to, for example, go and directly change something in the production website, things which was a common thing.

13:03.040 --> 13:10.040
I mean, it was the way that they were doing it before we actually started to work with them in that direction.

13:11.040 --> 13:22.040
And the level of the instability of the website before we've done this support for transformation was quite terrible.

13:22.040 --> 13:33.040
So throughout the phase of six months of support through coaching, we've managed to transfer knowledge and to develop these good practices.

13:33.040 --> 13:43.040
So they have developed the central governmental website and six, first six ministerial websites.

13:43.040 --> 13:59.040
After that, the coaching from us, let's say, and the support from the donor has diminished or has finished, and they continued through their own resources to launch further on websites.

13:59.040 --> 14:10.040
So never at any moment did we, the traditional Type 3 community members, write any line of code in those websites.

14:10.040 --> 14:17.040
Everything, everything, front-end, back-end configurations, everything was done by them, by the Rwandans.

14:17.040 --> 14:28.040
Well, without coaching, but really it was a supportive coaching and not something intrusive that we did because the important thing was for them to develop their capacity.

14:29.040 --> 14:36.040
Up until this moment, more than 300 websites were launching Rwanda on Type 3.

14:36.040 --> 14:51.040
So from the central government, national agencies, regional and local administration embassies, they have set up at the level of the national IT agency,

14:51.040 --> 15:05.040
a center for training of the editors, meaning that all the editors from all the ministries and institutions are going through a formalized, standardized training and a national support center,

15:05.040 --> 15:11.040
both functional and technical at the level of the national institution.

15:11.040 --> 15:29.040
So that means that the other institutions did not have any more the burden of having to maintain and to know their own website while everything was taken care in a standardized approach.

15:30.040 --> 15:40.040
In what I will go a bit further, a centralized deployment and hosting approach as well.

15:40.040 --> 15:54.040
So in the national data center, in one place, everything was set up, supported by a team of DevOps and cybersecurity engineers, which also we have supported coaching, let's say.

15:54.040 --> 16:13.040
In this respect of doing the audits, both for performance and both for cybersecurity, for security, and doing a disaster recovery policy, which by the way, before we came in, was not present.

16:13.040 --> 16:24.040
So all the websites of the government agencies and so on are actually following the same pattern, the same look and feel and the same content structure.

16:24.040 --> 16:33.040
You see here, for example, the main website of the government, let's say the Gov website.

16:34.040 --> 16:38.040
You see here an example of a ministerial website of the Ministry of ICT.

16:38.040 --> 16:53.040
So it follows the same logic, the same pattern, the same type of content blocks in order to create a familiarity for the users, the visitors of the website with the ways that the institutions in the country are presenting themselves.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.040
Here is a website of a region, a northern region.

16:59.040 --> 17:17.040
And what we have right now is more than 300 websites, 19 ministries which are all on one code instance, 30 districts on one code instance, and the logic continues.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.040
What does it mean on one code instance?

17:19.040 --> 17:31.040
Well, for this instance, actually there is one installation, a multi-tenant or multi-domain, which provides the code for all the websites of the same type.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
Why is that?

17:32.040 --> 17:47.040
Because actually the functional and technical resembles allow it to use the same technological components and extensions in the case of Type 3.

17:48.040 --> 17:59.040
While in the same time, the technical architecture of Type 3 allows completely autonomous management from the back end of all the websites, each of the websites.

17:59.040 --> 18:15.040
Each of the websites has the editor structure with their rights and access abilities with their own content and of course with their own layouts or layout specific elements, let's say.

18:18.040 --> 18:31.040
What we got out of it and what they got out of it is an approach into which they have a standardized take or standardized framework both in the technical perspective,

18:31.040 --> 18:43.040
but also in the perspective of doing the development further, doing the maintenance, the disaster recovery, the training of the editors, the support functional and technical,

18:44.040 --> 18:52.040
the continuous integration, continuous deployment and monitoring and auditing both performance and security.

18:52.040 --> 18:58.040
All being done under the umbrella of the National IT Agency.

18:59.040 --> 19:14.040
In this coaching program of six months, there was a relatively equal representation of engineers from the National Agency and developers from local private companies.

19:14.040 --> 19:25.040
And the local private companies further on have carried on the development of the next websites and the process is still carried on.

19:25.040 --> 19:31.040
Of course, we are expecting on a target of general of about 600 websites.

19:32.040 --> 19:46.040
Now, out of this experience and out of the success that we saw, not just in the matter of technology, but in the entire approach and the effect that we saw in the country,

19:46.040 --> 19:57.040
both in them having well established stable websites and also capacity both in the government and private sector and opportunity at the private sector,

19:57.040 --> 20:07.040
we realized that we can actually extend this, learn the points towards any government in the world.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.040
Any government in the world.

20:09.040 --> 20:12.040
And we're not just talking about the African ones.

20:12.040 --> 20:17.040
We're talking about the European ones as well and the most developed countries as well.

20:18.040 --> 20:30.040
And the principal, as you will see, are transversal are at the highest level, not necessarily touching the technology per se,

20:30.040 --> 20:36.040
although the technology has to be adequate in order to support the principles.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.040
So what the principles are?

20:39.040 --> 20:41.040
Of course, the websites have to be secure.

20:41.040 --> 20:47.040
Be on recognized, secure the frameworks.

20:47.040 --> 20:59.040
They have to be standardized and what we mean by standardization is the effect or the scale effect that is generated both in terms of economy,

20:59.040 --> 21:09.040
economy of scale, definitely when you're doing this approach you have much less costs than the traditional approach of actually each institution

21:09.040 --> 21:16.040
choosing their own technology and then running their own tender and hiring their own developers in order to do their own website,

21:16.040 --> 21:26.040
which afterwards get not maintained because the SLA contracts with the developers and or the technology gets obsolete

21:27.040 --> 21:30.040
and nobody is tracking it on the long run.

21:30.040 --> 21:48.040
So building a logic of standardization at the level of technology and also at the level of the method creates a tremendous effect direct economic in the cost of developing and running the websites.

21:49.040 --> 21:58.040
When you're applying proper methodologies for all the processes like security and performance and everything,

21:58.040 --> 22:11.040
you're actually getting a much higher, much better resilience and again and a much better cost because everything is at the level of the hosting strategy centralized in all in one place.

22:12.040 --> 22:28.040
Nowadays when we're talking with other countries about the standardization we're actually bringing to the discussion 12 points and I've actually pointed them out into this talk up until now,

22:29.040 --> 22:42.040
but we are in the moment into which definitely the next country which will adopt it with the support of international funders is already Somalia.

22:42.040 --> 22:52.040
There are several other countries which are in advanced state of discussions, Senegal, Gambia, Papua New Guinea.

22:53.040 --> 23:03.040
All understanding as of now the idea and the logic of having a structured approach.

23:03.040 --> 23:08.040
So it's not about let's do a website and then we'll see what we'll do next.

23:08.040 --> 23:20.040
It's about first making a plan, choosing what's right, building your capacity in terms of management and the development and touch all the points.

23:20.040 --> 23:32.040
From development to maintenance to upgrade updates, patching, integration, deployment, performance, security, disaster recovery, definitely technical support,

23:32.040 --> 23:39.040
technical project manager level of the authority of the country which is responsible or authorities if it is the case.

23:39.040 --> 23:49.040
Content migration if it is the case, sometimes it is, definitely from the older websites to the new one and the training and the boarding of editors.

23:49.040 --> 24:04.040
And what we're doing and we're very careful about and also to advise governments is that we need to establish from the start a proper method of onboarding and aligning all the institutions.

24:04.040 --> 24:09.040
It would be bad and very, very damaging for them.

24:09.040 --> 24:21.040
If one, let's say one minister out of 20 would say no we don't follow this thing because we have our own people, we know best and so on.

24:21.040 --> 24:27.040
It breaks all the logic of sustainability and that's the first thing that we're actually doing.

24:27.040 --> 24:37.040
So you see there are many, many layers aside from technology per se that needs to be taken care of.

24:37.040 --> 24:53.040
So right now one of the most important aspects into which we're dwelling initially in the initial discussions with governments is, okay, who is pro, who's against in your country for this type of model.

24:53.040 --> 25:11.040
If there are agencies, their directors and so on which are having a different opinion, they say, okay, how can we actually smoothen up the process so they can actually embrace this approach.

25:12.040 --> 25:26.040
So in the interest of time and because the most important point will be what we're doing next and what we're going to do next together.

25:26.040 --> 25:38.040
I will go, let's say faster through some websites related to the principles of the websites of the governments.

25:38.040 --> 25:45.040
But one point to make here is that it all relates to strategy and to the discourse that we have.

25:45.040 --> 25:57.040
So as I've mentioned earlier, it's about the value that we are creating and we realize that the value that we are creating is much more than the technological value.

25:58.040 --> 26:11.040
And the thing is that we are only showing what the value should be or could be and it's them, it's the local capacity, local institutions which are actually creating it.

26:11.040 --> 26:16.040
But to point out that several principles have to be followed.

26:17.040 --> 26:34.040
And when we are looking at these principles, the principles that you see on the screen are actually applying to any system, any digital asset of any government in the world or any institution in the world.

26:34.040 --> 26:45.040
And each of them should follow them and should prioritize them and then it should choose the methodology, the vendors, the technology in order to fulfill them.

26:45.040 --> 27:06.040
So this is the type of narrative that also to follow up on the OAN's presentation, we need to push in order to break from the vendors pressure of the technologies which have much higher budgets that we have.

27:07.040 --> 27:15.040
So it's not about only the technological effect, it's a lot to do about the social effect.

27:15.040 --> 27:35.040
And this is how we realize while not starting in 2018 with this idea but actually catching up with what we've managed to create, that a lot of what we are doing and a lot of what we will do is about the systemic societal effect.

27:35.040 --> 27:58.040
It's about empowering the local businesses, the local people to not only learn but to use that learning in order to access new jobs, to access new opportunities, to develop a capacity and an understanding to partner with each other and to support each other in order to be more competitive, both in their country and outside.

27:58.040 --> 28:14.040
And this is the first lesson that we realize that we've managed to do in Rwanda and this is the lesson that we want to push and we push in front of each government in that.

28:15.040 --> 28:41.040
And to all these very important points, the open source as a principle responds very well in terms of the digital sovereignty control over your systems, your data, independence from vendors, optimal life cycle costs, technical flexibility, stronger local business, new high value jobs for the local people.

28:41.040 --> 28:51.040
That is something that us as communities, as international communities around open source technologies should strive for to support.

28:52.040 --> 29:14.040
Although one point to make and the following remarks actually apply positively to all the members of our open websites alliance is that not all the open source projects are created alike.

29:15.040 --> 29:32.040
And we see a lot of discussion and backlash from the governments which are not understanding properly what kind of open source they should use and how they should prepare to use it.

29:33.040 --> 29:41.040
That they shown on or put a blame on the idea of open source itself as being a risky technology in principle.

29:42.040 --> 30:04.040
The right open source is an open source which is properly supported, maintained, developed with a continuous long term vision and approach and with a clear long term evolution path.

30:05.040 --> 30:23.040
That is super important and of course it has to have community or let's say availability of developers and companies that can support development of new projects in order to alleviate the risk for the vendor lock-in.

30:23.040 --> 30:45.040
What we have right now and what we are already using in different circumstances with various governments in the world is to put up their set of principles on to which they can easily already develop their strategy and their plan.

30:45.040 --> 30:56.040
And we are seeing by working with them right now how easy it became when everything is set up and everything makes sense, makes sense for them and makes sense on the long run.

30:56.040 --> 31:01.040
Standardization and planning is a definite need.

31:02.040 --> 31:17.040
Optimal technological architecture so that is not we are doing a website and then we'll see. That's not the way and we really and we have learned to be bold also when we are asked by a government to say let's do an experiment.

31:17.040 --> 31:19.040
No, it doesn't work.

31:19.040 --> 31:22.040
So experiments doesn't work, strategies do.

31:23.040 --> 31:34.040
You know you're creating ownership, you're creating the understanding, you're creating a commitment for a long term and then things might work.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.040
Right?

31:35.040 --> 31:45.040
So optimal technical architecture to hold complex installations, to hold multi-tenant deployments.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.040
That's a must.

31:47.040 --> 31:59.040
Strategies to support all the processes, not only the development itself, but everything that is related to it, to development and maintenance and so on.

31:59.040 --> 32:04.040
Don't keep the burden in the government.

32:04.040 --> 32:07.040
Share it with the private sector.

32:07.040 --> 32:25.040
Ultimately is the private sector is the startups is the freelancer is the developers that will be your partner as a government all over the place in all the world to build up to support to maintain the websites and in general.

32:25.040 --> 32:36.040
The application thinking the terms of life cycle things do change up websites as any other application needs to be upgraded.

32:36.040 --> 32:47.040
It needs to be changed needs to be re-implemented at some point for sure needs to be integrated needs to be extended and so on.

32:47.040 --> 32:51.040
You need to think at that all the time.

32:51.040 --> 33:03.040
And one important thing which we believe that already in Europe we have a bit of tradition in other places and for sure in Africa there is no such tradition is technical community.

33:03.040 --> 33:19.040
Technical local community that share an interest in the technology that shared understanding that supporting each other and working together makes sense for them and that are also having a mechanism of governance.

33:19.040 --> 33:34.040
Meaning that several or some people or at least somebody is able to bring the people together to foster this development of conversation and to support the discussion to move on.

33:34.040 --> 33:37.040
Out of this.

33:37.040 --> 33:44.040
Initial project and then the discussions that we had more and more with governments and with global.

33:44.040 --> 33:47.040
Global funding organizations.

33:48.040 --> 33:57.040
We found ourselves as matching with the logic and the strategy of a very important international project which is called golf.

33:57.040 --> 33:59.040
Govsteck or govsteck global.

33:59.040 --> 34:02.040
Probably some of you have heard about it.

34:02.040 --> 34:09.040
It was initiated by the International Telecommunion and German cooperation agency.

34:09.040 --> 34:35.040
And what it looks for is to develop specifications on essential areas of digital transformation of a country or of a government and to support that government with blueprint sandbox rules requirements and recommendation in order for them to be ready and to implement faster.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.040
Those type of.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.040
Of systems.

34:40.040 --> 34:48.040
So these building blocks are developed with the support of.

34:48.040 --> 34:51.040
People from various types of communities.

34:51.040 --> 34:54.040
Volunteers as well as personnel from it.

34:54.040 --> 35:03.040
And the least while it has started and you see already 12 building blocks which already reached a certain level of maturity.

35:03.040 --> 35:06.040
I would say most of them are quite mature already.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.040
And the least will expand.

35:08.040 --> 35:14.040
So you see for example we have a building block for identity which is the national system.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.040
Building blocks for.

35:17.040 --> 35:36.040
Gis for geographic information systems for all the country for signatures for workflows which is the support for the digital transformation or even automation of processes in between the institution or with the citizen and so on.

35:38.040 --> 35:42.040
And each of the building blocks has a certain structure.

35:42.040 --> 35:46.040
Of course with some aspects related to.

35:46.040 --> 35:50.040
Requirements other recommendations.

35:50.040 --> 35:53.040
Strategies for implementation.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.040
And so on.

35:55.040 --> 35:57.040
I won't go into details here but.

35:59.040 --> 36:04.040
The specifications of the building blocks which are already developed or let's say.

36:04.040 --> 36:09.040
Documented are present on the website of Gov stack.

36:09.040 --> 36:11.040
You can find them.

36:11.040 --> 36:16.040
It's they are organized in by using the book.

36:16.040 --> 36:19.040
They can be brought by anybody.

36:21.040 --> 36:26.040
What will happen very soon is an announcement of a new building block.

36:26.040 --> 36:32.040
The content management system building block which is aiming to become a specification.

36:32.040 --> 36:37.040
Including recommendations requirements.

36:37.040 --> 36:46.040
And support for the implementation of a national strategies for the websites of governments all over the world.

36:46.040 --> 36:50.040
Once this specification is actually developed.

36:50.040 --> 36:53.040
The big funders.

36:53.040 --> 37:02.040
I.T.U. and J.S.A. will support its implementation and will support actually the governments to pick it up and to use it.

37:02.040 --> 37:05.040
One important aspect here.

37:05.040 --> 37:13.040
Is that this specification is not strictly technology related.

37:13.040 --> 37:20.040
So while due to our activity our record and our relations with the donors.

37:20.040 --> 37:22.040
We will.

37:22.040 --> 37:25.040
Move do the first move.

37:25.040 --> 37:32.040
In order to support I.T.U. and the NG is that to set up this.

37:32.040 --> 37:35.040
Building block.

37:35.040 --> 37:40.040
Actually the team which will develop the specification hopefully.

37:40.040 --> 37:47.040
Some of them are here in this room and it's not about only the people from the type three community.

37:47.040 --> 37:56.040
It's about the people from Drupal from jumlah from WordPress and definitely from from other content management systems that.

37:56.040 --> 38:02.040
That are aligning with the principles that that we are discussing together in the.

38:02.040 --> 38:05.040
Open websites alliance.

38:05.040 --> 38:10.040
What we are looking to do together is to develop a set of.

38:10.040 --> 38:14.040
Specifications which actually touch those these points.

38:14.040 --> 38:20.040
So high level strategic requirements functional requirements technical requirements.

38:20.040 --> 38:25.040
Data structure, integrity and interoperability in terms of principles.

38:25.040 --> 38:36.040
So how things should work and we are not going to say okay Drupal is doing this type of trees doing that it is beyond the scope now of this specification.

38:36.040 --> 38:46.040
The specification needs to create the concept which needs to be followed or should be followed by any of the governments.

38:46.040 --> 39:02.040
So what we're looking for is to actually develop this team to set it up to work together with I.T.U. and the JZ to to formalize the building block working group.

39:02.040 --> 39:06.040
And then to create a set of.

39:06.040 --> 39:13.040
Of rules that would allow us to collaborate and of course to come with.

39:13.040 --> 39:24.040
A specification that we can then use in relation to all the governments very soon so thank you very much if there is time for question I don't know what Jim can tell me.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.040
Yes, couple questions.

39:26.040 --> 39:28.040
Anybody anybody please.

39:28.040 --> 39:31.040
Hi, thank you so much.

39:31.040 --> 39:35.040
I've been working in digital conservation for quite some time.

39:35.040 --> 39:43.040
And it tends to be driven by vendors vendors who buy the thing and all your problems themselves.

39:43.040 --> 39:47.040
And we've been saying for a very long time that the most important is to have a plan.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.040
So that's what you're doing.

39:49.040 --> 39:58.040
My question is what were the factors that enabled you to actually go in and say what we need to plan and this is going to make it work.

39:58.040 --> 40:03.040
What allowed to be the second environment to need for a strategic plan?

40:03.040 --> 40:08.040
All right, I will repeat the question for the audience online.

40:08.040 --> 40:20.040
How could we make a difference in putting strategy and planning first while the general approach is vendor driven projects?

40:20.040 --> 40:23.040
Well, the aspect was our principle.

40:23.040 --> 40:27.040
We are very, very adamant on respecting the logic of the flow.

40:27.040 --> 40:41.040
So we have the possibility to not agree with any government or with any donor because we are not linked to any contract.

40:41.040 --> 40:45.040
So we just say what we believe in and we did it.

40:45.040 --> 40:51.040
That's why we went four times in Rwanda because the first time it was not convincing enough.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.040
The second was not convincing enough.

40:53.040 --> 41:09.040
The fourth was, you know, but we said on the same thing and as one of our colleagues and supporters is saying, keep on saying the thing that makes sense until it will be understood.

41:09.040 --> 41:11.040
And that is what we're doing.

41:11.040 --> 41:15.040
So we have received recently the same point from another government.

41:15.040 --> 41:19.040
Let's do a website first and then we'll see.

41:19.040 --> 41:26.040
And no, we just don't do that until you're committed to do a proper plan.

41:26.040 --> 41:31.040
We're not we're not engaging.

41:31.040 --> 41:33.040
Very good question.

41:33.040 --> 41:35.040
Anyone else?

41:35.040 --> 41:36.040
Wonderful.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.040
Okay.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.040
Thank you, Daniel.

41:38.040 --> 41:39.040
Thank you so much.

41:39.040 --> 41:40.040
Thank you.
