00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
I would like to introduce our last two speakers of the day, last but not least.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
We've got Stephen and Mike.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Check.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Yes, there we go.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Hi.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Hi there.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
I'm Steve Jacobs.

00:19.000 --> 00:28.840
I am the director of the

00:28.840 --> 00:40.840
Open at RIT, though I have been doing teaching students and faculty and staff about open source since 2009 when we started making educational games for OLPC.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.840
This is my first thought stem.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.840
So thank you very much.

00:44.840 --> 00:49.840
And hi, I'm Mike Nolan.

00:49.840 --> 00:51.840
I'm the associate director of Open at RIT.

00:51.840 --> 00:55.840
I do not have a career tenure as long as Steve.

00:55.840 --> 01:05.840
But I have been doing open source for around a decade now across many different sectors and industry from the humanitarian aid sector and now working in academia.

01:05.840 --> 01:11.840
And today we want to talk to you about using science to build open source communities.

01:11.840 --> 01:19.840
So I'm sure if you've been sitting in the deaf room all day, you'll probably have noticed some themes around community building and different methods.

01:19.840 --> 01:37.840
And you'll probably see some of those themes in ours, but in particular what I'm interested in sort of conveying with this talk is how we use evidence based practices to really figure out what sort of things are necessary for building communities and various types of open work projects.

01:38.840 --> 01:52.840
So just as a quick note, you know, while Steve and I are up here, we have a long and storied history of hiring team members and students and very talented people to work on some of the things that we're going to talk about today.

01:52.840 --> 01:59.840
Two of those students are Django and Daechon who are fantastic designers.

01:59.840 --> 02:03.840
I think both of them might be looking for work, design work and open source.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.840
So if you're interested, please reach out.

02:06.840 --> 02:10.840
I'd be happy to connect to you with them. They're both amazing and talented.

02:10.840 --> 02:17.840
So before we get into the nitty gritty details, Steve, do you want to talk a little bit about who we are and what we do?

02:17.840 --> 02:18.840
Sure.

02:18.840 --> 02:24.840
So what is now open at RIT has its roots in the education program.

02:24.840 --> 02:31.840
We started in 2009 when we wanted students to make educational games for one laptop or child.

02:32.840 --> 02:47.840
That went from a seminar to a standard course to multiple courses and a co-op paid internship program that led to the only academic minor in free and open source software and free culture on the planet.

02:48.840 --> 03:06.840
We're our alums, number of folks like Justin Flory who is running the Fedora community these days, Remy Decausmaker who is the head of the first open source programs office in the federal government and center for Medicare and Medicaid.

03:06.840 --> 03:20.840
So we built things like Fedora badges. We laid the groundwork for the UNICEF venture teams, Roadmap and Milestone program for their fellowship people.

03:20.840 --> 03:32.840
So we've been around doing a lot of things. We've learned a lot from a lot of people including shout out Elizabeth Barron up there in the back who is the chaos community manager who God bless her everyone.

03:33.840 --> 03:50.840
And several years ago when universities started talking about having OSPOs within universities, we decided to spun one up with a second one in the U.S. anyway to be an open source programs office.

03:50.840 --> 03:59.840
Except we don't call ourselves that. We call ourselves an open programs office and we talk about the fact that we support all academic open work.

03:59.840 --> 04:09.840
We don't want to send the designers, the artists, the people who don't feel like they do programming or they do research or they do formal academia away.

04:09.840 --> 04:25.840
We want everybody to do open stuff and we're there to support them to do that. God bless the Alpha P Sloan Foundation as they gave us some funding because they came to us and said the stuff you used to do out externally for UNICEF,

04:25.840 --> 04:32.840
we want you to do for your own faculty members and that's what we're going to be talking about a lot today. Did I miss anything?

04:32.840 --> 04:36.840
If you want you can talk about the pillars of the services.

04:36.840 --> 04:46.840
Okay, so formal academic education for students. We run a list for faculty, students and staff to look at to learn more about open.

04:46.840 --> 05:00.840
We do policy work internally for the university. We just released a position paper on the reasons we feel that federal institutions should fund the peer review for open science.

05:00.840 --> 05:11.840
Since open science is being pushed by most of our governments to try to fix pieces of science that are broken or inaccessible and peer review is one of those.

05:11.840 --> 05:31.840
We do work and research into digital infrastructure for community building. I was one of the first Ford Foundation digital infrastructure fellows many years ago and what we looked at was community issues within Pi PI,

05:31.840 --> 05:43.840
and the first types of things that Dawn was talking about, her comments about knowing what your community is about, what you're doing, you can look up the research and the fully open qualitative research we did,

05:43.840 --> 05:54.840
which means that uncharacteristically the people we interviewed signed away their privacy rights and allowed us to use their names and their transcripts from their interviews.

05:54.840 --> 06:13.840
If you look up conceptual mismatches, you'll find access to all that data, but to go to Dawn's point, one of the things that Pi PI ran into was road blocking themselves when the culture of the program made the people who got hired to do outreach community managing onboarding

06:13.840 --> 06:28.840
and governance ended up feeling guilty because they weren't pushing code. So we do that kind of infrastructure and policy work, community building work, and we do this fellowship work which we pioneered for us anyway, working with UNICEF,

06:28.840 --> 06:37.840
extended to our own faculty with the Sloan Foundation support, and now do for anyone who would like to work with us.

06:37.840 --> 06:51.840
And so going into this fellowship work that we're talking about here, this is going to be the main subject of our services that we want to sort of be describing today because I think it's quite interesting for community building.

06:51.840 --> 07:06.840
This is the approach that we landed on. So to give a quick overview of what we mean when we say community building or fellowship, when we talk about people who were trying to provide services to,

07:06.840 --> 07:23.840
these people are maintainers of open work. I'm sure many people here might be maintainers of open software, others might be academics creating data sets, or people publishing journals and stuff like that of open work, right?

07:23.840 --> 07:38.840
And they come to us because they're really interested in either building a community around a piece of work that they built, maybe growing an existing community, making it more inclusive, or bringing in a new type of potential contributor or user,

07:39.840 --> 07:54.840
or maybe they're just super burnt out and they're like, this is an entirely unsustainable way of maintaining this piece of work and I want to figure out what I can do or what sort of things are needed to make this more feasible to maintain this work.

07:54.840 --> 08:12.840
And so, well, we have slowly built over the last, I don't know, 10 years of working with different clients is this process where we provide a team of developers, designers, and community managers to tackle this specific problem, right?

08:12.840 --> 08:26.840
Not necessarily making direct contributions to them, but to tackle this problem of figuring out these community issues, what they are, and what resources are needed to overcome that.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.840
And so, what does this team actually do?

08:31.840 --> 08:48.840
Well, we kind of act as maybe a project accelerator, which is a pretty common term, and you see startup accelerators do this where you have a directed resource specifically of figuring out what your market is and stuff and what you're going to do.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.840
We do this with projects.

08:51.840 --> 09:02.840
So, a project maintainer will come to us and we'll help them launch or convert a project being open or we'll help them grow it or maintain it so they don't have to burn out.

09:02.840 --> 09:06.840
And so, as I said earlier, we do this with all kinds of projects.

09:06.840 --> 09:21.840
We have this link all over our slides quite often, this open work definition, so we don't just work with open software maintainers, but open scientists, open data repositories, OERs, and many other things as well.

09:21.840 --> 09:30.840
And kind of like the smaller cases, but things that often happen is because we're based in a university, we've had faculty come to us for help.

09:30.840 --> 09:38.840
And I use this project stuff all the time. I have all these teaching materials. They need teaching materials. How do I contribute it back? I don't understand what to do.

09:38.840 --> 09:52.840
So, we've helped faculty do that and as a result, we've also kind of done an analysis of that project's contributor pipeline and said, you know, if you kind of smooth things out here and here, you probably get more people putting stuff in.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.840
So, it kind of works both ways. You don't have to be a maintainer.

09:56.840 --> 10:10.840
And so, before we get into like the services, I think it's good to understand the background of what existing kind of resources and knowledge bases that we're pulling upon when we think about how we're going to be building communities.

10:10.840 --> 10:33.840
And so, like a big one is like the Mozilla Open Leadership Training Series, which, you know, I can't speak for these communities, but from my perspective have really influenced programs by Code for Science and Society or the Turing Way or Open Life Sciences and many other sort of community building services are offered by other institutions.

10:34.840 --> 10:56.840
And this training series was like an amazing thing that was created probably a decade ago at this point that really set out the foundations of like how you think about contributors and, you know, Don was talking about the contributor ladder, right, which I think is kind of a good allegory to contributor personas and pathways that are talked about by Mozilla.

10:56.840 --> 11:10.840
We also pulled from concepts from like Nadia Eggball's book, working in public, thinking about taxonomizing communities and understanding, you know, different, you know, depending on the type of community may face different issues.

11:10.840 --> 11:17.840
We also use design thinking in our process of ideating and creating solutions and iteratively testing them.

11:18.840 --> 11:34.840
And then, you know, obviously, all of this came together in large part when we were working with the UNICEF Venture Fund doing sort of consulting with the various projects that they were funding to build open source communities.

11:34.840 --> 11:47.840
Some of this knowledge has been stored in UNICEF's own sort of open source inventory. It's kind of taken a different shape at this point, but I encourage you to check it out if you're interested in the approach that they're using right now.

11:47.840 --> 11:59.840
And this also back fills the undergraduate education we do. We, the degree, the minor courses are open to students all across campus, not just computing students.

11:59.840 --> 12:12.840
It's, you know, as everyone has said before, you know, contribution is docs, it's onboarding, it's graphics, it's websites, I think kids build logos for the projects that they want to contribute to as part of the course.

12:12.840 --> 12:28.840
And somewhere between roughly 40% of the class is learning how to do analysis based on the type of graphs that Don was showing, that, you know, what, you know, both for themselves, you're going to have to do contributions by the end of the semester.

12:28.840 --> 12:42.840
Does this look like something you want to try to contribute to? Are they responsive? Are they supportive? What do the flows look like, right? Does, when your projects are due by the end of the semester line up to a point when they're not really taking contributions?

12:42.840 --> 12:48.840
So is that a good thing, right? So they learn to apply all that stuff.

12:48.840 --> 13:03.840
So when we start working with a project, in particular with a first engagement with a project, I think it can be, we try to divide it into these three sections of objectives that we're trying to work with, with our client.

13:03.840 --> 13:16.840
The first is, you know, it's kind of slowly learning more and more about the project and more and more about the, you know, what's going on. And through that you can figure out like what are the actual specific things that need to be created.

13:16.840 --> 13:31.840
So, you know, first and foremost we have to understand, you know, what the project is, where its goals, like why did you create this, why is openness, you know, purportedly something that's important and useful to the project and like what do they hope to get out of that.

13:31.840 --> 13:45.840
You know, then we try to figure out who are the potential stakeholders and stuff and like how would they potentially get involved. And then like from that we begin working backwards and say, okay, well what are the actual roadblocks that people are encountering when they try to get involved.

13:45.840 --> 13:58.840
What are the things that are missing? So, you know, I think just to give a little bit of additional detail for each of these stages, I kind of want to like pose a few questions that we're oftentimes asking our clients when we're working with them.

13:58.840 --> 14:11.840
Right? Like, what are you actually trying to do? Like what's the point of this project and resource that you're creating? You know, why is open source the thing that's important to it? Is it about, you know, getting people from other areas that you traditionally don't work with?

14:11.840 --> 14:27.840
Is it, you know, about inclusivity? And then, you know, do you have a community or people currently contributing? And what ways are they contributing? Maybe you have some software contributors but you know, you don't have contributors from a different place.

14:27.840 --> 14:37.840
Or, you know, maybe you have a lot of non-technical people involved in a software project but you don't actually have a lot of technical people. You know, that's super common in things like humanitarian software, right?

14:38.840 --> 14:51.840
And then like, what sort of community are you trying to create? And then after that, you know, we, once we kind of understand the objectives of the project, then we can start trying to figure out who are the different archetypes of stakeholders.

14:51.840 --> 15:06.840
So in Mozilla or in the Turing way, they talk about contributor personas, right? So these archetypal sort of contributors, maybe in our project we might have like a persona that's like focused on researchers.

15:06.840 --> 15:18.840
But then you might have another type of contributor that's like maybe coming from the private sector or something like that. And these people each have their own incentives and sort of reasons for getting involved in ways of engaging with.

15:19.840 --> 15:32.840
Then, you know, we begin theorizing like what's the ideal way of getting involved and this creates the pathway or maybe something akin to the ladder, contributor ladder.

15:33.840 --> 16:01.840
And so the stuff gets applied no matter what type of project it is, right? So when we did 25 different academic projects over two years running people through this thing, we had everybody from computational astrophysicists to great vineyard DNA people to deaf educators working on early childhood

16:01.840 --> 16:19.840
and learning languages and teaching international sign languages to my favorite acronym of any project we've ever worked on, the Victorian Autobiographical Information Network or VANE so that they could share their data on Victorian autobiography that was much broader than what they could put in their book, right?

16:19.840 --> 16:26.840
So all of this stuff works no matter what corner of the universe they're coming from, right?

16:27.840 --> 16:37.840
And, you know, collecting all this information on the contributor types and how they get involved, this has meant to create like an idealized version of what you hope your community to be, right?

16:37.840 --> 16:42.840
Who are the people that you actually want to be involved and, you know, what is like the end goal?

16:42.840 --> 16:48.840
And then from this end goal, we begin, you know, documenting like where are these like shortcomings, right?

16:48.840 --> 16:53.840
Where are the things that might be missing or preventing people from getting involved?

16:53.840 --> 16:56.840
And this stuff can be, you know, pretty simple in the end, right?

16:56.840 --> 17:09.840
It can be things like project documentation that's maybe missing or a lack of marketing materials or like just no outreach in specific, you know, either geographic or online areas where people aren't finding things

17:09.840 --> 17:23.840
or a lack of governance that is preventing people from getting the stage of like being maybe a first time, you know, drive through contributor and getting them into a thing where they're maybe approaching something more akin to a leadership role, right?

17:23.840 --> 17:37.840
And so it's this like very specific process that regardless of the type of project that we really try to stick to because by going through this process we're gathering the evidence of what's actually needed and what the materials are.

17:37.840 --> 17:48.840
And, you know, it took us some time to get to this because there's a real tendency of just being like, well, you know, just like I just want to read me template that will make my community grow, right?

17:48.840 --> 17:50.840
Just give me the best practices, right?

17:50.840 --> 17:58.840
But, you know, oftentimes when you hear like people who do community building, they're like, well, yeah, like there's best practices for sure.

17:58.840 --> 18:02.840
Like, you know, make sure you have a license and a code of conduct. These are good.

18:02.840 --> 18:09.840
But the realities of what it takes to build a community is very specific to your community.

18:09.840 --> 18:19.840
And so what we've worked really hard on is trying to come up with like a specific process of finding out what that is so you can know for sure.

18:20.840 --> 18:31.840
And so to talk kind of about the maybe the scientific methodology that we're using, we think about our engagements, you know, in two different ways.

18:31.840 --> 18:36.840
The first is developing solutions, which is kind of what I've gone through here, right?

18:36.840 --> 18:46.840
And the way that we do this beyond just asking the maintainer these questions is we're conducting qualitative semi-structured interview studies with various types of, yeah, thank you, big words.

18:47.840 --> 18:51.840
I just got my masters, so, you know, what can I say?

18:51.840 --> 19:00.840
We conduct these qualitative semi-structured interview studies with people to generate evidence on what sort of interventions are needed.

19:00.840 --> 19:08.840
So we're like, you know, heavy touch in this case, because what we do is we find out like after coming up with all these personas and pathways,

19:08.840 --> 19:15.840
we talk to all these different people in the community that we feel like are representing each type.

19:15.840 --> 19:19.840
We talk to people who were really successful in getting involved.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.840
We try to talk to people who are unsuccessful in getting involved.

19:23.840 --> 19:31.840
And through these interviews, we're generating data of like legitimate evidence as to what has worked, what hasn't worked.

19:31.840 --> 19:40.840
And through that, we can begin trying to derive, you know, kind of potential solutions to these problems, right?

19:40.840 --> 19:47.840
So if we know that people keep on having trouble with like, yeah, but I couldn't get the project up and running on my own computer,

19:47.840 --> 19:49.840
so I just kind of like ditched it and I tried to use something else.

19:49.840 --> 19:54.840
Then you know for sure that this is something that is worth putting work into.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.840
And then once we develop these solutions, maybe we write some documentation, right?

19:58.840 --> 20:07.840
You deploy it and then you want to be able to see if it was effective and like if things have changed and if new problems have popped up.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.840
And with this is kind of the next stage after that, right?

20:12.840 --> 20:19.840
Where we have a preference of taking a more mixed methods approach that involve using more quantitative data.

20:19.840 --> 20:30.840
You know, Don, I think, did a really great job talking of some of the different ways that you can use various software from chaos to evaluate against these goals that you've developed in the first stage.

20:30.840 --> 20:39.840
As well as continuing to do qualitative and confirming your conclusions that you're generating from the data with community members.

20:39.840 --> 20:45.840
So following up and talking with people and showing them, you know, hey, like, it seems like, you know, the amount of contributors have gone up here.

20:45.840 --> 20:53.840
Like, you know, maybe the bus factor has lowered in seeing if there's like new problems coming up.

20:53.840 --> 21:04.840
And so, you know, I think it's important to note that like the interview work and this qualitative work that we do and our community building, it's very heavy touch.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.840
And it's like kind of expensive, right?

21:06.840 --> 21:17.840
You got to like have people going out and like, you know, doing half hour interviews with random people over and over and collecting all the data and doing the transcripting and then like doing the coding.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840
It takes a lot of work.

21:19.840 --> 21:30.840
But we find that it's really important because this work is often overshadowed and, you know, because this work is, it's often not thought about.

21:30.840 --> 21:39.840
And Steve, maybe this would be a good opportunity for you to talk about your research with conceptual mismatches and like what you were actually finding out.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.840
So, yeah, the conceptual mismatches effort.

21:43.840 --> 21:56.840
PyPI, the Python Packaging Index, had originally come to life as many open source projects do.

21:56.840 --> 22:07.840
Somebody had an itch, they have to scratch it, they built it, and it wasn't created for tens of thousands of people using it on a daily basis, right?

22:07.840 --> 22:12.840
So it needed to be re-scoped, re-architected, refactored, right? All those things, right?

22:12.840 --> 22:18.840
And they hit a wall. And they hit a wall even after they got funding to do that work.

22:18.840 --> 22:31.840
They hit a wall because of different perceptions of what being a community member, being a contributor, what the goals of the project were like, all those things.

22:31.840 --> 22:47.840
And so we did multiple rounds of interviews, and this is a process developed by Dr. Melchua, which she used on her PhD thesis originally,

22:47.840 --> 22:55.840
where a set of round robin interviews where we got X number of maintainers and X number of active community members

22:55.840 --> 23:02.840
to respond not only to a series of questions, but then respond to each other's answers, right?

23:02.840 --> 23:06.840
So we did three cycles and distilled all that down.

23:06.840 --> 23:12.840
And because they were willing, because they were open source people, yay, right?

23:12.840 --> 23:21.840
When you do a qualitative interview as a social scientist, generally it's just dead given that people never reveal who they are, right?

23:21.840 --> 23:26.840
Because often they might get fired if they trash their boss as part of this process, right?

23:26.840 --> 23:33.840
So you are like, never, never, never, never, supposed to actually out people or tie them to their work.

23:33.840 --> 23:42.840
And you have to go through an IRB and institutional research board where you prove that not only are you not electroshocking your students,

23:42.840 --> 23:44.840
but you are not revealing data.

23:44.840 --> 23:56.840
And we had to work with our IRB to create something and a process by which we had those folks not only sign off on the IRB paperwork,

23:56.840 --> 24:00.840
but give up their copyrights to the transcripts of their own interviews.

24:00.840 --> 24:09.840
We did let them review them first, but all that paperwork, all those forms, all that process is in the same repository as the report.

24:09.840 --> 24:17.840
So if you search on forward and critical digital infrastructure, you search on conceptual mismatches,

24:17.840 --> 24:21.840
if you will find a one-pager first, there will be a link to the repository.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.840
You can click down the repository and pull all that stuff out and reuse it.

24:24.840 --> 24:32.840
So if that kind of social science work is of interest to you and you want to try to convince your own powers that be that no one will go to jail

24:32.840 --> 24:36.840
or be sued if everybody signs off on this stuff, that's there for you.

24:36.840 --> 24:42.840
And as I highlighted briefly, there was so, you know, this happens, right?

24:42.840 --> 24:49.840
You have a core set of maintainers who are focused on how many lines of code go out a day, right?

24:49.840 --> 24:52.840
And did we hit refactoring this peep of the project by this time?

24:52.840 --> 25:00.840
And there was so much pressure there that people felt bad about doing their onboarding or their documenting or their other types of jobs,

25:00.840 --> 25:06.840
and that stuff fell behind, even that was funded as part of this big refactor, right?

25:06.840 --> 25:18.840
So culture and misperceptions about what our goals are and who we are and what we want to accomplish actually got in the way of doing what people wanted to do.

25:18.840 --> 25:25.840
So I'm going to breeze through this just so we have a little bit of time for Q&A at the end,

25:25.840 --> 25:32.840
but I thought it might help to give like a down-to-earth example of kind of a simple project that we worked with on a limited basis.

25:32.840 --> 25:38.840
So like one example is we worked with an RIT professor, Professor Rostojie.

25:38.840 --> 25:51.840
So she is a professor of computer science and she was working on developing datasets and investigating different ways that you can kind of potentially cause or ideally prevent.

25:51.840 --> 26:00.840
But issues around self-driving vehicles, getting into crashes and stuff due to harmful information in their datasets.

26:00.840 --> 26:13.840
So she's interested, obviously there's a lot of potential stakeholders that would be interested in this data and like how it can be distributed and a lot of other open source simulation systems that could use it.

26:13.840 --> 26:20.840
So we worked with her to develop specific personas of understanding like who these different types of stakeholders were, right?

26:20.840 --> 26:23.840
Because there are stakeholders in the private sector developing AV systems.

26:23.840 --> 26:30.840
There were other researchers who were interested in her work and might be able to continue generating further data.

26:30.840 --> 26:40.840
And then there were also kind of these like potential partner projects or like integrations with simulation systems, right?

26:40.840 --> 26:55.840
And so from there we kind of begin to try to understand like what were the goals of this project, which was a very early stage but potentially high impact project that could be integrated into all these different systems.

26:55.840 --> 27:02.840
And we found largely it was an issue of like discoverability and also understanding the open source aspect of this.

27:02.840 --> 27:18.840
So like for us, you know, through many of our interviews we realized that there's just, there wasn't a funnel from like finding the research to understanding that this is a project that can continually live and evolve and get contributions from other researchers and so on.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.840
So we needed to find a way to create a narrative around this.

27:21.840 --> 27:37.840
And like an obvious very easy first step to this was like developing a simple landing page website that describes the project, the research, you know, what are the main contribution asks, and then, you know, showcasing those different pathways of getting involved,

27:37.840 --> 27:45.840
which like oftentimes is just sort of linking to a well documented GitHub repository and examples of work, right?

27:45.840 --> 27:59.840
So we said, okay, well we're going to make a website and we went and we made a website and we like prototyped some copy and we got some review on it and we did the whole, you know, usual process of making a website and we deployed it and, you know, it was somewhat successful.

27:59.840 --> 28:13.840
I'm not going to go beyond this point because it was like a fairly limited engagement, but, you know, when thinking about applying this process, in particular if it's like a small project it can be quite a simple engagement, right?

28:13.840 --> 28:26.840
But, you know, when coming back to like what's the point of this engagement and like, you know, doing all this work to find out all this stuff is there's a few things, right?

28:26.840 --> 28:42.840
As a community becomes larger, developing that community becomes more complex because you have more stakeholders involved, you have more potential conflicts between those stakeholders, and more resources are needed to coordinate all that, right?

28:42.840 --> 28:51.840
And community development skills are not necessarily often found in like this peer to peer production of open work, right?

28:51.840 --> 29:02.840
So for our team we had like many designers and, you know, social scientists that like do this work and understand how to, you know, gather data from interviews and create this evidence.

29:03.840 --> 29:10.840
And, you know, Dr. Rastogi was super talented but not necessarily in these fields.

29:10.840 --> 29:22.840
And then, you know, finally if you want to justify growing, like allocating additional resources to growing your community, you need to have evidence to do that, right?

29:22.840 --> 29:31.840
Like in particular if you want to get funding for anything, like it's very, very difficult to just be like, and we're finding this now particularly in the private sector to say like,

29:31.840 --> 29:34.840
well, you know, we might go away if you don't give us money.

29:34.840 --> 29:39.840
We might go away if you do give us money but it's like less likely, right?

29:39.840 --> 29:50.840
I've spent the last four years of my life writing a lot of grants and I can promise you at least in those four years of experience has never worked once, although I've tried it a few times.

29:51.840 --> 30:02.840
So, you know, community development can get complex particularly as you migrate out of like a very simple governance structure into something that has like many different tiers and many different types of people involved.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.840
And this takes work to do, right?

30:05.840 --> 30:12.840
And that work requires these new skills, or maybe not new skills but like different types of skill sets involved.

30:12.840 --> 30:17.840
And that skill set is important for doing this work.

30:18.840 --> 30:33.840
And then finally, and what has certainly been probably one of the biggest points that has opened the eyes of a lot of people that we've worked with is, you know, if you want to like really get additional resources for your project, right?

30:33.840 --> 30:44.840
Particularly if you're like a burnt out maintainer or you feel like your project is like plateauing but you want to grow it and you know that it can but you just, you don't have what you need to do it.

30:44.840 --> 31:02.840
So, you know, getting the evidence to showcase what exactly is needed is one of the best tools that you have at your disposal for finding ways to like potentially fund this or just to, you know, give yourself the mind space to begin organizing around it, right?

31:02.840 --> 31:07.840
And then you can also get the data to be able to do that.

31:07.840 --> 31:12.840
And then you can also get the data to be able to do that.

31:12.840 --> 31:17.840
And then you can also get the data to be able to do that.

31:17.840 --> 31:22.840
And then you can also get the data to be able to do that.

31:22.840 --> 31:27.840
And then you can also get the data to be able to do that.

31:27.840 --> 31:32.840
And then, yeah, we have three minutes and 45 seconds left.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.840
So thank you and questions.

31:34.840 --> 31:36.840
Ask away.

31:36.840 --> 31:43.840
Any questions, folks?

31:43.840 --> 31:45.840
I'll bring it up on the mic.

31:45.840 --> 31:53.840
It's okay.

31:53.840 --> 32:00.840
So in across all of the projects that you've worked on, you do these personas.

32:00.840 --> 32:12.840
And I have to tell you that that is definitely a trigger word for me having worked in a number of companies where they would do personas and the people who ended up doing the personas knew absolutely nothing about.

32:12.840 --> 32:13.840
We do them right.

32:13.840 --> 32:14.840
So you're not trigger.

32:14.840 --> 32:23.840
My question is, have you looked at across all of these projects where people have done the personas and then later succeeded in the project?

32:23.840 --> 32:30.840
How far off the personas were at the beginning and did they evolve over time?

32:30.840 --> 32:31.840
Did they get closer?

32:31.840 --> 32:38.840
Can we get better at doing personas?

32:38.840 --> 32:40.840
Great question.

32:40.840 --> 32:45.840
There's a lot of bad persona.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.840
So I think part of it is coming from a design perspective.

32:49.840 --> 32:55.840
Personas are meant to be living documents that are kind of tested out.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.840
And they aren't just meant to be.

32:57.840 --> 33:00.840
It's like corporate values.

33:00.840 --> 33:06.840
A thing I hate, I hate corporate values because these arbitrary words like we're here for goodness and whatever.

33:06.840 --> 33:15.840
Personas can sometimes be that we're like, we have our customer persona and they like use our thing because they want to give us money because we're valuable.

33:15.840 --> 33:17.840
Like that's useless.

33:17.840 --> 33:22.840
With personas, what we're trying to find out is almost like documentation of our studies.

33:22.840 --> 33:23.840
Right.

33:23.840 --> 33:30.840
So we're we're trying to figure out like, who are the type of contributors that are useful to our community?

33:30.840 --> 33:32.840
And like, why do they want to contribute?

33:32.840 --> 33:36.840
And like, you know, what does that process look like?

33:36.840 --> 33:46.840
And so in terms of thinking about like, you know, we may make assumptions or collect, you know, invalid data about like who that person is and why they want to contribute.

33:46.840 --> 33:57.840
And so when thinking about our process, why there's these two stages of like developing solutions and then testing them, this is like where the evolution of a persona comes in.

33:57.840 --> 34:03.840
So, you know, we think our personas like are just having issues discovering us, right?

34:03.840 --> 34:06.840
So they're really interested and they have the time to contribute.

34:06.840 --> 34:10.840
And so we're going to like have a marketing campaign.

34:10.840 --> 34:19.840
But from from that campaign, we may find that they actually, you know, have another problem and then we can evolve that persona.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.840
So it's really meant to be kind of like documentation of that data.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.840
Sorry, I was wrong in the answer.

34:24.840 --> 34:29.840
I mean, I started as and still am a video game design professor.

34:29.840 --> 34:32.840
I've gone horribly wrong in so many ways.

34:32.840 --> 34:42.840
But what we tell our students straight up first thing, whatever it about ready to get to make a game is you're not your player.

34:42.840 --> 34:46.840
You think you're your player, but you're not your player.

34:46.840 --> 34:56.840
And so you need to figure out who your player really is just because they like the same game as you doesn't mean you're necessarily them.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.840
Any other questions?

34:59.840 --> 35:02.840
We want to go first.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.840
Well, thank you very much for our final talk of the day.

35:04.840 --> 35:09.840
Thank you so much.

35:09.840 --> 35:12.840
And thank you all for a great first FOSTA.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.840
Thank you.

35:14.840 --> 35:17.840
Thanks, folks. Thanks for sticking around.
