WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.600
We need to orbit the satellite back.

00:22.600 --> 00:28.800
So our next talk is a continuation on the theme of Libre Space.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.500
Now we are going to talk about the the the deployer.

00:32.500 --> 00:42.000
So please welcome Thanos.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
Hello everyone.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
So I'm Thanos.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.400
I'm also a core contributor at Libre Space.

00:46.400 --> 00:48.280
I'm a mechanical engineer too.

00:48.280 --> 00:52.560
And I will continue the talk of Vilias basically and that's some stuff about the

00:52.560 --> 00:57.320
satellite's final safe house, the deployer and specifically our own deployer, the pick-up

00:57.320 --> 00:58.960
bus.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.720
So some words about the deployer.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.220
What's a deployer?

01:02.220 --> 01:06.560
So now that our satellites are like the cubic small, you need to have a way to attach it

01:06.560 --> 01:07.560
to a rocket.

01:07.560 --> 01:14.560
Okay, so basically as mentioned before, we build a box, place all the satellites inside,

01:14.560 --> 01:17.240
mount the deployer on top of a rocket.

01:17.240 --> 01:20.040
Here you can see multiple deployers actually.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.640
And when the time comes, the rocket gives a signal to the deployer and says, okay,

01:23.640 --> 01:26.040
open your doors and deploy the satellite.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.560
That's what the deployer does.

01:28.560 --> 01:33.160
So how do you start designing a deployer actually?

01:33.160 --> 01:35.840
So that's a really tricky question.

01:35.840 --> 01:40.520
For us, we knew that we wanted to house 8P units.

01:40.520 --> 01:43.640
So 8 of the cubics, for example, that you can see.

01:43.640 --> 01:47.640
So I will do a quick walkthrough of the internals of the pick-up bus just to have a bit of context

01:47.640 --> 01:50.520
and then we will dive deeper inside the pick-up bus itself.

01:50.520 --> 01:53.360
So you start with a rail.

01:53.360 --> 01:55.000
You place all the satellites on the rail.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.160
Some way we will see how.

01:57.160 --> 02:03.080
Then you need to push the satellites outside with some kind of spring most of the times.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.120
And then you need all these things to be mounted on the rocket.

02:06.120 --> 02:10.040
So you put the flange there to be mounted on the rocket.

02:10.040 --> 02:14.960
After that, it's a best practice to close everything because space and also add some

02:14.960 --> 02:17.600
kind of door to keep the satellites inside.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.600
So now you have a box with satellites inside that can be pushed outside.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.440
But you also need a locking mechanism and deployment mechanism actually.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.200
So when the rocket gives the signal, the satellites do not stay inside.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.720
They go in orbit.

02:29.720 --> 02:32.640
So that's the final version of the pick-up bus, V1 actually.

02:32.640 --> 02:35.240
And these are the main components of it.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.800
Let's dive deeper now.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.520
So again, we start with a rail.

02:39.520 --> 02:46.480
That's one of the most basic parts, but one of the parts that actually restrict you because

02:46.480 --> 02:47.480
of the satellites.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.720
The interface of the satellites and the deployer too.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.760
So we have the pocket cube standard.

02:51.760 --> 02:56.200
This is the pocket cube standard actually that gives you the dimensions of a pocket cube

02:56.200 --> 02:58.880
and it's available everywhere around the pocket cube too.

02:58.880 --> 03:06.520
So satellite manufacturers can put side panels there, sometimes even deployable things, which

03:06.520 --> 03:09.320
is cool, which is the hot stereo you can see around.

03:09.320 --> 03:14.920
So for the pocket cube, there's a base plate down where the deployer actually interfaces

03:14.920 --> 03:17.800
with this base plate.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.160
So we manufactured the rail actually.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.360
So the rail, that's the top view of the rail.

03:22.360 --> 03:27.720
So you see here it has like a notch where the satellites slide inside and are held from

03:27.720 --> 03:29.560
the base plate.

03:29.560 --> 03:37.480
So for our specific rail, it was machined out of space grade aluminum, 7075 T6 alloy.

03:37.480 --> 03:43.400
It also was hard to analyze to give the surface as much strength as possible because satellites

03:43.400 --> 03:47.960
were sliding inside this two millimeter slot.

03:47.960 --> 03:51.040
So now, yeah, sorry.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.040
Yeah of course.

03:52.040 --> 03:56.960
So now we're moving to the PUSHER sub-assembly, which is what pushes the satellites outside.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.440
So this is a really early version actually.

04:00.440 --> 04:04.040
We actually try to follow the rapid prototyping procedure as much as possible.

04:04.040 --> 04:08.280
So we constantly 3D print parts, break parts, then redesign parts, and then 3D print again

04:08.280 --> 04:10.320
parts and then break them.

04:10.320 --> 04:14.960
So after much discussion, we opted to use constant force springs.

04:14.960 --> 04:15.960
This is really good.

04:15.960 --> 04:20.160
It's a good practice because you cannot just take a proper compression spring and just

04:20.160 --> 04:21.680
compress it all the way.

04:21.680 --> 04:25.040
So it gives a really big range actually.

04:25.040 --> 04:31.920
So with a really quick paper towel calculations, we got a rough estimate of the spring strength

04:31.920 --> 04:34.880
and also the satellite exit velocity, which is a really important number when you're

04:34.880 --> 04:36.800
building a deployer.

04:36.800 --> 04:41.800
So when we finished with the paper towel calculations, we actually machined by hand

04:41.800 --> 04:43.960
a dummy rail, as you can see there.

04:43.960 --> 04:49.360
We 3D printed PUSHERS and barrels and attached the spring to do some testing.

04:49.360 --> 04:54.920
So let's see the PUSHERS of assembly in action.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.520
That's our first prototype.

04:56.520 --> 04:58.640
And it seems to be working.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.560
Yeah, and they did the drop of the table.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.840
That was a really good one.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.680
So it worked.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.520
So we moved forward with this design actually.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.720
So again, you can see here the pick up us.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.520
You can see one side of the rail.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.680
So we have the same assembly mirrored.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.280
So we can house 4P on the one side and 4P on the other side.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.200
You can see the PUSHERS of assembly here.

05:21.200 --> 05:26.360
And you can actually see the machined part in the middle, the final rail with the PUSHERS

05:26.360 --> 05:28.800
that's now machined from PTFE material.

05:28.800 --> 05:29.800
It's not 3D printed.

05:29.800 --> 05:34.000
So the PUSHERS was made out of a single billet block of Teflon.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.400
That Teflon is a really great material because it's space great, which means it doesn't out

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400
gas.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.760
It can operate really good in volume.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.080
It also has a really, really small friction coefficient.

05:45.080 --> 05:49.120
So it slides amazingly with a hard-denodized aluminum.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.360
The second part was a barrel.

05:50.360 --> 05:54.920
It can be seen in the right side of the photo, which the course and force spring was wrapped

05:54.920 --> 05:55.920
around the barrel.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.760
And the spring was attached on the top of the rail.

05:58.760 --> 06:03.600
So in the right picture, you can see the PUSHERS that are in the top.

06:03.600 --> 06:08.360
That's the deployed state of the PECO bus deployer, actually.

06:08.360 --> 06:12.360
So moving on, we now go to the doors of assembly and the thermal knives mechanisms.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.000
So, okay, now we have the rail.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.320
We have the PUSHERS of assembly.

06:16.320 --> 06:19.360
We need to design the door, too.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.600
So you need two things.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.600
You need the mechanism to hold the door close.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.960
And you need the mechanism to open the door.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.400
That's the mechanical thing.

06:26.400 --> 06:32.960
You also need, from the electronic side, some way to attach the door and then cut it with

06:32.960 --> 06:34.600
a signal from the deployer.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.520
So we used this mechanism.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.800
These are early prototypes.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.480
So we used the pin puller mechanism with a compression string.

06:41.480 --> 06:46.840
And in order to hold the pin in place and actually secure the door closed, we used the

06:46.840 --> 06:47.840
enema string.

06:47.840 --> 06:52.400
And in order to cut the enema string so the door would open and the satellite would be

06:52.400 --> 06:54.680
deployed, we used thermal knives.

06:54.680 --> 06:59.800
Basically, a nigh-chrom wire which gets heated, cuts the enema string.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.720
The spring is decompressed.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.720
The pin is pulled.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.720
The door opens.

07:04.720 --> 07:07.640
So we did more prototyping.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.960
And we knew that we had to build electronics from scratch, of course.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.240
It was mandatory.

07:12.240 --> 07:17.200
So the PCB that we did would handle the communications with the rocket in order to receive the signal.

07:17.200 --> 07:21.320
We would also have the thermal knives attached to it and also the deployment switch.

07:21.320 --> 07:25.600
Of course, you need a way to see if the door actually opened.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.960
So yeah, we used two thermal knives because space and redundancy.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.600
And we also used two enema strings.

07:32.600 --> 07:36.160
So only one of the thermal knives needed to work for the deployment to happen.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.160
So you have two.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.160
It's a more redundant system.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.360
So that's the final door subassembly with the machine parts and everything.

07:44.360 --> 07:48.160
So you can see here the enema string is wrapped around like that.

07:48.160 --> 07:51.720
And the two thermal knives are here, one here and one here.

07:51.720 --> 07:55.600
So the two strings hold the pin inside.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.600
They get cut.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.920
The doors get released.

07:57.920 --> 07:59.920
So the door subassembly was complete, finally.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.560
It was ready to be integrated to the rest of the deployer.

08:03.560 --> 08:09.640
So behold, that's the deployer, the final deployer, the final pick-up bus.

08:09.640 --> 08:11.640
You can see here the wire harness.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.280
This is getting connected to the rocket.

08:13.280 --> 08:17.040
So when the signal is received, the door will open.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.960
So now let's see pick-up bus in action, actually.

08:20.960 --> 08:26.240
So this is the deployment test that we did.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.640
And you will see the thermal knives starting to glow.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
There they are.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.360
The pin will be pulled back.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.440
And then the door will open.

08:35.440 --> 08:37.240
And satellites will fly outside.

08:37.240 --> 08:40.360
In this specific case, these are dummy-mass satellites.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.360
They're not actual satellites.

08:41.360 --> 08:42.880
They're blocks of aluminum.

08:42.880 --> 08:48.360
But yeah, that's how it works, actually.

08:48.360 --> 09:00.360
And you can see the push-up assembly that now it reached the top there.

09:00.360 --> 09:05.680
So continuing now, I want to have some slides about the testing that we do and how do you

09:05.680 --> 09:07.760
space grade an assembly, actually.

09:07.760 --> 09:11.440
So one of the testing things that we do is called protoflight testing.

09:11.440 --> 09:15.200
Protoflight comes from two words, prototype and flight hardware.

09:15.200 --> 09:20.800
So when building pick-up bus, we had a really short period of time to do everything and

09:20.800 --> 09:22.360
build the two satellites that would be inside.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.640
So you had six months.

09:24.640 --> 09:29.400
So protoflight helps you with the time that you have developed really easily.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.960
So in this case, the qualification model, so the model that is tested and goes through

09:33.960 --> 09:37.400
the vibration and stuff, is the same as the flight hardware, actually.

09:37.400 --> 09:42.120
And the satellites were integrated inside pick-up bus when this protoflight campaign happened.

09:42.120 --> 09:49.320
So basically, you want to see if the DQT, the device under testing, will sustain the

09:49.320 --> 09:50.320
launch.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.840
Actually, launch is a really, really bad time for the deployer and the satellites.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.360
Huge vibration, huge accelerations, everyone.

09:56.360 --> 10:01.920
You really need to see and be sure that balls will not start flying around, pretty much.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.760
So the steps are the following.

10:03.760 --> 10:07.040
So step one, you do a resonance survey.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.680
What that means is you identify the eigenmodes of the system.

10:09.920 --> 10:16.440
Actually, you need to have, usually, the first resonance should be pretty high, at about

10:16.440 --> 10:18.600
100 to 150 hertz.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.560
But that depends on the launcher, actually.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.760
So you get these tables.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.160
You place the whole deployer into a machine, a vibration table.

10:26.160 --> 10:31.920
You vibrate it on all axes, and you get the resonance frequencies for each axis.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.840
Then you do a signed vibration profile.

10:33.840 --> 10:39.000
So this is where the bad things start to happen for the deployer.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.840
So you basically start punching the deployer with vibrations and the satellites inside

10:42.840 --> 10:45.920
and hope it survives and doesn't break.

10:45.920 --> 10:51.720
So you pass from five hertz to 125 hertz with a signed wave profile.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.640
That's really painful to watch.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.960
But what's even more painful is the random vibration, which is step three.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.480
That's the real heating.

10:58.480 --> 11:05.080
And you pass at the same time, the same machine, from 20 hertz up to 2 kilohertz.

11:05.080 --> 11:10.680
So that's the profile, and the deployer must sustain this.

11:10.680 --> 11:16.200
When random vibration finish and you are a bit relieved, OK, things seem to go OK, you

11:16.200 --> 11:17.840
took what's static testing.

11:17.840 --> 11:21.480
We simulate the static loads exerted on the deployed unique launch.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.160
Which again is painful to watch.

11:23.160 --> 11:27.600
But when everything is finished, you do again another resonance survey.

11:27.600 --> 11:34.200
So you add another table, basically, to there.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.560
So you have the post-serve resonance.

11:36.560 --> 11:43.560
So you need these values, the resonance before the testing and the resonance after, to be

11:43.560 --> 11:44.560
the same.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.240
If they're not the same, something happened.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.920
Something flew through, something broke.

11:49.920 --> 11:55.440
In our case, they were the same, actually.

11:55.440 --> 11:58.640
Some words now about our design simulation tools.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.480
So everything we do is open source.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.160
The tools we used to do.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.160
Our things are open source, too.

12:05.160 --> 12:08.880
So we use free cut to do all the modeling, everything.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.400
We also use free cut to do all the simulations.

12:11.400 --> 12:15.680
Before starting to hit your deployer in the vibration table, you need to do simulations.

12:15.680 --> 12:22.040
So we do a lot of model simulations to actually try and predict the eigen modes before sending

12:22.040 --> 12:24.560
the pick up bus to be hit in the vibration table.

12:24.560 --> 12:29.520
We also do static simulations because the deployer is bolted from the flange, and you

12:29.520 --> 12:32.000
have a lot of stress, stress is going around.

12:32.000 --> 12:38.560
We use calculus as a solver to do the vibration in free cut, and we also for the electronics,

12:38.560 --> 12:42.200
we use key cut to do everything.

12:42.200 --> 12:47.360
So as I mentioned before, the pick up bus was developed in a really short time.

12:47.360 --> 12:53.640
So now, eventually, we had a bit of time to develop the version two of the pick up bus.

12:53.640 --> 12:59.120
So by using the tools that we mentioned, we actually were able to do a lot of improvements

12:59.120 --> 13:02.400
that were obvious with the pick up bus we won.

13:02.400 --> 13:08.880
So the most, the improvement that mattered the most was the mass improvement that we

13:08.880 --> 13:09.880
did.

13:09.880 --> 13:14.440
So because it was designed in such a short notice, we had a lot of big safety factors,

13:14.440 --> 13:16.240
and we tried to do it really quickly.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.360
So now, we had more time to do simulations and more time to do design stuff.

13:20.360 --> 13:28.840
So by iterating the plates, we actually managed to cut the mass in half of the deployer.

13:28.840 --> 13:32.920
So right now, again, the capacity is the same.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.920
It can house up to eight satellites inside.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.760
It's almost half the mass of the pick up bus we won.

13:38.760 --> 13:44.360
It has a larger satellite envelope, which means you can fit more stuff around the satellite,

13:44.360 --> 13:46.480
but it has a smaller deployer envelope overall.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.880
It's a bit smaller deployer.

13:48.880 --> 13:53.560
And again, it has updated electronics because we found some minor issues, so we fixed them.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.800
So we did a really cool thing, again, with the isogrid patterns that you can see there.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.160
It's really space rated.

13:58.160 --> 14:04.080
So we had an aluminum frame this time, not just a plate.

14:04.080 --> 14:10.120
And we closed it with a huge PCB, an FR4 PCB, and polyamide tape, couple of tape, pretty

14:10.120 --> 14:11.120
much.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.960
So we closed it, and it was secured.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.480
We will see how that goes.

14:15.480 --> 14:20.600
We will start manufacturing the next months, and the expected loss of this is in the next

14:20.600 --> 14:23.000
few years.

14:23.000 --> 14:29.320
So before we leave, if you were watching about the pick up bus story, so pick up bus one

14:29.320 --> 14:36.200
was integrated, as Ilya mentioned in the previous talk, and it was launched, actually, but the

14:36.200 --> 14:39.720
launch, again, didn't go as planned.

14:39.720 --> 14:46.640
Yeah, it was a really sad thing to watch, but space, these things happened, explosion

14:46.640 --> 14:47.640
happened.

14:48.080 --> 14:52.000
So, but there was a plot twist.

14:52.000 --> 14:59.440
We received a phone call from the guys at Firefly, and they said, sometimes, we think

14:59.440 --> 15:01.760
we found your payload.

15:01.760 --> 15:09.360
We were like, what do you mean, it just blew up at 15 kilometers.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.760
You cannot do this, it's waste.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.760
What do you mean?

15:11.760 --> 15:14.040
No, no, no, we think we found your payload.

15:14.040 --> 15:22.200
We were like, yes, but so they found our payload.

15:22.200 --> 15:36.640
So that's the pick up bus that survived through a rocket explosion at 15 kilometers.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.520
And there's more.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.560
It was okay.

15:40.560 --> 15:47.560
We opened it, removed the satellites, they worked.

15:47.560 --> 15:52.120
It was, everything was so okay that we thought they didn't launch it.

15:52.120 --> 15:59.600
The only thing broken was this electronics cap and this poor capacitor.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
It was amazing.

16:00.600 --> 16:02.600
It was like, it didn't even work.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.360
Like it was great.

16:04.360 --> 16:09.840
And they actually sent us photos of the pick up bus mounted on a carbon fiber part from

16:09.840 --> 16:14.880
the payload bay, and we think that this huge carbon fiber part reduced the drag, and they

16:14.880 --> 16:17.040
found it in a beach.

16:17.040 --> 16:21.080
Mear van der Beek's Spaceport Base, when it was launched, it was like in the middle

16:21.080 --> 16:26.960
of the sand, two meters in front was sea, two meters from the back it was rocks.

16:26.960 --> 16:32.000
We have photos, but we cannot share them unfortunately, because they don't let us, but it looked

16:32.000 --> 16:36.400
pretty much like this.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.000
So yeah, pick up bus survived because space is hard.

16:40.000 --> 16:49.560
Pick up bus seemed to be harder though.

16:49.560 --> 16:55.160
I will close with this really cool video, which is the orbital pick up bus.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.720
This again is provided by Firefly.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.160
They had the camera on board.

16:58.160 --> 17:07.880
So let's just enjoy it for some seconds.

17:07.880 --> 17:10.200
Open source space, everyone.

17:10.200 --> 17:14.920
So unfortunately, because of the launcher they didn't have, as Ilias mentioned, they

17:14.920 --> 17:19.400
didn't have the doubt, they didn't download the open pick up bus.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.160
So that's what we get.

17:21.160 --> 17:25.360
Which by Firefly is great, like pick up bus.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.280
With the air.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.600
So yeah, that's it for me.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.080
Yeah, that was another deployer actually.

17:34.080 --> 17:39.480
So real funny, really quickly, when we were watching the stream, and there was a cut in

17:39.480 --> 17:43.480
the stream, and every day after that at the time said that they had confirmation that

17:43.480 --> 17:48.960
all three payloads were deployed successfully, and the stream came back and we saw this,

17:48.960 --> 17:49.960
and the door was closed.

17:49.960 --> 17:53.720
And we were like, no, come on.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.600
But yeah, after that, the Cubics worked and beaconed.

17:56.600 --> 18:00.040
So yeah, successful deployment, everyone.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.600
So I will keep that there.

18:02.600 --> 18:10.920
And I'm open to questions if you want.

18:10.920 --> 18:11.920
Thank you for the talk.

18:11.920 --> 18:17.560
Why is so much solid structure on the outside even required?

18:17.560 --> 18:20.840
So the question was why so much solid structure is required?

18:20.840 --> 18:24.240
So it's not really.

18:24.240 --> 18:30.640
In the pick up bus V2, you can see it's a more lightweight, but the pocket cubes are light.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.280
They're 250 grams, but when you have eight of them, it's a bunch of kilos.

18:34.280 --> 18:40.240
So when you place it in the rocket, acceleration, it's a really hard phenomenon.

18:40.240 --> 18:44.200
So you need actual structures to hold the rail in place so it doesn't move in place.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.640
It doesn't move everywhere.

18:45.640 --> 18:50.720
So the plates on the sides of the deployer actually held the rail in place.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.840
So you also need to sustain the vibrations too.

18:52.840 --> 18:57.160
So you need to have a bit of a mass to absorb these vibrations too.

18:57.160 --> 19:02.960
In the pick up bus V2 actually, instead of having a solid plane, we have two ribs.

19:02.960 --> 19:04.360
I can show you in the presentation.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.480
You can see it actually.

19:06.480 --> 19:13.120
We have the design is two ribs that secure the rail pretty much.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.600
So here is attached to the rail.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.880
So when you have the whole rail protruding out, you need to support it like that.

19:17.880 --> 19:21.240
So we did a lot of way saving by doing this.

19:21.240 --> 19:24.320
And you also need to have it separated from outside from everything else.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.600
So you need to have the deployer closed.

19:26.600 --> 19:29.760
So in case a satellite has a malfunction or it breaks or whatever,

19:29.760 --> 19:33.040
the deployer contains the satellite malfunction too.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.000
So you need to have it closed.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.400
Did I cover your question?

19:36.400 --> 19:37.960
Yeah, thank you.

19:37.960 --> 19:39.880
Thank you very much and congratulations.

19:39.880 --> 19:40.680
Oh, welcome.

19:40.680 --> 19:44.240
My question was in a eventually version three or version four,

19:44.240 --> 19:48.120
which you consider also having a communication bus to communicate with the

19:48.120 --> 19:52.520
satellite swatter inside the deployer for system checkouts, for example.

19:53.960 --> 19:59.000
So we don't know yet, to be honest, it would be a case.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.640
I don't know, we can ask the electronics guy.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.000
Have you ever thought about this?

20:03.000 --> 20:06.040
So yeah, maybe what it would be beneficial for

20:06.040 --> 20:10.840
the other version was to provide the chance of charging the satellites.

20:10.840 --> 20:15.560
So for the people that put the satellites inside, whether it's us or

20:15.560 --> 20:19.760
other people to have like a way to charge them after the integration,

20:19.760 --> 20:21.800
that would be an extra step too.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.560
About communicating with the satellites, I don't think so because I don't know,

20:24.560 --> 20:27.840
but I don't think so because when they are inside,

20:27.840 --> 20:31.040
there are key switches that are pressed.

20:31.040 --> 20:34.960
So the satellites do not start becoming or deploying or whatever.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.480
In the cubic, you can see the two switches on the bottom plate.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.080
So when they're inside, they completely shut down.

20:42.360 --> 20:44.360
Yeah.

20:44.360 --> 20:45.840
Yeah, here.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.520
Yeah.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.440
What kind of simulations did you perform?

20:49.440 --> 20:50.680
Raise your hand, I cannot see you, sorry.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.920
Yes, here.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.560
What kind of simulations did you perform and

20:54.560 --> 20:59.800
did those simulations inform further iterations of the design?

20:59.800 --> 21:01.960
Yeah, all they did.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.040
So much.

21:03.040 --> 21:07.200
Like we do static simulations to simulate the static loads and

21:07.200 --> 21:09.160
see if they can withstand these loads.

21:09.160 --> 21:12.440
And we also do the model simulations that I mentioned before because in order to

21:12.440 --> 21:16.160
do the vibration testing, we have to fly from Greece to Spain.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.640
So we need to be sure that, sure.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.880
We need to have a measure to see the eigenmos and stuff.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.640
So we do vibration testing and static simulations.

21:24.640 --> 21:28.440
So here it's a very good example because we did the through simulation,

21:28.440 --> 21:31.240
we reduced the mass actually of the part.

21:36.160 --> 21:36.760
Hi.

21:36.760 --> 21:42.040
In your test deployment video, when the door opened,

21:42.040 --> 21:44.800
there was a certain amount of bounce.

21:44.800 --> 21:48.240
So did you have to take precautions to try and make sure that the satellites didn't

21:48.240 --> 21:49.720
hit the door on the way out?

21:49.720 --> 21:55.000
Yeah, so the springs, in the door there is a hinge mechanism,

21:55.000 --> 21:59.120
so it has two torsional springs and are really, really strong.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.600
So the back glass is minimal.

22:01.600 --> 22:05.240
Now in the V2, we are thinking about adding a locking mechanism to it so

22:05.240 --> 22:06.760
the door doesn't bounce back.

22:06.760 --> 22:11.400
But it's not such a huge problem, to be honest, because even in the open position,

22:11.400 --> 22:15.880
the pick-up bus door has a bit of preload because of the torsional springs

22:15.880 --> 22:17.960
themselves, their legs are a bit angled.

22:17.960 --> 22:22.040
So even in the open position, there are like half a Newton meter of torque.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.160
So it stays there.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.520
Welcome.

22:25.520 --> 22:28.200
Yeah, there was a front question some here.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.200
But yeah, yeah, okay.

22:29.200 --> 22:31.320
Hi, thanks for the talk.

22:31.320 --> 22:36.360
Did you know why the door closed after the deployment?

22:36.360 --> 22:37.360
Oh, it didn't.

22:37.360 --> 22:38.360
No, it didn't.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.960
It was, it stayed open.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.240
You mean when it's torbid, correct?

22:43.240 --> 22:44.560
No, it stayed open.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.560
It didn't close.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.280
So why did it look like it was closed?

22:48.280 --> 22:54.520
Yeah, because the Firefly Stream was cut and we didn't have a footage of the door

22:54.520 --> 22:55.520
being opened.

22:55.800 --> 23:01.240
We only have footage of the door being closed before the satellites came outside the deployer.

23:01.240 --> 23:09.160
No, no, it stayed open, but we just don't have footage because the stream was cut from

23:09.160 --> 23:11.120
the rocket, the stream.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.920
They didn't download this specific part.

23:13.920 --> 23:14.920
Yeah.

23:14.920 --> 23:21.040
Do you, do you dump the vibrations in any way from the rocket through the pick-up

23:21.040 --> 23:23.480
bus into the satellites?

23:23.480 --> 23:25.880
As far as I know, no, we certainly don't.

23:25.880 --> 23:30.760
I don't know if there is any such mechanism in the payload bay of the rocket itself.

23:30.760 --> 23:33.480
But as far as I know, no, we certainly do not.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.480
We have time for one more question.

23:45.840 --> 23:47.280
Hi, thank you for the talk.

23:47.280 --> 23:50.160
I just wanted to ask what science did you do?

23:50.160 --> 23:54.120
Was this just proof of concept to show it would work?

23:54.120 --> 23:57.000
You mean for the deployer, I assume not the satellite itself.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.520
So, oh, sorry.

23:59.520 --> 24:00.520
What science?

24:00.520 --> 24:02.680
The deployer is pretty much a box.

24:02.680 --> 24:07.040
So it has one work to do, deploy the satellites outside.

24:07.040 --> 24:11.400
So there is the aspect of the proof of concept and the mechanical functionality of this thing.

24:11.400 --> 24:15.880
We managed to build it and make it the RL9, so it worked in space.

24:15.880 --> 24:22.240
So that was the goal, to have this kind of box work in space and deploy the satellites.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.600
But the science behind it, it doesn't have the experiment, maybe.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.880
You can say that the experiment was to deploy the satellites, actually, if you want.

24:28.880 --> 24:29.880
Yeah.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.200
Okay, thank you for very interesting talk.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.200
Thank you.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.200
Thank you.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.200
Thank you.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.200
Thank you.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.200
Thank you.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
Thank you.

24:38.200 --> 24:39.200
Thank you.

24:39.200 --> 24:40.200
Thank you.

24:40.200 --> 24:41.200
Thank you.
