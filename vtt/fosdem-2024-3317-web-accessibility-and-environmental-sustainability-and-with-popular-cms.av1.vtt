WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
Before we actually start, I just want to go off and quickly note the last two sessions

00:09.480 --> 00:14.640
being about AI and their rooms being packed, completely packed standing room only.

00:14.640 --> 00:19.000
We come down to a conversation about accessibility which is ultimately about humans, right?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.920
It's about us, all of us, right?

00:21.920 --> 00:27.880
And sustainability, which is the fucking planet we live on and the room is half full.

00:27.880 --> 00:33.160
So, you know, AI is an exciting thing at all, but really our priorities are a little bit

00:33.160 --> 00:36.200
at a skew here.

00:36.200 --> 00:40.600
This is not how the proportion should be about things that matter in our world.

00:40.600 --> 00:45.640
So I just want to add that little hint.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.200
No pressure.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.440
Exactly.

00:48.440 --> 00:49.680
Okay.

00:49.680 --> 00:54.560
So we can start, whether accessibility and environmental sustainability with popular

00:54.560 --> 00:56.520
CMS by Mike.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.520
Thank you very much.

00:57.760 --> 01:00.360
So thank you all for coming.

01:00.360 --> 01:05.160
So I wanted to give this talk because there's two issues I care a great deal about and I

01:05.160 --> 01:07.880
see there's a lot of overlap between them.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.000
On accessibility, we've made a lot of head roads.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.800
It's really nice to be able to see the kinds of changes that have happened in the last

01:13.800 --> 01:16.360
few years around digital accessibility.

01:16.360 --> 01:19.520
And we're only just starting to think about sustainability.

01:19.520 --> 01:24.080
And so I wanted to go off and have this session here so we can talk about them.

01:24.080 --> 01:27.120
The last two sessions had more technical information.

01:27.160 --> 01:28.920
I'm not going to show you any technical information.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.400
You will not see a terminal here.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.320
I'm here to talk about issues where there will be spaces and times to go off and to

01:34.320 --> 01:37.520
get into the terminal and to get into the technology.

01:37.520 --> 01:42.000
But generally I find that these kinds of presentations are not the best place for that.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.320
So first of all about me.

01:44.320 --> 01:48.000
Mike Gifford, a senior strategist at Civic Actions.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
I've been a Drupal developer for 18 years.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.040
I began working on accessibility in 2009.

01:55.040 --> 02:00.760
My assumption at that point was it wouldn't take me that long to go into, to fix the accessibility

02:00.760 --> 02:02.320
problems in Drupal.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.320
Just to let you know, we have not fixed all the accessibility problems in Drupal.

02:05.320 --> 02:08.320
This is a big problem, much bigger than I had thought.

02:08.320 --> 02:12.480
That said, Drupal is still one of the most accessible content management systems out

02:12.480 --> 02:13.480
there.

02:13.480 --> 02:17.000
I've also been involved in promoting open source for a long time.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.720
This isn't only my second time at FOSTIM, but I've been actively involved in promoting

02:21.720 --> 02:26.280
open source now for at least 20 years.

02:26.280 --> 02:31.120
And happy to be able to do this full time with Civic Actions now.

02:31.120 --> 02:36.120
And yeah, I've been able to focus more on accessibility and sustainability here at Civic

02:36.120 --> 02:42.640
Actions because I don't have to worry about HR and planning and all of that sort of stuff.

02:42.640 --> 02:48.120
So I've got deep roots in the Drupal community and that's just one CMS that people here are

02:48.120 --> 02:49.120
using.

02:49.120 --> 02:53.600
We also had a good experience in two years ago with FUNCA, which is an accessibility

02:53.600 --> 02:55.240
group in Sweden.

02:55.240 --> 03:03.800
And with them, what we tried to do was to build a, a cross CMS study of the offering

03:03.800 --> 03:04.800
environment.

03:04.800 --> 03:08.800
How do we try and make sure that offering tools are built to have accessibility built,

03:08.800 --> 03:13.800
how do we try and support authors to create more accessible content?

03:13.800 --> 03:16.280
How do we, we structure that?

03:16.280 --> 03:20.920
And how do we, if we can, looking at the European Accessibility Act and the Web Accessibility

03:20.920 --> 03:25.160
Directive, realizing the huge challenge that was facing the European Union to try and meet

03:25.160 --> 03:31.720
these particular accessibility goals, there was an effort by FUNCA to, to actually try

03:31.720 --> 03:37.760
and bring people together and to set some best practices for supporting authors and actually

03:37.760 --> 03:42.760
to do usability studies with authors to find out what, what we were doing.

03:42.760 --> 03:48.760
And I think it's actually the first, probably the only study using, looking at authors and

03:48.760 --> 03:53.360
engaging authors to say, how do we support authors in producing accessible content?

03:53.360 --> 03:58.600
And that's, that's strange given how many, how many, how much, how many billions of

03:58.600 --> 04:03.200
dollars are spent every year on accessibility and how little money is actually spent on fixing

04:03.200 --> 04:07.640
the problems upstream, either in open source projects like Drupal or supporting the authors

04:07.640 --> 04:10.940
who are creating most of the accessibility issues right now.

04:10.940 --> 04:15.060
So it's, it's an interesting challenge, but that was funded by the European Commission

04:15.060 --> 04:19.620
and it was a great project to be part of and allowed, allowed me to engage with people

04:19.620 --> 04:23.020
with, with PLONE and Type of, was Type of 3 there?

04:23.020 --> 04:29.180
No, Type of 3 was not, but JUMMA was, Umbreco, and again to see that the collaboration through,

04:29.180 --> 04:33.820
through different open source content management systems and some non-open source content management

04:33.820 --> 04:35.900
systems as well.

04:35.900 --> 04:40.660
I do think that a similar process should be happening with web sustainability, partly

04:40.660 --> 04:44.580
because we, we are in a climate crisis.

04:44.580 --> 04:47.180
This is something that we need to act on, all of us.

04:47.180 --> 04:53.300
It has to be something that we're thinking about the, the, how we're managing our, our

04:53.300 --> 04:57.540
technology because although we talk about the cloud, you know, all of the stuff has

04:57.540 --> 04:58.820
real world impacts.

04:58.820 --> 05:03.740
We do have to, to realize that there are, there are atoms, all, atoms behind all of the bits

05:03.740 --> 05:05.260
that we are driving.

05:05.260 --> 05:09.660
And unless we're starting to be more conscious about that, we're not going to be able to

05:10.660 --> 05:16.140
to, to have, we're going to continue to, to exponentially grow the, the, the, our sector,

05:16.140 --> 05:20.660
which will have a lot of environmentally negative consequences.

05:20.660 --> 05:26.900
So I wanted to touch on a couple different platforms, CMSs, and, and what they're doing

05:26.900 --> 05:28.900
around sustainability.

05:28.900 --> 05:33.460
Because this is something that, that I think every, every open source project should do,

05:33.460 --> 05:36.380
not just a matter of the ones that are, are, are content management systems.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.620
I'm only really familiar with the content management system world, because that's the

05:39.620 --> 05:41.900
world that I've been living in.

05:41.900 --> 05:46.780
But, you know, so for Drupal, we have, have a page that is talking about accessibility,

05:46.780 --> 05:48.260
about sustainability.

05:48.260 --> 05:52.100
It is really important to have something on, on, on project websites to say that this is

05:52.100 --> 05:53.460
something that matters to our community.

05:53.460 --> 05:55.460
This is a value of our community.

05:55.460 --> 06:00.540
You know, I've been writing about it and talking about it since 2016.

06:00.540 --> 06:04.180
But again, this is something that, that we need to see this information.

06:04.180 --> 06:08.580
If you don't hear it, reinforce it, and see that action that's happening, people are,

06:08.580 --> 06:13.220
are going to, people aren't necessarily sure how to plug in or how their actions today

06:13.220 --> 06:16.860
affect the sustainability in the future.

06:16.860 --> 06:20.180
There's a Drupal Slack channel on sustainability.

06:20.180 --> 06:24.500
There's also a sustainability statement that is up on the Drupal.org website.

06:24.500 --> 06:27.940
Again, it's not a very bold one, but it's something that, that is a start.

06:27.940 --> 06:30.860
It's a starting point for us to go off and say, this is something that matters for the

06:30.860 --> 06:33.460
Drupal community.

06:33.740 --> 06:37.900
And people need to have that, that starting point to go off and say, how do we, how do

06:37.900 --> 06:42.700
we try and, and get involved, take the next step, realize that our community is having

06:42.700 --> 06:45.540
an impact, both positive and negative in the world.

06:45.540 --> 06:51.340
So I'm trying to, to own as much as we can that responsibility around that.

06:51.340 --> 06:53.540
Is there any WordPress people here?

06:53.540 --> 06:55.140
Excellent.

06:55.140 --> 06:58.060
I like the WordPress sustainability folks.

06:58.060 --> 07:00.540
Like I like what is being done in that space.

07:00.540 --> 07:01.700
They've got a strong community.

07:01.740 --> 07:07.820
There's a lot of sustainability people who are engaged in, in both the Slack channel

07:07.820 --> 07:13.420
as well as in, in, in broader thought leadership, whether it's Tim Frick with Mighty Bites in

07:13.420 --> 07:18.580
Chicago or Tom Greenwood in, with Whole Green Digital in London.

07:18.580 --> 07:22.460
There's some great, great people in the WordPress space that are pushing sustainability and

07:22.460 --> 07:25.620
helping people engage with it.

07:25.620 --> 07:30.140
So, so yeah, there's, they've got a WordPress initiative and they meet as WordPress does

07:30.180 --> 07:35.980
them on a regular basis through the, the Slack channel and engage on issues that are important

07:35.980 --> 07:42.420
to try and help, help WordPress users go and, and make, make building sustainable websites

07:42.420 --> 07:46.420
more easier for everyone to go off and do.

07:46.420 --> 07:50.580
How much would it matter if WordPress were to go off and reduce its energy efficiency

07:50.580 --> 07:56.100
by 20% if they were able to reduce that by 20% I mean, that's, that's probably like,

07:56.100 --> 07:59.100
I don't know, I mean, like, they're 60% of the web, right?

07:59.140 --> 08:01.140
So how much energy is that?

08:01.140 --> 08:04.740
It's, it's, it would be significant if we could go off and reduce that demand side and,

08:04.740 --> 08:08.900
and think about the data centers, the impact on, on like the, the trickle-on effects to

08:08.900 --> 08:15.580
having 6% of the web be 20% smaller, would be enormous, 20% faster.

08:15.580 --> 08:20.580
If we could think about how, how we're, we're prioritizing our, our structure.

08:20.580 --> 08:25.380
Waitail, another really interesting CMS is doing some great stuff.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.380
Anybody from Waitail?

08:27.660 --> 08:30.660
Okay. So excellent, excellent.

08:30.660 --> 08:35.460
So, I, I think that, that of all the CMS out there,

08:35.460 --> 08:40.660
Waitail is doing the most to try and, and calculate what their impact is.

08:40.660 --> 08:45.260
There's a whole phrase that you've got to, if you don't measure it, it doesn't matter, right?

08:45.260 --> 08:55.260
And so, being able to say, you know, Waitail accounts for 8,240 tons of CO2 per year.

08:55.260 --> 09:00.260
And that's going to grow over year after year, I hope, because we want the Waitail community to go off and grow.

09:00.260 --> 09:06.260
But that's, that's still like 8,000 tons of carbon per year that Waitail's producing.

09:06.260 --> 09:14.260
And, I mean, we hope that the sites are doing good things, but ultimately, it's, it's a,

09:14.260 --> 09:16.260
if they weren't using work, Waitail, they'd be using something else.

09:16.260 --> 09:20.260
And it's so good to go, go off and start measuring this information.

09:20.260 --> 09:24.260
So, yeah, and then they've got good documentation.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.260
There's a, there's a roadmap in place.

09:26.260 --> 09:37.260
It's lovely to go off and, and see that there is, is, is support for authors so that authors again can have the support that they need to go off and, and to create more sustainable products.

09:37.260 --> 09:39.260
To have built in aid of support.

09:39.260 --> 09:44.260
Like, you know, this is something like, it's just the defaults that matter, right?

09:44.260 --> 09:47.260
Because, because authors are, authors are lazy.

09:47.260 --> 09:48.260
Developers are lazy.

09:48.260 --> 09:49.260
People are lazy.

09:49.260 --> 09:51.260
We want to do what is there by default.

09:51.260 --> 09:58.260
If you, if you, if you have the outcome, if whatever the outcome is, if it's the default, it's more likely to be the case.

09:58.260 --> 10:08.260
If you have to, if you have to do something else, if you have to go that extra step to do something, then most people aren't going to bother because they have the time to do the default, if that.

10:08.260 --> 10:18.260
And so, let, you know, let's, taking that effort as, as creators of tools to go off and to, to, to implement that as a default is really important.

10:18.260 --> 10:24.260
And that's something that we've done in, in Drupal for accessibility and something that, that, that has worked quite well for our community.

10:24.260 --> 10:28.260
So we definitely encourage that for both sustainability and accessibility.

10:28.260 --> 10:37.260
So how many people here are familiar with WCAG, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines?

10:37.260 --> 10:40.260
Has anyone read it from end to end?

10:40.260 --> 10:42.260
Okay, we've got two people, three people.

10:42.260 --> 10:45.260
It's like it's, it's the most boring document.

10:45.260 --> 10:50.260
It's, it's written by committee, oh my gosh, is it ever a dreadful document?

10:50.260 --> 10:52.260
Because it was written by committee.

10:52.260 --> 10:57.260
How many people here have read the Web Sustainability Guidelines?

10:57.260 --> 11:01.260
Less, because it's a, it's a much newer document.

11:01.260 --> 11:07.260
This is something that only was released in September at the, the WC3 forum.

11:08.260 --> 11:16.260
But, but yeah, the, the, the, the Web Sustainability Guidelines have been written for, for, for it to be human consumable.

11:16.260 --> 11:25.260
And it's, it's written for the, the WCAG structure and framework, because we ultimately want to create a standard that governments and other organizations can sign on to and say,

11:25.260 --> 11:30.260
our organization is going to embrace these best practices for sustainability.

11:30.260 --> 11:40.260
And we want to go off and to, to measure ourselves against these criteria so that we can, we can put that stamp of approval that says we are meeting these best practices.

11:40.260 --> 11:49.260
So, from an accessibility point of view, the, the principles are, is it perceivable, operable, understandable and robust?

11:49.260 --> 11:59.260
And, okay, those are fairly generic concepts, but they've been broken down and explained enough times that many people understand how that's, how that's structured.

11:59.260 --> 12:03.260
Is it written in the most usable or most easy, easy language?

12:03.260 --> 12:07.260
We'll know, but, but it's, it's a, it's a fairly useful set of structures.

12:07.260 --> 12:21.260
The Web Sustainability Guidelines are based on, on the Sustainable Web Manifesto and the principles there are to be clean, to be efficient, to be open, to be honest, to be regenerative and be resilient.

12:21.260 --> 12:33.260
So, again, those are broad, broad goals that are, I think, help the, help us try and understand where, where those are of the North Stars in terms of where, where digital products should be going.

12:33.260 --> 12:47.260
I did, because this is an open source event, want to go off and highlight that, that open right now in the Web Manifesto is, is structured as products and services that provide, that are willing to be accessible, sites to allow for open exchange of information

12:47.260 --> 13:02.260
and allow users to control their data. So, that's not quite the same definition used by the OSI or the GNU Foundations or others, but it's a, it's a starting point and hopefully as more people jump on board and if our community is able to embrace this,

13:02.260 --> 13:12.260
I'm hoping that, that the manifesto may be able to be modified so that there's actually stronger language about supporting open source because we need to be able to collaborate with each other.

13:12.260 --> 13:20.260
We need to learn from each other's best practices and we need to use the innovative abilities of open source to be able to make change, the changes that we need faster.

13:20.260 --> 13:26.260
We don't have the time to go off and, for all of us to go off and, and to make the same mistakes over and over again.

13:26.260 --> 13:37.260
We need to be able to quickly find out what works, share that, those, those ideas and experiences about what works around sustainability with others in our community and with other communities, right?

13:37.260 --> 13:45.260
We need to learn and test our ideas. We need to be evidence driven, not something that is based on, well my community thinks this and your community thinks that.

13:45.260 --> 13:50.260
It's like, no, let's get out and, and find evidence to be able to determine what is the best approach.

13:50.260 --> 13:58.260
I would love to be able to have the numbers that Wagtail has for Drupal to be able to say, we think this is the CO2 impact for, for Drupal.

13:58.260 --> 14:04.260
It would be much bigger than Wagtail. Likewise with WordPress, it would be much bigger than Drupals.

14:04.260 --> 14:21.260
But to have those numbers would be useful to go off and say, this is actually what our community is responsible for and why removing this megabyte or this, this, this byte of data is important because it's this byte of data is being used on, you know, we know this,

14:21.260 --> 14:26.260
but with this byte of data is being loaded and transferred across websites, you know, a billion times a day.

14:26.260 --> 14:35.260
Like that's huge when you're trying to, when you're thinking about the load times, like it's a millisecond. What does it matter? On your side, it matters nothing.

14:35.260 --> 14:48.260
But when you're scaling it up to a global level and it's being replicated, you know, a million times like it is in the Drupal condition, that millisecond matters because that's, I'm not going to do the math, but it's, you know, still quite a few seconds.

14:49.260 --> 15:04.260
Any questions about, about both web sustainability guidelines or the web accessibility guidelines? No, any other CMSs, any sort of opportunity to jump in, contradict me, tell me what I've missed so far?

15:05.260 --> 15:09.260
How far are they from being official standard?

15:09.260 --> 15:17.260
So how far is the, the, the web standards, web sustainability guidelines from becoming an official WC3 standard? And thank you.

15:17.260 --> 15:29.260
So there's right now a community group that set up and created the draft to people, basically, Alexander and Tim went off and did most of the work to try and create this draft.

15:29.260 --> 15:36.260
And it's, it's really quite good and quite readable. But that's not how any other WC3 specifications being done.

15:36.260 --> 15:41.260
So, so right now it's a good enough document for people to start punching at.

15:41.260 --> 15:46.260
But we need to both set up a sustainability guidelines working group. We're in the process of doing that.

15:46.260 --> 15:54.260
So creating a charter to go and, and to create that, the oversight, invite more people into that, that working group.

15:54.260 --> 16:01.260
Once the working group has a charter, and then there's the long process of going off and, and getting an adoption for that.

16:01.260 --> 16:11.260
And then as soon as we have two use cases, so if the, the UK government and the US government say, yes, we're going to endorse this, this is the direction we see going ahead,

16:11.260 --> 16:17.260
or it doesn't have to be the US, could be, you know, there's the French government and the UK government decide that this is a useful,

16:17.260 --> 16:24.260
and then, then there's a, there's two implementations of this guideline and then basically the WC3 can make that a recommendation.

16:24.260 --> 16:32.260
But that's, that's the path forward for this and it is like so many community organizing efforts, a bit of a sausage making factory.

16:32.260 --> 16:39.260
So it's, it's great to have people involved and would love to have people check to be, to be involved in the web sustainability guidelines

16:39.260 --> 16:45.260
and to help sort of champion the formation of this because it is really important to have, have documents that are understandable

16:45.260 --> 16:52.260
and that are executable, that we have passed ahead to go off and implement those.

16:52.260 --> 16:58.260
So wanted to highlight some other, some other innovations from the web sustainability guidelines.

16:58.260 --> 17:07.260
One is, there's a real effort to try and be usable. So there, there, there's the WC3 document and many people who've, who've looked at other WC3 documents,

17:07.260 --> 17:15.260
whether it's on HTML or CSS or whatnot, you see that structure and your eyes start to go, go, get weary and you close them and whatnot.

17:15.260 --> 17:23.260
Well, the, the, the committee's gone and built a JSON file for the WC3 standard.

17:23.260 --> 17:33.260
So it's available both in the JSON format and the WC3 standard format and also in the web sustainability, web, sorry, web sustainability.

17:34.260 --> 17:41.260
Web, I'm blanking on the name of the, of the, the website, the web sustainability guidelines.org. Is that right? No, that's not quite right.

17:41.260 --> 17:46.260
I guess web sustainability.org. I should have it here in my notes and I do not.

17:46.260 --> 17:54.260
But there, it's available in, in, in three different formats. I wonder which is designed to be more human readable and, and, and a shareable reference.

17:55.260 --> 18:10.260
We've also structured around different elements. So there's, there's, there's structured around, around user experience design, on web development, on hosting and infrastructure, as well as on, on business strategy and product hosting.

18:10.260 --> 18:23.260
So thinking this, think about this as holistically as possible. There are some elements of the web sustainability guidelines that do touch on, on, on issues of accessibility because if people are, are not able to go off and access your services and they're trying to net, net,

18:23.260 --> 18:35.260
to navigate around to go off and access the, your, your content, that's something that, that is, is going to be a performance issue. It's going to be something where it's going to cost CPU cycles because you're, you're constantly trying to go up and access this.

18:35.260 --> 18:44.260
Also, it's, it's, you know, I think a lot of people have, have looked at the, the, the data centers and, and the hosting environment is one piece of it.

18:44.260 --> 18:51.260
But actually if you look at the, the overall energy component, the hosting piece is just, it's actually a small part of the puzzle.

18:51.260 --> 19:02.260
You know, most hosting companies are very aware of the, the cost of electricity and are doing their, their effort to, to minimize that cost so that they can increase their revenues.

19:02.260 --> 19:11.260
The real, from an electricity and, and, and CO2 perspective, there's a lot more work coming from, from, from our own devices, right?

19:11.260 --> 19:17.260
Like we plug in our devices, we maintain our devices. There's also elements of, of embedded energy.

19:17.260 --> 19:23.260
So, you know, I don't know how much CO2 is involved to go off and create this iPhone. It's not an iPhone, this, this Samsung phone.

19:23.260 --> 19:34.260
But, but there's, but looking at that embedded energy and the energy that it's going to take throughout the whole life cycle, life, life cycle of the product is something that we need to be starting to think about.

19:35.260 --> 19:47.260
So I mentioned that JSON file is, is a part of the innovation. They've, they've also, the WCAG format doesn't really structure the, the, the, the impact of the level of effort.

19:47.260 --> 19:53.260
But it's nice to see that, that the web sustainability guidelines have tried to go off and to, to pull those apart.

19:53.260 --> 19:59.260
So you can get a sense of what is the, what is the easiest thing for me to do that will have the, the biggest bang for the buck, right?

19:59.260 --> 20:08.260
If you can, you can highlight and structure your information around that ROI, then that's something that you can more easily scale up and, and know how to go off and invest your efforts.

20:08.260 --> 20:18.260
Because we need to be able to, to get people starting on this. There's a lot of, if you give people a checklist of 100,000 things that they need to change to the website, like, yeah, good luck.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.260
Maybe they'll hit the right ones. Maybe they'll just ignore it and walk away, right?

20:21.260 --> 20:28.260
But if you can say, here's the top issue right now that you can address. This is how you can start now having to have a bigger impact in your, in your, in your work.

20:28.260 --> 20:32.260
Then, then that can motivate people to get started and to say that they can actually make a difference.

20:32.260 --> 20:39.260
Because nobody wants to, to take on a wall of errors and, and to take, add that to their existing issue queue.

20:39.260 --> 20:49.260
Yeah. So, so I'm a big fan of automated tests. How many, how many other people here like automated tests?

20:50.260 --> 20:54.260
Get the machines to do it. You know, and, you know, there's good reason for that.

20:54.260 --> 21:00.260
I mean, people are good at some things, but we're generally not good at doing the same thing over and over and over again.

21:00.260 --> 21:05.260
Sisyphus really should have been a bot, because he would have, he wouldn't have minded at all.

21:05.260 --> 21:12.260
But in terms of automatic tools, I do want to go off and point out both Google Lighthouse and Unlighthouse.

21:12.260 --> 21:14.260
Has anyone tried Unlighthouse before?

21:15.260 --> 21:24.260
So, Unlighthouse.dev. It basically scans your whole website, more or less, with Google Lighthouse and gives you a Lighthouse score.

21:24.260 --> 21:29.260
So, it's what's from a, from a sustainability point of view.

21:29.260 --> 21:32.260
That comes with all of the stuff that comes with Lighthouse. You get the performance hits.

21:32.260 --> 21:37.260
You also get the accessibility score for that. The accessibility score is less than acts.

21:37.260 --> 21:44.260
You're not getting as much of the features as you do with acts, but it is a good solid starting point for people.

21:44.260 --> 21:49.260
But if you look at the performance numbers, that's a great place to start looking for sustainability.

21:49.260 --> 21:54.260
There's lots of overlap between sustainability and performance.

21:54.260 --> 21:59.260
And it's so useful to find allies too, like who are the people who are interested in the same issue.

21:59.260 --> 22:05.260
And absolutely performance people are on the same camp of sustainability.

22:05.260 --> 22:12.260
They're sort of like security and privacy. They're not the same, but they're very, very related.

22:12.260 --> 22:21.260
Also useful to point out sitespeed.io and co2.js. You can also tie in actscore into this as well.

22:21.260 --> 22:28.260
How people know what sitespeed.io is. It's similar to what Google Lighthouse can do.

22:28.260 --> 22:32.260
It does gain a site, or Unlighthouse can do. It does a site-wide crawl.

22:32.260 --> 22:36.260
It provides recommendations and a little coach that gives you some direction.

22:36.260 --> 22:43.260
It is open source, which is good. Not that Google Lighthouse isn't open source as well, but you deal with Google.

22:43.260 --> 22:51.260
But the co2.js module is a tool that's being implemented by the Web Sustainability, sorry, the Green Software Foundation.

22:52.260 --> 22:55.260
Green Web Foundation, thank you very much Chris.

22:55.260 --> 23:01.260
So the Green Web Foundation, fortunately, is the organization that's behind the co2.js.

23:01.260 --> 23:10.260
And it's a great module, particularly to give a snapshot quickly of what is available within your website

23:10.260 --> 23:14.260
and what the estimated co2 impact is for that.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.260
There's a lot more work that needs to be done.

23:16.260 --> 23:26.260
Two tools like co2.js. The default right now is to look at a byte model that is more or less looking at how many bits are transferred and to focus on that side.

23:26.260 --> 23:33.260
There's so much more research that is needed to actually get to something that is a verifiable amount of co2.

23:33.260 --> 23:43.260
So we know that one byte of an image is going to have a lot less co2 impact than one meg of JavaScript.

23:44.260 --> 23:54.260
JavaScript is so much more intensive in terms of CPU processing, whereas rendering HTML and images are really not a big deal for browsers.

23:54.260 --> 23:58.260
But JavaScript is something that does take a lot of processing power.

23:58.260 --> 24:04.260
But it's a really great tool and you can integrate it with sitespeed.io and have that information available.

24:04.260 --> 24:09.260
I also want to point out EcoGrader and websitecarbon.com.

24:09.260 --> 24:14.260
Both of those are good tools to get a sense of how heavy your website is.

24:14.260 --> 24:17.260
Take all this information with a grain of salt.

24:17.260 --> 24:20.260
This doesn't actually give you a number that gives you an estimate.

24:20.260 --> 24:23.260
That is something you can work towards and improve on.

24:23.260 --> 24:30.260
But just like with accessibility tools like the WaveTool bar or Microsoft's open source accessibility insights,

24:30.260 --> 24:36.260
just because you don't have any errors within your accessibility tool doesn't mean that your website is accessible.

24:36.260 --> 24:42.260
It means that there are no automated errors that have been found with your tools.

24:42.260 --> 24:45.260
So it's trying to understand what the automated tools can give you.

24:45.260 --> 24:49.260
They can't tell you that there are no accessibility errors.

24:49.260 --> 24:54.260
They can only tell you that there's no errors that the automated tools can identify.

24:54.260 --> 24:57.260
And the same thing is going to be the case with sustainability.

24:57.260 --> 25:00.260
We're going to have to have human input in the mix.

25:01.260 --> 25:08.260
So manual, we're going to have to have humans who are looking at do we have this page?

25:08.260 --> 25:10.260
Do we need to have this page?

25:10.260 --> 25:12.260
Is this something we can yank off of?

25:12.260 --> 25:18.260
Is there an easier process to get where people need to go in order to achieve the goals of what we're trying to achieve?

25:18.260 --> 25:22.260
That's a very human thing to try and understand how humans are acting.

25:22.260 --> 25:24.260
We can't be expecting bots to do that.

25:25.260 --> 25:27.260
Same with on accessibility.

25:27.260 --> 25:31.260
It's a question of does this alt text actually make sense?

25:31.260 --> 25:34.260
It may or may not, but we need to be able to...

25:34.260 --> 25:36.260
A bot isn't going to be able to tell that.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.260
It can tell you whether or not there are...

25:38.260 --> 25:43.260
If it's image123.jpg, that we can get a machine to do.

25:43.260 --> 25:48.260
Most don't, but it's possible to go off and do that.

25:48.260 --> 25:53.260
But we need to be thinking about where the limitations of what the machines can do

25:53.260 --> 25:55.260
and what we're thinking about these processes.

25:55.260 --> 25:59.260
And again with JavaScript, is this JavaScript file actually needed?

25:59.260 --> 26:02.260
Could somebody actually navigate this information with the mouse?

26:02.260 --> 26:07.260
What are the comparisons between the accessibility world and the sustainability world?

26:07.260 --> 26:10.260
What can we learn from one that we need to bring to the other

26:10.260 --> 26:15.260
as we scale up and start addressing issues of sustainability in our sites?

26:15.260 --> 26:19.260
Is it content fulfilling user needs?

26:19.260 --> 26:21.260
Does it work for the assistive technology?

26:21.260 --> 26:26.260
Those are all kinds of related questions between the two different disciplines.

26:26.260 --> 26:29.260
Any questions at this point?

26:29.260 --> 26:34.260
Going through a lot of stuff and I know how hot this room is

26:34.260 --> 26:36.260
and how overwhelming FOSDEM is.

26:36.260 --> 26:40.260
So totally understand that if people just want to go off and engage.

26:40.260 --> 26:47.260
But do feel free to go off and stop me if you have questions.

26:47.260 --> 26:51.260
So I wanted to touch a bit more about open source tools for sustainability

26:51.260 --> 26:54.260
because this is an open source event.

26:54.260 --> 26:57.260
So we've got, and Chris, if you see things that are missing,

26:57.260 --> 27:02.260
please go off and jump and say if there's things that are missing.

27:02.260 --> 27:10.260
There's the carbon cloud footprint, Scandis, how do you spell that? Scrapis here?

27:10.260 --> 27:13.260
Yeah, whatever, that one.

27:13.260 --> 27:16.260
There's another one by Yadz.

27:16.260 --> 27:19.260
It's such a hard time naming things. Why is it so difficult?

27:19.260 --> 27:24.260
Cube Green, Kepler, Green Metrics Tool, CO2.js.

27:24.260 --> 27:28.260
And CO2.js is built into Firefox.

27:28.260 --> 27:31.260
I learned about that last year at FOSDEM and it's really wonderful

27:31.260 --> 27:34.260
that that's been something that's being brought into a popular browser.

27:34.260 --> 27:37.260
Hopefully Chrome will be shamed into doing that as well

27:37.260 --> 27:40.260
because we do need to go off and build these tools in.

27:40.260 --> 27:44.260
I also mentioned sitesv.io previously.

27:44.260 --> 27:51.260
In terms of websites to learn more, there's the awesome green software list.

27:51.260 --> 27:54.260
So you can go and find all kinds of information about green software

27:54.260 --> 27:59.260
that's an open source tool that are available for that.

27:59.260 --> 28:04.260
Also opensustain.tech and climatetriage.com.

28:04.260 --> 28:09.260
So there's so much information out there.

28:09.260 --> 28:12.260
A lot of it is free.

28:12.260 --> 28:15.260
This is stuff that people are learning and sharing because they need to go off

28:15.260 --> 28:17.260
and because there's not a lot of awareness.

28:17.260 --> 28:23.260
This is not an issue that most people still believe that as long as you don't print out the web,

28:23.260 --> 28:26.260
if you don't print out your pages, you're being environmentally friendly.

28:26.260 --> 28:31.260
We're not thinking about the overall impact of our digital devices

28:31.260 --> 28:37.260
and the actual weight that they carry on the planet.

28:37.260 --> 28:41.260
Any questions about that? Any tools are missing?

28:41.260 --> 28:44.260
Chris, anything big that I might have missed?

28:44.260 --> 28:51.260
No, the only thing to ask is that there's a talk tomorrow where it's Firefox profiled talking about sustainability.

28:51.260 --> 28:52.260
Excellent.

28:52.260 --> 28:56.260
And there is also a talk by a digital spread on Skafanja at 6 o'clock tonight as well.

28:56.260 --> 29:00.260
So tonight at 6 o'clock there's a talk on Skafanja which is...

29:00.260 --> 29:02.260
I'm going to be at lower this now.

29:02.260 --> 29:04.260
Yeah, that's taking in the other room at 6 p.m.

29:04.260 --> 29:05.260
Marvel. That's great.

29:05.260 --> 29:07.260
Definitely want to learn more about that.

29:07.260 --> 29:08.260
That's the energy room, is that right?

29:08.260 --> 29:09.260
Yes.

29:09.260 --> 29:13.260
And also there's...

29:13.260 --> 29:19.260
Sorry, tomorrow there's the talk about the Firefox profiler that's in the energy room as well.

29:19.260 --> 29:21.260
No, I think that's another room.

29:21.260 --> 29:26.260
But if you look up where sustainability, Firefox, it will show up.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.260
Wonderful. Thank you.

29:28.260 --> 29:31.260
I will definitely share that out after the talk as well.

29:31.260 --> 29:33.260
So that's great.

29:33.260 --> 29:38.260
Sorry, in terms of the question, sorry, did I repeat enough of it that it's understandable?

29:38.260 --> 29:41.260
Okay, excellent.

29:41.260 --> 29:46.260
So yeah, we need to go off and just like accessibility, we need to bring these things in early as possible.

29:46.260 --> 29:48.260
So how do we tie this into our development process?

29:48.260 --> 29:54.260
How do we start looking as early on in the process so that we're catching where we're starting to add bloat?

29:54.260 --> 29:56.260
Where does the page start to slow down?

29:56.260 --> 30:03.260
How do we make sure that every sprint were a little bit faster and a little lighter than we were previously?

30:03.260 --> 30:08.260
So we want to catch bugs before they ever get to production.

30:08.260 --> 30:11.260
So it has to be part of the CI CD process.

30:11.260 --> 30:13.260
If it gets to production, it's too late.

30:13.260 --> 30:16.260
Not that you can't fix it later, we probably won't.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.260
We're developers.

30:18.260 --> 30:24.260
So also trying to go off and setting page budgets is quite useful as well.

30:24.260 --> 30:29.260
With accessibility, I like to go off and aim for zero X errors.

30:29.260 --> 30:33.260
So they call that axe clean in the DQ world.

30:33.260 --> 30:43.260
For website pages, like you're going to need to set your own, it'd be lovely if people could go off and reach 200 grams of CO2 per page.

30:43.260 --> 30:45.260
Most are much, much more than that.

30:45.260 --> 30:55.260
So I don't know how that many sites out there that are meeting that 200 grams of page, but let's set a goal and try and see if we can improve it over time.

30:55.260 --> 31:03.260
And measure our pages now so we know what we are now and see if we can get achievable goals over time.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.260
Again, think about sustainability and accessibility bugs.

31:05.260 --> 31:08.260
We need to start, we can't think about these as features.

31:08.260 --> 31:10.260
If we leave them as features, they're not going to be addressed.

31:10.260 --> 31:14.260
They have to be seen as bugs and treated like bugs, right?

31:14.260 --> 31:19.260
So that they're more likely to be fixed in their address early in the process.

31:20.260 --> 31:27.260
And even if you're looking at minor bugs, if you're repeating the same minor bug a million times, it becomes a major issue.

31:27.260 --> 31:32.260
So again, think about the cycle and how these things scale up in our tools.

31:32.260 --> 31:39.260
Look at these tools and try to find ways to get a multi-layered process for quality.

31:39.260 --> 31:48.260
How do we make sure that we're building into our CI CD, that we're measuring support for authors, that we're scanning the environment for errors,

31:48.260 --> 31:53.260
that we're doing randomized tests, like we don't want to be scanning every page every week.

31:53.260 --> 32:02.260
But we should have some sort of process where we have a plan for how we're going to provide automated and manual scans for the information.

32:02.260 --> 32:06.260
Are there ways that we can construct your manual testing?

32:06.260 --> 32:12.260
How do we try to make sure we have a thorough rock process to remove content that we don't need?

32:12.260 --> 32:16.260
Are we doing annual reviews and doing deeper guides?

32:16.260 --> 32:20.260
Are we encouraging people to get certifications or to learn more about this?

32:20.260 --> 32:27.260
There are some good tools out there from the Linux Foundation and others around learning about the sustainability impacts of digital tools.

32:27.260 --> 32:32.260
We've got some ideas about what a robust approach to accessibility looks like.

32:32.260 --> 32:37.260
Very similar. We've got to go off and check for errors in our process.

32:37.260 --> 32:41.260
Use tools like Editorially and Sally to go off and evaluate it.

32:41.260 --> 32:45.260
Is anyone going to use Purple Hats as an accessibility tool?

32:45.260 --> 32:49.260
Purple Hats is a great tool for crawling for accessibility errors.

32:49.260 --> 32:55.260
Singapore's Government Digital Services has created this using Act,

32:55.260 --> 33:07.260
but it's useful to try and think about ways to build processes and to have a belt and suspender approach, just like you do with security.

33:07.260 --> 33:14.260
There's also a tool called the WKGEM, which is WKG Evaluation Methodology,

33:14.260 --> 33:19.260
which is useful for thinking about a structured approach for evaluating websites or an accessibility

33:19.260 --> 33:25.260
to see that you can compare two websites and you're going to have some confidence that you're going to get similar results

33:25.260 --> 33:32.260
or similar kinds of comparisons so that you're not dealing with an apples and oranges situation.

33:33.260 --> 33:43.260
I also want to go off and highlight that in terms of, yeah, we've got information around CO2.js

33:43.260 --> 33:49.260
and incorporating that into our pages. There's tools like SiteSpeed.io, the Firefox Profiler.

33:49.260 --> 33:57.260
There's also efforts to try and have, I don't know what the evaluation,

33:57.260 --> 34:06.260
what the comparison would be between WKGEM, this accessibility evaluation, and something like sustainability.

34:06.260 --> 34:12.260
I don't know how you would create that tool. The Web Sustainability Guidelines is trying to do that, to have that comparison,

34:12.260 --> 34:19.260
so you have some way to do a comparison of two websites and have a sense of how sustainable both of them are,

34:19.260 --> 34:23.260
but this is stuff that needs to be developed. There's no tools for that.

34:23.260 --> 34:31.260
The Firefox Profiler is one tool. We need to have others because Firefox isn't the only browser out there.

34:31.260 --> 34:35.260
It may be the best browser out there, but it's not the only one out there, so we need to be thinking about this

34:35.260 --> 34:38.260
in terms of how people are engaging with the tools.

34:38.260 --> 34:48.260
I do want to encourage people to go and to learn more about sustainability, to think about what their next steps are.

34:48.260 --> 34:55.260
Here's the sustainablewebdesign.org website. That's the URL I forgot about earlier.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.260
This is the Human-Readable approach.

34:58.260 --> 35:06.260
Is everyone here use Slack? More or less, even if you have to, just because you have to.

35:06.260 --> 35:13.260
The climateaction.tech has a really great community for learning more about this,

35:13.260 --> 35:19.260
and I think it's a wonderful place for people to ask questions and to be able to share their ideas

35:19.260 --> 35:26.260
and to, if you've written blog posts about how you're engaging with sustainability in your open source project

35:26.260 --> 35:29.260
and you want to share that with others, that's a great place to do that.

35:29.260 --> 35:35.260
I think that's where I learned about the work that Wagtail is doing and tried to sort of bring that over.

35:35.260 --> 35:39.260
There's also a whole bunch of interesting books, and there's more and more coming out all the time.

35:39.260 --> 35:45.260
There's Green Code, there's SustainableWebDesign, there's Building Green Software.

35:45.260 --> 35:51.260
Depending whether you're a designer or a developer, whether you're back-end, front-end,

35:51.260 --> 35:57.260
there's material out there which is geared to you.

35:57.260 --> 36:06.260
Take a look at what's available and see if there's material out there that you can read and learn from.

36:06.260 --> 36:10.260
There's also any project managers here in the group?

36:10.260 --> 36:14.260
Okay, two project managers, excellent.

36:14.260 --> 36:22.260
Three, so there's now actually a course that I don't have listed here on sustainability for project managers

36:22.260 --> 36:30.260
to learn how to go off and how to project manager, what do they need to know in order to learn about digital sustainability.

36:30.260 --> 36:34.260
There's also some excellent podcasts including Environment Variables where you can hear

36:34.260 --> 36:40.260
our very own Mr. Chris Adams, much of the time, not all the time, but quite a lot of the time.

36:40.260 --> 36:45.260
And Green I.O., which is another great podcast, there's others as well where people are being done.

36:45.260 --> 36:51.260
There's a lot of places to learn about what's available here and engage with it.

36:51.260 --> 36:57.260
But I really want to encourage people here to test their code, to test their websites using tools like

36:57.260 --> 37:06.260
the website carbon.com website or eco grader or co2.js, test your stuff and see how it looks,

37:06.260 --> 37:08.260
what you can learn from it and share that with others.

37:08.260 --> 37:16.260
Let's start talking about that so that we're encouraging other people to think about what their impact is with the digital tools that they use.

37:16.260 --> 37:24.260
And with that, I can be contacted here and I can also, if people have any questions,

37:24.260 --> 37:30.260
happy to answer questions or engage with people here as people for CFET.

37:30.260 --> 37:32.260
Thank you, Mike.

37:32.260 --> 37:40.260
Any questions?

37:40.260 --> 37:44.260
I'm glad I didn't answer all of everyone's thoughts.

37:44.260 --> 37:47.260
Hi, thank you. Thank you for this.

37:47.260 --> 37:52.260
I'm not familiar with these topics, especially sustainability.

37:52.260 --> 38:00.260
You're talking about accessibility and sustainability as they are somehow related to each other.

38:00.260 --> 38:02.260
They're both elements of quality.

38:02.260 --> 38:11.260
The way I see it, accessibility is more about individuals, users, on the land, sustainability is about the general audience,

38:11.260 --> 38:14.260
the general environment issues.

38:14.260 --> 38:17.260
So how do they correlate to each other?

38:17.260 --> 38:24.260
I mean, if your website is sustainable in terms of electricity and money saving,

38:24.260 --> 38:34.260
it doesn't mean that it's accessible for a user which has issues using your website.

38:34.260 --> 38:40.260
They're mostly combined in my head because I work in both areas.

38:40.260 --> 38:47.260
So to some extent, you can have different areas, but there's also a real effort to see the development of,

38:47.260 --> 38:49.260
like you know about human-centered design?

38:49.260 --> 38:52.260
There's the effort to create planet-friendly design.

38:52.260 --> 38:57.260
We are the only species that is engaging with the web at this point that we know of.

38:57.260 --> 39:03.260
And so we are the users in this case.

39:03.260 --> 39:07.260
And we only live here and a few people in the space station.

39:07.260 --> 39:10.260
But it's like having a planet-friendly focus is...

39:10.260 --> 39:12.260
Of course they're...

39:12.260 --> 39:18.260
But the way I see it, companies will be happy to talk about sustainability because they will save money.

39:18.260 --> 39:19.260
Right.

39:19.260 --> 39:25.260
I'm not sure a company will be happy to talk about accessibility because it's not giving directly money to them.

39:25.260 --> 39:31.260
Is it correct what I'm saying or just maybe my wrong perception of everything?

39:31.260 --> 39:33.260
There's definitely different incentives.

39:33.260 --> 39:43.260
And partly it comes down to there's new legislation that is coming into place and finds that will be in place.

39:43.260 --> 39:48.260
And certainly in the U.S. if you're trying to sell to a university or a government agency,

39:48.260 --> 39:54.260
there's an effort to go off and to meet Section 508, which is now the more or less WKG 2.0 standards.

39:54.260 --> 39:58.260
So there are some financial incentives around that.

39:58.260 --> 40:01.260
But there's also... And people look at sustainability.

40:01.260 --> 40:06.260
They think about the cost of both producing or buying new hardware,

40:06.260 --> 40:11.260
but also in terms of electricity savings and seeing that as being a cost savings initiative.

40:11.260 --> 40:16.260
But there's other elements about digital sustainability that does actually cost money too.

40:16.260 --> 40:22.260
Like to do it properly, you do need time to focus the developers on building systems that are optimizing them

40:22.260 --> 40:28.260
and finding ways to cut down on the amount of craft that's...

40:28.260 --> 40:33.260
How many websites have redundant JavaScript libraries running?

40:33.260 --> 40:41.260
Or they've got multiple instances of analytics on their site or other tools that the marketing team wanted to install,

40:41.260 --> 40:43.260
but nobody's looked at for months.

40:43.260 --> 40:46.260
We know this happens in our industry all the time.

40:46.260 --> 40:51.260
And we are paying a price for that, but not necessarily a price that is...

40:51.260 --> 40:54.260
That the companies themselves are paying.

40:54.260 --> 41:00.260
Again, from an accessibility point of view, a lot of people are seeing this a lot cheaper

41:00.260 --> 41:06.260
to go off and to add an overlay to their website and hope that paying $50 a month will go off

41:06.260 --> 41:09.260
and wish away all of their accessibility problems,

41:09.260 --> 41:11.260
and they'll have something that they can justifiably say,

41:11.260 --> 41:16.260
we've got that covered for $50 a month as opposed to the justifiably thousands,

41:16.260 --> 41:21.260
hundreds of thousands of dollars to go off and pay people to actually fix the problems.

41:21.260 --> 41:23.260
But that just pushes it to the fringe.

41:23.260 --> 41:25.260
It's not something that actually solves the problem.

41:25.260 --> 41:27.260
Chris.

41:27.260 --> 41:29.260
Hi there. You can hear me all right, can you?

41:29.260 --> 41:30.260
Was that?

41:30.260 --> 41:31.260
You can hear me okay.

41:31.260 --> 41:32.260
Cool.

41:32.260 --> 41:37.260
I'm curious if there is a role you think that public sector organizations

41:37.260 --> 41:41.260
or early organizations could play like we saw with accessibility.

41:41.260 --> 41:42.260
Right.

41:42.260 --> 41:46.260
So mainstream this or make it easier for people to adopt like we saw with say public sector

41:46.260 --> 41:48.260
and Microsoft and stuff like that.

41:48.260 --> 41:52.260
Are there any similarities there that you would draw people's attention to?

41:52.260 --> 41:53.260
Absolutely.

41:53.260 --> 41:55.260
I mean, ultimately we've got to look at incentives, right?

41:55.260 --> 41:56.260
Follow the money.

41:56.260 --> 42:00.260
And that's starting to happen with accessibility, with sustainability.

42:00.260 --> 42:02.260
People are still not aware of it.

42:02.260 --> 42:06.260
And the UK government has done some great work talking about sustainability

42:06.260 --> 42:09.260
and digit and measuring it and trying to be aware of it.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.260
And their site is probably the most sustainable in the world.

42:11.260 --> 42:14.260
So it's really wonderful to see that.

42:14.260 --> 42:21.260
But also the, yeah, I think that the government sector is in most countries

42:21.260 --> 42:24.260
the single biggest procure of technology.

42:24.260 --> 42:28.260
So if we can get government to commit to buying green software,

42:28.260 --> 42:31.260
it will make a huge deal in our industry.

42:31.260 --> 42:33.260
Because people, if they want the contracts,

42:33.260 --> 42:36.260
they're going to have to go off and be able to follow the web sustainability guidelines

42:36.260 --> 42:39.260
and say that this complies, right?

42:39.260 --> 42:41.260
Even if they're doing a half-hearted effort,

42:41.260 --> 42:44.260
it will make a huge difference if government steps up and says this matters.

42:44.260 --> 42:49.260
Even just to make it an issue of public discussion.

42:49.260 --> 42:50.260
Thank you.

42:50.260 --> 42:52.260
Any question?

42:52.260 --> 43:00.260
Thank you, Mike.

43:00.260 --> 43:03.260
You mentioned earlier the AI hype.

43:03.260 --> 43:07.260
Do you think we can find that for either the BDT or accessibility?

43:07.260 --> 43:09.260
Yeah, I mean, absolutely.

43:09.260 --> 43:11.260
I mean, it can do wonderful things.

43:11.260 --> 43:15.260
But people also, there's an environmental cost to AI,

43:15.260 --> 43:17.260
and that's something that is not being measured.

43:17.260 --> 43:20.260
And so yeah, we can go off and solve some problems with AI,

43:20.260 --> 43:23.260
but we have to be very careful about how we're doing that

43:23.260 --> 43:26.260
and whether or not we're being responsible for our use of AI.

43:26.260 --> 43:31.260
Because it's something that we can't just solve problems

43:31.260 --> 43:35.260
and throw AI at a problem and hope that this goes away.

43:35.260 --> 43:39.260
We need to have humans involved in the process to see this actually makes things better

43:39.260 --> 43:41.260
and be focusing, like with accessibility,

43:41.260 --> 43:45.260
we need to make the people with lived experience of disabilities the experts.

43:45.260 --> 43:52.260
They're ultimately the ones who need to be heard to know that they're able to access these sites.

43:52.260 --> 43:56.260
And not the standards, not the experts,

43:56.260 --> 43:59.260
but the people with lived experience with disability need to be involved.

43:59.260 --> 44:02.260
And the same goes with sustainability.

44:02.260 --> 44:07.260
You can't just have, like, we have to be measuring what the overall life cycle impact is.

44:07.260 --> 44:10.260
That includes people coming to conferences like this.

44:10.260 --> 44:16.260
It also includes the cost of involving thousands of generative AI models

44:16.260 --> 44:21.260
to go off and to evaluate the performance of websites.

44:21.260 --> 44:26.260
We need to be cautious about it because I think that it can be useful,

44:26.260 --> 44:29.260
but it has a huge cost.

44:32.260 --> 44:36.260
Thank you, Mike. No other question?

44:36.260 --> 44:38.260
Okay. Thank you very much.

44:38.260 --> 44:40.260
Thank you very much.

44:49.260 --> 44:52.260
It was green the whole time. Perfect.

45:08.260 --> 45:11.260
Thank you.
