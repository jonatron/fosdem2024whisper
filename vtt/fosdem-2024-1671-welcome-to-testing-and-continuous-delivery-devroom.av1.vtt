00:00.000 --> 00:10.600
All right, good morning everyone and thank you for coming so early.

00:10.600 --> 00:15.360
I'm just going to take less than five minutes of your time to say the welcome and then we

00:15.360 --> 00:18.360
continue with the awesome speakers that we've got.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.080
As you can see, there's a lot of us here today.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.480
If you aren't aware of the history, in the past we did have the testing and automation

00:26.480 --> 00:32.120
dev room which was separate from the CI CD dev room and this year the two dev rooms have

00:32.120 --> 00:36.400
been merged and going in the future we will continue like that.

00:36.400 --> 00:44.000
So we do have the two teams from the dev rooms organizing together this year.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.760
So we start with Anders.

00:45.760 --> 00:46.760
Say hi.

00:46.760 --> 00:47.760
Yeah.

00:47.760 --> 00:48.760
Then we have Jan.

00:48.760 --> 00:58.760
Olivia, Fabrizio, Carlos.

00:58.760 --> 01:01.200
We've got Sirio who is at home at the moment.

01:01.200 --> 01:07.040
He cannot join us because he has newly born small kids and my name is Alex.

01:07.040 --> 01:09.320
Nice to meet you.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.440
So you all know the rules I think.

01:11.440 --> 01:12.440
Don't be a jerk.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.160
Enjoy the presentation.

01:15.160 --> 01:20.120
If you see more people coming in late, go towards the middle so that they can squeeze

01:20.120 --> 01:23.600
in on the sides and not jump over you.

01:23.600 --> 01:27.360
And if you want to talk to the speaker, it's up to them whether or not they will be taking

01:27.360 --> 01:33.000
questions during the presentation or after, but we do not have a lot of time for switch

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
over.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.880
So if you want to talk to the speaker, please take it outside so the next speaker can set

01:37.880 --> 01:42.160
up and we can continue and then you can just come back in.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.920
And this is it, I guess.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.600
Thank you again for coming and let's start.
