Hi everybody, I'm here to tell you a story about how French public agency managed to

00:10.880 --> 00:14.480
migrate their users from Excel to Greece.

00:14.480 --> 00:24.480
By the way, my name is Fréran, I work as a developer for the French public agency ANCT

00:24.480 --> 00:28.280
in the Doné Territoire team, Doné Territoire meaning Data and Territory.

00:28.280 --> 00:36.800
But I'm not here to talk about myself, I'm here to talk to you about Anne, who is a French

00:36.800 --> 00:44.520
public agent working for the ANCT as she is in charge of subsidy programs and she has

00:44.520 --> 00:54.160
to have the feedback about how it goes.

00:54.160 --> 01:02.440
So she sends Excel spreadsheets to Priscilla, Paul and Patrick who are regional workers

01:02.440 --> 01:06.240
because she hasn't had the data herself.

01:06.240 --> 01:16.080
And then they don't have the data themselves neither, they send to regional local agents

01:16.080 --> 01:21.480
and well, it didn't work, went as expected.

01:21.480 --> 01:33.520
Paul didn't understand correctly what Anne asked for, so he sends her new data.

01:33.520 --> 01:41.880
Then Patrick is in CECLIVE, so it didn't have the time to send the data to the local

01:41.880 --> 01:44.880
users in time.

01:44.880 --> 01:51.000
And Priscilla is a bit worried about the data, she received back from the local agents and

01:51.360 --> 02:00.720
she asks for clarifications, sends partial data to Anne, but still she has a bit delayed.

02:00.720 --> 02:04.320
So finally what happened?

02:04.320 --> 02:13.440
Anne Gathers and the data, she realizes that the data are incomplete and outdated and well,

02:13.560 --> 02:20.720
she has colleagues who adjust her to send the data and well, she went back to the regional

02:20.720 --> 02:29.160
and local agents for clarifications and they're just fed up with these spreadsheets.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.360
So here comes GRIST.

02:31.360 --> 02:38.920
GRIST is a collaborative spreadsheet, but not only it's also a local platform, if you

02:38.920 --> 02:45.360
know it's kind of an alternative and open source.

02:45.360 --> 02:54.160
It's made by GRIST Labs with a small US-based company and yeah, we deployed an instance

02:54.160 --> 02:59.720
that we self-host ourselves for data sovereignty.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.560
Why we chose GRIST?

03:01.560 --> 03:04.840
Because we didn't develop it ourselves at first.

03:04.840 --> 03:06.760
First because it's hacker-friendly.

03:06.760 --> 03:13.320
You have formulas in Python, you have many possibilities with that, just with that.

03:13.320 --> 03:20.520
Second you have access control list, which means that when a local agent fears the data

03:20.520 --> 03:31.400
that is for his local administration, he doesn't see the data of the other local agents.

03:32.120 --> 03:36.440
Obviously, it's free-level open source.

03:36.440 --> 03:41.760
That's why we're here, but it was a criterion we had at first.

03:41.760 --> 03:51.560
And it's easy to consume data, so we can transform and publish part of it as an open data.

03:51.560 --> 03:53.760
Here is how GRIST looks like.

03:53.760 --> 04:00.520
You have a spreadsheet and well, I don't have much time to make your demo, so let's get

04:00.520 --> 04:02.400
in touch.

04:02.400 --> 04:06.920
And just to finish, we don't fork this project.

04:06.920 --> 04:10.200
We contribute with development and many stuff like that.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.200
Thank you.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.200
Thank you.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
Thank you.

04:13.200 --> 04:13.700
Thank you.
