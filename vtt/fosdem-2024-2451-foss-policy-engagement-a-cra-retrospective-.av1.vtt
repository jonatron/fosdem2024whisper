WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.680
So Martin and I, I think we met seven months ago, six months ago, eight months ago, something

00:09.680 --> 00:10.840
like that.

00:10.840 --> 00:15.720
When you started to get interested more and more into policy, and I was in Eclipse trying

00:15.720 --> 00:19.640
to make something out of the CRA so that we can solve all the issues that we've been discussing

00:19.640 --> 00:21.720
during the first session.

00:21.720 --> 00:25.060
And we quickly realized that we had backgrounds that are very complementary.

00:25.060 --> 00:29.240
In a sense that he has obviously this all open source background, and I have this policy

00:29.240 --> 00:33.860
background into advocacy and how to advocate in terms of policy.

00:33.860 --> 00:39.460
So out of our four matters combined, we sort of decided to combine our efforts.

00:39.460 --> 00:45.160
So here today I discuss what it's like to do advocacy, and then Martin will explain

00:45.160 --> 00:48.800
what it's like from an open source perspective to be new in Brussels and try to do something

00:48.800 --> 00:51.860
about it and how we try to organize the whole thing.

00:51.860 --> 00:57.060
So I think what we need to do here is share the information about how policy making is

00:57.060 --> 00:58.720
done in Brussels.

00:58.720 --> 01:02.400
In Brussels you have several institutions gathering together in order to create those

01:02.400 --> 01:03.560
policies.

01:03.560 --> 01:08.180
The main three ones not entering into details of all the policy making procedures are the

01:08.180 --> 01:13.240
commission, the one that is drafting the proposal, for example the one that drafted the PLD, the

01:13.240 --> 01:17.180
one that drafted the CRA, the two policy officers that were here this morning are the one who

01:17.180 --> 01:19.780
did it together with their teams.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.580
Then you have what we call the co-legislators.

01:22.580 --> 01:26.400
One is the parliament, the one that we directly elect, and the other one is the council, the

01:26.400 --> 01:30.180
council of the EU which is representative of all the government of the EU.

01:30.180 --> 01:35.060
So we're talking France, the Netherlands, whatever country you're from in the EU, that's

01:35.060 --> 01:37.460
your government that is there.

01:37.460 --> 01:42.160
Then the question is how do you actually influence those policies?

01:42.160 --> 01:46.340
There are I'd say several things to keep in mind as a community to do that.

01:46.340 --> 01:51.900
If you want to influence that policy, first is to get interested so that you gather the

01:51.900 --> 01:56.380
knowledge on the policy, to gather the reason why this policy is happening, to gather the

01:57.000 --> 02:01.880
actual details of the text or the issue that the policy makers are trying to address.

02:01.880 --> 02:06.960
The second one is get organized, trying to actually have an impact so that you have credibility

02:06.960 --> 02:10.920
and the policy makers don't see just one citizen coming to them but a group of citizens that

02:10.920 --> 02:14.920
is organized enough to represent a part of the society.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.920
The other one is just write down stuff so that you have clarity.

02:18.920 --> 02:24.160
Then you have to identify the different elements within the policy making process that can

02:24.160 --> 02:25.640
allow you to get involved.

02:25.900 --> 02:30.900
Here I'm talking about contacting policy makers, the REC-1, being able to identify them properly.

02:30.900 --> 02:36.180
I'm also talking about getting support in your network, in the companies that you know

02:36.180 --> 02:40.780
because the open source community in the case of the CRA for instance, we won part of the

02:40.780 --> 02:46.780
overall challenge for policy makers but they also have to discuss with industry, car companies,

02:46.780 --> 02:51.060
large tech companies that are closed source as well and all of this needs to be addressed.

02:51.060 --> 02:55.420
I'd go back to Marty now giving details and then we'd be exchanging throughout the presentation

02:55.420 --> 03:01.400
as well to see what didn't work, what worked, what could have worked if we would have acted

03:01.400 --> 03:05.400
differently and then if you have questions we try to do that as well.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.160
I'll start with a quick promise.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.720
I was here last block and this will be the last time you see me here and then I'll just

03:14.720 --> 03:19.760
sit down and other people can talk because we take this rule seriously.

03:19.760 --> 03:24.440
What I will be sharing with you is my personal story of how I got here because that was not

03:24.460 --> 03:25.900
really my plan.

03:25.900 --> 03:33.800
So my role is to work between policy and technology from an Elnet Labs which is a small R&D organization

03:33.800 --> 03:39.060
in doing DNS enrouting from Amsterdam.

03:39.060 --> 03:45.460
In September and because this is not about me but about the lessons I learned, I'll

03:45.460 --> 03:50.660
give you the lessons first then you can plug your ears for the remainder of my talk and

03:50.660 --> 03:53.940
then that works for the deal.

03:53.940 --> 04:00.760
My lessons first, I think we were too late and if you're too late, if the commission

04:00.760 --> 04:03.200
makes a proposal then you're chasing the train, right?

04:03.200 --> 04:10.080
So we did a lot of train chasing and that means you need a lot more effort than you

04:10.080 --> 04:15.260
would have needed if we were in front of the train at the station discussing where the

04:15.260 --> 04:17.680
train would be headed.

04:17.680 --> 04:24.160
I also think and I learned that we cannot expect FOSS to organize as an industry organizers

04:24.160 --> 04:29.600
because if it turns out that it is nicely organized like a trade organization and you're

04:29.600 --> 04:35.580
probably not talking to the whole community but just to the industry part of it.

04:35.580 --> 04:42.140
And I think because of these facts that the digital dossiers in the European Union needs

04:42.140 --> 04:50.020
to change a little or we need to figure out the mechanisms to do advocacy from the community

04:50.020 --> 04:55.260
because for all the digital dossiers software is relevant and for software open source is

04:55.260 --> 04:56.260
relevant.

04:56.260 --> 05:03.620
And I'll try to illustrate why I think these are the lessons because I think I and we all

05:03.620 --> 05:09.060
got quite lucky on this one.

05:09.060 --> 05:15.540
So two last lessons, I think we should be talking more to parliament as a community.

05:15.540 --> 05:18.700
They should be the people that are most accessible to us.

05:18.700 --> 05:25.660
I think I personally didn't talk enough to parliament and it turns out that even if you

05:25.660 --> 05:35.420
don't have any EU policy experience you can figure this out if you have enough time and

05:35.420 --> 05:37.820
if you're lucky then you can make this work.

05:37.820 --> 05:42.260
So now to the story and you can plug your ears if you want to because you just had the

05:42.260 --> 05:43.260
lessons.

05:43.260 --> 05:48.700
So in September 2020 I found out that there was this thing called the CRA and I read it

05:48.700 --> 05:55.100
and I thought hey this is weird, open source is mentioned which is great but it's also

05:55.100 --> 06:00.620
clustered under the whole idea of non-commerciality and we all know that there's also a lot of

06:00.620 --> 06:03.580
open source and commercial products right.

06:03.580 --> 06:11.180
So I sent some emails and I got lucky real quick because I reached out to the Dutch digital

06:11.180 --> 06:14.780
civil rights organization Bits of Freedom, they connected me to a law professor and they

06:14.780 --> 06:20.060
connected me to a wonderful recent graduate who had a lot of context on this law because

06:20.060 --> 06:24.740
she had recently interned with the team that actually wrote it.

06:24.740 --> 06:30.220
And I want to thank Francine because she delivered the mental model to me and to a lot of people

06:30.220 --> 06:36.780
I work with later about how this actually fits in with the NLF and that's thanks to her.

06:36.780 --> 06:42.660
So in October I contributed to the first blog by ISOC, they were the first I think to mention

06:42.660 --> 06:47.140
hey there's this thing coming and I wrote a little newsletter saying oh I'm spending

06:47.140 --> 06:52.900
some of this time reading this stuff and I send a little tweet and then I got lucky again

06:52.900 --> 06:58.660
because the tweet was noticed by the commission, by Benjamin specifically and he said hey maybe

06:58.660 --> 07:00.100
you should come and talk.

07:00.100 --> 07:06.940
So that was kind of a surprise, I mean you write.

07:06.940 --> 07:16.820
So I was planning a visit to Brussels, I bought a t-shirt, super relevant detail, yeah.

07:16.820 --> 07:23.580
So I was there because my organization works in DNS right so I was attending a DNS conference

07:23.580 --> 07:30.060
in Brussels and I decided to drop by the commission because I was invited.

07:30.060 --> 07:34.380
So I learned a couple of things, they have really nice rooms with really nice flags and

07:34.380 --> 07:40.460
you get, they receive you friendly people and then you get kicked out because that room

07:40.460 --> 07:43.860
was for the boss.

07:43.860 --> 07:50.940
And what also really stuck with me and Benjamin repeated this morning, one of his colleagues

07:50.940 --> 07:55.620
said oh it's so refreshing not to talk to a lobbyist for once and I was like yeah I've

07:55.620 --> 08:02.500
no idea what I'm doing here but so but it was really constructive and I'm not saying

08:02.500 --> 08:09.420
this to please people, I'm saying this, this was November 2022, we actually had conversations

08:09.420 --> 08:14.140
about whether compliance work would increase security of open source and I was arguing

08:14.140 --> 08:19.020
it probably wouldn't and we got the question like is there anything we can do that will

08:19.020 --> 08:25.660
increase security and so we got into the conversation about if a vendor is obliged to report a

08:25.660 --> 08:31.380
vulnerability maybe they should also be obliged to send the patch if they have one and that

08:31.380 --> 08:36.420
was just a conversation and I don't know how it got into the law, maybe Benjamin will tell

08:36.420 --> 08:41.900
us someday but I think at that point already they were thinking oh maybe you can tweak

08:41.900 --> 08:44.580
this a little which I think was great.

08:44.580 --> 08:48.540
I also learned and this is about talking to parliament, Benjamin and his colleagues were

08:48.540 --> 08:54.780
very insistent that I should talk to the co-legislators and I was like what I'm here now so co-legislators

08:54.780 --> 08:59.700
others also other and it turned out they were actually done already because they made the

08:59.700 --> 09:04.420
proposal they could explain the proposal but they were not the party making changes at

09:04.420 --> 09:06.300
that point in time.

09:06.300 --> 09:10.980
So in December I visited Brussels again and I came with a list of examples like hey this

09:10.980 --> 09:16.940
is the ways that people write software and maybe interpret it as a commercial activity

09:16.940 --> 09:20.820
and people told me yeah it's great but you need to talk to the co-legislators.

09:20.820 --> 09:25.140
I was like oh great maybe I'm doing this wrong but I'm not talking to you so maybe you should

09:25.140 --> 09:26.140
come to Fosdam.

09:26.140 --> 09:33.100
So last year we had a Janssen, the session with Omar with Benjamin and I think that was

09:33.100 --> 09:38.940
the first time we did EU policy at Fosdam and some questions were raised because Benjamin

09:38.940 --> 09:45.500
told us, it's on camera, you should be talking to the co-legislators and Alex who is chairing

09:45.500 --> 09:50.140
this room today was in the audience and asked so what is your plan because you're talking

09:50.140 --> 09:55.460
to the wrong people and he was right right but I didn't know so we're just trying to

09:55.460 --> 09:58.380
get.

09:58.380 --> 10:03.740
So what it did get us though was it started building alliances right because a lot of

10:03.740 --> 10:10.020
people started interacting with me with others, Open Forum Europe became very active and I

10:10.020 --> 10:14.380
think that was what Fosdam did for us.

10:14.380 --> 10:19.780
Now remember that blog it did three things so I got in touch with people who did know

10:19.780 --> 10:24.740
how Brussels worked and that was useful because I didn't.

10:24.740 --> 10:30.700
I got an email from an aide to the Dutch senate and they were interested to understand

10:30.700 --> 10:33.820
what was it what this about so they started writing questions to the commission, they

10:33.820 --> 10:39.580
started writing questions to the Dutch government and these questions are obligatory to answer

10:39.580 --> 10:44.660
right so it created some pressure and we got a visit at an outlet lab from the Dutch

10:44.660 --> 10:51.820
delegation writing the CRA from the national like from the council perspective and it turned

10:51.820 --> 10:59.940
out that the Dutch were both very pro CRA but they also grasped FOS so that I think was

10:59.940 --> 11:05.300
a win because at that point in time we kind of or at least I could start to talk to the

11:05.300 --> 11:11.980
right people instead of the friendly people because that was kind of how this works right.

11:11.980 --> 11:17.820
So the questions from the senate helped for the civil servants to actually show up because

11:17.820 --> 11:26.020
they need to focus their time on where the relevant problems are right and I got some

11:26.020 --> 11:31.380
help from people that are more experienced working the Dutch government so I want to

11:31.380 --> 11:33.780
thank Bert.

11:33.780 --> 11:41.900
Then came some silence because FOS was over and I talked to the Dutch and then everything

11:41.900 --> 11:48.460
moved back into its own room right or just silence and I got a rejection from parliament

11:48.460 --> 11:53.140
because I applied to go to the hearing and they're saying yeah we don't know you we were

11:53.140 --> 11:56.700
mostly talking I mean there's limited seating and we're talking to the people we've heard

11:56.700 --> 12:02.380
from before so that was a bit of disappointed I mean it was a very kind rejection letter

12:02.380 --> 12:09.460
but it didn't help me as like a random Joe trying to but also open forum Europe built

12:09.460 --> 12:18.420
up steam so in and so open forum Europe was the place where a lot of us met on a weekly

12:18.420 --> 12:24.780
basis Kiran made an agenda every week I was now in the corner and he basically made sure

12:25.220 --> 12:31.780
that people were actually discussing the same topics no matter whether and we or maybe I

12:31.780 --> 12:38.660
got lucky again because about every couple of weeks I got from random people leaks from

12:38.660 --> 12:44.700
the council discussion from what the parliament was discussing and I learned how to analyze

12:44.700 --> 12:50.140
these and just share like oh this is what is being discussed and I also had to I also

12:50.180 --> 12:57.340
learned how not to write a position paper because we wrote some they were very lengthy

12:57.340 --> 13:05.740
and I think they were completely ignored so that was a good thing to learn and we yeah

13:05.740 --> 13:15.180
and we learned that the policymaker perspective perception was that we were just trying to get

13:15.180 --> 13:23.500
out so I and I think a number of people shifted focus to challenge some specific assumptions

13:23.500 --> 13:30.580
instead of arguing about the scope so over the summer I started emailing some me piece the

13:30.580 --> 13:37.020
commission the council there was a lot of silence and a bit of despair but then in the

13:37.020 --> 13:44.380
October November time frame suddenly communication started flowing we got emails not just me anyone

13:45.180 --> 13:52.740
asking for reviews we got asked questions for input there was a proposal floated about an open

13:52.740 --> 13:59.220
source steward and no one saw coming and I think at that point we started to be in the position

13:59.220 --> 14:04.260
where we should have been before the train left there were people engaged on a topic talking to

14:04.260 --> 14:10.820
the right people about the policies they were making and I think the policy makers delivered in

14:10.820 --> 14:15.940
parliament in the commission and in council by actually having conversation about these topics

14:15.940 --> 14:23.740
with people working on the specific aspect so this is how I got to these lessons learned we

14:23.740 --> 14:32.260
were too late we cannot expect the community to organize like industry and I think digital

14:32.260 --> 14:39.940
dossiers need a way to get us involved at a stage where where in a way that actually works for

14:39.940 --> 14:47.860
the community oh yeah and you should talk to the co-legislators that's it for me I'm having

14:47.860 --> 14:54.100
over the end so because I let it did a lot of things weirdly and I'm happy to hear about it so I

14:54.100 --> 14:59.940
think it raises the questions then from the very beginning I sort of said this is how it normally

14:59.940 --> 15:05.300
works you get organized you get interested and then you start writing stuff and then you speak to

15:05.380 --> 15:11.140
the co-legislators but the question is and Martin raised it very well he got lucky I wish I could

15:11.140 --> 15:17.580
be that lucky in my life but how are we gonna get organized who is gonna be the person that is

15:17.580 --> 15:22.340
enough interested in the open source community so that we get the information at the right time

15:22.340 --> 15:26.700
who is gonna write the stuff how are we gonna agree on the stuff that we want the open source

15:26.700 --> 15:32.340
community to say all those questions we need to figure them out figure them out on our side

15:32.420 --> 15:37.380
because Martin just said the co-legislators and basically all the institutions need to figure

15:37.380 --> 15:41.700
out a better way to interact with us but how do we also get better at interacting with them

15:42.260 --> 15:45.860
and that's the question that we're probably going to have to discuss today during the workshop

15:45.860 --> 15:51.380
the and then the fishbowl and that's I think the question of today in this specific session

15:51.380 --> 15:55.940
are the two what do we want the co-legislators to do so that they can come to us more often and in a

15:55.940 --> 16:01.780
better manner and how can we step towards them as well so that we also get better at interacting

16:01.780 --> 16:05.380
with co-legislators and the commission thank you
