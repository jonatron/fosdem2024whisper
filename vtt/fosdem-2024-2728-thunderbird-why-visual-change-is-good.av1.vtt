WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
Nameless. You cannot blame me for anything.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Hello everybody. Thank you so much for joining.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
This is a much packed room than I was expecting, but it's fine.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
My name is Alessandro. I have a slide that I present myself.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Of course, I need to fill up the time. Why visual change is good?

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
We're going to talk about the dreaded. We're going to change things up

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
and your user will absolutely love it. Nobody will be upset about it.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
And we are going to look at a little bit of history about Thunderbird,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
what we did and the success that came from all the changes that we did.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
So first of all, who the hell am I? I'm the director of product engineering

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
and you might ask yourself, what is a director of engineering doing here talking about design?

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
I've been a designer and a developer for almost 20 years.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
Yuck. Started as a front-end developer and UX designer at Thunderbird.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
First I was already there. Build many absolutely terrible GTK applications.

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
I'm a really strong advocate of open your process. Open, share everything

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
from the ideation, prototype, mock-ups, anything that you have.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Just share them with your community. It's free user feedback.

01:10.000 --> 01:14.000
You don't have to pay for user research. We already have people to do that for you for free.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
So who doesn't know what Thunderbird is?

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Okay, good. That would be very awkward for you to be here.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
This is Thunderbird. This was Thunderbird. This was Thunderbird version one.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
We officially initially released it in December 2004. So Thunderbird is actually 20 years old.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
It looks pretty nice. I guess pretty standard email application.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
It has a folder pane, message list, a message pane, a toolbar. Nothing crazy, nothing new.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
This is Thunderbird 102. We released this a little bit more than two years ago.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
Kind of looks worse, right?

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
This is colorful. You can identify. It's easy to read.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
You can identify the major interaction points. There's a lot of nice white space.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.000
It's breathable. Yes, it's dated with the little icon from Windows XP era.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
All this type of thing. But this is flat, cramped, 25 toolbars,

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
all flat icons. What the hell happened? So all these wonderful things.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
And the reasons because this happened is if you don't know,

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Thunderbird is actually built on top of Firefox.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
Thunderbird is a bunch of layers of C++, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript on top of the GECO render engine.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.000
And at that time, when Thunderbird was initially created,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Firefox and Thunderbird were developed at the same time.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
Anything that was happening in Firefox was trickling down into Thunderbird without much control.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
All the user interface changes or the tool kit changes, we were just inheriting those things.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
So when Firefox adopted the Aero Windows 7, we got that by default.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
All those rounded tabs. Even having tabs was weird for Thunderbird, but that worked.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
When Firefox was completely compliant with GTK 3 and accent colors,

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
we got that by default. Windows 10, their new flat accent color toolbar.

03:13.000 --> 03:20.000
So there wasn't really a time where designers were on top or in charge of Thunderbird.

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
It was all just at some interface things from Firefox.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
But the problem is that Firefox UI is technically just a toolbar and a setting page.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
Yes, there's much more, but the majority of the things that you use your browser for is just browsing the web.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
You don't use your browser to look at the UI.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Hopefully the UI gets out of the way so you can enjoy the web much more.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Thunderbird has a lot of UI, a million dialogues, a lot of message panes, a lot of options.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.000
It's just all the tool kit and UI and design system and ideas that come from Firefox,

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
they don't translate and adapt seamlessly on Thunderbird.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
And then these happen. We broke up.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
So these are all excerpts taken from Wikipedia.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
The Thunderbird development was just a burden.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
They decided to give it to the community, which was fantastic because community members stepped up and kept the project alive.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
The problem is that community members were, the majority of them were engineers.

04:20.000 --> 04:28.000
And when you leave the user interface choice to an engineer, everything goes great, right?

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
Like they, oh, we have so much space on this toolbar. Let's add another button.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
Where's the option? Let's put in a sub-menu, a sub-menu, a sub-menu.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
It's fine. Users will find it.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.000
So it turned into the most powerful email client that no one can fully use.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Still off today. As off today, we get email supports and requests like,

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
I wish I could use Thunderbird, but it doesn't do this or it doesn't do that.

04:55.000 --> 05:01.000
And our answer is mostly, well, it can, but you need to enable it from the preferences

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
but in the sub-menu and also change this dialogue a little bit.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
And now you can use it the way you want.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.000
So this is an example of the steps that you need to do if you want to move an email to a folder without using a mouse.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
This is the only access point to keep it fantastic, right?

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
Like very easy if you do a wrong step, everything closes all of a sudden, fucking great.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
And then we have other examples that are like the pinnacle of user experience.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
We have our filters dialogue. You can create custom filters.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
It's extremely powerful. It's an amazing piece of engineering.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
But oh my God, what is that?

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
A lot of users, they say, I prefer to go into Gmail and set the filters there because it's easier.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
We have these situations when you need to change something, you need to open a dialogue

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
and then open another dialogue from a dialogue and then another dialogue and then you can do your things.

05:49.000 --> 05:56.000
Or this, which is for a lot of our users, this is the most optimal interface ever created.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
I can see everything all at once and again, I have stacks of toolbars.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
What can I ask more for that?

06:02.000 --> 06:11.000
So obviously this translated in slowly losing users because what was working 20 years ago

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
and what was working 10 years ago in terms of what was the standard of user interface and user experience,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
it's completely different.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
The level of interest in an approach to accessibility and assistive technologies

06:25.000 --> 06:33.000
or just the heuristic researches and discoveries, they are completely different from what they were even five years ago.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
And that translates to user retention.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
Users will see Gmail is easier to use.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Yes, there are a lot of other value propositions from like a webmail,

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
but even other applications are more enticing.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
They look a little bit more beautiful and things like that.

06:47.000 --> 06:54.000
So we had, yes, our absolutely fantastic community kept us alive and they continue.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
We kind of have a steady stagnant user base, but slowly, slowly declining.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
These tip down are December because people don't use email in December.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Thank God.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
But yeah, we were like, I don't know, 20 years, maybe a thunderbolt would die, like no more users.

07:09.000 --> 07:22.000
So whoever got this type of feedback from any of their users, this is kind of a silly but honest and knee-jerk reaction to any change

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
because users, they love their muscle memory.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
It's the most important thing, which is true.

07:30.000 --> 07:37.000
When you get comfortable with an interface and when you start doing things without actively thinking where to look for, it just becomes natural.

07:37.000 --> 07:43.000
And when you see someone like a designer stepping into a project, hey, I'm going to change everything because this is bad.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
The first reaction is like, fuck you.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
And this is a little formula and hopefully if there's any developer in here, you would appreciate this strict operator.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
This is a little formula that reminds myself sometimes.

07:57.000 --> 08:09.000
When you don't have any, any like zero user interface and user experience updates, you basically have a stagnant application, which doesn't mean that it's familiar.

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Familiarity doesn't mean that you cannot change anything.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
You cannot bring any improvements, any updates.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
You can maintain familiarity but without creating a stagnant environment.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
That's what we did.

08:22.000 --> 08:33.000
We created a new effort called Supernova because we literally wanted to blow things up and create new elements from these galaxy explosions.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
And this is a little screenshot.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
This was one or two.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
This is 115.

08:39.000 --> 08:49.000
It's not finished, but it looks like an email application from 2005 now rather than like 1992 or it was before.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.000
And you can go to Thunderbird.net, click on what's new.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
There's a little funny little slider.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.000
You can see the differences.

08:57.000 --> 09:05.000
The thing is we really focus on familiarity and muscle memory and retain the current user.

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
We didn't want to alienate our audience that for 20 years they kept using Thunderbird, even if it didn't have any substantial update.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.000
So rather than just saying we need to make this prettier, we need to make this look modern, which modern is a very relative concept.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
What is modern today is not modern tomorrow.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
Don't follow the trend.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
So we approached this from what are the improvements that we can do?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.000
And we started focusing on the first problem.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.000
We have a million and one features that users cannot discover, cannot find.

09:37.000 --> 09:45.000
The density control and font size control that we have here are very important because a lot of our users, they have multiple monitors with different DPI.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
Sometimes they plug and plug out inside like different monitors.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
They're going on laptop.

09:50.000 --> 09:59.000
And it depends on the operating system, especially in Linux, how the operating system talks with the application, how our gecko engine reacts to it.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Sometimes the density doesn't change.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Sometimes the font is a little bit too small, a little bit too big.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
These solve 50 bucks per month constantly.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
My font doesn't work.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
My density doesn't work.

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
We just exposed these on the primary menu and we made them, not in an option, sub-option, with like multiple text fields.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
Just a little thing and this is absolutely lovely.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
We focus primarily on accessibility.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Who cares about colors?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Who cares about, it's pretty, no.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
It is accessible.

10:30.000 --> 10:41.000
Users with mouse, keyboard assistive technologies, color blind users, can they actually use this without tabbing with the tab like 35 times and losing their minds?

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
Then we focus on consistent paradigms.

10:45.000 --> 10:52.000
Every tab in Thunderbird, if you open the address book, it looks from another application, the calendar from a third application and all these things.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
We start implementing some consistent paradigms.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
Let's create an accent primary color that we're going to use for primary buttons.

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
They use the same color to indicate user call to action or indicator.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
Let's create a color palette that is consistent across the space, consistent icons.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Also the icons were coming from Firefox.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
We didn't design our own icons.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
All the icons were coming from what the designer of Firefox did.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Incredible design that was working well for Firefox, not for us.

11:19.000 --> 11:26.000
So we decided to take in our hands and then fewer dialogues because before the address book, you want to edit a contact in the address book.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
You needed to open three dialogues.

11:28.000 --> 11:41.000
Now we have this crazy application called different panels and models and all like very, very intuitive and makes things much more easier and compatible with assistive technologies.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Obviously, our community loved it.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
It was like, thank you for doing this.

11:45.000 --> 11:54.000
We were waiting for it because the main complaint that we got was this is not familiar for me.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Like you broke my muscle memory.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I don't want to reuse Thunderbird.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I don't want to relearn how to use Thunderbird.

12:01.000 --> 12:10.000
And the majority of our audience, unfortunately, are like old engineers, like people in their 16, their 70s, asking your mom or your grandma,

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
please relearn everything from scratch is absolutely not going to fly.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
But something happened.

12:18.000 --> 12:32.000
The last little thing in at the end of August, 2023, we officially opened the faucet and upgraded all our users to Thunderbird 115 before we were trickling in and fixing bugs and regressions and things of that.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And now look at that.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
For the first time in six years, we're getting more users.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
It's absolutely beautiful.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
And the feedback that we're getting are incredible.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
We have two major feedback.

12:45.000 --> 12:54.000
One is I used to use Thunderbird in 2017 at a stop because it didn't have this or it was looking outdated.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
I was looking for something different.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Now I'm back and it's perfect.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
I love it.

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
Or the other is I never used Thunderbird, but I tried and downloaded a couple of years ago.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
I hated it.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
So I just left it there and now they're trying it again and they're using it and we're getting new user, which is fantastic.

13:11.000 --> 13:21.000
So at the end of the day, visual change is good only, only exclusively if you do it tastefully and you do it with a controlling intuitive upgrade path.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
So thank you.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
You've actually got like 10 minutes left.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Holy shit.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
Let's do this again.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Okay.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
We've got a lot of time for questions.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
Yes, please tell me.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.000
Tell me everything.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
So remember repeat the question before you answer.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
Do we have questions from the room?

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
I see one there and one there.

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
So we'll go Mike.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Great.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Great talk.

13:53.000 --> 14:02.000
I'd be curious in terms of, I'm not sure what sort of like format you're getting at, but you've seen, I assume overall, user growth.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Yeah.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
Did you see a lot of your legacy users drop off?

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
We had a little bit of a drop off.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.000
We didn't, sorry.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Hey, I have 10 minutes.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
I can do whatever I want.

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
The lovely person asked if we have data to confirm if we saw any drop off in existing user.

14:23.000 --> 14:38.000
Yes, we had a little bit of a drop off, but we didn't pull any actual numbers so I cannot speak like specifically, but in general, we have an average of 15 million active users per month.

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
And the total complaints that I got of people very upset were around 200 messages.

14:44.000 --> 14:52.000
So it looks like as a first impact is like, oh my God, our community is absolutely upset, but the rest of the 15 million didn't really care.

14:52.000 --> 14:57.000
So always take the grain of salt off, like take them with a grain of salt.

14:57.000 --> 15:05.000
When you get user complaints, is that really the voice of the whole community or is just the knee jerk reaction of you're changing things I hated.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
So fuck you.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
Thank you.

15:09.000 --> 15:14.000
You mentioned focus on accessibility.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
Yeah.

15:15.000 --> 15:21.000
I have some tests that interact with under birth using accessibility API.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
Yeah.

15:22.000 --> 15:31.000
And I noticed from version to version it's working worse like less descriptions and left on the notes, etc.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Is it going to be improved with this?

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
100%.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
So that's our question.

15:37.000 --> 15:45.000
The user is asking this lovely person is asking throughout the years, which version do you remember?

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
Whatever throughout the years, the accessibility got worse than worse.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
And if we're going to address this and we're improving it.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
Yes, 100%.

15:54.000 --> 16:04.000
The major problem is that what we were using before all those message list and folder pain were and this is probably you're going to collapse some of you.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
The user interface was generating C++.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
That's a Zool 3.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I don't know Zool XUL.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Very easy to work with absolutely fantastic.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
It was easy to inspect everything in like, yeah.

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
We had like almost borderline zero control on that.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.000
So if things broke, it was very, very hard to figure out what broke.

16:26.000 --> 16:32.000
Now our new folder pain message list is a virtual HTML list box.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
It's just an order list with list items.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
We need to rebuild all the accessibility that we broke in the past 10 years.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
It's going to take us a while, but we collaborated with visually impaired users from our community.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
We do a lot of beta testing.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.000
Version 115 is later a lot better.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
There's also a little thing which is funny.

16:55.000 --> 17:07.000
NVDA and JAWS, which are the most famous assistive technology softwares out there, because Thunderbird was so broken, they created layers to create compatibility with Thunderbird.

17:07.000 --> 17:11.000
And now those layers are broken because we removed the whole thing.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
So great.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
Okay.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
You go.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
One, two, and someone else.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Okay.

17:22.000 --> 17:29.000
So I initially was one of the absolute users and I might say it could have been improved a lot by communication.

17:29.000 --> 17:41.000
So as you see, even in the pictures, the default on the old version was much denser in the number of emails per screen.

17:41.000 --> 17:50.000
So the trick to be happy with the new version is to set your density much denser than you had previously, but this was not announced.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
So I had to learn it through Hacker News.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000
Okay.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
So the user, that's not a question, but it's fine.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
The user is saying that the default density is much more spread out.

18:01.000 --> 18:05.000
There's much more white space compared to the old one.

18:05.000 --> 18:13.000
So in the previous version, the button did not really do anything and it was well hidden, so everyone forgot about it.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
Yes.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
The density button was not this horrible.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
Yes, absolutely.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
We're going to talk later.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
I want to ask you why you need that density.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
So, you receive fewer emails.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.000
Is that it?

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
You receive fewer emails.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
No.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
Well, technically, a lot of designers might know this, but your focal point is actually like this big.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
So you don't need all the density.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
You have the perception of, I'm seeing everything.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
It's great.

18:37.000 --> 18:40.000
I was like, no, you're not that efficient if you have everything cramped as well.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
You need space.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
Faster to scroll your eyes than to scroll your mouth.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
Yes.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
There was another question.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah, there was another.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
There was, I think I saw her first.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
Yeah, one, two.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Yeah, good.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Dan, sorry.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
How do you market to users you may have lost to say, hey, try us again.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
We've changed.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
Okay.

19:03.000 --> 19:09.000
So you're asking how do we market and target users that we lost and change?

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
We don't really, right?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
They're still part of our community.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
They're still shouted at us.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
They tell us we're doing a terrible job.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
And then we show, hey, we made $9 million in donation this year.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
So I guess we're doing something right.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
And we're gaining 30% of users.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
So we don't, there's a certain point where you need to pick your battle.

19:26.000 --> 19:33.000
Like if this person is very upset, like what do I gain from servicing them specifically

19:33.000 --> 19:42.000
and their niche needs rather than the whole community that we were completely like not servicing.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
So, thank you.

19:44.000 --> 19:48.000
So I actually used it for like 15 or 20 years maybe.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
So thank you.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Thank you for using Thunderbird.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
I was actually mostly not contributing.

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
My point is like so I'm very happy to see more users and probably more money coming.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
And so the software is going to improve in 10 years.

20:04.000 --> 20:16.000
But do you actually really attribute these two weeks changes or is it because honestly like for the past five years or like, okay, seven years ago, let's say,

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
Cernibur was dead for a long time.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Like, Mozilla was not taking care of it anymore.

20:22.000 --> 20:30.000
Other people were thinking should it move to like, like we talked about many different people starting to take care of Cernibur.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
So I was wondering if the peak now that we are seeing is just something like, okay, the project is back on track.

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
There are actually people taking care of it again.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000
So if I ask for something, someone is actually going to listen to this.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.000
Like also a lot of good work has been done on the booth like the performance.

20:48.000 --> 20:55.000
For me, the increase can be like something bigger than new weeks improvement.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah, so yeah.

21:00.000 --> 21:11.000
So the question is can we make sure how are we sure that the user increases attributed to exclusively UX improvement and not all the other things that happen throughout the years.

21:11.000 --> 21:16.000
Like Thunderbird has more development and there's more trust in the community, all these things.

21:16.000 --> 21:31.000
So Thunderbird was announced that it was part of MZLA, had a new for profit, and we started releasing monthly beta releases and ESR.

21:31.000 --> 21:38.000
We had all the resources in, I was hired in 2019.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
Our marketing and outreach for the user continue constantly throughout these four years.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Users, the clients still going down.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
We kept having the same feedback.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
Oh, Thunderbird is not that fantastic.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
I'm going to try it.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Oh, it looks like from 1999.

21:53.000 --> 21:59.000
That's, yes, is not 100% UX exclusive success.

21:59.000 --> 22:07.000
It's a lot of other things, but your user, when they use an application, the first reaction should be, oh, wow, this is nice.

22:07.000 --> 22:14.000
And if you don't have that, it doesn't matter if it's a well supported or they hold the features.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
There's the whole thing, but the entry barrier is absolutely terrible.

22:20.000 --> 22:31.000
Your general population, not the open source enthusiasts and the privacy focused person that really knows that one's Thunderbird, the general population will just like don't care about any of that.

22:31.000 --> 22:40.000
So yes, it's a combination of a lot of things, but if you don't, if the first impression is yuck, nobody's going to stay around.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
You can take one more question.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
One more question.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I saw him, sorry.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.000
You showed operating system themes, not messing with the UI.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.000
Is that still a problem?

22:55.000 --> 23:00.000
Where are the canonical people here?

23:01.000 --> 23:09.000
The person is asking if the operating system changes are still the compatibility with the operating system still messing things up.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Yes, because we release on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
Windows and Mac OS is pretty stable.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
They have the human interface guidelines.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
We kind of stick with them with those pretty quite frankly.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
We still have bug reports of my custom arch with KDE on Dracula theme doesn't work with your theme.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
Can you fix it?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
So yes, it's still a problem.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
Unfortunately, we rely on the gecko render engine.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
So if Firefox fixes it, we get it.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.000
But it's very, very tricky and we have limited amount of resources.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.000
Our front-end team and designer, we're only six people in total and we're services 20 million active users.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
So it's a pill bottle.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
Can we show some love to...

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Thank you.
