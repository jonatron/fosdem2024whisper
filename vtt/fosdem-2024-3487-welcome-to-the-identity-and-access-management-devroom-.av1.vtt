00:00.000 --> 00:12.760
We are starting the second edition of the Identity and Access Management Dev Room.

00:12.760 --> 00:18.760
My name is Alexander Bakavoy, this is Iker Petroza.

00:18.760 --> 00:22.440
Formally we are the ones who organize this Dev Room.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.440
If you have any questions, anything, please talk to us.

00:27.440 --> 00:34.440
A guy in blue t-shirt will be the guy moderating a specific session.

00:34.440 --> 00:41.440
I'm not talking about him or Trevino specifically because this is a moving target.

00:41.440 --> 00:46.440
We have one t-shirt for people who will be moderating.

00:47.440 --> 00:53.440
I wanted to do a bit of history reminder.

00:53.440 --> 00:57.440
We had the first edition six years ago.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.440
It was, I think, a successful one.

01:00.440 --> 01:06.440
We got roughly the same amount of talks we will hear today.

01:06.440 --> 01:11.440
They were as much diverse and wide in topics.

01:11.440 --> 01:26.440
Also, we had quite a lot of people coming to listen to the point that at some talks we actually caught the FOSDMQ sickness.

01:26.440 --> 01:33.440
There were like 50 people in the room, there was a smaller room and hundreds of people waiting to get into the room.

01:33.440 --> 01:40.440
So, truly FOSDMQ sickness part that we enjoyed six years ago.

01:40.440 --> 01:48.440
I hope we will have enough space because this is twice the room, the first one.

01:48.440 --> 01:56.440
For this year, as you all know, this URI probably has a whole schedule.

01:56.440 --> 02:08.440
You can get access to all the things that I will just remind to speakers here that please upload slides.

02:08.440 --> 02:16.440
Using this new interface to pre-talks, but please upload them roughly like half an hour before your talk

02:16.440 --> 02:23.440
so that people who will be watching this live stream and they have some reference point and can see their...

02:23.440 --> 02:33.440
You can omit things from the slides that you want to make a surprise during the live presentation so that it's not spoiled.

02:33.440 --> 02:37.440
But it's typically good to have it uploaded.

02:37.440 --> 02:49.440
Since this is a smaller room and we don't have another mic, please, when you're talking and hearing some questions, please repeat the questions

02:49.440 --> 02:52.440
so that it's recorded in the mic.

02:53.440 --> 03:02.440
Finally, we have smaller slides, but please leave one or two minutes so that we can change to the next one

03:02.440 --> 03:07.440
and don't get the time taken from the next one.

03:07.440 --> 03:16.440
And since this is largely done by automation and volunteers,

03:16.440 --> 03:26.440
you will get an email from the video team that will give you a link with the details of your presentation recording.

03:26.440 --> 03:35.440
And you need to act on that. Preferably if you have time today or at most tomorrow

03:35.440 --> 03:39.440
so that they can re-encode the video and publish it.

03:39.440 --> 03:51.440
There will be an interface where you get to set where the talk starts and ends and maybe not in our rooms, we have one mic or maybe two.

03:51.440 --> 03:58.440
And in some other rooms they also have more mics and you can choose which audio you're taking.

03:58.440 --> 04:08.440
And once you set this off and signed off on that video, it gets re-encoded and published automatically on the schedule page.

04:08.440 --> 04:20.440
For all the people who missed your talk, they will be able to get the recording and how fast they will get it depends on you as a presenter.

04:20.440 --> 04:26.440
So, yeah, and now Iker does an overview.

04:26.440 --> 04:32.440
You forgot one thing regarding the video meeting that you need to make sure that you sound correctly.

04:32.440 --> 04:38.440
I forgot to say that yes, you need to check that you sound correctly in the video.

04:38.440 --> 04:43.440
Last year's talks. This one wasn't very good at the beginning.

04:43.440 --> 04:49.440
Yep. So, now it's to you.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.440
Okay, so my name is Iker.

04:53.440 --> 04:59.440
Well, this is my first post-dem. I hope you are enjoying it as much as I'm doing it.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.440
And, well, this Identity and Access Management Dev Room is about Identity and Access Management.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.440
We have several talks regarding passwordless.

05:07.440 --> 05:13.440
We also have multi-factor authentication, signals unknown, user federation.

05:13.440 --> 05:18.440
And, well, just in short, I hope you are enjoying it a lot.

05:18.440 --> 05:23.440
Leave space to the next one, do the next speaker to prepare everything.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.440
And we are all volunteers.

05:25.440 --> 05:38.440
So, if you find that something is not correct or just fix it or tell it to us so that we can, you know, try to fix it and have everything correct.

05:38.440 --> 05:43.440
I don't have much else to say, so thank you and have fun.
