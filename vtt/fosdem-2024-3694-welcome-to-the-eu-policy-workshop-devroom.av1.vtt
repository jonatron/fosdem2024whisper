00:00.000 --> 00:11.480
So good morning everybody, welcome to the open source in the European Legislative Landscape

00:11.480 --> 00:13.200
Devereux.

00:13.200 --> 00:18.280
I have a confession to make which is that we applied for this devereux two days before

00:18.280 --> 00:25.000
the end of the closing deadline and we have made it up as we went along after unexpectedly

00:25.000 --> 00:27.960
being awarded a devereux.

00:27.960 --> 00:33.440
So the whole day is very organic but it has a very important purpose.

00:33.440 --> 00:40.640
We've discovered that the European Union has noticed that devices contain software and

00:40.640 --> 00:43.440
that the software needs regulating.

00:43.440 --> 00:50.720
And they have started doing an amazingly effective job at writing software into regulation.

00:50.720 --> 00:56.040
So one of the people we have with us today, Benjamin Bergel, wherever Benjamin is, he's

00:56.040 --> 01:01.360
presumably, I know he's here but he's hiding.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.800
He was involved in writing the NIST 2 directive and then he went on to write the CRA and he

01:07.800 --> 01:14.840
is surprisingly expert if you have a low opinion of EU policy officers or unsurprisingly expert

01:14.840 --> 01:19.040
if you know that they're all generally brilliant people.

01:19.040 --> 01:24.840
However we discovered that the EU's model of what open source is is that it is low quality

01:24.840 --> 01:32.040
components full of defects that are created by hobbyists in their basements.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.280
And the regulations rather reflected that.

01:35.280 --> 01:41.240
And so we found over the last year it was very valuable to engage with the regulators.

01:41.240 --> 01:47.560
Today what we want to do is not talk about the technical details of any regulations but

01:47.560 --> 01:56.600
rather gather the feedback of the open source community so that we can document the reflections

01:56.600 --> 02:02.120
and outlooks of the community for the benefit of the commission as they go forward in regulating

02:02.120 --> 02:04.160
within their digital agenda.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.000
So we've arranged for there to be four workshops today.

02:07.000 --> 02:16.040
The first workshop that is starting in six minutes is a workshop on the consequences of

02:16.040 --> 02:20.360
the Cyber Resilience Act and the Product Liability Directive.

02:20.360 --> 02:28.120
Then the second workshop which starts at 11.15 is going to look at how we engage with policy

02:28.120 --> 02:30.640
makers as a FOS community.

02:30.640 --> 02:38.520
The third workshop which is at 1.20 is going to look at how we can assist in getting more

02:38.520 --> 02:43.280
free and open source software in use by public administrations.

02:43.280 --> 02:47.720
And the fourth workshop is going to look at how the free and open source community can

02:47.720 --> 02:55.080
come alongside the task force that is implementing the DMA and the DSA and promote interoperability

02:55.080 --> 03:00.240
given that the best path to interoperability is not standards but rather the implementation

03:00.240 --> 03:03.320
of standards in shared open source packages.

03:03.320 --> 03:06.600
So that's our agenda for today.

03:06.600 --> 03:12.400
We have some ground rules that you'll see again during the day.

03:12.400 --> 03:19.360
First of all we encourage you if you are like me and you talk a lot to maybe talk less

03:19.360 --> 03:25.200
and to encourage and leave space for other people to express their opinions.

03:25.200 --> 03:31.760
We encourage you to always be holding the microphone when you speak in a session where

03:31.760 --> 03:37.520
notes are being taken and that is all of them because today we have four rapporteurs

03:37.520 --> 03:39.520
free to the workshops.

03:39.520 --> 03:44.680
The rapporteurs will be listening to what's said, noting down the substance and writing

03:44.680 --> 03:50.280
a written report for us to send to the commission after the workshop.

03:50.280 --> 03:55.560
When you do start speaking please make sure every time you start speaking you indicate

03:55.560 --> 04:01.320
who you are and if you have an affiliation what your affiliation is.

04:01.320 --> 04:07.480
Please note that this is a very complex topic and we know that it's a very complex topic

04:07.480 --> 04:11.600
so please be open to new ideas.

04:11.600 --> 04:18.600
When we run into an intractable problem let's note it and move on to something we can fix

04:18.600 --> 04:21.520
rather than obsess about the obstacle.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.480
And finally there's two ways of looking at this.

04:24.480 --> 04:29.880
Please observe the FOSDEM code of conduct or if you prefer let's have fun and make

04:29.880 --> 04:30.560
new friends.
