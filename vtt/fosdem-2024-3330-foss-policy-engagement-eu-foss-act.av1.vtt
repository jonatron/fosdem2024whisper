00:00.000 --> 00:11.600
Thank you very much. So we spent the last 15 months thinking about all the problems that

00:11.600 --> 00:16.840
could be solved, caused by a piece of e-legislation. At the same time we were trying to think in

00:16.840 --> 00:21.200
a positive sense, what could we do to get something positive? How could we have something

00:21.200 --> 00:27.760
useful? And so one idea that I started thinking about was an EU FAS Act. However, after discussing

00:27.760 --> 00:32.280
this with a few people I agreed this is not the time for a EU FAS Act. It's not certain

00:32.280 --> 00:37.440
that it would get done correctly. So I just added a little bit of punctuation there to

00:37.440 --> 00:50.160
get myself out of that one. So the idea is when we saw the CRA and we saw that it was

00:50.160 --> 00:56.920
a very long document with a single paragraph about free and open source software, we started

00:57.920 --> 01:01.880
thinking about is this the right way to do legislation. Free and open source software

01:01.880 --> 01:05.720
has been getting bigger and bigger over the past few years. And so I looked for a few studies

01:05.720 --> 01:12.800
and one study found that 76% of code bases are free software. And this could be biased

01:12.800 --> 01:16.960
in favour of free software because how do they get access to these code bases? But the same

01:16.960 --> 01:22.000
report also said 96% of the code bases contain free software. So you could imply from this

01:22.080 --> 01:25.880
that also some of the code bases that were not available would also contain free software.

01:25.880 --> 01:31.040
So another way of counting it was by NISA which is partly funded by the European Commission

01:31.040 --> 01:37.600
so there's some legitimacy there. And the average IT application is 70% open source

01:37.600 --> 01:45.080
components and this number it may be higher today because that was a 2019 number and it

01:45.080 --> 01:50.480
also concluded that this was already a doubling since 2014. So the actual number for 2023,

01:50.560 --> 01:57.440
2024 could already be a lot higher than that. So what we're trying to think about is in

01:57.440 --> 02:03.720
future if legislation was to be written is there a way we can ensure that the drafting

02:03.720 --> 02:09.640
matches the reality which today is that free and open source software should be the assumption.

02:09.640 --> 02:14.160
We should have texts that regulate software with us in mind and there should be a little

02:14.160 --> 02:18.360
paragraph at the top if you happen to decide that you absolutely must keep your source

02:18.400 --> 02:23.520
code secret then you have separate obligations but the default should be free and open source

02:23.520 --> 02:30.560
software. So the CRA was a lot of work. We heard from the Commission on Thursday that

02:30.560 --> 02:36.720
they put out a call for input and they got over 100 responses and only two of them mentioned

02:36.720 --> 02:40.240
free and open source software. So Openform Europe was one of the people who responded.

02:40.240 --> 02:45.560
I scanned the response, I couldn't find the other one if anyone knows who it was interested.

02:46.280 --> 02:52.320
But the thing is the response to the input we gave was on a fairly generic proposal,

02:52.320 --> 02:56.520
you know, we're going to do something in this domain and we gave a generic response of well,

02:56.520 --> 03:01.240
be careful. And so this is all we can do if we don't have the specifics of what is actually

03:01.240 --> 03:06.960
going to be regulated. Now, possibly due to the input we gave or due to other people's input,

03:06.960 --> 03:11.720
there was this one paragraph in the CRA and it was very useful. It gave us a starting point to

03:11.760 --> 03:16.920
have conversations. This one paragraph later got turned into pages and pages of text to improve

03:16.920 --> 03:22.840
the situation. But it was interesting that the CRA got written and then after the drafting of

03:22.840 --> 03:28.280
the CRA during 15 months of negotiations and meetings, the actual provisions that will

03:28.280 --> 03:36.040
affect free software got written. So what we were thinking of is what would be the principles

03:36.120 --> 03:43.120
which we would like to see in the way legislation is written in the European Union. And so one is

03:43.120 --> 03:49.680
that we would like the topic to be discussed at an earlier stage in detail and so preferably with

03:49.680 --> 03:53.080
all the people in this room, preferably in the most public way possible. But there are also

03:53.080 --> 03:57.240
internal bodies in the European Commission. The European Commission has an open source

03:57.240 --> 04:03.840
program office in ASPO and maybe, I don't want to hand them too much work, but maybe they could

04:03.880 --> 04:10.840
be consulted either to comment on the content or to be asked who should we be talking to. They

04:10.840 --> 04:19.280
currently have two staff, maybe that could be more. The question then is also raised of when

04:19.280 --> 04:24.920
we want to consult, when we want to talk about how will this impact us, who do we phone? And it's

04:24.920 --> 04:30.840
true, there is not a single industry association and it's not even an industry. So it is a difficult

04:30.880 --> 04:35.960
thing. However, we also have to try. And so first off, European Commission coming to FASTEM last

04:35.960 --> 04:40.640
year this year, it's a fantastic step and it's a fantastic way for them to get a feeling for who is

04:40.640 --> 04:48.040
actually behind all this software. But we are made up of small entities and they need funding if

04:48.040 --> 04:53.520
they're going to participate in any of all these meetings and all these procedures. And this already

04:53.520 --> 04:58.600
complicates the way we work together. At the same time, there are instruments in the European

04:58.640 --> 05:03.640
institutions that could be used. So there are high level expert groups for certain ICT and

05:03.640 --> 05:08.880
standardization topics and there are multi-stakeholder platforms and maybe there could be one for

05:08.880 --> 05:18.040
free and open source software. The second thing is that things should be clarified earlier. And so

05:18.040 --> 05:23.640
at the moment, the text of the CRA is complete. However, we're now going into two and a half,

05:23.680 --> 05:28.600
maybe three and a half years of negotiating 44 different standards with standard organizations

05:28.600 --> 05:36.640
where we're not well represented. It could be useful to have certain assurances that we will be

05:36.640 --> 05:40.720
taken into account and they're taking into account this category of software, which is the majority,

05:40.720 --> 05:46.320
should be a basic principle. And so this could go into the general text of legislation and then

05:46.320 --> 05:52.320
specifically on standards rather than a definition of open standards in the EU legal system, which

05:52.600 --> 05:57.920
says that if the standard is developed in an open process, it's an open standard, which leads to

05:57.920 --> 06:03.280
standards which we may not have access to. We don't know if we will have access to these standards

06:03.280 --> 06:09.880
that we can't implement in free and open source software. And so this idea of open standards

06:09.880 --> 06:14.520
freely implementable standards needs to be thought of in terms of patents, in terms of

06:14.520 --> 06:19.280
technologies, in terms of compatibility with our development and our business procedures.

06:20.240 --> 06:26.480
So with these, we hope that we would at the least, well, we hope that we will get access to all

06:26.480 --> 06:31.880
these standards and we hope that we will be able to use them. These things can be clarified in

06:31.880 --> 06:38.520
regulation 125 is up for review and maybe this is somewhere we can put these suggestions in.

06:38.520 --> 06:47.520
So in summary, what I wanted to say is that what we're hoping will happen is that the European

06:47.560 --> 06:53.720
institutions will discuss early and clarify early and that would help us out a lot. But from our

06:53.720 --> 06:59.000
side, we also have to figure out what exactly we're asking them to do. And when we're talking to

06:59.000 --> 07:02.960
specific people, we have to make sure that we're asking those people to do something that is within

07:02.960 --> 07:08.880
their power. And so from our side, there's also if we want to get to the stage where we could trust

07:08.880 --> 07:14.960
the EU institutions to write an EU FAS Act, we also have to improve the way we interact and make

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
sure that we're asking for the right things and giving them the right input. With that, when I'm

07:20.000 --> 07:25.240
chairing meetings, I'm quite strict with timekeeping and I like to eat my own dog food, so I'm going

07:25.240 --> 07:27.520
to cut myself off and thank you all very much.
