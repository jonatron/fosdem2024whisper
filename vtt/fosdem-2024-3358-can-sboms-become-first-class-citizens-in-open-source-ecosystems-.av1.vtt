WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.360
Thank you for allowing me to come here, the organizers.

00:15.360 --> 00:20.960
I am almost new to the S1 community out here.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.600
My name is Sal Nielsen.

00:22.600 --> 00:27.320
I am part of something called the SEPA security working group.

00:27.320 --> 00:36.400
We work on supply chain stuff and security on the oldest open source software repository

00:36.400 --> 00:37.400
system out there.

00:37.400 --> 00:41.080
It started in 1995 with lots and lots of...

00:41.080 --> 00:46.000
Let's see if we can switch the slides here.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.320
There we are.

00:48.320 --> 00:55.160
And I am here with software and all that implies with developers publishing there and downstream

00:55.160 --> 01:01.160
in Debian and Redats and all the systems out there being used all over the world.

01:01.160 --> 01:08.000
And like 14,000 developers still, more than 14,000 packages.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.880
So it's a real system.

01:09.880 --> 01:13.280
It's out there, it's working and people are earning a lot of money on this stuff so they

01:13.280 --> 01:15.360
want to keep it going.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.440
And now we are having a new reality coming with legislation.

01:20.440 --> 01:25.040
So I am trying to today bring the open source supply chain perspective.

01:25.040 --> 01:31.400
This is recently finished slides so please excuse me if I am either finished early or

01:31.400 --> 01:34.400
late I will try to do my best to make you happy.

01:34.400 --> 01:41.160
So I talked to a bunch of the people who are involved in the middle parts of this chain

01:41.160 --> 01:43.760
of events.

01:43.760 --> 01:46.280
They often say why should I care about this stuff?

01:46.280 --> 01:49.960
We already do a key track of dependencies on that one.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.680
We have the new formats and this is not my problem.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.720
If you pay me maybe we can talk.

01:56.720 --> 02:03.400
This is actually, this is paraphrasing but the essence of the discussions are like some

02:03.400 --> 02:05.760
of the blog posts are like I am not your supplier.

02:05.760 --> 02:09.560
It's actually like that out there.

02:09.560 --> 02:12.680
As I can confirm that notion.

02:12.680 --> 02:20.920
Then reality arrives and end users or use all the software are obliged by the threat

02:20.920 --> 02:25.720
of fines to keep track of all the dependencies and what is happening with them so that we

02:25.720 --> 02:30.400
can't get all those horrible security situations going on.

02:30.400 --> 02:37.320
That means they need authority and up to date information from the utmost upstream sources.

02:37.320 --> 02:42.760
And to do that you actually have to have the supply chain bits and pieces and steps play

02:42.760 --> 02:47.360
along in this game so that we can get all the good stuff.

02:47.400 --> 02:51.800
Like figure out where stuff comes from, check it up against very built-in databases and

02:51.800 --> 02:53.200
all that good stuff.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.560
We like that.

02:55.560 --> 03:01.720
So I am researching, looking around what the documentation tried to learn, this whole

03:01.720 --> 03:08.400
S-bound thing, reading documents from the US government and all kinds of interesting

03:08.400 --> 03:12.200
organizations like many of you probably have done.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.080
Very interesting stuff.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.720
Then I find this thing.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.240
This is from my nice tea.

03:20.240 --> 03:33.200
They tried to describe where I spawned the show in, show up and there's something wrong

03:33.200 --> 03:34.200
there.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.800
There's no supply chain mentioned at all in there.

03:36.800 --> 03:45.720
It says third party software enters here and there's no open source or processes or communities

03:45.720 --> 03:47.720
or anything.

03:47.720 --> 03:55.240
It seems almost like there's a lot of, this is a pattern, it seems a lot of documentation

03:55.240 --> 04:00.760
and even in some of the standards it's just assumed there's something going on here.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.880
And well, it isn't.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.200
There's stuff going on.

04:05.200 --> 04:09.760
And I would like you to just get a little picture of what's going on there to draw a

04:09.760 --> 04:12.520
simplified supply chain.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.400
We have an author at the top who does stuff, publishes something.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.800
There's a language ecosystem they publish on.

04:17.800 --> 04:21.320
They also collaborate with others on a collaboration platform.

04:21.320 --> 04:27.800
So the language ecosystem would be the PIPIs or the NPMs or the C-Pants collaboration

04:27.800 --> 04:32.000
ecosystem would be the GitOps and GitLabs and all that stuff.

04:32.000 --> 04:38.400
And they are sources for downstream package.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.400
Oops, sorry.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.800
There we have it.

04:45.800 --> 04:49.160
So that one, the red one, that's where I come from.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.600
That's the C-Pan and then PIMS.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.760
And we care about the infrastructure and how that happens and making sure that only the

04:55.760 --> 04:59.280
right people get to upload software and that it's published and available and all that

04:59.280 --> 05:00.600
good stuff.

05:00.600 --> 05:05.800
But the downstream of us, we have a packaging ecosystems.

05:05.800 --> 05:13.560
These folks here, that's the Debian and the Red Hats and all kinds of places that compile

05:13.560 --> 05:18.000
stuff for their own environment and make sure it's available in a consistent and available

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
manner.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.880
But they also feed into themselves.

05:21.880 --> 05:26.360
Like downstream of Debian you find Ubuntu.

05:26.360 --> 05:33.640
And sometimes the packages here are patched because of upstream availability or you have

05:33.640 --> 05:37.160
to back port security fixes.

05:37.160 --> 05:42.320
And there's a package there that sometimes I have to talk with a curator about which of

05:42.320 --> 05:48.760
the software pipelines you should publish one package.

05:48.760 --> 05:52.360
Because some of them are LTS pipelines.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.440
You don't want to do stuff there that you can do in another one.

05:56.440 --> 06:01.600
And then of course you have to make it all available so that the developers, some business

06:01.600 --> 06:10.280
can do their work and all that magic so that it can put to something production environment

06:10.280 --> 06:11.960
and make people happy.

06:11.960 --> 06:18.520
All these boxes here, I try to make it so that there are boxes that represent a role

06:18.640 --> 06:23.240
that cares about something that is supposed to be in an S-bomb file.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.880
I'll try to be quick.

06:26.880 --> 06:35.240
So these bits here, that's actually this one except for that the third-party software

06:35.240 --> 06:42.080
arrow here, the tiny little grey one there is doing some seriously heavy lifting.

06:42.080 --> 06:45.840
That needs to stop, seriously.

06:45.960 --> 06:49.360
And there's another one, second-party software.

06:49.360 --> 06:51.280
We are not third-party software doing this.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.280
We're second-party.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.560
We're partners.

06:53.560 --> 07:00.880
When people say we can get third-party software from open source, no, we get second-party.

07:00.880 --> 07:05.880
When you accept a license, you're actually getting a partner, someone you are supposed

07:05.880 --> 07:06.880
to cooperate with.

07:06.880 --> 07:11.240
Most people don't but they're still there and expected and you need to know about that

07:11.240 --> 07:15.560
and people who make decision management, they have to know about this.

07:15.600 --> 07:21.200
That means anyone who writes documentation and teaches this kind of stuff needs to stop

07:21.200 --> 07:25.320
calling open source as a third-party source of software.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.080
That's just insane.

07:28.080 --> 07:33.040
Second-party software means people like these actual people working on infrastructure out

07:33.040 --> 07:37.600
there get ignored, basically.

07:37.600 --> 07:44.040
And that's not a good way to get the inclusion and the support from that software supply

07:44.080 --> 07:49.200
chain people and the ecosystem that you actually depend on.

07:49.200 --> 07:52.440
So, okay, who are these people?

07:52.440 --> 07:55.400
They're, in fact, your open source colleagues.

07:55.400 --> 08:00.880
In fact, they are your unpaid open source colleagues.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.200
Just so you know that.

08:03.200 --> 08:09.280
So stop treating them as a stranger, start treating them as a colleague, talk with them,

08:09.320 --> 08:14.600
interact with them, teach them and learn from them as usual colleagues do in a healthy

08:14.600 --> 08:15.600
environment.

08:15.600 --> 08:20.040
Of course, if you don't have any healthy environment at work, maybe your work should

08:20.040 --> 08:23.280
go do something else or quit or something.

08:23.280 --> 08:31.600
So to make S-Bomb become first-class citizens in open source ecosystem, make open source

08:31.600 --> 08:36.040
ecosystem first-class citizens in the S-Bomb community.

08:36.040 --> 08:38.520
Please do that.

08:38.520 --> 08:45.800
Don't just put them behind a miniscule with one pixel wide arrow that says third-party

08:45.800 --> 08:47.600
software enters here.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.800
That's just so bad and wrong.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.600
It's horrible.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.360
So there we have that.

08:54.360 --> 08:57.040
And don't, yeah, they are your partners.

08:57.040 --> 09:01.840
Please, it's a good thing to have them on your team, even if they're living somewhere

09:01.840 --> 09:03.320
and you don't pay them.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.520
They're competent people and they actually do want to help you.

09:06.520 --> 09:10.240
Like if you've treated them badly, they'll just say, this is your problem and see if

09:10.240 --> 09:11.240
you can fix it.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.240
No, you can't.

09:14.240 --> 09:24.120
And in a way, if you want something happened with somebody you don't have a monetary relationship

09:24.120 --> 09:29.360
with, you have to treat them as friends and with respect and help them if they have a

09:29.360 --> 09:31.280
problem and communicate and stuff.

09:31.280 --> 09:37.720
And this is the good way to operate if you want to have a supply chain in on the S-Bomb

09:37.720 --> 09:38.720
game.

09:38.720 --> 09:45.720
So I hope this is a message that you can find useful and adopt in your work in years to

09:45.720 --> 09:46.720
come.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.720
Thank you.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.720
If you have any questions, maybe we'll have a room for one or two.

09:51.720 --> 09:58.720
One question?

09:58.720 --> 10:08.720
I've been involved in some of the groups that produce the thing that we should show them.

10:08.720 --> 10:14.720
I think there may be a miscommunication between them because that third-party perspective,

10:14.720 --> 10:20.160
it wasn't planned to offend anyone.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.720
Anybody can be a third-party when you're developing, right?

10:22.720 --> 10:25.720
So I think it's just not you.

10:25.720 --> 10:30.600
But in fact, some of the work that some of the work that they're doing has been, you

10:30.600 --> 10:35.720
know, approaching those language communities and helping them build their, for example,

10:35.720 --> 10:40.960
involved with the BIPA Foundation and their efforts to create their own S-Bomb.

10:40.960 --> 10:47.960
So I think if it's a miscommunication, then we just need to sit down and talk a little

10:47.960 --> 10:48.960
bit more.

10:48.960 --> 10:49.960
There might be a miscommunication, of course.

10:49.960 --> 10:50.960
You'll have to repeat that.

10:50.960 --> 10:53.600
Yes, there's a long comment here.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.800
There might be miscommunications out there.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.000
And of course, my perspective comes from one community.

10:59.000 --> 11:05.080
All the communities who might be more resourceful, like the Python community, are easier and

11:05.080 --> 11:09.120
don't feel that it's, of course, not meant as an insult.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.640
And of course it is.

11:10.640 --> 11:16.760
But I think my point still stands that by treating open-source communities as partners,

11:16.760 --> 11:22.240
you get all the benefits, even if it's a small community like mine or a big one.

11:22.240 --> 11:27.040
So I think, thank you for your comment.

11:27.040 --> 11:33.200
I'll still mean what I mean.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.200
You haven't changed my mind.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.200
Thank you very much.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.200
Okay, that was it.

11:38.200 --> 11:39.200
Thank you.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.200
Thank you.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.200
Thank you.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.200
Thank you.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.200
Thank you.

11:43.200 --> 11:44.200
Thank you.

11:44.200 --> 11:45.200
Thank you.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.200
Thank you.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.200
Thank you.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.200
Thank you.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.200
Thank you.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.200
Thank you.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.200
Thank you.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.200
Thank you.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.200
Thank you.

11:53.200 --> 11:54.200
Thank you.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.200
Thank you.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.200
Thank you.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.200
Thank you.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.200
Thank you.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.200
Thank you.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.200
Thank you.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.200
Thank you.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.200
Thank you.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.200
Thank you.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.200
Thank you.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.200
Thank you.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.200
Thank you.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.200
Thank you.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.200
Thank you.
