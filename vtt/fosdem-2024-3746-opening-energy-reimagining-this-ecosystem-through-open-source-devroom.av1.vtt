So welcome to the Energy Dev Room.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.400
We're all happy that you're here.

00:10.400 --> 00:16.200
For those who are speaking today, thank you for generating the content for the talks today.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.960
It was really exciting to see the proposals that came in.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.120
Just a couple, I guess like housekeeping rules of housekeeping.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.760
If there's an empty seat in the middle to make space for people who might be coming

00:28.760 --> 00:31.080
in, we're going to ask you to squeeze to the middle.

00:31.080 --> 00:35.000
It would be great if you could start already right now because I'm seeing some empty seats

00:35.000 --> 00:36.000
in the middle.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
We see empty seats, yeah.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.520
Squeeze together so there's people coming in so they can have somewhere to sit.

00:40.520 --> 00:41.520
Thank you.

00:41.520 --> 00:42.520
Anything else we need?
