00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Hello.

00:02.000 --> 00:07.000
Hi, everyone.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
My name is Gabriel.

00:10.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm a senior release engineer in Mozilla, and I work on

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
shipping Firefox on several different platforms.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
And today I'm here to talk to you guys about the new debt

00:25.000 --> 00:33.000
package that we are shipping to our Mozilla app repository.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
So first I'm going to talk a little bit about the journey

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
from Nile to stable builds, and then I'm going to

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
elaborate on some of the reasons why we thought a native

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
package might be useful for people on debt-based distributions.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
Okay.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
So early last year we started talking about setting up

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
an app repository for Mozilla product builds to help us

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
offer better support on Linux and stuff like that.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
It's really challenging to support distribution builds

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
for us because they're built with different compiler,

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
compiler versions.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
We can lead to some issues.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
Yeah, so first around October we started shipping a Nile package.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
And it was mostly for Nile community.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
This offered them some benefits like they didn't have to create

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
a desktop file.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
It also made it easier to update the binary.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
We have some data that actually suggests that we keep

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
people more up to date on these debt packages.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
I think probably because people update the whole system

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
components in the app store or...

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
Yeah, I wonder if they did other stuff.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Yeah, so I made a blog post about that.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
We got a lot of feedback from the community about

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
developer addition debt package.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
So we shipped that.

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
And now as a Firefox 122 we're shipping stable builds

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
to the repository.

02:36.000 --> 02:42.000
So we want you to be able to use Firefox how you want.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
And we know browsers are complex applications that support

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
many different use cases in people's lives.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.000
So we wanted to offer a native package in addition to

02:52.000 --> 02:58.000
SNAP, some flat packs.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
So this package, it's built in Mozilla infrastructure

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
from the Firefox source code without any modification.

03:09.000 --> 03:16.000
And the builds are supported by Mozilla directly.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Another good thing about the package is that we spend a lot

03:21.000 --> 03:31.000
of resources in optimizing the builds using PGO and things

03:31.000 --> 03:32.000
like that.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
And we wanted people to be able to get those benefits without

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
having to install our tar balls but rather getting packages

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
from this repository.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
I like this one.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.000
The updates are faster in case of chem spills.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
So the new app repository is plugged in directly to the

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Firefox release automation.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
So when we ship Firefox we upload the build directly

04:01.000 --> 04:06.000
to this repository as soon as it's available.

04:06.000 --> 04:15.000
Which is nice in case of security patches and things like that.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And here's a slide about how to install it.

04:18.000 --> 04:22.000
So you can visit that.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
The website right there and follow instructions,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
as I said.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
It's easy.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
It's just about adding the Mozilla app repository and

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
installing the package.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
The package is not perfect, surprise.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
So if you have feedback, if you actually try it out,

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
you can join our matrix channel and let us know if the package

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
is working for you, if you're having issues.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
And Mozilla will offer support.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Thank you.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Thank you.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Thank you.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Thank you.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Yes.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
Can you provide arm 64 builds?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Not yet.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Can you reply the question?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yeah.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
So here's if we offer arm 64 builds.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Not yet.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
We've been talking about it.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Yeah.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
Working on it.

05:25.000 --> 05:32.000
How are the bindries constructed for these packages?

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Do you use the native devian tooling to build it?

05:34.000 --> 05:38.000
Or do you basically repackage the same binders you would put

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
in a snap file?

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
It's the same binary that we've been shipping as a tarble

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
forever.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And yeah, we use the native devian tooling to repackage that

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
into a dev package.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
And that's what we put in the app repository.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I saw a hand over here.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I lost the person.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Someone had a question.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I don't have any questions.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
Oh, OK.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
You're tricking me now.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Yes, I see.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Coming.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
For those new in the room, this is a challenge for me to have

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
10K today.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
So don't hesitate to ask questions.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Hello.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Do you envision the dev package being like a stepping stone

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
towards the future where flat packs and snaps work well?

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
Or it will be like a permanent offering going forward?

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
I envision it as a permanent offering, just like an additional

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
option for people that like the packages.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
Yeah, makes sense.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
Why did you specifically choose dev as a packaging format?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
I didn't quite understand that.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Over like something like flat pack and have a custom repository

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
for that.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
Yeah, we already have a flat pack.

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
So this is just a different option for people that want to use

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
that packages.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
There's already a Mozilla flat pack repository?

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Yep.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
OK, I didn't know that.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
Good to know.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
Yes, go ahead.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
Sorry.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
The microphone is coming.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
So that we mentioned dev and flat pack, so the next question is

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
what about other packaging formats like OS native, for example,

07:30.000 --> 07:35.000
RPM or any other, like, I don't know, like something for

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
ARCH or anything else?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Yeah.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
I mean, that would be cool.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
There's definitely been conversations over RPM.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Yeah, we're thinking about it.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
My question will be if you're supporting dev now and all these

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
packages, is it not a burden for you to continue supporting more?

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Don't you have a plan to focus on something more straightforward?

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
It is true that we're taking on more work by supporting these

08:11.000 --> 08:16.000
packages, but I think we wanted to offer that support to the

08:16.000 --> 08:17.000
Linux community.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
That's, yes.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Thank you.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
Are you going to be working with projects like Debian to

08:34.000 --> 08:40.000
promote the Mozilla repositories for their, like, stable user

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
bases?

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, we, the Debian package maintainer is a Mozilla

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
employee, he helped us out with this.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
Yeah, it's just a different package, it's a different set of

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
trade-off, right?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
There's a lot of different guidelines when you build the

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
package for the distribution and different infrastructure

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
limitations and things like that.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
So it's more like an alternative package for people that find

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
it useful.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
Thank you.
