WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.920
So, we have stopped somewhere between regional and global perspective.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.840
Let's go global.

00:13.840 --> 00:21.120
The energy transition implies that thousands power systems around the world should be transformed

00:21.120 --> 00:25.600
with a pace which has never been seen before.

00:25.600 --> 00:33.200
And while we know what should look like the picture on the global level, that is still

00:33.200 --> 00:40.400
a question how should it be translated into regional levels.

00:40.400 --> 00:47.600
And what is special about this global scale energy planning problem is that we should

00:47.600 --> 00:53.680
plan decades ahead under deep uncertainties.

00:53.680 --> 01:00.600
And basically, we have quite an experience of energy policy failures.

01:00.600 --> 01:09.680
There have been quite a few cases when energy policy measures looked quite reasonable in

01:09.680 --> 01:20.880
advance but have resulted in failures, didn't lead to results which have been expected and

01:20.880 --> 01:23.960
these programs should be stopped.

01:23.960 --> 01:28.920
And that is why actually we need large scale energy modeling.

01:28.920 --> 01:38.000
We can replace this painful experience of rail war cultures by playing with the modeling,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.280
with energy models.

01:40.280 --> 01:48.680
And obvious advantages of open source, of open modeling and open data for energy planning

01:48.680 --> 01:54.920
has lead to a rapid increase in interest towards open energy modeling.

01:54.920 --> 01:59.120
And currently we have dozens of open energy models.

01:59.120 --> 02:04.160
We have a lot of open data sets relevant for energy modeling.

02:04.160 --> 02:10.800
But the picture is very incomplete and very patchy and there are regions in the world

02:10.800 --> 02:17.720
where we do not have even a net zero plan not to say open net zero plan.

02:17.720 --> 02:25.520
And that is exactly the gap which we are addressing as independent research initiative.

02:25.520 --> 02:34.240
PIPESIMEDS Earth aims to provide every part of the world with the open and reproducible

02:34.240 --> 02:38.120
and accessible energy systems model.

02:38.120 --> 02:43.480
What we are doing can be divided by three blocks.

02:43.480 --> 02:46.960
First of all we are doing open coding indeed.

02:46.960 --> 02:57.280
We are working with open data and we support open energy modeling community.

02:57.280 --> 03:01.200
So just a reminder about energy systems model.

03:01.200 --> 03:10.200
There are I would say power engineering models that is tools which we mainly have discussed

03:10.200 --> 03:17.200
today and there are also academic integrated assessment models.

03:17.200 --> 03:25.200
Academic integrated assessment models relate to the whole world and model global scale

03:25.200 --> 03:31.360
large scale interconnections between economics, environment and energy.

03:31.360 --> 03:39.920
And energy systems model that is kind of tool which translates these results of global assessment

03:39.920 --> 03:48.440
into plan of actions on the regional scale and obviously energy systems model should

03:48.440 --> 03:56.480
contain should reproduce in realistic way behavior of power systems.

03:56.480 --> 04:01.240
So that is what our workflow what our architecture look like.

04:01.240 --> 04:07.000
We have data block, we have modeling block and we have optimization block.

04:07.000 --> 04:14.400
Processing is orchestrated by snake mate and well probably the most trying part of the

04:14.400 --> 04:17.520
whole picture is work with data.

04:17.520 --> 04:26.040
There are different groups of data which effort operation of power system and there is also

04:26.040 --> 04:36.520
quite trivial but very impactful moment which relates directly to open data licensing.

04:37.040 --> 04:46.520
Basically we have starters data kit which we provide with the model to facilitate starting

04:46.520 --> 04:55.760
with modeling and I think the most frequent how to start request is about loading this

04:55.760 --> 05:03.680
starter kids data and many troubles by created by the fact that some open light some licenses

05:03.680 --> 05:09.520
of open data set do not allow redistribution or hosting of the data.

05:09.520 --> 05:19.960
So for some data we can collect data set and transform it in the form which is needed for

05:19.960 --> 05:26.440
energy system model to run while for others we do not have right to redistribute and have

05:26.520 --> 05:34.480
provide data to sources and connect them with the scripts to clean data and to prepare them

05:34.480 --> 05:44.520
to format which can be used by energy modeling and that is exactly chain of the whole link

05:44.520 --> 05:46.640
which breaks most frequently.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.080
So just open data in action.

05:50.080 --> 05:55.720
Environmental and climate that is part of the data workflow where we are truly grateful

05:55.720 --> 06:00.640
to open science community and to geophysical community.

06:00.640 --> 06:07.920
Basically that is the most unproblematic part of the whole workflow and we have package

06:07.920 --> 06:14.480
which translates geophysics to energy related parameters and basically that's it.

06:14.480 --> 06:23.680
Mainly it just works but as for electricity demand here the biggest problem is data availability.

06:23.680 --> 06:31.400
Indeed well what we need are hourly demand profile for every country of the world at least

06:31.400 --> 06:36.120
at national at aggregated national level.

06:36.120 --> 06:44.280
Indeed they data exist but they are not openly available and so we have a model we have machine

06:44.280 --> 06:53.040
learning model which has reproduced synthetic lot profiles but we would be very happy to

06:53.040 --> 07:02.720
improve flexibility and geographic coverage of this approach and access to the data to

07:02.720 --> 07:10.320
original lot profiles that is bottleneck currently for this group.

07:10.320 --> 07:17.280
Another important part, another part which is crucial if you are interested to model

07:17.280 --> 07:23.720
a power system of some arbitrary country is data on power infrastructure especially on

07:23.720 --> 07:34.320
grid and here we have used open street map database and developed a dedicated package

07:34.320 --> 07:46.160
which extracts power futures and allows to prepare model of grid topology.

07:46.160 --> 07:55.080
A part of that we have packages from pipes ecosystem which provides data on power plants

07:55.080 --> 08:05.880
on installed generation and a data set which collects and curates data on technology costs

08:05.880 --> 08:17.720
including forecasts for technology of technologies development.

08:17.720 --> 08:22.440
So and that is what modeling workflow look like.

08:22.440 --> 08:32.320
We take preprocessed data for power infrastructure and simplified topology preserving electrical

08:32.320 --> 08:43.320
properties of original power grid then cluster it to make the problem tractable and the next

08:43.320 --> 08:51.800
point is the most challengeable from the perspective of open source because open solvers are still

08:51.800 --> 09:01.320
overplayed by commercial solutions and here there is some room for improvement and we

09:01.320 --> 09:11.600
are collaborating with developers of open solver to improve the situation and now once the workflow

09:11.600 --> 09:21.400
has been established we had to be to ensure that it is actually possible to apply our model for

09:21.400 --> 09:25.680
every country in the world in the most literal sense.

09:25.680 --> 09:38.400
It has it took about almost a year work to introduce all the necessary fixes which account for

09:38.400 --> 09:47.120
different special futures and now it is done that is linked to it's another report which

09:47.120 --> 09:57.000
contains schemes for power systems of every country of the world of 193 United States country

09:57.000 --> 10:04.440
and we also have the code the source code which we have used to produce these schemes as images

10:04.440 --> 10:11.000
and if you are interested in model any country of the world please feel free to do that.

10:11.000 --> 10:21.040
Now let's look what actually can we obtain if we apply this approach that is net zero study for

10:21.040 --> 10:29.600
Nigeria which we have used in course of development the model which we have used as kind of proof of

10:29.600 --> 10:37.880
concept and the lessons which we have learned the most interesting output of this study has been

10:37.880 --> 10:49.080
that well net zero power system for Nigeria can be actually a little cheaper as compared to

10:49.080 --> 10:58.400
state of as compared with status quo indeed we haven't included we haven't accounted properly for

10:58.400 --> 11:06.680
uncertainties which exist for energy demand for Nigeria and this work should be certainly

11:06.680 --> 11:14.120
continued and applied to every country of the African continent but that is what does it look

11:14.120 --> 11:24.560
like that is which well that may be helpful to shift a paradigm and that is actually what is it all

11:24.560 --> 11:35.760
about and that is a study which has been done by in collaboration of pipe summits earth and open

11:35.760 --> 11:43.200
energy transition and a German think tank agor energy vendor they have considered Kazakhstan power

11:43.200 --> 11:53.160
system and the question is if it is feasible to implement solar in and wind faster as compared to

11:53.160 --> 12:02.160
with the current Kazakhstan current national development plans and the results are quite

12:02.200 --> 12:13.320
encouraging and being currently discussed on policy level and that is output of a master study for

12:13.320 --> 12:24.400
Saudi Arabia and that is a country where 99% of energy mix relays on fossil fuels a study which

12:25.000 --> 12:34.720
an author has done using pipes earth has shown that wind and solar actually can have quite well

12:34.720 --> 12:44.320
quite a place in power system of Saudi Arabia and it isn't so expensive as it could be expected

12:45.120 --> 12:55.520
that is the case when data accessibility data availability is a big issue so this this results

12:55.520 --> 13:02.760
are quite preliminary because more advanced optimization methods are needed to account for

13:02.760 --> 13:11.400
this uncertainty and also account for all pathway all transformation pathway but what is important

13:11.640 --> 13:19.720
what is an effect what is an impact of this study is translating conversations translating

13:19.720 --> 13:27.120
discussion about possible futures for fossil fuel relate countries from purely

13:28.120 --> 13:40.000
hypothec hypothec level to a level of numbers and that is a case for Bolivia case when South

13:40.000 --> 13:47.400
America when networks of South America are considered and that is region where data of

13:47.400 --> 13:55.200
open street map data have not so good quality so it has been needed to introduce quite some

13:55.280 --> 14:03.800
tricks to restore topology and the resulted model has been successfully validated for energy

14:03.800 --> 14:11.680
for dispatch on the national level so it works even if you don't have data of such excellent

14:11.680 --> 14:20.320
quality in open street map and that is a case for Malaysia we have considered decrobanization of

14:20.400 --> 14:32.800
industry and in Malaysia the local the local feature is well renewable sources renewable

14:32.800 --> 14:40.760
potential is not so excellent so we have shown that it is basically possible to decrobonize one

14:40.760 --> 14:48.280
bright branch of energy sector but if we would speak about the whole national economics it looks

14:48.360 --> 14:58.760
like it makes absolute sense to include into modeling into discussion not only traditional

14:58.760 --> 15:08.280
on wind off wind and photovoltaic also something more exotic like floating solar or probably to

15:08.280 --> 15:19.560
consider cross-country interconnections so and last but not least community is essential part of

15:19.560 --> 15:31.040
the whole story we have different channel of communications and we are very interested that

15:31.040 --> 15:38.360
is essential for now for us to build global community as we have seen there are some countries of

15:38.360 --> 15:48.080
the world where there are still a lot of modeling evidence available where efforts of researchers

15:48.080 --> 15:56.640
and developers are still focused but energy transition is a global thing and if we wanted to

15:56.640 --> 16:06.240
work we need to provide tool we need to involve people around the whole world and we can unfortunately

16:06.240 --> 16:16.880
confirm that there is definitely a gap geographic geographic gap in free and open source software

16:16.880 --> 16:27.320
community Tobias has talked about during free about that during previous first day and now I think we

16:27.320 --> 16:35.600
have some understanding about reasons which which are behind this gap and that is basically quite

16:35.600 --> 16:42.760
quite simple people around people in different regions just have different patterns of communication

16:42.760 --> 16:50.240
and that should be accounted for if you want to build inclusive community and another part of the

16:50.240 --> 17:00.200
story is that many things which we take for granted like education or even stable internet

17:00.200 --> 17:09.000
connection cannot be taken for granted in too many parts of the world so but the good news is that

17:09.000 --> 17:18.240
actually those problem which cannot be solved alone can be perfectly can be solved if we join efforts

17:18.240 --> 17:28.240
and well we are doing it we are solving them we still have a lot to do there are research tasks

17:28.240 --> 17:35.480
there are validation tasks because we can build power system model for every country of the world

17:35.480 --> 17:46.520
but it would be nice to understand how close are we to reality what are errors what are modeling

17:46.520 --> 17:55.000
errors for each of the components for power grids model for installed capacity how far we are from

17:55.000 --> 18:03.040
reality in demand profiles and that validation task it is huge if you're interested to join please

18:03.200 --> 18:11.200
feel absolutely free we would be happy to accommodate you and another big task is to increase

18:11.200 --> 18:20.560
usability in particular condo environment and version conflicts inside all our pytonic soul that

18:20.560 --> 18:29.080
is still a big questions and we have we would be very happy to improve it somehow and another part

18:29.120 --> 18:36.680
relates to capacity building relates to improvement of documentation and to spreading the world spreading

18:36.680 --> 18:46.920
knowledge so again we are very happy to accommodate any suggestions and we are inviting contributions if

18:46.920 --> 18:55.240
you are interested please do not hesitate to ping us using any of our channel our communication

18:55.240 --> 19:04.480
channel so just a reminder that energy transition is a global thing and can be tackled effectively

19:04.480 --> 19:09.400
only together thank you very much and I am very happy to take your questions

19:25.240 --> 19:41.880
what's the role of Earth observation for this models do you use satellite data to track transit

19:41.880 --> 19:50.080
lines or look you look for wind turbines or solar cells or is in this data set you use is just you

19:50.080 --> 20:02.680
use official data sets for your modeling thank you we do not use satellite observations directly

20:02.680 --> 20:10.600
but we are using for power grid we are using open-street map data only while it would be great to

20:10.600 --> 20:18.600
supplement them by satellite images we had some stream which have been focused on addition and on

20:18.640 --> 20:26.480
adding actually satellite data to open-street map but the this team currently is not very active so

20:26.480 --> 20:33.800
that is perfectly that would be perfect that would work definitely but we just don't have capacity to

20:33.800 --> 20:40.800
do that right now also we would be happy to revive it and as for installed capacities we are using

20:41.200 --> 20:49.520
fusion we are using merging of a number open data sets on power plants I am not sure if satellite

20:49.520 --> 20:59.720
observations have been used of in any of this data sets but at least we don't make yet satellite

20:59.720 --> 21:06.600
processing ourselves and we do not use them directly also I agree with you that it would be

21:07.000 --> 21:11.600
very interesting idea and it would be also perfect academic topic

21:11.600 --> 21:22.040
there are some countries which really don't want to collaborate I don't know quite like North Korea

21:22.040 --> 21:34.640
or other other countries where we don't get any data well to answer that directly we have data for

21:35.520 --> 21:45.800
Northern Korea but we would be very careful about using them because when you are applying if you

21:45.800 --> 21:53.600
are modeling especially well specific countries I would be very much concerned about safety people

21:53.600 --> 22:00.600
who are affiliated with those countries and that also goes for China for example because for China

22:00.880 --> 22:10.040
there are some local regulations which basically forbid going into too much details of power system

22:10.040 --> 22:16.720
for people who are not approved by national government so I would be very careful about

22:16.720 --> 22:27.440
delicate areas of the world but technically yes it is possible so my feeling is that correct

22:27.440 --> 22:37.600
approach would be to try build collaboration in more or less safe way providing tools to people

22:37.600 --> 22:44.160
who are safe using these tools for example if there is there is some group in China who is

22:44.160 --> 22:53.120
approved as approved by national authorities as experts in power systems as people whom whom they

22:54.000 --> 23:05.120
trust then we may provide tool and support them in using it in the right way also I agree that it

23:05.120 --> 23:21.760
is complex question and it may go a little bit complicated first let me remark agor energy

23:21.760 --> 23:26.280
vendors a very good name in Germany so Congress and getting them using that and my question now

23:26.280 --> 23:36.240
are you also doing storage like water reservoirs or millions of batteries distributed well I

23:36.240 --> 23:43.640
agree that storage is one of the key question when we are speaking about energy transition and we

23:43.640 --> 23:50.440
include a number of different storage technologies and currently that is one of the key points of

23:50.440 --> 23:57.040
energy transition we are able to capture them and if you're interested please feel free to

23:57.040 --> 24:03.960
investigate the details we would be very happy very happy to obtain your feedback and suggestions

24:03.960 --> 24:09.400
and contributions if you see that something can be improved actually we have a huge poor request

24:09.400 --> 24:16.360
which should provide interface to a big list of different storage technologies and it would be

24:16.360 --> 24:31.680
perfect if you could revive it I was just interested I've got a friend who I'm doing who's a

24:31.680 --> 24:40.520
research who's doing geothermal in Nigeria and you have to yeah well he's doing it on me do you have

24:40.520 --> 24:46.080
geothermal resources in there as well okay all right good thank you yes we have geothermal and we

24:46.080 --> 24:55.800
have quite recent request from from Kenya where people are interested to include geothermal in a

24:55.800 --> 25:07.200
more sophisticated way thank you
