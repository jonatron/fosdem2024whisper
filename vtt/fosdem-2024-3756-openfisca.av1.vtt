Perfect. Hi, I'm Matisse Schneider. I'm here to talk about a digital comment that I really

00:10.920 --> 00:15.440
care about. It's called OpenFisca. And as it says here, it's the most widely adopted

00:15.440 --> 00:22.440
free and open source engine. It's under AGPL 3 to write Rosas code. What is Rosas code?

00:22.440 --> 00:30.560
It's the idea that if every piece of regulation, legislation had an implementation in code,

00:30.560 --> 00:36.440
it would be kind of easier to figure out what this is all about. And this is now 13 years

00:36.440 --> 00:41.000
old. We've been, we're used in many, many different countries. Here are some of the

00:41.000 --> 00:47.240
countries that we are used in. There's an engine, and then there are models of the legislation.

00:47.240 --> 00:51.400
I'm going to show you what's the sort of product that you can build on top of it. Here is a

00:51.400 --> 00:57.640
selection. We don't have everyone here because it's on a voluntary basis to register, but

00:57.640 --> 01:04.360
we do have quite a few. One of the most common use cases is for NGOs or governments to build

01:04.360 --> 01:10.120
benefits assessment tools. Tools that will enable people to figure out what the hell they are

01:10.120 --> 01:14.840
entitled to in terms of social benefits. Usually you have to figure out which agencies distribute

01:14.840 --> 01:20.200
which benefits. Here, thanks to Rosas code, you can just talk about your situation. You

01:20.200 --> 01:28.680
describe your personal case. You fill in your information. And then we just send this to

01:28.680 --> 01:34.040
the Rosas code engine, which basically acts as like a big calculator, but instead of calculating

01:34.040 --> 01:39.400
arithmetics, it calculates law. And then it's going to tell you the sort of stuff that you're

01:39.400 --> 01:45.240
entitled to based on the current status of the legislation. So that's one most common use case.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.880
But once you have a model of the legislation that you can interact with through APIs that you can

01:49.960 --> 01:57.640
compute, you can do other stuff. Like for example, here, this super scary user interface is actually

01:57.640 --> 02:03.880
used by members of parliaments in France to simulate the impact of potential reforms. So here is

02:05.000 --> 02:11.480
the payroll of a person. And here to the left, so I'm going to do a really fast because that's a

02:11.480 --> 02:17.400
lightning talk. So in the lightning, I'm going to now create a change in the legislation where I

02:17.400 --> 02:25.080
increased the income revenue tax by 5%. And you can see immediately the impact on all sorts of

02:25.080 --> 02:29.400
potential families. That's pretty cool already. You can design your own reform. But if you're a

02:29.400 --> 02:35.320
member of parliament, you can log in and get this calculated on 60 million on the whole population

02:35.320 --> 02:41.000
of France on real data in about one minute, thanks to the fact that Open Fiscal does vectoral

02:41.000 --> 02:49.400
computation. But that's not limited to the governmentary users. You could do your own thing

02:49.400 --> 02:58.200
as well with it. Here is an example of the user interface to provide some readability exploration

02:58.200 --> 03:05.720
on legal models. That's the demonstration one. So it's a very simple model. We have the same one

03:05.720 --> 03:11.320
for France. It has over 6,000 entries and so on. So for each country, it's going to be different.

03:12.200 --> 03:18.440
But you can see different things. And for example, you can also see the different parameters in

03:18.440 --> 03:27.960
legislation, such as the value of an entry in the legislation that changes. Here, for example,

03:27.960 --> 03:34.680
is in the French model, the list of countries that are member states in the European Union. So if

03:34.680 --> 03:42.040
you ever want to assess if one person is a national of an EU member state, you can either code this

03:42.040 --> 03:48.840
yourself or you can just go to an authority that is going to tell you what it is and also what it

03:48.840 --> 03:54.920
was historically. Because Open Fiscal stores all the history. So I can tell you, for example, here,

03:55.480 --> 04:02.280
that's the initial creation of the European Union. And so you can write formulas that will take as

04:02.280 --> 04:09.400
input that am I an EU national and depending on when you run the simulation, it's going to give you

04:09.400 --> 04:14.760
something different. Here is, for example, the hourly rate for minimum wage and do I have to stop now?

04:14.760 --> 04:21.640
Is it 30 seconds? No. Okay. All right. You can calculate stuff also. It's cool.
