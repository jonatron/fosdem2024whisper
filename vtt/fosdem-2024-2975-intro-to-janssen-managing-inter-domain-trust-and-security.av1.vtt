Hi everyone, my name is Mike Schwartz.

00:07.480 --> 00:18.480
I'm the founder and CEO of Glue and I also lead the Janssen Project at the Linux Foundation.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.480
And how do I do next?

00:22.480 --> 00:23.480
Next?

00:23.480 --> 00:30.480
Well, what happened now?

00:30.480 --> 00:35.480
There we go.

00:35.480 --> 00:45.480
Okay, so in 2009 I was working in digital identity for enterprise customers and I was

00:45.480 --> 00:48.480
sort of tired of recommending commercial solutions.

00:48.480 --> 00:56.480
So we wrote the first Glue server to provide an enterprise identity access management system,

00:56.480 --> 00:58.480
authorization, authentication.

00:58.480 --> 01:07.480
We built this product comprised of open source components and we sold it to many large enterprise

01:07.480 --> 01:09.480
customers over the years.

01:09.480 --> 01:18.480
In 2020 we decided to contribute our IP to a community-governed project at the Linux Foundation.

01:18.480 --> 01:25.480
And we couldn't contribute Glue, that's our trademark, so we created a new brand called Janssen Project.

01:25.480 --> 01:31.480
And Janssen, so the trademark is free for companies to use.

01:31.480 --> 01:41.480
In 2023 we launched a new developer website called Agama Lab, which helps developers write in the Agama

01:41.480 --> 01:49.480
language, which is a programming language we authored at the Janssen Project to help developers use low

01:49.480 --> 01:54.480
code to write web identity journeys.

01:54.480 --> 01:58.480
So Janssen is composed of multiple components.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.480
Think about it like Linux.

02:00.480 --> 02:05.480
It's a number of open source components deployed and working together.

02:05.480 --> 02:11.480
You can, it's built on a mountain of open source like many other open source projects.

02:11.480 --> 02:16.480
We are in production only supporting containerized deployments.

02:16.480 --> 02:20.480
So each service runs in its own container.

02:20.480 --> 02:27.480
From a functional standpoint, digital identity is really existentially important for governments.

02:27.480 --> 02:33.480
We tend to think of governments as having one identity system, but actually there are many

02:33.480 --> 02:39.480
ministries and agencies and departments, and each of those departments have their own identity

02:39.480 --> 02:45.480
infrastructure with their own usability, accessibility, and security requirements.

02:45.480 --> 02:48.480
So we're in a multi-IDP world.

02:48.480 --> 02:52.480
Each government needs to manage trust, and that's just hard to do.

02:52.480 --> 02:58.480
And Janssen helps governments build this identity infrastructure so they can service their

02:58.480 --> 03:02.480
ministries and departments.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.480
This time is wrong.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.480
Actually, so I have a deep dive on Agama.

03:06.480 --> 03:10.480
If you're an IAM geek, please join us.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.480
It's tomorrow at 9.45, not five.

03:13.480 --> 03:19.480
So, but I'm going to do a deep dive on Agama if you want to learn how we can use low code to build these

03:19.480 --> 03:22.480
authentication flows.

03:22.480 --> 03:25.480
So why would you use this project?

03:25.480 --> 03:28.480
It's not for every organization.

03:28.480 --> 03:37.480
We really are looking for organizations that have what I would say described as economies of scale in IT.

03:37.480 --> 03:44.480
That means that they have, if you're a small company, you should probably use a SaaS, but if you're a

03:44.480 --> 03:50.480
government and then you have, then you need to really manage this yourself.

03:50.480 --> 03:53.480
Janssen is good at handling customer requirements.

03:53.480 --> 03:59.480
We forget that a lot of these organizations, they already have infrastructure that they need to support, and they

03:59.480 --> 04:01.480
have special requirements.

04:01.480 --> 04:08.480
So hosting yourself enables you to meet all those special requirements for your identity.

04:08.480 --> 04:13.480
And data sovereignty, a lot of the customers that we serve, banks, telcos, and other

04:13.480 --> 04:19.480
banks, telcos, healthcare, education, government, they need to host this data themselves.

04:19.480 --> 04:23.480
They need to persist the data in their region.

04:23.480 --> 04:30.480
And then finally, you might need this infrastructure if you're building a product.

04:30.480 --> 04:35.480
So many products actually include a digital identity component.

04:35.480 --> 04:42.480
For example, NEC is using our software to build a biometric authentication platform for governments.

04:42.480 --> 04:49.480
So if you need to build an identity stack, you can sort of build this into your product.

04:49.480 --> 04:54.480
And you can know that it is safe to use.

04:54.480 --> 05:01.480
I should mention that actually Janssen Project is registered as a DPG.

05:01.480 --> 05:05.480
And that means that it's safe to use.

05:05.480 --> 05:11.480
And it's important to remember that, yeah, we don't want to get hashy-corped.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.480
So with that, I'll end.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.480
And thank you very much.
