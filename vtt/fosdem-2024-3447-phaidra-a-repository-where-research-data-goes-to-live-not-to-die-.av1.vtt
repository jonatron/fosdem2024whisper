00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Thank you.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Thank you.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
Outside for additional questions if you want.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Thank you.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Thank you.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
Thank you for a great talk.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
Thank you.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
Thank you for a lot of that.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
Yeah, this is an honor.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Yeah.

00:18.000 --> 00:28.000
Welcome.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Do you have an adapter?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I've lost one.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Okay, I don't know if we have a USB-C here.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Please do not take it away from your needs.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
What?

00:43.000 --> 00:53.000
Here you go.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I have an adapter if you want.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
There was one on the table.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
Let me check if it works.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Really?

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Yeah.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
Does it look like it's working?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
It takes a bit of time.

01:09.000 --> 01:31.000
Try it.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
So again, please, let's try to move all the way to your...

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
to this side of the room.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
Everyone look to your left.

01:39.000 --> 01:53.000
If there's an empty seat, sit in it.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Is it pronounced...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
Mancanguli?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Real Mancanguli, yes.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
I'll introduce you very briefly and let you...

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Okay, yes.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
Yes.

02:06.000 --> 02:18.000
Okay, so we have now Ramón de Gullir, who is going to present...

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
without further introduction.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yes, thank you.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Can you hear me?

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
Is the mic okay?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Okay.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
So thank you for being here.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
I'd like to present also a repository, but it's not a software repository.

02:32.000 --> 02:44.000
It's a data repository, which is a kind of dual what we are now using very often in research data management at universities.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
And who's talking to you?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
My name is Ramón de Gullir.

02:49.000 --> 02:54.000
I'm working at the University of Vienna in Austria.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.000
And I'm heading their department, which is called IT Support for Research.

03:00.000 --> 03:08.000
So I'm based at the Computer Center and focusing and helping the researchers to preserve the data long-term.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
So I'm not a researcher, but I'm in the support shoes.

03:13.000 --> 03:23.000
And during my work, we are also responsible for a repository for keeping the data safe and preserve them long-term.

03:23.000 --> 03:33.000
And for this, we have developed our own system, and I'd like to present to you today about the system, what's about, and why we did this.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
And didn't go to something else, and we are developing still by everything by our own.

03:38.000 --> 03:47.000
First of all, the origin of our system, FIDRA, we started quite early.

03:47.000 --> 03:52.000
So the project of FIDRA started 2007.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.000
During this time, there haven't been a lot of data repositories out, so we could use.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.000
We looked and researched about what kind of systems they are available.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
And we found a solution that we can build on, but it wasn't directly fit what we wanted to do.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
This was FIDRA.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
And FIDRA is still the base of our repository as well.

04:17.000 --> 04:25.000
And the main idea and the goal was to find a home for all the data which are around the university.

04:25.000 --> 04:32.000
So for this project, there was a combined project from the library.

04:32.000 --> 04:40.000
So the main idea came from the library, but from the beginning on, we have the collaboration with the computer center.

04:40.000 --> 04:51.000
And also, and that was the interesting part from the beginning, there have been a service unit which is called Center for Teaching and Learning, also involved.

04:51.000 --> 05:00.000
They dropped out after a few years, but now in the last three to four years, they came back to the repository issues as well.

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
So we are launched very fast, our first repository.

05:07.000 --> 05:19.000
It was 2008, so it was really bringing the people together, looking what kind of systems we want to use and then build something new and then we go to this repository.

05:19.000 --> 05:29.000
So and then because it was a very rushed start, the system wasn't that good developed.

05:29.000 --> 05:41.000
And the problem we have seen this as new partners came in and these partners now wanted also to use the same system what we have and then the problems arise.

05:41.000 --> 05:53.000
So we rebuilt everything from 2011 and these were also the very early start at thinking we should do everything as open source and open source project.

05:53.000 --> 06:08.000
And then national project came in where we also developed based on the demands that came from the project and we go further and further.

06:08.000 --> 06:22.000
And the thing was that we are our own biggest customer, so we built our system, but we also developed this for some other fader partners as well.

06:23.000 --> 06:29.000
So what is now the idea how we are doing this and how we are doing the development.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
So as I told you, I'm also research support center, so I help also researcher.

06:34.000 --> 06:44.000
I'm connected with their needs and this is also key for such a system is identifying the needs and managing the different needs.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
So we have really different needs.

06:48.000 --> 07:00.000
The main idea is preserving the data, but the point of view from a library is different than the point of view from the researchers as well as the point of view from a funding agency,

07:00.000 --> 07:07.000
which are also a big stakeholder in the whole ecosystem of research data management.

07:07.000 --> 07:19.000
And also the IT support, the IT center as well plays a big role because they have to maintain and operate all the system, which the other people want to know.

07:19.000 --> 07:36.000
And the thing is also they want to know which kind of data are in their infrastructure because we are having a lot of spaces on our shared data where people drop out.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
And then nobody knows which kind of data there are.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
And if we're using a kind of data repository, we are knowing about the data.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
So that's mainly the idea.

07:51.000 --> 08:03.000
Over the whole years, what we have learned and what we are trying to improve is the needs are key.

08:03.000 --> 08:20.000
So we are started from the perspective of the library and the needs of a library to describe and to also implement the systems in a way that barbarians can work easily with data and preserve them to do their work.

08:20.000 --> 08:28.000
And then suddenly we are presented this what we have to the researcher and they had completely different needs.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
So balancing these two things is not an easy thing.

08:32.000 --> 08:41.000
So our approach and our idea is that the data are the key factor of these and we have to manage the data.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
But the viewpoint of the data can be very different.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
So also in this way, then we have thought about how we can make different viewpoints.

08:52.000 --> 09:07.000
And this we are going to enable an easy to use or an also an easy to self develop a new interface, a new user interface to the data that you see all the data.

09:07.000 --> 09:16.000
So we have different approaches, different kind of data, but we have also in the repository and from these different interfaces as well.

09:16.000 --> 09:33.000
And these are also the thing what I'm why I'm here is what we have learned about open source is just putting an open source license to a piece of software doesn't mean that's an open source project.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.000
So open source project is something else open source project is to engaging with the community and to bring all the things alive.

09:42.000 --> 09:59.000
And this is what we are now heavily working on it and bringing also to our software and new community or not the new community also the community who are wants to bring the software more to life and to develop this further.

10:00.000 --> 10:12.000
So now we are that that's the situation what we are now in when we have some ideas what we want to to to go to the future.

10:12.000 --> 10:21.000
So working with the community of data management is is really the key and we will keep to this.

10:21.000 --> 10:30.000
So we are part of the data management community because we are the user of the repository as well.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
We are engaging with the researcher.

10:32.000 --> 10:44.000
We are engaging with the people who brings us the data and we know that we have just covered a little bit what what's necessary for the future because we can handle.

10:45.000 --> 10:53.000
Yes we can handle files which are household files that we have on a laptop print into the repository describe them.

10:53.000 --> 11:02.000
But there are a lot of challenges out there how do you go with big data how do you go with databases how to go with applications.

11:02.000 --> 11:09.000
So there are a lot of open question and these we want to work with the community together to find solutions.

11:09.000 --> 11:22.000
And from the digitalization point of view is that keeping the data secure secure and keep and preserving the data long term is very essential because the viewpoint is now going to the data.

11:22.000 --> 11:36.000
And we need we have a lot of knowledge into the data and we need also to preserve the data so and just to have the data and not the knowledge around this is also not what we want.

11:36.000 --> 11:52.000
We need the whole growing of of of the data management and this is just one answer to the big challenge we are all facing when it came to data management.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
So.

11:54.000 --> 12:01.000
What are now what what are so to to to wrap up.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
These is it's just the beginning.

12:05.000 --> 12:20.000
So I know it's not the perfect solution but because that's I'm here we need people to look at these what we are doing and then say OK in which direction it's necessary to go to improve.

12:20.000 --> 12:30.000
And there are a lot of challenges we need to master and it's the best way to go in the community to challenge all these masters all these things.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.000
If you want to get in touch there are some links.

12:35.000 --> 12:38.000
So there's the link from the repository.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
There is a community site.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Then we have the GitHub repository as well.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
We have a podcast.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
This is how we engage also with the community.

12:49.000 --> 12:54.000
We want to get known more from the community and their challenges for these.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
We have a podcast.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
We are we can you can see what we are doing at our university.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
You have also the links to the other universities as well.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
We are our partner partners.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
We have a conference.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
This is a yearly conference.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
This is always in November.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
And if you want to get in touch with me.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
So it's also my email address on the slide.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
Thank you very much.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
We may have time for one short question.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Thank you for the presentation.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
How do you see the connection with the European Open Science Cloud that you listed in the data history?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Yes.

13:38.000 --> 13:45.000
So as a point, the question was how we are connected with this,

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
what we are developing with the European Open Science Cloud.

13:48.000 --> 13:53.000
So we are connected with national projects, but also not national projects.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
This is also international projects because all which funded by the ministry goes to this national European approach.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
This is all European Open Science Cloud.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
So we apply to fair data.

14:03.000 --> 14:16.000
We are going to have these these standard the standard APIs which we then can link to also to other repositories or to the European Open Science Cloud.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
We are also part of the European Open Science Cloud.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
So the University of Vienna is a member of the European Open Science Cloud.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
So we are highly connected to all these things what's happening there.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
Thanks again for the moment.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Thank you.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
Just a moment.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.000
Thank you.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.000
Thank you.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
If you do the microphone, I do your computer.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Okay, thanks.
