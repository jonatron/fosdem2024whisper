00:00.000 --> 00:12.400
Okay, everyone. So we are ready for our second workshop in our death room open source in

00:12.400 --> 00:19.480
the European legislative landscape. We have some general rules. I think Simon want to

00:19.480 --> 00:26.160
talk about them. No, this is okay. So we have some general rules for the whole death

00:26.160 --> 00:30.480
room. That means for the next two hours, this is true, but also for the rest of the day.

00:30.480 --> 00:39.520
Please, we have some issues here with like the sound quality in the room. So please,

00:39.520 --> 00:45.200
remain as quiet as possible. And if possible, please only change rooms in between the sessions.

00:45.200 --> 00:51.240
So we are having like quick changes in between. So there should be enough time to like leave

00:51.240 --> 00:57.120
and enter the room again. And also we have this microphone. And there's only this one

00:57.120 --> 01:02.040
microphone. It looks a bit strange to talk into it, but it's important for us that people

01:02.040 --> 01:06.480
in the livestream can follow us. So this means if you want to address a question, please wait

01:06.480 --> 01:11.000
until we are around to see microphones so that people in the livestream can also follow us.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.840
We in this workshop want to build on what we just like discussed in the workshop before. And I think

01:19.840 --> 01:27.040
Mirko put it very correctly to say we should stay in the dialogue. And the question is how do

01:27.040 --> 01:33.640
we stay in this dialogue? And how, yeah, shall we do this? What have we learned? For example,

01:33.640 --> 01:37.960
during CIA, but also other debates. And this is basically what we are going to discuss in the

01:37.960 --> 01:44.720
next two hours. So we will talk with Martin and Enzo about their CIA experience. Then we will talk

01:44.800 --> 01:50.120
to Jean-Luc and Clementine. They will show us about how important open source projects to the

01:50.120 --> 01:55.880
European Commission and how they are funded around NGIO. And then we will talk with Cyril

01:55.880 --> 02:05.680
about future EU free software regulation. And then we want to turn this workshop here into a

02:05.680 --> 02:12.600
panel which then turns into a fishbowl conversation. And I will also then later explain you how this

02:12.600 --> 02:19.200
fishbowl conversation works out as soon as we go to the panel. But now I would be happy to see

02:19.200 --> 02:28.480
Enzo and Martin. Would you be so happy to join here and then we go to our very first talk of

02:28.480 --> 02:32.960
Martin and Enzo. Who wants to start? You.
