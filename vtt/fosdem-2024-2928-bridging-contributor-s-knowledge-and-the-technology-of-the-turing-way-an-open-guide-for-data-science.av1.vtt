WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Okay, great.

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
Yeah, after the last speaker, I think my sticker game isn't quite up to standard.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.000
But I'm Jim, I'm a research software engineer at the Alling-Turian Institute

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
and a volunteer core member of the Turingway team.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
The title I submitted was Bridging Contributors' Knowledge and the Technology of the Turingway

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
and Open Guide for Data Science.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
And I thought that was a bit long and vague and maybe I'd have another go

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
and I came to a personal perspective on the interface of infrastructure and people

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
which is at least shorter, but I'm not sure if it's much better.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
But I'm going to be talking about getting the people who contribute to your project

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
with the infrastructure, which does mean the technology,

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
but also means the processes and people who control what gets into the project

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
and how decisions are made.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
So the way I like to pitch it is we all contribute to projects for a reason.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
We're making something for a purpose and there's different ways we can measure that

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
and you might think about a number of contributors or stars or downloads

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
or engagement or something.

01:16.000 --> 01:21.000
But the common thing between all of these is we need the contributions.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
So that's how we make progress.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
And so maybe what I'm going to suggest is maybe the important thing,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
the most important thing that you should be thinking about and measuring yourself against

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
is how well do you facilitate people who are contributing to your project.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
So a bit of scene setting for the Turingway.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
The Turingway is a handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
It's developed completely in the open on GitHub

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
and is open to the licensed creative commons.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
And there's quite a large number of contributors.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
The last time I looked it was a bit over 470 contributors in total.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
When I work on the book, that's what my screen looks like.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
My background, I have a chemistry degree in PhD and during that

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
I was exposed to Linux and open source software through computational chemistry

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
and became really passionate about that.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
And now I work as a research software engineer.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
So I'm not really a chemist, but I'm not quite a computer scientist

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
and I'm somewhere floating in the middle.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
And the Turingway is a big project where I work.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
And I started off just making a few tiny contributions, fixing typos

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
and links and things.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.000
And late last year I became one of the co-leads of the new infrastructure working group

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
and we think a lot about the CI and automation

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
and how we help people get stuff into the book.

02:58.000 --> 03:03.000
So what's the actual problem I'm talking about and trying to think about?

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
So if you're a maintainer of a project, one of your key tasks is maintaining quality

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
and to a certain extent that means putting up a bit of a barrier to contribution.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
You need to have some standard, you need to keep standard,

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
you don't want to break things.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
And that can be a bit tricky because that involves a bit of pushing back against people,

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
maybe giving critical feedback or maybe not accepting certain changes

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
and you need to kind of strike a balance there of encouraging people

03:32.000 --> 03:36.000
and then getting stuff in particularly when your contributors...

03:36.000 --> 03:42.000
I always say non-technical, which really means not software engineers, I suppose.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.000
Your contributors may come from many different backgrounds

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
and have different amounts of experience.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
So some might be more or less into tech

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
and that can also create problems

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
because you can't assume that every contributor is going to be the same

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
and they might need different levels of assistance

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
and that might make sense to one, might not make sense to others.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
In the Turingway in particular, the community is incredibly diverse

04:13.000 --> 04:17.000
in terms of their educational and professional background,

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
the language they speak, time zones where they work, where they live, their lived experience.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.000
And most of the contributions, most of the data that's actually in the project

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
is pros and not software.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
They're contributing their ideas and their knowledge in the form of text

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
rather than working on the code.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
And so also the people are generally not software engineers,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
which means there's quite a lot of additional support

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
in terms of, you know, YAML format,

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
why does Markdown work and why doesn't CI pass.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
But I think the important thing there is that all of the people that contributes

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
make valuable and important contributions to the book

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
and their sort of technical ability,

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
so how well they understand the build process and things,

05:08.000 --> 05:12.000
isn't really a good measure at all of the value of their contributions.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
So we focus quite a lot on how to enable people to contribute to the book.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
So here's our approach at the moment, things we do.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
Probably not surprising, but everything is version-controlled

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
in Git and the projects on GitHub.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
But I think there is an interesting question of why do we do that

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
and why don't we just have a wiki if it's mostly text.

05:37.000 --> 05:42.000
I think the simple answer is the advantages of version control are just too strong.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
You can go back in time.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Handling multiple contributors is really easy

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
even when they're working asynchronously on different branches

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
and you have to fix conflicts and things.

05:53.000 --> 06:00.000
And because it's a guide about open and reproducible data science,

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
there's elements of do what we say,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
we've got to demonstrate the sort of culture we're trying to create.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
And so that means doing everything in the open,

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
doing everything as reproducibly as possible.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
There is a community handbook,

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
and I always love how sort of meta this is.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
It's like a book within a book,

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
and it's a book which tells you how to contribute to the showing ways.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
There's a contribution guide, there's the code of conduct,

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
style rules and things like that.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
So yes, I love that the book tells you how to write the book

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
and contribute to the book.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
And because it's part of the book, it's completely open,

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
and if you think those rules should be changed

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
or adjusted or can be clarified, you can also contribute to that.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Recognising contributors is really important,

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
and we try to recognise all types of contributions,

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
so not just text and not just code.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
And one of the ways to do that is to use tools from the All Contributors project,

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
where you can tag people for the types of contributions they've made,

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
and you get this nice table of people and their contributions,

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
and that is also displayed in the book.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
And on a Git repository, people are encouraged that if they feel

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
they've done something, they've put in some effort,

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
they should suggest that they be added for a certain contribution type on this.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
More recently, we started using a GitHub action

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
which ties into the crowd-in API.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
So crowd is the platform that's used for making translations

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
to help to better recognise the translation efforts that go on in the during way.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
There's a lot of support.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
As I said, a lot of people are not super technical,

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and so we might need to work quite closely with them.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
We like to think of pull requests as a chance to work with people

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
and collaborate with people and make connections

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
and not just a barrier to stop things you don't want to be merged in.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
And that support goes even further.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
There are different types of events and co-working sessions

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
to help people get contributions in.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.000
So there's regular co-working.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.000
There are sprint-style events called book dashes.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
And so there's a lot of stuff which adds a bit of social element,

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
but it's also about helping people work together collaboratively

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
to get things into the book.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
And we lean on, see on automation a fair amount,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
and the focus there is remove burden from the users

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
so we don't expect people to build the book or run tests themselves.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Everything is done in CI for you,

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
so you don't really need to know about how it gets built.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
You can just focus on writing the muck down.

09:00.000 --> 09:07.000
So here are my sort of unoriginal lessons for how to search contributions.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
Building a community takes effort.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
If you write some code, you put it on GitHub,

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
it doesn't necessarily mean people will engage with you.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.000
You need to be quite proactive in reaching out to your community

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
and assisting them.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
And that means you need to know who your contributors are

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
so if you can identify that and figure out what would help them,

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
I think the thing to think about is what thing can you do

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
which would most enable them to contribute.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Leaning on CI is great.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
You can sort of say what CI says goes.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
It's a fair way to sort of compare people's work,

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
all the tests are done in one consistent place.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Everyone's being marked to the same standard

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
and avoid sort of arguments about, well, it works on my machine.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
I think this sort of goes without saying version control, not optional.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
It's brilliant, do everything in version control.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
And if that means you need to do some support to help onboard people

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
and how to use that, which we definitely do,

10:12.000 --> 10:16.000
it's definitely worth the effort, it's worth the pain of doing that.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
You should be flexible.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
So I think something to keep in mind is it's better to bend the rules a little bit

10:24.000 --> 10:31.000
to better contribution in and you shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
However, you do need to know when to be strict

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
and here's some suggestions of what maybe your red line should be,

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
things that sort of aren't acceptable to merge in.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
However, even when you're doing that, you've just got to keep in mind

10:46.000 --> 10:52.000
be kind and respectful and actually problems are an opportunity

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
to get to know someone and help someone and teach someone.

10:58.000 --> 11:02.000
So thanks very much for listening.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
I'd just like to thank a few people.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
I'd like to thank all the infrastructure working group on the sharing way.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.000
That's Brigitta, Danny, me and Sarah.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
I'd like to thank Ale and Anne who's here with the project and community managers

11:18.000 --> 11:23.000
and provide a huge amount of support in getting the working group started.

11:23.000 --> 11:27.000
Skrobiria who worked to make all the brilliant illustrations that you've seen.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
So without them, you would have been looking at a lot of bullet points

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
which wouldn't have been as fun and absolutely everyone that's contributed to the sharing way.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
If this has sounded interesting to you or the book,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
A Guide to Open Refugees, Refugeeful Data Science,

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
you can read the book.

11:46.000 --> 11:50.000
Here's some ways to join the community, the sort of social aspects.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.000
And we've got more definitive, clear ways to get involved.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
So you can read the community handbook.

11:57.000 --> 12:04.000
We've got good first issues and there are events you can join to start making contributions.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
Thanks very much.

12:07.000 --> 12:15.000
So we have one minute so you can take one question as you please.

12:15.000 --> 12:19.000
Why we welcome the next speakers if they are here.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Yes.

12:20.000 --> 12:25.000
So you mentioned Ale have seen how you're recognizing contribution

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
and you can have people nominate.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
I'm curious if you have sort of a list of what those categories of contribution are

12:30.000 --> 12:34.000
because I assume that many products struggle to recognize non-striped contribution.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
I'd like to see that you have a record but I was curious how do you,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
I don't know what those times are, do you have a list of how you can recognize these other titles of contribution?

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
Yeah, I'm going to read the chef.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
Yes, so the question is we say we want to recognize all types of contributions

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
and earlier in the slides you could see a little emoji to say what those are

12:54.000 --> 12:57.000
and so is there a specification for what those are?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
So I can learn more about that.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
So the All Contributors Project has a list of contribution types and the emoji

13:06.000 --> 13:09.000
and so they've, I would say it's sort of loose suggestions

13:09.000 --> 13:15.000
that some of those are infrastructure, content thinking, event planning, things like that.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
So we roughly follow what that says.

13:19.000 --> 13:27.000
We're not sort of super strict on saying this emoji relates very specifically to this kind of work

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
and actually the approach I think it's probably written somewhere in the community handbook

13:31.000 --> 13:37.000
is more like if you feel like what you've done, for example is event planning,

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
you should find the closest one to that and add yourself.

13:41.000 --> 13:50.000
So we use it quite loose and take the attitude that even a contribution of any size,

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
if it's a measurable contribution it's worth adding an emoji.

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
But yes, the All Contributors Project has their table of what those mean

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
and some sort of suggestions.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
But I think it's quite nice.

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
I think another project you can sort of maybe use them a bit as you want,

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
maybe some of them are more or less relevant depending on what your project does.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
Thanks.
