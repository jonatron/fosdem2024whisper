WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I'm going to go to the next slide.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
Let's see.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
The U.S.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
is now going to present

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
from grassroots to standard practices how an open society

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
shaped university initiatives.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Here you go.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
Hello, everyone.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm coming here to talk about my experience at the Surrey

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
University in the UK where I did my PhD in the last four years.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
I just finished my PhD.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Thank you.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Thank you.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Basically, is this working?

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Next.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
This society was founded in 2019,

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
which is when I started my PhD,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
but I wasn't part of it at the beginning.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
Sometimes it's difficult to find out what's going on at the university.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
It was founded by Marta Topor,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
who was a student at the time.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Emily Farron, who is staff,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
she's a senior lecturer, I think, at the university.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
They wanted to create this society

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
to tackle this kind of reproducibility crisis

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
in the field of psychiatry,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
but we'd aim to expand to all the other areas.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
It was a society run by young researchers

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
and postgraduate students.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
It was open to any students,

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
but undergrad students are usually not interested

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
in this kind of society.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
At some point, we have over 100 members,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
which was very successful for this kind of society.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
We were inspired,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
but different from the other students.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
We were inspired by the different students

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
and we were inspired by different grassroots initiatives.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
We have the UKRN,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
the reproducibility network in the UK.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
This is a national peer-led community of researchers

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
that want to tackle this reproducibility,

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
trusting science,

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
and improving methodology of scientific methods.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
We also have other initiatives,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
like reproducibility.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
This is a journal club

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
where people get together to read

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
papers about methodologies

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
and how to improve methodologies and analysis.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
The Riot reproducible, interpretable, open,

02:33.000 --> 02:36.000
and transparent is also a science club.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
I think it was started by King College London.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
We have the UKRN,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
and the Riot reproducible is also a club

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
in King College London.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Those were our aims.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Integrate, open, transparent,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
and reproducible methods in science.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Help with this rigor

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
and quality

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
and this trust in science crisis.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
As I was saying,

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
we have the UKRN,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
the Riot reproducible,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
and the UNR,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.000
and the UNR,

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
and the UNR,

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
and the UNR,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
and the UNR,

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
and the UNR,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
and the UNR,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
and the UNR,

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
and the UNR,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
and the UNR,

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
and the UNR.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
We have a lot of meetings and discussions

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
and workshops,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
and we also have

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
conferences

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
in the university.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
We managed to create...

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
It run for two years maybe?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Two or three years.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Two or three years, yeah.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
Yeah, and that was very interesting because it brought like all the university together

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
so we could discuss with different people, so not only students from different faculties,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
but also staff and researchers.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.000
And from these different events that we were creating,

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
we started in January 2020 the monthly mini hacks by Daniel Curtin here, she's here.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
She will be giving a talk later.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
But yeah, this was when we started putting a greater focus on the computational methods

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
of these social sciences, so not only that reproducibility,

04:53.000 --> 05:00.000
but also we wanted for people to have the skills, coding skills that maybe are not so easily accessible

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
when you are in social sciences or in non-computational fields,

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
but that are very, very important for those fields.

05:10.000 --> 05:18.000
So it was this cross-disciplinary collaboration and skill sharing

05:18.000 --> 05:23.000
and kind of like hands-on coding so someone would come give like a maybe 20-minute talk

05:23.000 --> 05:32.000
or 15-20 minutes about a topic and then there would be like a collective programming time.

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
And then it's always better to kind of learn these things in a group, right?

05:38.000 --> 05:43.000
So you can ask questions instead of just watching a YouTube video or reading something online

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
and then no one is there to guide you.

05:45.000 --> 05:51.000
And yeah, it's also useful to encourage and promote these best coding practices.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
So sometimes I'm sure many of you have had this problem when you go to like a research,

05:57.000 --> 06:04.000
academy, software project and you have no idea what's going on and all this spaghetti code

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
so to try to make people be better at coding.

06:10.000 --> 06:17.000
And also as a way of training and improving your research and your employability

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
and just your own skills that may be helpful for you in the future outside of the university.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
And I guess, yes, the isolation and the learning curve that is worse for some people in different fields

06:31.000 --> 06:36.000
or just depending on what background, what opportunities you've had before, right?

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
So with the pandemic, there was a lot of things going on, right?

06:41.000 --> 06:47.000
Some of them very bad and in a way we had new opportunities because we all went online

06:47.000 --> 06:55.000
so there was more like a global opportunity of sharing from outside the university.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
I guess we always had this option but we weren't really used to do things online.

06:59.000 --> 07:08.000
So we created the mini-hack consortium which is kind of like taking the mini-hacks initiative

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
outside of the reproducibility society which they were still interlinked but it became its own thing

07:15.000 --> 07:23.000
and we started creating a lot of online courses every month bringing different people from different universities.

07:23.000 --> 07:30.000
We had people from universities in Spain, in Germany, but also in Latin America.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
We had a collaboration in Colombia.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.000
We did a two-day hackathon for a neural language processing.

07:38.000 --> 07:47.000
So bringing people who were experts in different things to talk about their experiences

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
and things that were... maybe they weren't experts in but they've learned about, I don't know,

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
if you've done a PhD in some science, you know latex but when you're starting in research

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
you have no idea how to write latex and it all looks very strange and difficult to understand.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
So it went very well at the beginning.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
We had a lot of people interested.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
We have more people joining the workshops so when they were in person

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
maybe it was more difficult to advertise it across the university

08:21.000 --> 08:29.000
but when we went online we could reach a larger audience so that was very successful at first.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
These are some of the tools that we were using both at the reproducibility society and the mini-hack.

08:35.000 --> 08:48.000
So yes, we have all our files and data at the Open Science Framework repository

08:48.000 --> 08:55.000
so if we had any presentations we would record them, we would upload the video so you can go there later

08:55.000 --> 09:01.000
and all the slides and anything that was required at these workshops.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
Then we publish all the slides and any outputs of these workshops in F1000 Research

09:07.000 --> 09:17.000
which is an Open Science scientific publisher so then you could also have your own thing in your CV and record, right?

09:17.000 --> 09:28.000
So it would help your... in the future and then obviously we publish all the code in repositories open for everyone to use

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
and for this advertisement of the workshops we would use Eventbrite which is not open

09:34.000 --> 09:45.000
but it was very useful to reach a larger audience so it's not only the people you know and that already know you

09:45.000 --> 09:52.000
but it also promotes your events to people who have related interests

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
so there were a lot of people who had no idea who we were and they were just joining

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
because they saw the topic was related to their field or something.

10:00.000 --> 10:09.000
And this brings me to what happened at the University of Surrey so we created all these events and workshops and things

10:09.000 --> 10:19.000
and then through Emily Farron who was part of the staff she was pushing this to become more policy at the University of Surrey

10:19.000 --> 10:24.000
and more people started joining from the staff, from the researchers areas

10:24.000 --> 10:32.000
and we got... I think they adapted this open batch

10:32.000 --> 10:40.000
the open batch, yeah, to know that your... I don't know what I was going to say

10:40.000 --> 10:48.000
that your project has all these data standards and all these open standards of research

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
and they created a working group that was leading this change within the university

10:52.000 --> 10:59.000
and they created a community with forums and chats where they could share all these things across universities

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
or not just in psychology but across all the other faculties

11:03.000 --> 11:10.000
they created a research handbook, they actually created an actual module that people can take about open science

11:10.000 --> 11:15.000
learning about open data and they created this open research annual lecture

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
and this is basically the continuation of the conference we were doing as students

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
So to finalise this is what happened to us

11:26.000 --> 11:37.000
We were very successful at the beginning, we had a lot of people, more than 100 people as members of the society

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
but with the pandemic apart from going global we also had other problems

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
People were meeting less online, less in person

11:44.000 --> 11:51.000
People weren't going to maybe the faculties and the office to work so we started like putting it apart

11:51.000 --> 12:00.000
and because students come and go people were leaving the university and there wasn't any new people to join

12:00.000 --> 12:10.000
and at half the time that this type of initiatives required which is a long time

12:10.000 --> 12:17.000
So I was left alone with the mini hacks and it just completely faded in my last year of PhD

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
when I couldn't get more people to give more talks or workshops, I just couldn't find anyone else

12:23.000 --> 12:32.000
But at least the university policy now, maybe more students will come in the future and we'll want to take this on

12:32.000 --> 12:38.000
and we learned a lot so we already have that going on for us

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
and I don't know if we have any time for questions

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Sorry

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
We do have to be so let's take some questions, thank you

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Thank you

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
Thank you

12:58.000 --> 13:07.000
So it's a very nice story, it's a pretty good way but is this journey like what you just presented

13:07.000 --> 13:21.000
Yes, yes, so the question is if all of this work that we've done is anywhere and people can take on from that

13:21.000 --> 13:30.000
Yes, so everything we've done, not only the workshops and the events that we did but also like our policies

13:30.000 --> 13:39.000
and our documents of how to organize and how to do everything is in our open science framework repository

13:39.000 --> 13:47.000
so the first point here and people can go back there and see like how did we do the main list, what are the resources that we use

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
what was the kind of like flow of organizing a society

13:52.000 --> 13:59.000
which is helpful even if you want to create your own society that is not continuing this

13:59.000 --> 14:02.000
That was the second question, second and third

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
Yes

14:03.000 --> 14:12.000
Thank you very much for the presentation, what's your point of view on the initiative you have in science club with respect to this

14:12.000 --> 14:18.000
The European Open Science Club, is this similar to some of them?

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I don't know, I'm not familiar with this

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
So would it be like similar to this but European level

14:27.000 --> 14:42.000
Okay, so I am not aware of the European Open Science Club but I think it would be very interesting to connect with all the different initiatives that kind of have the same aim in place

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
and that would probably be useful also to get people to collaborate with this, thank you
