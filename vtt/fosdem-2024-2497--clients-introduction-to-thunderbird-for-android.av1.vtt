WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
All right.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.000
Welcome everybody for a new round of the modern email death room.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
And now it gets a little more user friendly user experience because we are in the email

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
client session.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
And yeah, we start with a very interesting new development.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
Many of you might know there was K9 email which might turn into, or will turn into Thunderbird

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
for Android.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
And we are happy to have K9 main developer, I think I can say here, and he will give

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
us some first hand insights.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
That is yours.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Thank you.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
Yeah.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
So half of the talk was that.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
So just kidding.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Kati.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
I will tell you a little bit about Thunderbird for Android.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
First we'll start with a little bit of history.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
And it's about K9 email.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
Like you mentioned, it will eventually be renamed to Thunderbird for Android.

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Our journey starts in 2008 when the first Android version was released.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
Jesse Vincent bought an Android device, tried to connect to his self hosted mail server.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Back then that was more common than it is now I guess.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
And it wasn't working.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
That's because the email app that ship with Android wasn't really great.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
And he figured it's part of the Android open source project.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
So he will just fix it and it will work.

01:32.000 --> 01:39.000
He did fix it, but then he found out you can't just install an update to a system app.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.000
So back to the drawing board, like extracting the code of the email app from the AOSP source

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
tree that contains all the app, the AOS.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
Build it as a separate app, give it a different name.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
And then it was working and he figured if he made all this work,

01:56.000 --> 02:00.000
other people might like to use that as well.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
So he uploaded it to the Android market.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
That was the name of the app store back then.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
And he released the source on Google code, which was a thing back then.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
And since it was really early days, most of the Android users were nerds like us,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
many of them developers.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.000
A lot of them realized that the email client that ship with Android was really crap.

02:25.000 --> 02:32.000
And so a lot of people ended up finding K9 Mail and hoping the bugs were fixed there.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Most of the time, because it was forked from the original email app,

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
the bugs were still there, but at least they could fix it easily.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
So a lot of us found K9 Mail that way myself as well.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.000
I joined in 2010 or late 29, depending on how you count.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
And because neither K9 Mail nor the email app were working with my providers,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
I had to fix K9 Mail.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
Unfortunately, we don't have a lot of time.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.000
So I can't talk about all the awesome people that contributed bug fixes and features,

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
even the early days, to make K9 Mail as popular as it is.

03:11.000 --> 03:20.000
We'll have to skip forward a little bit to events that are half relevant for Thunderbird for Android.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
The next one is that Jesse made me the project lead because I kept fixing bugs

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
even once I wasn't affected by it.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
At the end, I was doing releases and stuff like that.

03:30.000 --> 03:36.000
So basically everything maintained as Jesse went off to start a startup.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Doing keyboards.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
Fast forward a couple more years.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
I was contacted by Ryan Sypes from Thunderbird.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
And he was like, we have lots of users, but they also use mobile devices

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
and they want clients for that.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
So Android and iOS.

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
And he was talking to lots of people, trying to find out how they can do that.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
How can there be a Thunderbird for Android, Thunderbird for iOS?

04:04.000 --> 04:09.000
One of their ideas was to use one of those cross-platform frameworks where you can write JavaScript

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
because Thunderbird and desktop also have a bit of JavaScript, so you only have to write the code once.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
I was like, I have no experience with that, but it sounds like a horrible idea.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
I offered to ask my friends that I'm mobile development that have used those frameworks before

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
and everyone was like, yeah, that's nice if you have super simple apps

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
that maybe do some rest calls and display some data from the web server.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
But everything that goes beyond that, you probably don't want to use that,

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
especially if you're trying to write an email client.

04:40.000 --> 04:44.000
So I told them that and Ryan went off and talked to other people,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
tried to find out how to do that.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
What I took away from the conversation was like Thunderbird was asking for donations

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
and was funding their development that way.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
I was like, I can probably do that as well, right?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
So I wrote a blog post.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
What's up with K9 Mail?

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
At that time, it was a difficult period for K9 Mail.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
The last stable release was September 2018.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
So that's one and a half year before the blog post.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
And the next stable release was maybe one and a half years off

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
because we were doing a big UI rewrite.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
The Android platform changed underneath that.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
We had to do a lot of catching up, so we were able to run on more than Android versions.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
I wrote a blog post outlining all of this and asking people for donations.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
And that kind of worked, but not really.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
I mean, maybe you have tried it for your own project.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
If you just write it in a blog post that nobody reads, you don't get a lot of money.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
At the end of that year, I ended up with not even 6,000 euros,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
which is nice for a hobby project.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
You can probably buy a new laptop, but you can't pay rent with that.

05:52.000 --> 05:58.000
Nevertheless, I tried again next year for iLOVE Free Software Day

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
or Valentine's Day for regular people, I guess.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Wrote a blog post, K9 Mail is looking for funding.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
So don't make it about the stuff that we can't do, like do new releases,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
leave with asking for money, and then basically I still outlined all this stuff.

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
Like we can't do releases because we still have to do a couple of things.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
That one spread really widely.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
And in February alone, over 18,000 euros in donations came in,

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
which was very nice.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
I figured if that continues, I am getting rich.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
Spoiler alert, it didn't.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
So donations got down, but at the end of the year, it was still 51,000 euros,

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
which is not quite a salary for a seasoned senior developer,

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
but it's enough to live on.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.000
And I was talking to the Thunderbird people on and off during that period.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
At some point, they were like, maybe we can just fork K9 Mail.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
I'm like, you could, but I mean, it's not in a great state.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
If you really want to, I can help you a little bit,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
but I'm not sure if you really want to do that.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
And then at the end of that year, I was contacted, oh, damn it.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
I was contacted by Ryan again, and he was like, we have to do this now.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
We need a Thunderbird for Android client.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
How about we just use K9 Mail, rename it to Thunderbird on Android,

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
and be done with it.

07:27.000 --> 07:33.000
And I'm like, okay, this asking for donation thing is nice,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
but really donations went down,

07:35.000 --> 07:39.000
and you have to constantly remind users to give you money.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
And if you're a maintainer for an open source project,

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
there's just one task on top of the huge list of tasks you do anywhere.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And I'm like, okay, if someone else could do that,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
and I could just work on that, that would be nice.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.000
So I asked Jesse if he'd be fine,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
if his old project was becoming Thunderbird for Android,

07:58.000 --> 08:02.000
and he's like, yeah, sure, go ahead.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
And that was basically the start.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Still, it took a couple more months

08:06.000 --> 08:11.000
until we actually announced that K9 Mail will be joining the Thunderbird family.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
And I was basically hired with a company

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
that does a pace developer to do Thunderbird development.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
So I guess first full-time employee working on K9 Mail.

08:27.000 --> 08:36.000
And the idea was K9 Mail will be renamed to Thunderbird for Android

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
eventually because we wanted to work on some features

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
that Thunderbird for Android should really have by the time it is released

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
with the Thunderbird stamp of approval.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.000
So the next thing we did is we hired a second Android developer

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
because two people get more work done than one.

08:57.000 --> 09:02.000
And we started informing the community about our progress.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.000
And if you've read those blog posts,

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
you will know that we haven't released Thunderbird for Android yet,

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
even though the plan was to do it by mid-2023.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
That kind of didn't work out.

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
And then we figured, okay, maybe do it by the end of the year,

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
cut some features, and then we decided,

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
no, we don't really want to cut features, we want those in there.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
So, well, there's no Thunderbird for Android yet.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
You will ask yourself, well, when is it going to be released?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
And if you were hoping, I will say now.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
The answer is very open source, so when it's done,

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
like I mentioned, we want to get the features in there.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
And you will ask yourself, well, what are those features?

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Roadmap, asterisk, so that's the current plan.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I mean, we've changed it before, might change it in the future.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
That's the plan for now.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
The new account setup, we've been working on what feels like forever,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
but it's almost done now.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
The latest beta will probably be the last one,

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
or penultimate one before a new stable release.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
If you're on the beta channel on Google Play,

10:20.000 --> 10:23.000
you can already use a new account setup.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
But you can't design three is not something I would have chosen,

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
but our users really like new shiny stuff.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.000
So, we put it on the list, improved folder management,

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
conversation view is what modern email clients need nowadays.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
Thunderbird sync, that's also part of the asterisk thing.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
It's something we really, really want,

10:43.000 --> 10:48.000
but there's a lot of technical problems or open questions

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
on the infrastructure side, also on the client implementation side.

10:51.000 --> 10:57.000
But the basic idea is sync settings between instances of Thunderbird,

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
be it the mobile version or the desktop version.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
Then what I put on there, we have existing functionality

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
that needs a bit of tweaking to make it more user-friendly.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
And of course, Android keeps changing stuff,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
so that's also something on the list,

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
which is I guess this year Android 15 will be released.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
There's been no new APIs announced yet.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
I think that starts in March,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
but who knows when we'll actually get to the release.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
All right, what about that?

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
A lot of users have mentioned that they really like the brand

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
and the icon and stuff like that.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
And so we decided, well, we'll keep it around.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
We wanted to change the application ID,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
the identifier Google Play uses,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
anyway to something more Thunderbird-like.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
So Thunderbird will be a separate app,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
and we will just keep, can I mail it around?

11:53.000 --> 11:57.000
Of course, we don't want to maintain two code bases that then diverge,

11:57.000 --> 12:02.000
so we will build from one code base, two apps.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
Hopefully, we haven't started on that work yet.

12:06.000 --> 12:11.000
And then the difference really is meant to just be visual stuff,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
so I can have name and the theming.

12:15.000 --> 12:21.000
Yeah, and since we are now in the client section,

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
we can also have screenshots.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
That's something that several people can't really do, right?

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
So, yeah, it's not too large of a screen.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
It's also really boring.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
It looks like every other email client, basically,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
you have a message list that contains a list of messages.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
If you tap one, you get a message view,

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
which displays the message contents.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
What could use a little bit more love in K9 Mail

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
is the compose screen,

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
but still it works for simple messages.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.000
Hopefully, in the future, also for more complex stuff.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
Then in the first screen, if you tap the hamburger icon,

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
not to be confused with a Kibbup menu,

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
you get an account switcher at the top,

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
and then a list of folders.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
Improving this to make it look nicer

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
is also in the list of folder management stuff.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Right, and since we're in open source project,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
if you really want to, you can contribute.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
The slides are on the FOSTA website,

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
so you don't have to type down the links.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
We are hosted on GitHub,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
so we are not doing the Thunderbird thing,

13:33.000 --> 13:38.000
like using McEul, using Bugzilla, and stuff like that.

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
Translations are on WebLate.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
We have a ton of them,

13:45.000 --> 13:49.000
but could use really help for some of the more obscure ones.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
One of the blog posts goes into details,

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
which one need help.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
We have a support forum where mostly users help each other,

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
which is really nice,

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
so we don't have to do a lot of stuff.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
But also, we develop and monitor that

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
to get an idea what users have problems with and fix it.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
We also have user documentation,

14:10.000 --> 14:14.000
which is not very often found these days, I find.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
It's also very outdated,

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
so it turns out maintaining user documentation is work.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.000
If you want to help out the project

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
and you're not good with code,

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
maybe you're good with words and screenshots,

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
so you could help out with documentation.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.000
All right, the one-minute sign goes up,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
and I'm also done.

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
Thunderbird has a stand here in Building K, level one.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
If you want to talk to some of the desktop people,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
they are probably also here.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
Maybe Hans-Up who's working on Thunderbird for desktop.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
Well, Kai is here. He's on the floor,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
so you probably don't see him,

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
but there are also some people at the stand.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Right, and with that,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I'm happy to answer questions if you have any.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Thank you very much.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Sorry, don't ask for the release date, probably.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
He won't have any questions.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
You need to help me, probably.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
There's so many people. I don't see.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
Ah!

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
So, how is the funding going, basically?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Where is the money coming from?

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
Oh, I see. There was a talk about that.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
You can probably find the video recording

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
on the FosterM website.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
Ryan talked about how Thunderbird is making money.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
The summary is we are asking users for donations,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
and that worked out really well.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Last year we made over 8 million.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.000
I don't have the exact number, so a lot of money.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
By the end of the year,

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
we have all of Thunderbird,

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
so the desktop app, mobile,

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
and some other projects we're working on.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
The plan is to have 45 people working by the end of the year.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Any further questions?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
While people are thinking,

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
you were mentioning the iOS topic in between,

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
but somehow that got lost in the rest of the presentations.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Can you say anything about that?

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
The first idea was maybe if we have an existing client,

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
so the same story with Android,

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
we could do that, but didn't find any.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
So the ideas will start from scratch,

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
and we're currently looking for someone to start that off.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
So it will come eventually.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Which year?

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
Probably not this one.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.000
You know, when it's done.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
Any further questions?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
Thank you.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
I have just a quick question regarding the forum and the issue tracker.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
Will you keep them around?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
Thank you.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
The issue tracker, yes.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.000
I mean, people report bugs, yes.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
And we don't want to switch to bugzilla.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
No offense to people that have to work with that,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
or even like it, but no.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.000
The support forum maybe depends on, you know, how it works out.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
If there are a lot more users and not more volunteers

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
helping out like answering questions and moderating this,

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
probably goes away,

17:31.000 --> 17:35.000
but for now there are no plans to abolish it.

17:35.000 --> 17:38.000
All right. Last chance.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I see no more hands.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.000
So thanks again for that nice presentation.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
Thank you.
