00:00.000 --> 00:09.920
So I was asked to try to summarize this and I was asked to do that before I knew it was

00:09.920 --> 00:13.680
a fishbowl and how difficult this is going to be.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.800
So bear with me and please don't insult me if I forgot something that you've said.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
I just tried to summarize.

00:17.800 --> 00:23.080
We're going to reuse the recording for everything that I've missed so that we can try to summarize

00:23.080 --> 00:26.760
all of this and all the points into a small report that we can share with policymakers

00:26.760 --> 00:31.280
and hopefully try to create that process where our voices are heard, which is the first

00:31.280 --> 00:33.720
point I'm going to try to start with.

00:33.720 --> 00:37.840
I think something that was interesting in the room is that there's sort of a divide

00:37.840 --> 00:42.080
between us about whether or not we believe that it's part of our role as citizens to

00:42.080 --> 00:47.000
get more and more involved within policy-making, more and more interested.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.080
And those that say, well, no, what I want to be interested in is writing code.

00:52.080 --> 00:57.240
And so this divide is interesting in a sense that one said, yeah, okay, but you're a citizen.

00:57.240 --> 01:00.640
You can just get involved the same way that, you know, if you're unhappy because there's

01:00.640 --> 01:04.480
not enough parking spot in your street, then you go to your town hall and you complain and

01:04.480 --> 01:05.880
you do it.

01:05.880 --> 01:12.600
Then the following point after that is that there is a huge, huge, huge knowledge gap and

01:12.600 --> 01:16.560
something that was missing from the conversation are ideas about how to solve that knowledge

01:16.560 --> 01:17.680
gap.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.800
But something that was quite interesting in that conversation as well, that is to say,

01:21.800 --> 01:25.720
well, there is only one organization that can really help you into doing that knowledge

01:25.720 --> 01:28.040
gap and as the European Commission.

01:28.040 --> 01:32.000
And that's where the sort of conversation ended on the knowledge gap.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.360
We know that the community has to do more.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.040
That's what people have said a lot and get more involved.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.000
And that's what people have said repeatedly.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.420
But we also have said that there is a work that needs to be done from the institution

01:42.420 --> 01:43.800
so that they share more information.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.560
And the only answer was the commission is the right place to do it.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.440
Again, don't insult me if I forgot something you said because I see people doing this.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.880
So sorry.

01:52.880 --> 01:58.960
Then someone...

01:58.960 --> 02:02.720
Something that was mentioned after and I'm not entering into the details of the NGI projects

02:02.720 --> 02:05.680
because I had trouble understanding them to be fair.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.160
I guess that's the knowledge gap.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.960
Is the lack of processes as well.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.200
So we've said there is a lack of knowledge.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.920
There is a lack of knowledge in our community.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.800
There is a lack of listening and from communicating from the institution.

02:18.800 --> 02:22.640
But something that was said repeatedly and repeatedly and repeatedly is that there is

02:22.640 --> 02:26.720
no processes for us to be able to express ourselves.

02:26.720 --> 02:31.360
And one was saying, yeah, we don't have processes within the community to be able to express

02:31.360 --> 02:32.840
ourselves entirely.

02:32.840 --> 02:36.400
Someone mentioned OFE, someone mentioned OFE as a coordinator, some organization that

02:36.400 --> 02:40.480
don't remember the acronyms because I was taking notes hardly.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.800
And someone else said, yeah, but there is also no processes within the institution for

02:43.800 --> 02:45.600
us to be there.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.440
Emails were mentioned by the parliament many times.

02:48.440 --> 02:49.440
Send us an email.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.520
We'd be able to share the information.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.560
But they also say the limits of their own resources.

02:53.560 --> 02:57.040
We're going to try to answer the emails, but if we're not really responsible for the files,

02:57.040 --> 02:59.000
we can't really do anything about it.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.160
And I guess there is something I can't really express more than what the community has done,

03:05.160 --> 03:07.480
which is we don't have a solution yet.

03:07.480 --> 03:12.080
So maybe the best way to conclude this summary of the FISHBALL is we should think about it

03:12.080 --> 03:15.520
more, discuss it more so that we figured out the way to solve the problem.

03:15.520 --> 03:20.000
And when I say we, I don't only mean the open source community, but also mean the policymakers

03:20.000 --> 03:24.800
because I think that's the call out that our community did to the policymakers today.

03:24.800 --> 03:29.120
Speak with us, but also speak with ourselves, with each other so that you figure out a solution

03:29.120 --> 03:30.560
so that we can be more involved.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.640
Again, sorry if I didn't summarize the best way possible.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.080
I tried to take better notes next time.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.080
Thank you.
