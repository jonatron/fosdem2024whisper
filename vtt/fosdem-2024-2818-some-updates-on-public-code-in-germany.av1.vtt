WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.480
Okay. Hi everyone. My name is Marco and I'm an active member of the Floss community for

00:14.480 --> 00:22.960
about 10 years now of contributions to SignalDino also in the wireless community tooling, wireless

00:22.960 --> 00:29.840
mesh community tooling area. Currently I'm working for the German government for a German

00:29.840 --> 00:36.480
government agency that builds IT infrastructure for Germany, mainly backend infrastructure.

00:37.280 --> 00:44.800
And we like we are in the middle between the 16 federal states of Germany and the federal

00:45.520 --> 00:54.800
so we have a lot of stakeholders in place and to contribute to. Also during this job I get a lot

00:54.800 --> 01:01.520
of feedback and see a lot of things that are happening in Germany. So first maybe let's talk

01:01.520 --> 01:08.000
about a little motivation about this talk. So in Germany I have the feeling that the term open

01:08.000 --> 01:14.400
source is very omnipresent in the public administration also in politics. No one actually

01:14.480 --> 01:22.960
speaks about free software. So the open source term is the leading term here. Also there's very

01:22.960 --> 01:29.440
little information about how Floss is used in public administration and also there's little

01:29.440 --> 01:38.560
knowledge in public administration about how to handle Floss software appropriately and

01:38.560 --> 01:42.960
there's hardly any contact with the Floss community. There are exceptions of course but

01:42.960 --> 01:51.280
like generally speaking there are ways to improve that. There are also hardly any statistics on

01:51.920 --> 01:58.800
the use of free and open source software in the German government and so my impression after

01:59.600 --> 02:06.480
three years in this domain is now that everyone is talking about at least open source software.

02:07.200 --> 02:14.000
Maybe they also mean free software. Maybe they don't do the decision between the two terms.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.720
It's also okay but in practice hardly anyone is really doing or following these software

02:22.720 --> 02:29.440
development practices. Yeah right now there is a lot of happening in Germany and I thought it

02:29.440 --> 02:36.640
might be a good chance to give an update what happened in the last year or so and what's happening

02:36.640 --> 02:43.600
right now to give you a better feeling how these things that happen in Germany might also be like

02:43.600 --> 02:49.840
relevant for other countries or if you are from Germany I hope it might also be interesting for you.

02:50.240 --> 03:00.560
Yeah so the first question are we Floss yet in Germany especially and I wanted to start with

03:00.560 --> 03:13.600
the state of Floss laws and regulations there. So in June 2020 yeah two and a half years ago

03:13.600 --> 03:21.120
there was a principle defined in the service standard and this service standard

03:21.840 --> 03:28.240
like these designs or gives design principles for government digital web services like

03:28.240 --> 03:34.240
interactions between people and the government and this service standard is also mandatory

03:34.960 --> 03:42.480
for the largest digitalization program over the last five years. Those of you who are from Germany

03:42.480 --> 03:49.760
may know it as online two and a half years or short OZG. It's a law in Germany that mandates the

03:50.480 --> 03:57.920
government agencies to provide their services online and in this principle it says that a

03:57.920 --> 04:04.720
source code from the realization of digital services must be made available as open source

04:04.720 --> 04:11.600
so that's very progressive. We think that's a nice thing but the problem with it it's not mandatory.

04:13.360 --> 04:24.320
There made a survey I think in 2012 no what was it it's written down here 2022.

04:24.320 --> 04:33.760
They made a survey and out of 15 from 221 people that have been been asked to give it a high priority

04:33.760 --> 04:42.240
in their in their own projects but that's only a very few people from and in practice I also

04:42.240 --> 04:48.080
see many people don't don't know it actually so it's not not very broadly adopted.

04:52.080 --> 04:58.320
Then in 2021 there was another approach there was an obligation from the economic stimulus package

04:59.280 --> 05:06.800
also intended to improve government digital services and there it says the source code

05:06.800 --> 05:12.000
will be made available as open source whenever possible. Nobody really knows what this whenever

05:12.000 --> 05:19.680
possible means and unfortunately the federal ministry of the interior didn't really keep track

05:19.680 --> 05:26.960
of which projects actually released software as as open source under any open license.

05:27.920 --> 05:34.480
I think actually so I personally know only one. There were a lot of projects in there that got

05:34.480 --> 05:46.160
funding so this really didn't have had much impact. Then in November 2021 there we had a new

05:46.160 --> 05:53.280
parliament in Germany we had elections and the coalition that formed after these elections

05:54.160 --> 05:59.200
then decided or wrote down in their coalition agreement that they wanted to

05:59.280 --> 06:09.600
or yeah that the development contracts of public agencies should be generally commissioned as open

06:09.600 --> 06:15.120
source and the corresponding software that is being developed should always be made public.

06:15.120 --> 06:27.280
So this is like the same intention again and yeah there's a but because like after this agreement

06:28.080 --> 06:36.800
the German government spent 4.8 million a billion euros investment in proprietary cloud

06:36.800 --> 06:43.280
infrastructure in addition to 1.3 billion dollars to Microsoft licenses of course you can't just

06:43.280 --> 06:48.560
throw Microsoft software away it doesn't work. So this is like more a long time

06:49.520 --> 06:54.480
terms change but these 4.8 million cloud infrastructure that have been like this

06:54.480 --> 07:00.800
was a new contract that didn't exist before in this form you could have like invested in open

07:00.800 --> 07:10.080
source software here. Also in general less than 1% investment during like for the second by the

07:10.080 --> 07:15.760
current government investments from the current government from the current legislation went

07:15.760 --> 07:24.640
into the open source software ecosystem and also the plan financing for so-called senders

07:24.640 --> 07:31.920
that's the the German Ospo has been cut by nearly half due to resource I don't know they

07:31.920 --> 07:40.160
didn't find the money that was needed so they had only 24 million euros that's still a lot of money

07:40.800 --> 07:50.480
for an Ospo that's great but yeah compared to the initial plan it's less than we expected and hoped.

07:52.240 --> 08:00.560
And also there is still no floss procurement regulations that are badly needed to give government

08:00.560 --> 08:10.800
agencies a tool to really require these procurements to be based on open source licenses.

08:13.520 --> 08:18.880
But we have some policies in the German federal states we have 16 federal states in Germany

08:19.680 --> 08:26.240
and two of them Turing and Schleswig-Holstein they defined a priority for free software

08:27.040 --> 08:35.040
in their federal laws. The first one like it's mainly the same text in those regulations

08:36.480 --> 08:45.120
and the first aspect is that a priority for free software should be applied if technically possible

08:45.120 --> 08:50.160
and economical this is again we don't really know what this means it's like hard to define when is

08:50.320 --> 08:57.280
it economic to use open source software compared to proprietary software often this like also comes

08:57.280 --> 09:04.720
with long-term impacts so this is this is a really hard question and it's easy to like find some

09:05.600 --> 09:14.000
arguments why it's not even cheaper. Also for in-house developments the rule is that an open

09:14.080 --> 09:22.000
source license yeah has to be applied and the software needs to be published as long as it is

09:22.000 --> 09:28.880
not used for security relevant tasks and this is still again I don't know what your security

09:28.880 --> 09:36.320
relevant task is and even like for maybe people thought about like police software etc but still

09:36.320 --> 09:45.040
I think we in this room are know that even like especially in these domains it's super

09:45.040 --> 09:51.040
relevant to have open source software to have the possibility to see inside the code and see what

09:51.040 --> 09:58.560
they're doing there. First to improve the security and second like to improve control

09:59.520 --> 10:06.640
of what agencies do in their day-to-day business. Okay but still like these two

10:07.840 --> 10:13.040
federal states have these like thought about these questions, applied some regulations that's great

10:13.680 --> 10:19.360
I really like the effort there and in practice we see there are still also there are some very

10:19.360 --> 10:26.240
motivated people in the governments there and they're doing everything they can to improve

10:26.560 --> 10:32.320
this even further so I think that's a very good first step here that's nice.

10:35.840 --> 10:42.240
So let's have a short look at the European perspective here. I just created a graphic

10:42.240 --> 10:54.400
based on the information from the join-up platform also from a questionnaire to the

10:57.440 --> 11:05.360
German Bundestag like our federal parliament and we see that currently right now there are

11:05.360 --> 11:12.960
some countries in Germany actually in Europe actually I would say it's a huge amount of the

11:12.960 --> 11:27.120
or like relevant parts of Europe in terms of like their power also in the European parliament

11:27.200 --> 11:31.760
have some some regulations in place concerning open source software.

11:33.920 --> 11:41.040
The Swiss parliament just passed a law this year or last year sorry in March 23 to publish all

11:41.040 --> 11:45.760
government software and an open license there will be another talk in the legal and policy issue

11:45.760 --> 11:55.280
deaf room at 226th Oc so yeah head over to this talk to get more insights about Switzerland.

11:57.360 --> 12:07.520
Okay so but let's have a look at floss in practice and in generally we must summarize that these

12:07.520 --> 12:13.120
political objectives that have been defined are mainly ignored to be honest in public administration

12:13.120 --> 12:18.960
so there is no like the step from legislation to like the execution of this laws is hard and it's

12:19.920 --> 12:22.000
yeah it's not done not not not done yet.

12:25.440 --> 12:32.720
As in the industry we also have this phenomenon of open washing like presenting some kind of

12:32.720 --> 12:41.280
software as being open when in fact it's actually not. A small example for this is like the government

12:41.280 --> 12:48.880
site builder that's used to build the websites of all the German ministries and on their website

12:48.880 --> 12:55.600
they say it's based on open source we dig a bit deeper we can see that the technology the

12:55.600 --> 13:03.120
technological basis is 100% open source that sounds great so I wanted to dig a bit deeper

13:03.680 --> 13:10.320
and I tried to find some download link I have found some and unfortunately I didn't come to any

13:10.320 --> 13:17.200
git repo or something instead I was greeted with an HTTP basic auth because like the software is

13:17.200 --> 13:20.800
based on open source software it's correct but it's not released as open source software.

13:25.440 --> 13:30.000
So why is that that the public administration doesn't really respect these political intentions

13:30.000 --> 13:35.920
that have been formed on or formulated on like every federal level in Germany like from the

13:36.880 --> 13:44.320
from the top federal level in the Bundestag to the federal states and

13:46.320 --> 13:52.720
as far as I see it the public administration has like no no too little experience either with public

13:52.720 --> 13:58.320
procurement of free software it's hard they don't know how to like buy free software and buy

13:59.040 --> 14:04.480
support for free software and also they have no experience with releasing software or releasing

14:04.480 --> 14:11.920
their own code as free software there's little incentive to invest in existing free software

14:12.720 --> 14:18.480
coming from some laws and regulations and also there's little incentive to release

14:18.480 --> 14:26.400
own code and to collaborate with others to improve their own code because there's so little knowledge

14:26.480 --> 14:29.520
about the like benefits of all of that.

14:32.400 --> 14:40.800
Yeah, like in summary I think the application of these

14:40.800 --> 14:45.440
floss software development models still heavily depends on individuals we have individual

14:46.320 --> 14:51.920
cities and we will see there in we'll later see an example of this where it works really well but

14:52.800 --> 15:00.480
yeah my feeling is that it's still dependent on individual persons that yeah mandate for this

15:00.480 --> 15:06.880
and do the the heavy work in practice it's not really widespread and spread adopted in all government

15:06.880 --> 15:14.720
agencies. Yeah we will later see how to fix that but first maybe let's talk about some wins there

15:14.720 --> 15:21.600
are also great things that are happening in Germany. Germany just built an open source

15:21.600 --> 15:29.760
collaboration platform called OpenCode it consists of like GitLab instance there's a discourse forum

15:29.760 --> 15:38.080
there's a wiki.js wiki and it also is also based on the public code YAML standard that is used to

15:38.080 --> 15:46.640
annotate the purpose of public software and this encourages the public agencies to make things open

15:47.520 --> 15:54.880
today the administrations do not really dare to do this though like with this platform they can see

15:54.880 --> 16:00.400
that other government agencies also release their code and if others do it it might be okay and I

16:00.400 --> 16:06.720
might also be able to to release my code as free and open source software and I think that's a great

16:06.720 --> 16:15.200
thing. Also it's somehow a safe haven for for public administrations to get some first experience

16:15.840 --> 16:21.440
where they don't have to go to all the real free software or external free software

16:22.240 --> 16:29.760
repositories like like gitlab.com or or like even github where they have no experience with and like

16:29.760 --> 16:34.320
this is inside the government even if it's public it's something government owned and this might

16:34.320 --> 16:41.520
help to to convince some people to release their software there. I think it works okay so there's

16:41.600 --> 16:48.400
already more public organizations on there than on github at least for for the german

16:48.400 --> 16:55.280
organizations to be fair there are very little organizations on on github in Germany from the

16:55.280 --> 17:03.680
public administration yeah but still only a few real projects exist on this platform to be honest

17:04.640 --> 17:09.120
many of them are stubs many of them are just code dumps or other kinds of documentation

17:09.840 --> 17:14.960
consultation processes etc so it I think it's a good start there needs to be more

17:15.920 --> 17:22.080
more code there integrate all these products we know like for example next cloud colabora

17:23.280 --> 17:30.240
also Univention Corporate Server, Op-Mix Change and all this this kind of software that exists

17:30.240 --> 17:35.920
but doesn't really integrate very well and the idea of Open Desk is to pay the software vendors to

17:35.920 --> 17:44.880
to build integrations between these solutions. Also there is an interesting project from Germany

17:44.880 --> 17:53.680
that's called Kullibri it's completely public funded by an IT service provider of the federal

17:53.680 --> 18:01.040
government and it's basically a component library that uses web components and is meant to be

18:01.760 --> 18:08.960
what are meant to have a strong focus on accessibility and they also do a real open source

18:08.960 --> 18:15.120
model they also accept accepting contributions in my opinion they have interesting great tech

18:15.120 --> 18:20.400
but it doesn't really feel like public administration project it's the normal open source project

18:20.400 --> 18:26.400
and that's great great as a huge recommendation if you if you're looking into a component library

18:26.400 --> 18:28.640
maybe this this might be an interesting thing for you

18:31.120 --> 18:35.840
there's also the current design system that's meant to be used for all government services

18:36.480 --> 18:44.240
to build a unique or re-identifiable design system it's not an actual software project

18:44.240 --> 18:51.600
like the design system which that defines which design elements are used on the websites

18:52.240 --> 18:57.360
but still they have the philosophy and also the community building parts

18:58.080 --> 19:03.200
baked in in their DNA and they're trying to to get involvement and they're trying to to

19:03.200 --> 19:08.400
build a community that's also a great thing that that that happens right now

19:10.640 --> 19:16.880
already mentioned there are some cities they're doing great progress the city of Munich built

19:17.600 --> 19:23.920
its own open source transparency website and this is really interesting because they document

19:23.920 --> 19:29.520
which floss software they use they also document which software they contribute to both in terms

19:29.520 --> 19:38.080
of code and also in terms of funding and they also document which software they write and publish

19:38.080 --> 19:43.840
so they really understood the benefits of free and open source software and build a website to

19:43.840 --> 19:47.600
make it transparent i think that's a good example maybe for other cities too

19:49.760 --> 19:56.960
and we have the national documentation portal that's like read the docs like project

19:57.920 --> 20:05.280
where documentation for developers on the core government infrastructure can be found it's by

20:05.280 --> 20:10.640
itself a license under the european union public license and it's also contributing accepting

20:10.640 --> 20:19.680
contributions so let me close this talk with the question what does it take for free software to

20:19.680 --> 20:26.720
be to become the the default in public authorities and i've brought three challenges here the first

20:26.720 --> 20:33.920
one we need to release custom build software of course under free software licenses i think the

20:33.920 --> 20:38.640
regulations here are very very important so there needs to be some regulation in place that

20:38.720 --> 20:44.080
enforces governments to do this because otherwise they have no knowledge in this there's no

20:45.040 --> 20:51.280
so like there's little to no motivation why to do this in the first place so regulation

20:52.320 --> 20:55.200
helps very much here to to release all all the code

20:57.520 --> 21:04.080
yeah and of course also knowledge and skills in this area need to be built up in the administration

21:04.640 --> 21:11.600
maybe our ospo made contribute a lot to this in the next years but that's a major challenge

21:11.600 --> 21:18.880
in all government agencies second challenge uh for software procurement is of course a real

21:20.080 --> 21:22.720
yeah a thing here we need

21:34.080 --> 21:35.460
you

22:04.080 --> 22:04.980
you

22:34.080 --> 22:34.980
you

23:04.800 --> 23:05.380
you

23:09.760 --> 23:13.520
very important because we need to measure our progress does it really work

23:14.640 --> 23:22.800
does it do we make progress in in this in this area right now there are hardly any statistics so

23:23.440 --> 23:28.960
i think it's it might be a good idea to have the mandatory use of a researchable software catalog

23:28.960 --> 23:35.200
before buying any software like the italian government does this already there's the italian

23:36.400 --> 23:42.080
free software catalog and all italian government agencies need to have a look at this catalog

23:42.080 --> 23:46.640
it doesn't really say anything about what they do about this like results they just have to document

23:46.640 --> 23:53.840
that they have searched here for for the software or for the kind of software that they want to buy

23:54.560 --> 23:59.760
and if there's something in there they that's a good opportunity to look into it and see

24:01.440 --> 24:06.880
like for example is yeah is this software useful for us before they're buying any

24:08.000 --> 24:09.200
yeah non-free software here

24:12.640 --> 24:15.520
yeah if you want to learn more we collected some

24:16.320 --> 24:21.040
infos on best practices about free software in the german government also some examples

24:21.920 --> 24:28.800
this kind of follows the idea of of like the awesome list but like just find some information

24:29.760 --> 24:37.520
about what is what has worked in the government to improve free open source software

24:38.400 --> 24:43.920
maybe this might also be something for for other countries too for your communities too

24:44.640 --> 24:50.960
i really encourage you to build some knowledge about what already exists and communicate

24:51.840 --> 24:54.240
