00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Thank you.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Okay, perfect.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
I'm sorry we need the microphone.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Okay, so now we're going to have a wrap up from the

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
repertoire on the inside inputs that we got.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
But let's take around five minutes.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Only five minutes, and then you can go.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
That's all right.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Okay.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Oh, yeah.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I'm sorry.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
I'm sorry.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I'm sorry.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Okay.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
All yours.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
I'll do a gesture thingy.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Okay.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
So for the few of you that might still have forgotten about what we

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
heard about in the last two hours,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
I'll just do a quick wrap up.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
But first of all, thank you all for putting forward so many questions.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
We're very happy to see that many people be interested by public sector and

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
public sector.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
And having so much interest in what our speakers presented,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
I think maybe it's all right.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
I think maybe some of the most interesting comments were first on

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
the presentation of Issa before that related to clearly the

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
question of the implementation of this act.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
And then we'll have to go back to the first question.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
Clearly the question of the implementation of this act and how to

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
be part of this question of the interprobability assessment.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
Now it was also made quite clear that this legislation is not an OS law

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
and that there were many pushbacks again having this made as an OS law

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
instead of having it just as an interprobability Europe act.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
A lot of you also raised question of the open documents,

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
of the open format and how this will be integrated into this regulation.

01:54.000 --> 01:58.000
I think that's what's very nice to hear.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
And on the question of standardization there as well,

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
it's been quite clear that the board would be one of the main actors in the

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
implementation of those.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
As for the second presentation and the question of the OS,

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
the question of the OS strategy,

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
you raised question about the inner source, how to move away from inner source.

02:22.000 --> 02:28.000
I think it was also quite clear that it was the first step and that it was really helpful for you.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
And on the question of incentivizing or having mandatory

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
use of open source and what was the strategy used which was clearly

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
trying to understand how open source works, why people adopted and trying to avoid having

02:42.000 --> 02:48.000
counter effect by making it too mandatory or strong.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah, and maybe just to finish, I think one last one.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Oh, yeah, thank you.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
One last one was really interesting also on the question of the EIDES.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
Thank you for bringing that up and other regulation like this.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
So we talked about very specific policy papers or regulations today,

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
but there's a lot of regulation at the U-Level that are constant by open source.

03:12.000 --> 03:20.000
And I think it was really interesting to learn about how actually it can be shaped up by this reference implementation and so on.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.000
So, yeah, thank you all.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
I will finish to write a better report about that later on.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
And good luck to those who stay.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
We will start, I think, in a few minutes.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
So, yeah, thank you.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Thank you.
