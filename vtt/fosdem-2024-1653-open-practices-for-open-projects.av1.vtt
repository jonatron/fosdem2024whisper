00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Life Stream is on.

00:06.720 --> 00:15.600
So yours everybody, welcome, Dhanu Benjamin.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.120
Hello everyone.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.120
Hello.

00:18.120 --> 00:25.840
This is my first FOSSTEM.

00:25.840 --> 00:32.640
I have wanted to come to FOSSTEM for so long and I've come from all the way on the other

00:32.640 --> 00:34.480
side of the planet.

00:34.480 --> 00:39.880
Is there anyone in the room right now from New Zealand?

00:39.880 --> 00:44.520
Because if you're from New Zealand you've come further than me and if you're not from

00:44.520 --> 00:52.880
New Zealand then I probably have travelled the furthest to be here today.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.880
I'm from Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.480
My name is Donna Benjamin.

00:56.480 --> 01:00.120
I'm the product owner and maintainer of the Open Practice Library.

01:00.120 --> 01:06.000
So I'm very proud to be emblazoned and being a public billboard today.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.480
And the stickers that I've just passed your way are the very simplest and easiest way

01:11.480 --> 01:15.800
of contributing to my project is to spread the word.

01:15.800 --> 01:20.160
Wear your sticker with pride somewhere and help tell the world about the Open Practice

01:20.160 --> 01:21.160
Library.

01:21.160 --> 01:24.040
But wait, I hear you say.

01:24.040 --> 01:28.920
Why would I want to tell the world about the Open Practice Library?

01:28.920 --> 01:33.680
Well my answer is, well why wouldn't you?

01:33.680 --> 01:36.600
Well let me tell you why I think it's awesome.

01:36.600 --> 01:44.080
Way back in, well over a decade ago now, for a little while I was a born again agilist.

01:44.080 --> 01:49.800
I did a scrum master course and I thought wow this is amazing and I became like a scrum

01:49.800 --> 01:53.480
padawan learning everything about scrum and thinking it was awesome.

01:53.480 --> 01:58.200
I'd been involved in the open source community for a long time before that and I felt like

01:58.200 --> 02:05.640
there was all this like similarities between like open source and the agile stuff and I'd

02:05.640 --> 02:11.480
been to lots of open source events and I went to some agile events and whilst we were all

02:11.480 --> 02:18.600
talking about software, none of the agile people were talking about open source and

02:18.600 --> 02:21.200
none of the open source people were talking about agile.

02:21.240 --> 02:28.200
It's almost like they were on different planets and there were a few people who were familiar

02:28.200 --> 02:32.920
with both worlds but not many.

02:32.920 --> 02:37.320
And then I came across the Open Practice Library.

02:37.320 --> 02:43.720
Thank you Leslie Hawthorne who sadly isn't with us but is one of the organisers of this

02:43.720 --> 02:50.360
Dev Room who introduced me to the Open Practice Library and I went oh my goodness this is

02:50.400 --> 03:01.440
the first time I've seen open and agile together and for me that was like

03:01.440 --> 03:05.680
because it made so much sense to me.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.240
I'd always wondered why they weren't together.

03:08.240 --> 03:09.760
I still don't know why they're not together.

03:09.760 --> 03:15.200
I have theories but no hard evidence shall we say.

03:15.200 --> 03:19.400
Okay so as you can tell I'm not doing slides.

03:19.400 --> 03:24.400
If you've bothered to read the little description of this talk then you may have some idea but

03:24.400 --> 03:27.840
in practice I know most people don't bother reading the abstracts they just kind of end

03:27.840 --> 03:33.600
up in a room at a conference so that's okay no judgement right no judgement.

03:33.600 --> 03:41.840
But what I wanted to do was to introduce this idea of open practices for open projects.

03:41.880 --> 03:47.600
So hands up if you're involved in an open source project.

03:47.600 --> 03:57.440
Okay hands up if you in that involvement have come across various needs, challenges, things

03:57.440 --> 03:59.680
that need doing.

03:59.680 --> 04:05.040
I think that's everyone.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.960
Was there anyone who didn't put up their hand?

04:06.960 --> 04:07.960
Did I miss you?

04:07.960 --> 04:08.960
No good.

04:08.960 --> 04:15.680
So the thing about the open practice library is that last word library.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.360
I like to think of a library as two things.

04:18.360 --> 04:23.680
Obviously it's a collection of stuff like usually books but other stuff.

04:23.680 --> 04:31.080
But libraries are often the hub at the centre of their community and so I think that's a

04:31.080 --> 04:37.840
really nice kind of thing to think about in the community developer room at Foster, right?

04:37.840 --> 04:44.280
We're talking about a hub of a community and the people in that community are and again

04:44.280 --> 04:49.120
the clue is in the word practitioners.

04:49.120 --> 04:59.160
They practice things and those things are practices and the kinds of practices in the

04:59.160 --> 05:06.240
library are organised around the Mobius loop.

05:06.240 --> 05:12.560
The Mobius loop is an outcome based delivery framework developed by Gabrielle Benfield

05:12.560 --> 05:16.640
and it starts with a discovery.

05:16.640 --> 05:24.080
It continues with a decision making kind of chunk and then there's delivery and then

05:24.080 --> 05:31.240
you cycle back through your options and decisions perhaps back to discovery or perhaps continuing

05:31.240 --> 05:35.560
to deliver based on what you've learned.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.680
In the open practice library we took Gabby's stuff because it was Creative Commons and we

05:40.680 --> 05:43.560
added a foundation underneath it.

05:43.560 --> 05:47.680
I think of that foundation as a bit more like a seesaw because we're trying to keep

05:47.680 --> 05:53.640
in balance cultural practices and technology practices.

05:53.640 --> 06:01.480
So on the cultural side we'll have things like a social contract or a team API or a

06:01.520 --> 06:02.520
manual of me.

06:02.520 --> 06:08.560
I think someone I think lovely Scottish chap this morning earlier.

06:08.560 --> 06:13.480
Mike talked about having a manual of me or some kind of personal API.

06:13.480 --> 06:16.760
That's a practice in the open practice library as well.

06:16.760 --> 06:21.800
But those cultural or social practices are also balanced by technical practices, stuff

06:21.800 --> 06:27.520
like CI CD pipelines, canary releases, observability.

06:28.520 --> 06:32.560
They're the underpinning platforms and I say it's a seesaw because you've got to have

06:32.560 --> 06:33.560
both.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.200
You've got to have those things in balance.

06:36.200 --> 06:40.080
And that foundation underpins the kind of work that you do to discover.

06:40.080 --> 06:43.800
Like we talked yesterday we heard a bit about product management and I think a lot of the

06:43.800 --> 06:50.320
product management practices fit in that discover phase of really understanding who this thing

06:50.320 --> 06:55.160
is for, why it exists, why they need it.

06:55.200 --> 07:02.320
And the delivery side once you've built something you need to be able to measure and learn.

07:02.320 --> 07:07.920
So that gives you kind of high level idea of the practice library.

07:07.920 --> 07:14.440
What I want to do now and this is the worst room to try and do this is actually have you

07:14.440 --> 07:16.440
talk to each other for a little bit.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.040
Sorry, live stream this is not going to be much fun for you.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.440
Maybe you could jot down some thoughts on pen and paper or just have a think while we

07:23.480 --> 07:24.760
have this little section.

07:24.760 --> 07:25.760
Okay, yeah, good.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.760
Awesome.

07:26.760 --> 07:27.760
You guys rock.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.760
Okay, so you who are here, I know it's tricky.

07:30.760 --> 07:33.600
So what I want you to try and do is kind of look around you, who's sitting beside you

07:33.600 --> 07:36.320
or maybe behind you and just huddle a little bit.

07:36.320 --> 07:42.120
That question I asked you before, you're involved in an open source project, tick, and you have

07:42.120 --> 07:47.560
some stuff that needs doing or thinking about or changing whatever.

07:47.560 --> 07:51.160
And I want you to just have a chat about that stuff.

07:51.200 --> 07:55.200
What are the things you want to tackle?

07:55.200 --> 07:59.360
Do you need to imagine something new or new set of features?

07:59.360 --> 08:05.120
Do you need to tackle a thoughty community problem as Angie and I have done on the odd

08:05.120 --> 08:06.120
occasion?

08:06.120 --> 08:10.240
Whatever it is, whatever the stuff is, no judgment, could be technical, could be social,

08:10.240 --> 08:13.400
could be infrastructure, could be finance, whatever it is.

08:13.400 --> 08:18.560
I just want you to have a little huddle and talk about the stuff.

08:18.560 --> 08:27.200
And I'm going to give you three minutes if I can count based on this clock.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.200
Your time starts now.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.400
Let's count it down.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.240
So I'm going to count 13.

10:48.400 --> 10:52.640
OK.

10:52.640 --> 11:05.600
Hello.

11:05.600 --> 11:10.400
Hello.

11:10.400 --> 11:15.400
Okay, hello!

11:15.400 --> 11:18.400
Hello!

11:18.400 --> 11:21.400
You got to be...

11:21.400 --> 11:23.400
Oh!

11:23.400 --> 11:27.400
Ooh! Nice!

11:27.400 --> 11:32.400
Sorry to rudely interrupt your conversations.

11:32.400 --> 11:36.400
It was kind of fascinating watching from down here,

11:36.400 --> 11:38.400
because some of you were like, into it.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.400
So you're like...

11:41.400 --> 11:44.400
And that's fine.

11:44.400 --> 11:49.400
So I'm hoping that you stimulated a few ideas,

11:49.400 --> 11:53.400
exchanged some maybe commonalities, maybe contrasts.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.400
What I'd love to do now, and I don't know that...

11:55.400 --> 11:57.400
I'm not going to try and make you run with the mics

11:57.400 --> 11:59.400
to try and get to everybody.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.400
I'll repeat.

12:00.400 --> 12:05.400
So what I'd love to do now is hear a little bit.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.400
What happened to my bit of chalk?

12:07.400 --> 12:10.400
Some different strategies.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.400
Sorry, not strategies.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.400
Different challenges and stuff.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.400
Thank you, Mike.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.400
Can we go to the box and show Karen the table?

12:17.400 --> 12:18.400
All good.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.400
All right, so I'm going to write down here.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.400
You're not all going to be able to see it, but I can reach it.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.400
Practical, right?

12:26.400 --> 12:29.400
Practices, practical.

12:29.400 --> 12:34.400
So who would like to start the bidding with a challenge for me?

12:37.400 --> 12:39.400
Getting developers to document.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.400
Getting developers to document.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.400
We just had this fabulous talk about that as well, right?

12:44.400 --> 12:46.400
Getting developers to document.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.400
And I think one of the things I really heard Erin say

12:48.400 --> 12:51.400
is around prioritisation.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.400
How do you prioritise things?

12:53.400 --> 12:56.400
And there are, in the Open Practice Library,

12:56.400 --> 12:59.400
a couple of different practices, actually probably more than a couple,

12:59.400 --> 13:04.400
focusing on prioritisation activities that you can do.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.400
Some of the famous ones, it's called the Eisenhower Matrix,

13:06.400 --> 13:08.400
or how now, wow.

13:08.400 --> 13:18.400
So document prioritisation is a good one.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.400
For which we have practices.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
Awesome, thank you.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.400
Next.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.400
Overcoming single-maintainership.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.400
Sorry?

13:26.400 --> 13:28.400
Overcoming single-person maintenance.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.400
Overcoming single-person maintenance.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.400
Ooh, that's a good one.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
I don't know if I've got a single practice for that,

13:35.400 --> 13:40.400
but I think that's about creating a space that invites collaboration.

13:40.400 --> 13:44.400
And a lot of our practices are designed to be collaborative

13:44.400 --> 13:46.400
and have people come together.

13:46.400 --> 13:49.400
So I guess it may even be part of this starting with docs

13:49.400 --> 13:51.400
and putting the call out.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.400
And one of our other speakers this morning

13:53.400 --> 13:55.400
around communication strategies, right?

13:55.400 --> 13:59.400
How do you get people to come on board and help?

13:59.400 --> 14:01.400
So I can't answer that one. I like it.

14:01.400 --> 14:11.400
So let me put single-maintainer challenge.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.400
All right, my writing is terrible.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.400
Don't judge. Yes.

14:16.400 --> 14:21.400
Getting your technical leads to write down a roadmap.

14:21.400 --> 14:26.400
Getting your technical leads to write down a roadmap.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.400
Getting your technical leads to write down a roadmap.

14:29.400 --> 14:33.400
Cat, I'm not sure that's a practice.

14:33.400 --> 14:38.400
But, bragging. Yeah.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.400
But I think it's a good one, though.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.400
Does anyone want to shout out some strategies for that?

14:43.400 --> 14:48.400
How do you get stuff out of people's head and onto the page?

14:48.400 --> 14:49.400
Document a prioritise.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.400
Document a prioritise.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.400
Gold star.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.400
Brainstorming.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.400
Brainstorming.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.400
Start with a wrong answer.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.400
Oh, that's a brilliant one.

14:58.400 --> 15:03.400
Start with the wrong answer.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.400
And someone will correct it.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.400
Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. Yes.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.400
I listen to them.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.400
Listen to them.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.400
What if they're not talking?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.400
Yeah, they are.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.400
They don't want to write it down.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.400
They don't want to write it down.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.400
But maybe they don't need to write it down.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.400
This is where the collaboration piece comes in, right?

15:22.400 --> 15:27.400
A lot of the practices in the library are about helping teams do their stuff.

15:27.400 --> 15:31.400
Collaborate, either how to make sure they're building the right thing

15:31.400 --> 15:33.400
and building the thing right.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.400
But not everyone is a writer.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.400
And not everyone is a coder or a community manager.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.400
So what you want is this diverse perspectives and skills

15:41.400 --> 15:49.400
and for someone to work with the tech lead to at least talk about what is in their heads.

15:49.400 --> 15:54.400
And then maybe someone else can write it down.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.400
Good one.

15:55.400 --> 15:59.400
Right. Another. Sage.

15:59.400 --> 16:05.400
Finding and encouraging and nurturing mentors.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.400
Finding, encouraging and nurturing mentors.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.400
Awesome.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.400
Do we have a practice for that?

16:14.400 --> 16:17.400
No, but I think outreach he does and Patch is welcome.

16:17.400 --> 16:24.400
Yes.

16:24.400 --> 16:31.400
How do you create a welcoming space for other types of contributions to community?

16:31.400 --> 16:32.400
Like documentation.

16:32.400 --> 16:37.400
How do you create a welcoming space for other types of contributions to come in?

16:37.400 --> 16:42.400
Like documentation, like community management, like social media.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.400
Great question.

16:43.400 --> 16:47.400
Again, I'm not sure we've got specific practice for that.

16:47.400 --> 16:52.400
From community involvement at various times,

16:52.400 --> 16:56.400
be welcoming is like the first step.

16:56.400 --> 17:04.400
Be surprised how often and how unwelcoming so many open projects have been traditionally.

17:04.400 --> 17:06.400
I think it's actually changed.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.400
I've got grey hairs now.

17:07.400 --> 17:10.400
I'm beginning to sort of see a then and now.

17:10.400 --> 17:23.400
But being welcoming and making that an explicit value is probably the first step.

17:23.400 --> 17:33.400
And having consequences for behaviour that turns people away is probably the second.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.400
Really nice, nice point.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.400
I like that one. Thank you.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.400
Yes.

17:38.400 --> 17:42.400
A moderator is usually also a good mentor.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.400
Nice.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.400
That you have to train the moderator.

17:46.400 --> 17:52.400
A moderator is also usually a good mentor, but you also have to train the moderator.

17:52.400 --> 17:58.400
But some moderators, I agree with you, but I also disagree because some moderators can turn people away by saying,

17:58.400 --> 18:00.400
no, that's not welcome here.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.400
But then again, it's always, it's never simple, right?

18:04.400 --> 18:09.400
Sometimes you need to actively turn people away to ensure you have a welcoming project.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.400
Tricky to balance.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.400
That seesaw again. Yes.

18:13.400 --> 18:19.400
How to do the right things and do things right and convince your leadership that this is the right thing?

18:19.400 --> 18:20.400
Good one.

18:20.400 --> 18:25.400
How to do the right things and do things right and, because that wasn't enough,

18:25.400 --> 18:29.400
convince your leadership that that's the way it should be.

18:29.400 --> 18:36.400
Okay. So this one, I think we've got a good answer for, and that's the Mobius Loop at the heart of the Open Practice Library,

18:36.400 --> 18:44.400
Gabby's outcome-based model, is really my, really, it really pauses to say,

18:44.400 --> 18:49.400
we need to understand the who and the why,

18:49.400 --> 18:51.400
and we need to be clear on what we're trying to achieve.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.400
So our target outcomes.

18:53.400 --> 18:58.400
Too often in software development, sort of in agencies or in companies,

18:58.400 --> 19:02.400
probably less in the open source world, we're basically given some spec

19:02.400 --> 19:04.400
and then told to just go build it.

19:04.400 --> 19:10.400
And we've had no involvement in the design, the ideation, the who, the what, the why part of it.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.400
It's just just build this thing.

19:12.400 --> 19:16.400
And you could go build this thing real fast, but if it's the wrong thing,

19:16.400 --> 19:19.400
how much effort has been wasted, right?

19:19.400 --> 19:23.400
So I think this discover phase is really, really important.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.400
Actually, I'm not allowed to call it phase, Gabby told me not.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.400
It's more like a part.

19:27.400 --> 19:34.400
So the discover part of the whole picture, understanding who, understanding why,

19:34.400 --> 19:37.400
being really clear on what you're trying to achieve,

19:37.400 --> 19:40.400
and how you're going to measure if you've achieved it,

19:40.400 --> 19:43.400
you've got to get that clear before you rush into building.

19:43.400 --> 19:47.400
So once you've got that stuff clear, you're going to have a whole bunch of ideas of how to go about it, right?

19:47.400 --> 19:49.400
So you've got to go to options phase.

19:49.400 --> 19:53.400
You've got to develop, create, ideate, get those ideas up, and then sort them.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.400
You can't do everything.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.400
You have to prioritize.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.400
And that's your options phase.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.400
You'll decide, discover, decide.

20:01.400 --> 20:05.400
Before you go on to deliver the right thing, hopefully has been,

20:05.400 --> 20:07.400
you now know you're building the right thing,

20:07.400 --> 20:09.400
and you can focus on that technical excellence,

20:09.400 --> 20:16.400
bringing in those technical practices to ensure you're building it right.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.400
One more. Yes.

20:46.400 --> 20:51.400
I love everything you just said, and I'm not going to be able to say it back for the live stream perfectly,

20:51.400 --> 20:54.400
but it was building on the welcoming thing that we mentioned a bit before.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.400
How do you create a culture of gratitude?

20:56.400 --> 20:59.400
How do you create a space where it's safe to experiment?

20:59.400 --> 21:02.400
And there was a last little bit which I didn't catch.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.400
It's about personal development.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.400
Personal development.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.400
We're working in the project.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.400
And how do you create space for personal development and growing in the project?

21:10.400 --> 21:11.400
Beautiful.

21:11.400 --> 21:18.400
Okay, so the welcoming space, I think making a culture of gratitude is really important.

21:18.400 --> 21:23.400
The fact that someone has stepped into your project and offered a contribution.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.400
And I do this with the Open Practice Library.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.400
I get first contributors and I go,

21:27.400 --> 21:31.400
thank you so much for contributing to the Open Practice Library.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.400
It is the first thing I say.

21:33.400 --> 21:38.400
Even if the contribution is not particularly right or perfect for now,

21:38.400 --> 21:42.400
the fact that they made the effort to contribute is just awesome.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.400
And I am always overwhelmed with joy.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.400
So that's one way.

21:47.400 --> 21:54.400
In a physical space, we've done things like having a kudos wall or where you get sticky notes.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.400
If you're having regular team meetings, you can start with gratitude.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.400
What are we thankful for?

21:59.400 --> 22:00.400
There's lots of ways.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.400
And I think it's a really beautiful practice.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.400
And there is something in the Open Practice Library about it, thank you all.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.400
So yeah, that's lovely.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.400
The personal development piece.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.400
I don't think I've got something explicit about that,

22:16.400 --> 22:22.400
but I kind of seem to think that almost every step you take together as a community

22:22.400 --> 22:24.400
is an opportunity for personal growth.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.400
But it's not always sunshine and roses.

22:27.400 --> 22:33.400
Sometimes the personal growth comes out of quite hard work,

22:33.400 --> 22:36.400
emotional work and disappointments.

22:36.400 --> 22:41.400
And I think that's one of the biggest things that we can learn as a community

22:41.400 --> 22:47.400
is to not shy away from the stinky, hard messiness,

22:47.400 --> 22:49.400
because that's really human.

22:49.400 --> 22:53.400
We talk a lot about code and technical excellence,

22:53.400 --> 22:56.400
but really we're human beings,

22:56.400 --> 22:59.400
and it's not always right, it's not always perfect,

22:59.400 --> 23:02.400
and it's often very much the opposite.

23:02.400 --> 23:06.400
So I think they're real opportunities for personal growth as well.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.400
And then I've forgotten the middle bit again.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.400
Too many things for me to think about at once.

23:14.400 --> 23:15.400
Will that do?

23:15.400 --> 23:16.400
Thank you.

23:16.400 --> 23:17.400
Awesome.

23:17.400 --> 23:20.400
All right, I think we're just about out of time.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.400
One more?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.400
Two minutes.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.400
Two minutes, because we're doing the questions as well.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.400
Oh, then I can have more.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.400
Ha ha ha!

23:29.400 --> 23:31.400
In that case, question?

23:31.400 --> 23:33.400
Wait, you've had a lot of go's.

23:33.400 --> 23:34.400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:34.400 --> 23:35.400
Anyone else?

23:36.400 --> 23:37.400
Yes?

23:37.400 --> 23:41.400
A team that feels overwhelmed by too many things to do.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.400
A team that feels overwhelmed by too many things to do?

23:44.400 --> 23:47.400
Our prioritization friend again.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.400
But one of the things that I like to do,

23:51.400 --> 23:53.400
and I think we've played with this,

23:53.400 --> 23:55.400
is just start with a list.

23:56.400 --> 24:00.400
Actually, just get it all out of people's heads and fears and worries.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.400
And get it down.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.400
And then you can say, okay, let's sort this.

24:03.400 --> 24:07.400
Let's come up with some criteria for how we want to sort it.

24:07.400 --> 24:10.400
Are we optimizing for impact, as some people say?

24:10.400 --> 24:13.400
Are we looking for low-hanging fruits so we can get some quick wins?

24:13.400 --> 24:17.400
Are we looking to tackle something really, really challenging,

24:17.400 --> 24:19.400
because we want to strive together?

24:19.400 --> 24:22.400
So I think getting it out of people's heads,

24:22.400 --> 24:24.400
because sometimes I think the overwhelm is just,

24:24.400 --> 24:26.400
it hasn't been quantified.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.400
But once you get it down into a list,

24:28.400 --> 24:31.400
you can say, hey, this stuff matters.

24:31.400 --> 24:34.400
And actually, if we never get round to this stuff down here,

24:34.400 --> 24:35.400
does it matter?

24:35.400 --> 24:38.400
Maybe we can lighten our load and just say,

24:38.400 --> 24:41.400
no, we're not doing those things.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.400
Anything else?

24:47.400 --> 24:49.400
Any questions, folks?

24:50.400 --> 24:55.400
So one thing I want to kind of add into this is,

24:55.400 --> 24:58.400
I was cheeky at the start and I passed around

24:58.400 --> 25:01.400
my Open Practice Library stickers.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.400
Did you all get one?

25:05.400 --> 25:08.400
So that's one way of contributing,

25:08.400 --> 25:15.400
of sharing the fact that the Open Practice Library exists.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.400
Another way of contributing, and we've heard it today,

25:18.400 --> 25:22.400
Open Collective, so Funding Open Practice Library.

25:22.400 --> 25:25.400
I've put us on opencollective.com.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.400
slash openpractice.library.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.400
Buy us a coffee a month.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.400
That's another way of contributing.

25:31.400 --> 25:34.400
But also some of the ideas that you've had,

25:34.400 --> 25:37.400
or perhaps practices that you're using,

25:37.400 --> 25:39.400
scan the Open Practice Library,

25:39.400 --> 25:42.400
and maybe your favorite practice isn't there.

25:42.400 --> 25:45.400
Maybe we could, you could add it.

25:45.400 --> 25:50.400
And we've got a really low barrier to entry.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.400
We'll accept most things before they're perfect,

25:53.400 --> 25:56.400
because hey, it can always be improved.

25:56.400 --> 25:59.400
It can always be iterated upon.

25:59.400 --> 26:04.400
So I very much want to invite every single one of you

26:04.400 --> 26:09.400
to think of yourselves as contributors to the Open Practice Library

26:09.400 --> 26:13.400
as being welcome at our community hub.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.400
Feel free to use the practices.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.400
There's absolutely no nothing stopping you.

26:18.400 --> 26:22.400
Feel free to raise issues if something's a bit clunky.

26:22.400 --> 26:25.400
And hey, feel free to make a pull request.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.400
Add a new practice.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.400
Help us fix our website, or all of the above.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.400
Thank you so much.

26:32.400 --> 26:42.400
Thank you. Just check any of the questions.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.400
Yeah, and now any standard questions?

26:44.400 --> 26:46.400
You don't have to follow my script.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.400
No?

26:48.400 --> 26:50.400
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.400
You should know this by now.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.400
Thank you.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.400
It's more about what you find as a practice

26:56.400 --> 26:58.400
and what is not a practice,

26:58.400 --> 27:00.400
so that we know what to put there and what not to put there.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.400
Thank you.

27:01.400 --> 27:02.400
Excellent question.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.400
What's a practice and what's not a practice,

27:04.400 --> 27:06.400
and how do you know the difference?

27:06.400 --> 27:09.400
On the website, there's a menu,

27:09.400 --> 27:11.400
and there's a contributors guide.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.400
We've got editorial guidelines there,

27:13.400 --> 27:16.400
and a little bit of an outline of what we think a practice is.

27:16.400 --> 27:18.400
But that said, if it's not a practice,

27:18.400 --> 27:20.400
we can talk about it in the pull request and go,

27:20.400 --> 27:22.400
this isn't quite right.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.400
So don't let that stop you.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.400
Great question. Anyone else?

27:26.400 --> 27:29.400
All the way over there, Laura, run.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.400
You're off the pizza now.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.400
One moment, please.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.400
Here we go.

27:35.400 --> 27:40.400
No, I just want to express my gratitude

27:40.400 --> 27:44.400
and acknowledge how brave you are

27:44.400 --> 27:46.400
to come to this conference with a full room

27:46.400 --> 27:48.400
and to not use a slideshow

27:48.400 --> 27:51.400
and to really tap deep into the collective intelligence.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.400
It's really, it's very much appreciated.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.400
Thank you.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.400
Thank you.

27:58.400 --> 28:01.400
That is very kind and also very validating

28:01.400 --> 28:03.400
because I was like, I'm not going to do slides.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.400
I'm just not going to do slides.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.400
So thank you very much. Thank you.

28:07.400 --> 28:10.400
Well, unless there's anything else,

28:10.400 --> 28:13.400
I am going to express my gratitude again

28:13.400 --> 28:16.400
to all of you for coming and sitting through this,

28:16.400 --> 28:18.400
but also for having that conversation in the middle there

28:18.400 --> 28:20.400
and sharing with each other.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.400
I wish we had a bit more of that here, to be honest.

28:22.400 --> 28:25.400
But hey, I'm new, so forgive me.

28:25.400 --> 28:27.400
Thank you.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.400
Thank you very much.
