WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.720
Like yesterday.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.520
But yeah, today I'm going to walk you through the 17th, probably.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.320
I need to add Sweet there.

00:11.320 --> 00:18.160
So it's like Sweet 17 years journey of the Mozilla support platform and its community.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.400
And today I'm not alone.

00:19.400 --> 00:25.600
I will be with Smith from the platform team and also Tasos will also join us to answer

00:25.600 --> 00:29.600
some of the questions that you have around the platform.

00:29.600 --> 00:35.240
So without further ado, I think I'm going to just start with the agenda that we're going

00:35.240 --> 00:36.440
through today.

00:36.440 --> 00:41.800
So I will be first, walk you through the inception, like the story of how the Mozilla

00:41.800 --> 00:43.080
support came about.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.640
And then I'll talk more about the community.

00:46.640 --> 00:51.680
And last but not least, but Smith will walk you through the platform and what are the

00:51.680 --> 00:56.120
tech stuff that we're using and how you can contribute to the platform, to the code.

00:56.120 --> 00:59.560
So with that, I'm going to start with the first.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.320
Section over here.

01:01.320 --> 01:06.680
I'm pretty nervous because I know that there are, I saw a lot of like older Mozilla folks

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
over here.

01:07.680 --> 01:12.680
So I'm afraid that I'm not telling the right story about how it came about.

01:12.680 --> 01:17.520
But I need to dig into our archive, like our blog archive to kind of like find out what

01:17.520 --> 01:23.520
exactly the start of the Mozilla support platform at that time.

01:23.520 --> 01:31.880
But before the Mozilla support, there were already some kind of like platforms that community

01:31.880 --> 01:37.240
based, like those are like the community initiated those efforts, like Mozilla Zine, Mozilla

01:37.240 --> 01:39.440
Polish and Gecko Zone.

01:39.440 --> 01:44.240
I've never heard of Gecko Zone, but it's actually something back then.

01:44.240 --> 01:48.840
But yeah, those are like community based and none of them are official.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.120
So and it's scattered, right?

01:51.120 --> 01:52.200
Like across different sites.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.640
So there's no like official effort from the Mozilla site.

01:56.640 --> 02:05.000
So just before the launch of Firefox 3, I found actually the first Google conversation

02:05.000 --> 02:09.760
in the Google group that I found was from May 8, 2007.

02:09.760 --> 02:14.840
And then after that, like five months after that, the first version of Mozilla support

02:14.840 --> 02:16.400
in Tikiwiki was launched.

02:16.520 --> 02:18.600
Tikiwiki is an old CMS.

02:18.600 --> 02:23.000
I was, I've never heard of it before, but it's actually a thing.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.840
So after that in 2010, we moved to Kitsune, which is a in-house platform that we built

02:29.840 --> 02:36.120
from the start because we realized that Tikiwiki doesn't really meet our criteria or like a

02:36.120 --> 02:37.320
requirement.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.680
So we moved to Kitsune.

02:39.680 --> 02:42.600
And there was a gap in there.

02:42.600 --> 02:48.400
But it's like the days where we actually lack resources.

02:48.400 --> 02:54.920
So you only have very few developers like maintaining the platform.

02:54.920 --> 03:00.480
And because it's an in-house platform, we cannot struggle at that time.

03:00.480 --> 03:08.120
But around like 2019 or 2020, there was a moment where we merged our team, like the

03:09.040 --> 03:15.720
customer support, sorry, at that time, I think the support team from Mozilla side with the

03:15.720 --> 03:18.360
bucket side of things.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.920
Pocket is another company that we acquired.

03:20.920 --> 03:25.960
And then we merged the customer support team together as a customer experience at that

03:25.960 --> 03:27.200
time.

03:27.200 --> 03:33.480
And that was probably the start also where we kind of like, you know, like trying to

03:33.480 --> 03:38.040
build another muscle of a support team because at that time, we need to support like premium

03:38.040 --> 03:43.320
products with the plan of like launching Mozilla VPN and stuff like that.

03:43.320 --> 03:48.880
So we're trying to build a support operation team at a time for the premium products.

03:48.880 --> 03:54.120
And now fast forward to 2024, we're actually planning another migration, although it's very,

03:54.120 --> 03:58.440
I've limited like information to share with you about that.

03:58.520 --> 04:04.800
So that we're planning to, you know, like migrate our CMS to a new CMS called Week Hill.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.760
But the plan is still going on.

04:06.760 --> 04:11.440
So maybe Smith will explain some more about it.

04:11.440 --> 04:19.360
So the community, as I mentioned at the beginning of the timeline that you saw just earlier,

04:19.360 --> 04:25.400
there was a Google group that I found from the first blog post that I like, you know,

04:25.400 --> 04:27.680
like find out.

04:27.680 --> 04:33.840
In that Google group, there were lots of people like, you know, like bunching ideas.

04:33.840 --> 04:38.560
And I can't even tell who's are like the staff members, who's are the volunteers.

04:38.560 --> 04:45.040
So it's just like, embodied the community spirit, like the relationship of Mozilla and

04:45.040 --> 04:47.240
contributors.

04:47.240 --> 04:53.320
So community definitely part of like Sumo since the beginning, even like, you know, from

04:53.320 --> 04:57.320
the first part of like the inception.

04:57.320 --> 05:04.480
And it's still true after today because most of our, most of our product, like free products,

05:04.480 --> 05:10.080
are supported by community contributors across different parts of the world.

05:10.080 --> 05:14.600
And they've been contributing for a very, very long time.

05:14.600 --> 05:21.520
The last time we did a contributor survey, we find out that actually 50% of our contributors

05:21.520 --> 05:24.000
have been contributing more than five years.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.280
And even some of them are contributing since the beginning, since 2007.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.360
And they're still contributing until now.

05:30.360 --> 05:34.720
So they're very passionate about their work, about their contribution.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.640
And they're pretty much self-sustained.

05:36.640 --> 05:42.400
I think even if I die today, I think they'll still be able to run the community on their

05:42.400 --> 05:43.960
own.

05:43.960 --> 05:48.520
And because of their experience with the product and because they have been involved since

05:48.520 --> 05:53.880
the beginning, they have very deep understanding of the product.

05:53.880 --> 06:00.120
I think even more than like staff members, they're in the company right now.

06:00.120 --> 06:05.640
And one of the things that the community provides like huge value is also on the accessibility

06:05.640 --> 06:11.920
part where they enable our content to be accessible in, you know, like languages that we otherwise

06:11.920 --> 06:16.960
won't be able to support because it's also part of like contribution areas that we offer

06:17.080 --> 06:18.720
in the Mozilla support.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.720
So yeah.

06:19.720 --> 06:27.920
I'm going to show you a few contributors that the picture doesn't show.

06:27.920 --> 06:30.200
But there's this contributor.

06:30.200 --> 06:37.000
He's Jefferson, his intellectual property attorney by day.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.960
But he's been contributing to this small platform since 2007, so since the beginning.

06:42.960 --> 06:47.480
And he is mostly contributing to the forum, to our support forum.

06:47.480 --> 06:51.120
And he's really knowledgeable in the customization part of it.

06:51.120 --> 06:57.480
So like doing CSS configuration to tweak your browser appearance, stuff like that.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.520
So he's very knowledgeable in that area.

07:00.520 --> 07:05.040
And then there's also Wenxi, who is our contributor based in China.

07:05.040 --> 07:11.480
He's contributing to the translation, localization of our support articles into Chinese.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.520
He's been translating like more than 50 hundred articles already.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.800
So he's really, yeah, he's really big on this effort.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.680
He's also part of like the proponent of like open source movement.

07:23.680 --> 07:27.920
I think he's involved with the Free Software Foundation at some point.

07:27.920 --> 07:31.280
So, so he's definitely a big open source supporter.

07:31.280 --> 07:35.080
And the last is Bitya.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.640
She's pretty new in the community.

07:37.640 --> 07:41.800
She just joined in 2021.

07:41.800 --> 07:48.480
But I'm really excited because she just shared this news with me that she got hired as a content writer.

07:48.480 --> 07:53.840
And in fact, it's actually one of the things that she contributed in support,

07:53.840 --> 07:55.240
in the Mozilla support platform.

07:55.240 --> 07:59.440
So I'm super proud and excited for her accomplishment.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.440
Okay.

08:03.440 --> 08:13.040
So before I walk you through like our struggle as a community that has been run for like 17 years old,

08:13.040 --> 08:19.240
I'm going to talk about like some of the things that influence the growth of the community, right?

08:19.240 --> 08:27.440
Because there are multiple factors that come in the equation of like how our community can grow.

08:28.440 --> 08:33.440
For example, like there are external factors like industry competition, for example.

08:33.440 --> 08:38.440
I mean like the domination of Chrome is out of my hands.

08:38.440 --> 08:43.440
So, but at some point it's also like constrain our growth as a community.

08:43.440 --> 08:48.440
So that also, you know, like that's also something that we shouldn't forget.

08:48.440 --> 08:53.440
There's also internal factor like product market share, for example,

08:54.440 --> 08:57.440
the leadership support and stuff like that.

08:57.440 --> 09:03.440
So that's also another stuff that, you know, like makes in the growth of our community.

09:03.440 --> 09:09.440
And there's things that we can control at the right side of it, like the community experience part,

09:09.440 --> 09:16.440
the onboarding, the documentation, the governance of our community, and the community platform as well.

09:16.440 --> 09:20.440
Those are like the things that we can actually control to improve.

09:20.440 --> 09:24.440
Although we may not be able to kind of like improve some of the other things,

09:24.440 --> 09:31.440
but those are like, you know, like where we're going to focus more on, because we have more control in that area.

09:31.440 --> 09:40.440
So, I'm pretty sure there are a few kind of like community builders in this room right now.

09:40.440 --> 09:49.440
So if you're just starting out in like community building or community, you know, industry,

09:49.440 --> 09:57.440
you may want to take note on some of the things that we learn as a challenge as a 17-year-old community.

09:57.440 --> 10:07.440
I feel like given the age of our community, there are like multiple people who have contributed for a very long time.

10:07.440 --> 10:14.440
So the knowledge is kind of like concentrated on some people, and that has been a problem,

10:14.440 --> 10:17.440
because we want to make it more accessible for newcomers, right?

10:17.440 --> 10:24.440
So how the problem is like, how do we share this knowledge from the, you know, the other contributors

10:24.440 --> 10:30.440
to the relatively new folks who are joining our community recently.

10:30.440 --> 10:38.440
And then there's this community help part about how do we keep the morale of our contributors high

10:38.440 --> 10:44.440
when the circumstances and the dynamic of the organization has changed over time.

10:44.440 --> 10:53.440
And last but not least, we also have to think about how do we quantify our value as a community team.

10:53.440 --> 10:56.440
How do we show up internally to our leadership?

10:56.440 --> 11:01.440
So that's also something that we struggle with right now.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.440
But what do we do about it, right?

11:04.440 --> 11:10.440
So the first one, split the community.

11:10.440 --> 11:20.440
It turns out that when we're too big, we probably need to split the groups into smaller pieces.

11:20.440 --> 11:24.440
So the concentration is kind of like divided into different areas.

11:24.440 --> 11:30.440
That way we can make newcomers feel like they can have influence over the community,

11:30.440 --> 11:36.440
because otherwise if it's, you know, like if it's already established, if the community is already big enough,

11:36.440 --> 11:44.440
like it's hard to believe for newcomers to think that they still have a place in that community,

11:44.440 --> 11:47.440
because it's already established, right? Everybody have their own role.

11:47.440 --> 11:55.440
So the strategy there is to split the community into smaller group focus groups

11:55.440 --> 12:00.440
to make room for those newcomers that are joining the community.

12:00.440 --> 12:05.440
And then the second one that we're planning to do is the proactive outreach.

12:05.440 --> 12:09.440
So things that we're doing right now in FOSTA.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.440
We haven't been doing much of this after the pandemic,

12:12.440 --> 12:19.440
but you know now that the world is kind of like recovering, there is a chance that we can,

12:19.440 --> 12:23.440
we want to be more proactive in meeting like potential contributors.

12:23.440 --> 12:27.440
So that's what we're planning to do more.

12:27.440 --> 12:34.440
And then last but not least, this is really important is building our data capability internally.

12:34.440 --> 12:41.440
You know, like thinking about what value that we want to show to our leadership

12:41.440 --> 12:48.440
to convey that how valuable contributors are, because it's easy to take those for granted,

12:48.440 --> 12:56.440
because it's already there since the beginning, but you know, like we need to have some kind of like quantify,

12:56.440 --> 13:02.440
we need to be able to quantify our value in order to show up to our leadership.

13:03.440 --> 13:11.440
So with that, I didn't speak much about how people actually contribute in Mozilla support,

13:11.440 --> 13:14.440
but there are actually lots of like ways to contribute.

13:14.440 --> 13:19.440
So the first one is the support platform, sorry, the foreign support.

13:19.440 --> 13:23.440
So people can answer support questions in our platform.

13:23.440 --> 13:28.440
And then the second one is to improve foreign health articles.

13:29.440 --> 13:32.440
Is it still working?

13:32.440 --> 13:33.440
Right, it's good.

13:33.440 --> 13:38.440
The second one is to write and improve our health articles in English.

13:38.440 --> 13:43.440
And then the next one is to localize our articles into another locales.

13:43.440 --> 13:51.440
Last ones are providing supports to our users in social channels like Twitter, mostly Twitter,

13:51.440 --> 13:55.440
and responding to reviews, people reviews on Google Play Store.

13:55.440 --> 14:03.440
So we have a tool that we, like the third party tool that we use to accommodate the last two contribution area that we have over there.

14:03.440 --> 14:12.440
And if you're interested in contributing, there's a link to learn more about what we're doing with Mozilla support.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.440
It's support.mozilla.org.

14:15.440 --> 14:24.440
I also have a few flyers that I'm pretty sure I bring here that I can just, you know, like give to you after this.

14:25.440 --> 14:31.440
So yeah, we're also at the booth in the same building, in the same floor.

14:31.440 --> 14:40.440
So if you're curious to know more about Mozilla support in general, or, you know, like the Mozilla organization, what we're doing recently,

14:40.440 --> 14:42.440
you can just come to our booth.

14:42.440 --> 14:53.440
I also have lots of like contributors, like community members over here, here and there, you know, like I see Danny over here, team, Paul is there, you know.

14:54.440 --> 14:59.440
Somewhere. So yeah, definitely talk to those people, they know a lot.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.440
Okay, let me try.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.440
Oh, good.

15:06.440 --> 15:11.440
Yeah, so definitely come to us and talk more after this.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.440
We're going to be at the booth anyway.

15:13.440 --> 15:21.440
Also, I'm looking for Spanish-speaking contributors, because we're kind of like straddled there right now.

15:21.440 --> 15:26.440
We don't have anyone who's in charge of the local group in Sumo for Spanish.

15:26.440 --> 15:32.440
So if you can speak Spanish and if you're interested in helping us, let's talk after this.

15:32.440 --> 15:38.440
With that, I think I'm going to give it to Smith to talk more about the platform.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.440
Hello.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.440
Thank you, Kiki.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.440
Sure.

15:43.440 --> 15:47.440
So I want to get the robot voice thing going, if we can do that.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.440
So I'm going to tell you a little bit about our platform.

15:52.440 --> 16:00.440
Our platform itself is the architecture is containerized Python app using the Django web framework.

16:00.440 --> 16:06.440
We use Postgres working along with Redis for storage and caching.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.440
Our assets are packaged through Webpack.

16:09.440 --> 16:14.440
And we're using vanilla.js, jQuery, SAS, Svelte.

16:14.440 --> 16:17.440
We use Elastic for search.

16:17.440 --> 16:20.440
And we're running in Kubernetes.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.440
Our inference is maintained through Terraform.

16:23.440 --> 16:34.440
So the kind of support that you just heard that we provide on the site, we have very community focused support that goes through Kitsune.

16:34.440 --> 16:44.440
And then we have paid support as well for the paid product support where those tickets turn into tickets for support staff.

16:44.440 --> 16:54.440
Our support journey goal, you know, we want to make sure that the site lets people find the help that they need quickly and that it's very usable.

16:54.440 --> 17:03.440
And we want to continuously improve using data and information and make the platform better.

17:03.440 --> 17:08.440
So, hey, it's just a Django project.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.440
You know, why is it complicated?

17:10.440 --> 17:16.440
So it's a very rigid monolithic architecture.

17:16.440 --> 17:19.440
So it's been around for a while.

17:21.440 --> 17:26.440
Changes in our platform can have a larger impact than you might anticipate.

17:26.440 --> 17:33.440
So there's a bit of an avalanche of things that maybe you don't seem connected but are very connected.

17:33.440 --> 17:36.440
It's a large project.

17:36.440 --> 17:42.440
We have custom parsers for our Wiki syntax.

17:42.440 --> 17:49.440
In the knowledge base, there's a lot of tight product integration, very custom CMS.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.440
And then, of course, technical debt.

17:51.440 --> 18:02.440
So, you know, as a product ages and comes in and out of being well supported and low supported and very well supported and medium supported, people touch it many hands.

18:02.440 --> 18:05.440
So there's some debt there.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.440
So I guess, you know, I can speak to that.

18:07.440 --> 18:12.440
I keep saying I'm new, but I guess I've been here a little too long to be new anymore.

18:13.440 --> 18:34.440
But when I started, you know, there were some barriers to entry, I think, for me, like learning the language, like, you know, A-A-Q, Kitsune, Sumo, you know, understanding that the apps inside of our larger Django application are, some are more complicated than others.

18:35.440 --> 18:41.440
So each piece, you know, we did very large upgrades.

18:41.440 --> 18:52.440
It was some of the early work that I was on for Django upgrades, jQuery upgrades, and I got to experience sort of the depth of peeling back the onion of our platform a little bit.

18:52.440 --> 18:56.440
And it goes on and on.

18:57.440 --> 19:04.440
The good news is we've already changed some things since I started.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.440
I'd like to say, like, I personally changed all these things, but that's not true.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.440
Ta-Sos is looking at me.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.440
We've improved the developer experience.

19:12.440 --> 19:15.440
Our documentation is a lot better now.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.440
So you're using MK docs.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.440
You know, it's a lot easier to navigate.

19:21.440 --> 19:23.440
It's correct.

19:24.440 --> 19:31.440
So if you wanted to get started contributing to Dev, you could take a look there and you should be able to get going.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.440
We've improved our coding standards.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.440
We do a lot of in-house quality checks.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.440
We do code reviews now.

19:38.440 --> 19:46.440
And we're trying to behave better with our repos and organize better, have better ergonomics automation.

19:48.440 --> 19:49.440
Excuse me.

19:49.440 --> 19:56.440
And so, yeah, we've, like I mentioned earlier, we've already updated many of our, you know, the core bits and pieces of the platform.

19:56.440 --> 20:01.440
So Django, jQuery, many other packages were updated.

20:01.440 --> 20:09.440
We've altered our data storage, our cloud provider, and we've started supporting additional products.

20:09.440 --> 20:16.440
So like Pocket, as new products come on board, we are now able to add them in and support them.

20:17.440 --> 20:22.440
We do content and data audits of the site.

20:22.440 --> 20:29.440
So we're getting better at keeping the content clean and we're finding new ways to organize it and keep everything meaningful.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.440
And so what do we want to do next?

20:35.440 --> 20:45.440
You know, we have some plans to merge our different tools for localization into, like, a more singular process.

20:46.440 --> 20:52.440
We want to build and automate pipelines to leverage different ways that we can get localization done.

20:52.440 --> 20:56.440
You know, some of those things could include machine translation.

20:58.440 --> 21:03.440
You know, just getting the need to the right place as quickly as possible so that we have something.

21:05.440 --> 21:12.440
We're changing user flows to make things a little bit easier for people to navigate the site.

21:12.440 --> 21:18.440
And so that would include, you know, not just people stopping by for help, but also people who are contributing,

21:18.440 --> 21:21.440
making it a little easier for everybody to get around,

21:21.440 --> 21:33.440
breaking apart sort of the monoliths of our site into the core functionality and being able to address those in a more standalone way.

21:34.440 --> 21:42.440
And then dropping our custom wiki syntax or altering how we're handling wiki syntax.

21:42.440 --> 21:47.440
As again, you heard earlier, we're trying to integrate Wagtail CMS,

21:47.440 --> 21:57.440
which is going to bring some hopefully improved usage in how we handle our text

21:57.440 --> 22:03.440
and make things a little bit easier for creating and managing documents.

22:03.440 --> 22:09.440
So hopefully we'll get away from the wiki syntax a little bit.

22:09.440 --> 22:18.440
And then some work has also been going on to inform our information architecture and taxonomy,

22:18.440 --> 22:32.440
so that things are arranged and accessible in the more easy to use, easy to understand model.

22:32.440 --> 22:38.440
So probably more to come on that as we get there, but we're getting there.

22:38.440 --> 22:44.440
So we have, you know, a lot of helpful links here in the stock.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.440
I don't know if this will be shared out. I assume it will be shared out.

22:46.440 --> 22:54.440
And then please feel free to come, you know, if you have an interest in contributing as a developer.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.440
Great. Please come check out these links.

22:57.440 --> 23:01.440
If you have an interest in contributing as anything, that's fantastic.

23:01.440 --> 23:06.440
Please come check out the links in the prior slides.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.440
And that's it.

23:08.440 --> 23:17.440
We're going to have a few minutes of Q&A.

23:17.440 --> 23:25.440
If you have questions, I'm going to...

23:25.440 --> 23:30.440
We don't have enough microphones to run with the microphone, but please voice out your question.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.440
And I'll have the speaker to repeat it for the recording.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.440
So yeah.

23:35.440 --> 23:39.440
Also, for those of you who just come, there's more space over here.

23:39.440 --> 23:48.440
You may want to come to the front to get your seat.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.440
So any questions?

23:50.440 --> 23:56.440
Any questions?

23:56.440 --> 23:58.440
Okay. Thank you.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.440
Well, can find them at the booth.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.440
Yep.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.440
That's side a few meters down.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.440
Thank you.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.440
There's actually a question.

24:07.440 --> 24:17.440
Thank you.

24:17.440 --> 24:22.440
As Kiki mentioned, there are a lot of empty seats on this side and everyone enters this side.

24:22.440 --> 24:27.440
So either try to come on this side or people please move a bit in the middle.

24:27.440 --> 24:31.440
Leave the sides more open as people will come in more now.

24:31.440 --> 24:36.440
Thank you.

24:36.440 --> 24:38.440
Bonjour.

24:38.440 --> 24:40.440
Ready?

24:40.440 --> 24:45.440
Let me get that.

24:45.440 --> 24:50.440
Okay.

24:50.440 --> 24:54.440
Who speaks first?

24:54.440 --> 24:57.440
And Mark, I think you're going to have the portable microphone.
