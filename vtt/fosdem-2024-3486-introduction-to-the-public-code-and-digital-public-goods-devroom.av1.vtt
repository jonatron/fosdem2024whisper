00:00.000 --> 00:10.720
So, hello. Welcome to the Public Code and Digital Public Goods Dev Room. My name is

00:10.720 --> 00:15.080
Elena Finlay-Diracht. I'm here at the Foundation for Public Code. This is my colleague.

00:15.080 --> 00:20.660
Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you. I'm Amreen Taneja, the Standards Manager at Digital

00:20.660 --> 00:26.680
Public Goods Alliance. And there I manage, lead and promote the Digital Public Goods

00:26.720 --> 00:29.480
Standard. So, very excited for this Dev Room today.

00:29.480 --> 00:34.960
And I'm Jan Einley. I'm also at the Foundation for Public Code and I'll talk later.

00:34.960 --> 00:41.880
Cool. And I'm going to... So, in case there's any confusion about what we're doing here and who

00:41.880 --> 00:47.480
we are, this is a Dev Room dedicated to everyone developing public code. That is open source

00:47.480 --> 00:52.120
code that implements public policy used for the public good and by public organizations like

00:52.120 --> 00:58.480
governments, public administrations and state corporations. Digital Public Goods, DPGs, are

00:58.480 --> 01:03.640
open source software, open standards, open data, open AI systems and open content collections

01:03.640 --> 01:10.440
that help meet the sustainable development goals. So, we have a couple of housekeeping notes.

01:10.440 --> 01:18.400
Most importantly, the FOSM Code of Conduct applies here. So, please be respectful in the space.

01:19.400 --> 01:26.080
Oh, sorry, this way. On this side of the... Okay. Secondly, even more. Okay.

01:26.080 --> 01:34.000
All right. We have a window open for ventilation. That's to make the space a bit more comfortable.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.800
If people would like more than one window open, I'm happy to hop on that. We're going to leave

01:37.800 --> 01:45.200
the window open all day in any case. And that moves us to the third housekeeping point,

01:45.240 --> 01:50.240
which is that if you have any questions, if anything comes up today, talk to Jan, Amrine or me.

01:50.240 --> 02:01.600
And that's it. So, on to Amrine. Thank you so much. I'll just take a moment and get this up.

02:01.600 --> 02:15.640
Okay. So, well, I think moving on. So, I've already introduced myself. So, first of all,

02:15.640 --> 02:23.600
I'd like to warmly welcome you all to this dev room today. First things first, I'd like to share

02:23.600 --> 02:27.400
with you a bit about the Digital Public Goods Alliance for those of you who are new to this

02:27.960 --> 02:35.800
organization and concept. So, we are a multi-stakeholder initiative which was launched in 2019. And our

02:35.800 --> 02:40.720
mission is to accelerate the attainment of sustainable development goals by facilitating

02:40.720 --> 02:45.720
the discovery, the development and the use of digital public goods, which are essentially

02:45.720 --> 02:50.640
all open source solutions. So, I'll share about this as we move forward, but I'd like to kick off

02:50.680 --> 03:01.840
this conversation by introducing you to the Digital Public Goods Standard. Right. So, just to give you

03:01.840 --> 03:08.560
a little bit of context of where this concept and this definition came from. So, the DPG definition

03:08.560 --> 03:15.280
was actually laid out by the UN Secretary General. And there are five kinds of open source digital

03:15.280 --> 03:21.080
solutions that are recognized or can be certified as DPGs. So, these are open source software,

03:21.080 --> 03:31.760
open data, open content, open standards and open AI models. So, we have a set of nine indicators,

03:31.760 --> 03:37.920
right, that make up the standard. And I'll share a bit about each of them with you today. So,

03:37.920 --> 03:43.880
the first one is SDG relevance, right. So, this is a very broad topic. So, essentially any application

03:43.960 --> 03:48.400
that wants to do good for the society in some form or the other will come under one or the other

03:48.400 --> 03:55.600
SDG, right. So, what we expect from you here is, first of all, to establish a clear contribution

03:55.600 --> 04:00.920
to either one or more SDG and also explain how your application will be seeking to do that and

04:00.920 --> 04:06.840
achieve that. And then also we have an SDG tracker tool, which I'll be sharing in the presentation

04:06.840 --> 04:13.760
as we move forward. The second indicator is open licensing, right. So, the DPG standard has

04:13.960 --> 04:20.280
a set of specific licenses that we accept. And all licenses, supposing that are, you know,

04:20.280 --> 04:26.360
they're approved by OSI are there for software. We have Creative Commons licenses for open content.

04:26.360 --> 04:33.480
And then we have various other licenses for AI systems as well as data. So, because there's

04:33.480 --> 04:37.800
positive time, I'll not get into too much detail right now, but I'd love for you to have this

04:37.800 --> 04:43.680
conversation with me later on. I'll move on to the third indicator for now, that is clear ownership.

04:44.120 --> 04:51.160
So, that essentially what we mean by this is, the DPG status needs to be renewed every year, right.

04:51.160 --> 04:56.920
So, you have to send out an application everywhere every year and, you know, your application needs

04:56.920 --> 05:02.240
to be up to date with the standard that we have created. So, we need to know who the owner of

05:02.240 --> 05:08.760
this application is and it could be either a person or an organization. Both are acceptable.

05:08.760 --> 05:13.480
And what you have to provide to us is a proof of ownership, which is anyway a legal requirement

05:13.960 --> 05:20.840
for the application. Now, fourth indicator talks about platform independence, right. So,

05:20.840 --> 05:28.440
this is a tricky one, right. And the goal here is for vendor lock-in to be avoided. And we prefer

05:28.440 --> 05:34.120
for everything to be open source, but let's say you have a proprietary component within your

05:34.120 --> 05:40.760
application. So, when you apply for a DPG, what you have to do is provide an alternative open

05:40.800 --> 05:48.120
source component to this and explain how it should be implemented and the condition being that it

05:48.120 --> 05:54.400
should be relatively easily implementable, right. That solution should be easily implementable for

05:54.400 --> 06:02.800
anybody who has enough technical knowledge about this. So, we in fact have external, you know,

06:02.800 --> 06:08.840
facilitators and experts for this particular indicator. We have them with us today as well. So,

06:09.080 --> 06:13.960
Ivan, that's for you. So, if you have any questions around this indicator, please feel

06:13.960 --> 06:20.840
free to contact him. Now, coming to indicator number five, that is documentation. So, this is

06:20.840 --> 06:25.080
fairly straightforward, right. So, it basically means that you need to have all your documentation

06:25.080 --> 06:31.160
in place. So, this can be in the form of a repository or, you know, on your website or in

06:31.160 --> 06:37.960
the form of some good book. And it should essentially have enough detail, you know, that

06:38.000 --> 06:42.720
someone with enough technical knowledge should be able to deploy the solution by themselves. That

06:42.720 --> 06:51.160
is the requirement that we have. Now, moving on to indicator number six. So, that basically talks

06:51.160 --> 06:58.400
about mechanism for extracting data, right. So, if your project collects any sort of non-PII data,

06:58.400 --> 07:03.440
then it should be possible to access it through non-properity formats. That is the condition

07:03.440 --> 07:12.240
that we have. And now, coming to indicator number seven. So, this is adherence to privacy and

07:12.240 --> 07:16.320
applicable laws. In fact, I have some news around this indicator which I'll be sharing with you

07:16.320 --> 07:23.240
later on. So, essentially what this means is that your application, it should be compliant with,

07:23.240 --> 07:28.280
you know, any of the privacy laws that are there in the jurisdiction where the application has

07:28.320 --> 07:33.480
been created or where you intend to operate. So, if it's Euro, it'll be GDPR or anywhere else,

07:33.480 --> 07:38.880
you have to provide proof of compliance, of course. And that can be through, you know,

07:38.880 --> 07:43.240
providing us a terms of use or privacy policy. And of course, these things are held on a

07:43.240 --> 07:47.680
case-to-case basis. So, you know, you'll be speaking to our reviewers around this. And once

07:47.680 --> 07:53.720
you satisfy the conditions, then we move forward. Now, coming to indicator number eight. So, this

07:53.760 --> 07:59.000
is adherence to standards and best practices. So, essentially, any standards and best practices

07:59.000 --> 08:03.800
that apply to the industry where your solution belongs, you have to adhere to them and you

08:03.800 --> 08:10.680
have to provide some proof of adherence as well to us. And lastly, coming to indicator number nine.

08:10.680 --> 08:17.760
So, this is do-no-harm by design. So, do-no-harm by design essentially means that we, you know,

08:18.520 --> 08:23.720
we say design because we don't look at the implications that will be there, you know,

08:23.720 --> 08:29.200
down the line somewhere which are completely out of your control, right? So, we look at how the

08:29.200 --> 08:34.880
digital solution is being used or rather how it's being built and not how it's being used. So,

08:34.880 --> 08:45.240
that is what we kind of focus on. Now, moving on to the next slide. So, this is about how do you

08:45.320 --> 08:50.840
become a DPG. So, this is a three-step procedure, right? So, first stage is nomination. So,

08:50.840 --> 08:55.120
nomination essentially means that you can either nominate yourself or a third party can nominate

08:55.120 --> 09:00.480
you. And the second stage after this is technical review. Of course, this is a very, very rigorous

09:00.480 --> 09:06.960
process. We have level one and level two reviewers who go through, you know, your application. And

09:06.960 --> 09:13.320
if your application satisfies all the conditions, then, you know, your application is essentially

09:13.640 --> 09:17.520
certified as a digital public good and it is recognized on the registry.

09:20.520 --> 09:27.200
So, like I mentioned, step one. So, we have a five-minute eligibility test that anybody can

09:27.200 --> 09:32.600
take and you can figure out whether your solution is at the outset capable of becoming a

09:32.600 --> 09:38.760
digital public good or not. Step two is the nomination. So, this is what the application

09:38.760 --> 09:43.800
form looks like and this needs to be filled up as per the criteria that we just spoke about.

09:43.800 --> 09:51.520
And this is step three. So, success. So, if, you know, your application is selected, it is added

09:51.520 --> 09:57.800
to the DPG registry and this is the SDG tool tracker that I was talking about. So, this is

09:57.800 --> 10:04.440
where we have 150 of the DPGs categorized and arranged as per the various SDGs that they are

10:04.520 --> 10:13.000
striving to contribute towards. So, now coming to call for experts. So, I was mentioning about

10:13.000 --> 10:17.480
something about indicator seven. So, this is where, you know, the standard is entering phase

10:17.480 --> 10:22.760
two of operations. So, what this means is that we are going to be fine-tuning critical indicators

10:22.760 --> 10:29.160
of the standard through two expert groups that we are launching, one on privacy and one on AI.

10:29.160 --> 10:33.640
You'll see this poster across the dev room and outside as well. So, if you're interested,

10:33.640 --> 10:40.200
please feel free to scan the QR code and apply. And these are the requirements. So,

10:40.200 --> 10:44.840
if you're a subject matter expert in either privacy or AI with a technical background,

10:44.840 --> 10:51.640
legal background, academia or, you know, any other background which you think would be a good fit,

10:51.640 --> 10:57.720
please do apply. And it's not much of a time contribution. It's about three to four hours

10:57.720 --> 11:03.880
for this knowledge partnership. And of course, if there is previous experience in standard

11:03.880 --> 11:11.080
making, then that is also highly encouraged. And with that, it comes to an end from my side.

11:11.080 --> 11:19.240
I would like to introduce Yan now. So, who is our DPGA member as well as the co-host here for this

11:19.240 --> 11:25.800
dev room. Thank you so much. Thank you, Amreen. And I'll come from the Foundation for Public Code.

11:25.880 --> 11:31.640
We're a non-profit. We're based in Amsterdam, but we aim to work globally. Just last year,

11:31.640 --> 11:39.400
we started chapter in North America. And we exist to help the public organizations who already

11:39.400 --> 11:46.360
decided that they want to work with open source, develop open source, to help them do that in a

11:46.360 --> 11:53.560
collaborative way. So, ensuring that also that anyone can reuse what they have been doing.

11:55.800 --> 12:01.160
And to do that, we have the standard for public code. Here are some old versions. We have some

12:01.160 --> 12:09.560
new paper versions here, if you'd like. Just last month, we released 08.0. And it has a number of

12:09.560 --> 12:15.080
different criteria in it, certification criteria. I'm not going to go in as deep as Amreen did.

12:15.080 --> 12:23.320
But this is what we use to sort of like certify that a code base is able or easy to collaborate on.

12:24.280 --> 12:31.400
And our philosophy is that it shouldn't contain any surprises. It should be more or less the best

12:31.400 --> 12:38.120
practices in the open source business. So, you're probably already doing most of it already. And

12:38.120 --> 12:43.080
then there's probably also a lot of shortcuts that you have made to save some time that you're not

12:43.080 --> 12:48.600
doing, but that you wish you had the time to do. We have collected them all here, because that varies

12:49.160 --> 12:56.760
over. And if you comply with the standard, our thesis is it will be very easy for someone to

12:56.760 --> 13:04.120
come up and collaborate with you. It's of course an open standard itself. It's cc0. You can start

13:04.120 --> 13:10.200
using it immediately. You don't need our permission to do anything. And you don't need us to come talk

13:10.200 --> 13:17.400
to you. Reuse it, adapt it to your needs. If you find that something is, oh, this is shaping with me,

13:17.960 --> 13:23.800
please contribute back to us so we can continue to improve it with your feedback.

13:25.880 --> 13:32.600
And these are sort of like the type of requirements that we have. And just as

13:33.480 --> 13:38.440
Amrin showed with the DPG standard, we also have a self-assessment test that you can do. There's

13:38.440 --> 13:45.000
just 10 yes or no questions to give you an idea how close you are to dig into it completely,

13:45.000 --> 13:49.560
because in the entire standard it's like 116 requirements or something like that.

13:54.440 --> 13:59.880
And there's a review template, of course, and a checklist to easily check what you're doing. And

13:59.880 --> 14:06.600
we list everyone who is compliant on this website. Today it's a list of zero, but it is a list still.

14:08.040 --> 14:13.640
But we also include right now everyone who has said, oh, we are aiming for this goal. So everyone

14:13.640 --> 14:20.280
who has the ambition gets listed there. And then just a tiny little thing. We also have a number

14:20.280 --> 14:24.920
of governance game decks. It's a little sort of a game you can play with your community to figure

14:24.920 --> 14:31.640
out how do we want to do with our governance. And we're giving them out from the small fee of

14:31.640 --> 14:39.080
signing up to our newsletter. And with that, I want to introduce our first speaker from the day.
