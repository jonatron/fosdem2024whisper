00:00.000 --> 00:14.760
Hello, everybody. I'm Anne and I'm a, yes, data engineer, software craft woman. And currently

00:14.760 --> 00:20.520
I work for the French Ministry of the Higher Education and Research in France. So it will

00:20.520 --> 00:27.240
be important for the project, for the presentation, because I'm working on the French Open Science

00:27.240 --> 00:34.200
Monitor. So before, before all, I have to say that in France we have no CRIS system,

00:34.200 --> 00:39.200
the system in the university that will reference all the publications and all the works in

00:39.200 --> 00:45.640
the, in each university or in the, in the national level. So, or at the national level.

00:45.640 --> 00:58.840
So, so, yes. And back in 2018, the, the, the policymakers decided to, to, to create the

00:58.840 --> 01:05.360
national plan for open science. So to, to promote the, the open science in France. And the,

01:05.480 --> 01:15.600
the first question was, so how, how open is the French science? So according to, so to, to

01:15.600 --> 01:22.760
answer to this question, we developed a tool to, to be able to, let's say a sovereign tool to be

01:22.800 --> 01:33.840
able to, to measure open science. And the, and the, later the requirement would be, would be not to

01:33.840 --> 01:45.840
use the proprietary database. So everything had to be open and transparent. So to first begin with

01:45.880 --> 01:54.880
the publications, which, which was the first part of the project. Yes, we, we started from there.

01:54.880 --> 02:02.880
The, the, let's say the, the, the graph on the right, proprietary bibliographic database. They're

02:02.880 --> 02:08.880
kind of complete. They have lots of metadata, but they are missing some part of the publications

02:08.920 --> 02:15.920
because they are the one that decided what publication will be in their databases. And on the

02:15.920 --> 02:23.920
other hand, the, the open bibliographic databases, they have, they are more complete, more extensive,

02:23.920 --> 02:30.920
but they are missing some metadata information or sometimes the quality of the metadata was not

02:30.960 --> 02:39.960
really perfect. So we decided to create our own tool based on this. So first we collected multiple

02:42.960 --> 02:50.960
metadata available on the, on the web, just like with Crossref specifically. And we tried to

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
aggregate some other sources like OpenAPC, PubMed, and, and, and web crawling to, to

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
complete the information, the, the metadata. So, and based on this, we developed a tool to be

03:06.000 --> 03:12.000
able to automatically detect the country of the affiliation in this metadata. So we, we

03:12.040 --> 03:19.040
this little hoist, it's the tool that we made. And the, the previous one, PubMed, Crossref,

03:19.040 --> 03:25.040
and HAL, we just collect and extract metadata from there. But based on this metadata, we had to

03:25.040 --> 03:30.040
build the country detection. So we, our affiliation match, which is able to detect the

03:30.040 --> 03:38.040
country of the affiliation. And we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we

03:38.080 --> 03:41.080
we, we, we, we, we were able to communicate. So we wanted to create, to create, to create

03:41.080 --> 03:46.080
our affiliation match, which is able to detect the country of the publication. Just to, to

03:46.080 --> 03:51.080
draw the, the perimeter of the, of the French publications. So, yeah, that's it. That's just

03:51.080 --> 03:56.080
What I said. So by, by example. So one of the examples here. So the first compromise

03:56.080 --> 04:02.080
would be to, to, to say, okay, if I detect France in the affiliation, it will be France.

04:02.080 --> 04:03.960
the affiliation, it will be French.

04:03.960 --> 04:05.400
It will be French, sorry.

04:05.400 --> 04:10.600
But then we faced this problem with Hotel de France,

04:10.600 --> 04:12.600
which is a hospital in Beirut.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.600
So, OK, first, wrong result.

04:16.600 --> 04:21.120
And then we improve our affiliation

04:21.120 --> 04:26.200
measure based on the public institutions database, just

04:26.200 --> 04:28.280
like raw.

04:28.280 --> 04:31.680
So yeah, that was our first challenge.

04:31.680 --> 04:35.920
And then we still, we keep consolidating the metadata

04:35.920 --> 04:40.720
by adding the open status based on NPWOL.

04:40.720 --> 04:43.840
So for each publication that we collected,

04:43.840 --> 04:50.240
we added, thanks to the DOI, we added the open status on it.

04:50.240 --> 04:56.040
And after that, we redo the classification

04:56.040 --> 05:00.680
to say if it's open or not, but if it's green or not,

05:00.680 --> 05:02.560
if it's bronze or not, hybrid or not,

05:02.560 --> 05:07.040
there are some different levels of, let's say, openness,

05:07.040 --> 05:10.480
according to the journal and according to the APC.

05:10.480 --> 05:14.280
So we developed a new classification open access type.

05:17.040 --> 05:21.720
And we also added, let's say, categories there,

05:21.720 --> 05:27.400
so a tool to be able to add some classification

05:27.400 --> 05:30.360
for the publication, to be able to know in which,

05:30.360 --> 05:32.480
let's say, discipline or let's say,

05:32.480 --> 05:37.040
which scientific field this publication is.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.960
So yes.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.720
And with all these metadata, we were

05:42.720 --> 05:44.240
able to build some indicators.

05:44.240 --> 05:51.400
So our first problem would be to measure the open science

05:51.400 --> 05:51.960
in France.

05:51.960 --> 05:56.760
And we know how the results, according to this methodology,

05:56.760 --> 05:59.240
I might show you something else, just like.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.240
The website with the results.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.600
So according to all the computer metadata,

06:11.600 --> 06:19.040
we know that the French publications are open in 67%.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.560
So that's the point.

06:20.560 --> 06:26.400
And thanks to the, let's say, categorization by discipline,

06:26.400 --> 06:28.760
we have some other graphics.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.040
Some other graphs, sorry.

06:31.040 --> 06:36.480
Just like being able to know the openness by discipline.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.360
So here it's about the, let's say,

06:39.360 --> 06:45.640
mathematics is the most open scientific field in France.

06:45.640 --> 06:49.360
So yeah, you can go on the website where there are more

06:49.360 --> 06:51.880
results.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.600
But no, I would like to.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.000
So yes, that's what I said.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.440
Yes, and with all these results, we

07:01.440 --> 07:03.840
asked the universities in France,

07:03.840 --> 07:06.440
if they were interested, to have their own results.

07:06.440 --> 07:11.240
So the only condition would be we asked them to send us

07:11.240 --> 07:13.200
their own perimeter.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.240
So their own list of publications

07:15.240 --> 07:18.320
that they have in their university.

07:18.320 --> 07:22.400
And then we were able to send them exactly the same graph,

07:22.400 --> 07:26.000
but adapted for the smaller perimeters.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.280
And we now have more or less 200, let's say,

07:31.280 --> 07:34.160
local variations of this monitor.

07:34.160 --> 07:38.920
So there are some universities perimeter, but some labs too.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.640
So yeah, and I just show you that.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.320
And after that, we did a second round

07:44.320 --> 07:47.880
to try to detect and to, let's say,

07:47.880 --> 07:50.240
measure the openness of data and code

07:50.240 --> 07:53.040
on the French publications too.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.880
So yes, let's try to invent another methodology.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.120
So first, we needed to collect the data.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.080
So that's just what we said before.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.760
So we have the whole publications in France.

08:05.760 --> 08:07.720
In France, sorry.

08:07.720 --> 08:11.360
We tried to download all the PDFs of the publications

08:11.360 --> 08:13.040
freely available on the internet.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.720
So in this case, there was almost no problem

08:15.720 --> 08:19.800
as long as the PDFs were still available.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.160
But for the closed one, we need to find some agreement

08:23.160 --> 08:28.240
with our partners in the project to give them tokens

08:28.240 --> 08:31.520
to be able to download it.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.080
And after that, once again, we needed

08:34.080 --> 08:35.760
to consolidate the metadata.

08:35.760 --> 08:41.480
So we first choose Grobit that you might, may, probably know,

08:41.480 --> 08:46.160
which is a tool that takes a PDF in entry

08:46.160 --> 08:52.840
and give you a standard XMLTI as an output.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.920
And all your data is structured in it,

08:54.920 --> 08:59.560
just like giving you the author, paragraph, keywords,

08:59.560 --> 09:01.800
affiliations, stuff like that.

09:04.400 --> 09:09.720
And after that, we used, so we developed two tools called

09:09.720 --> 09:11.840
Datastate and Softsite.

09:11.840 --> 09:16.880
And those tools tried to detect the mention of data

09:16.880 --> 09:20.480
or code in the PDF.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.160
So first, the mention.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.280
And after that, in the second layer,

09:24.280 --> 09:29.120
trying to categorize or qualify the mention

09:29.120 --> 09:32.800
if it's a mention of usage, if it's a mention of production,

09:32.800 --> 09:35.760
and if it's a mention of sharing.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.240
So those two tools have been developed

09:39.240 --> 09:44.160
by Patrice Lopez from ScienceMiner, the guy

09:44.160 --> 09:46.200
who is behind Grobit 2.

09:49.120 --> 09:53.520
And once again, we were able to do some indicators

09:53.520 --> 09:58.560
to have some ideas about the part of the, let's say,

09:58.560 --> 10:03.240
the part of the use of data in the publications in France.

10:03.240 --> 10:07.360
So among the world publications, so the way

10:07.360 --> 10:10.640
to read this graphic is among the world publication

10:10.640 --> 10:11.680
in France.

10:11.680 --> 10:17.320
So in the 2021, 60% of the publication

10:17.320 --> 10:21.160
were mentioning the use of data.

10:21.160 --> 10:25.400
So it's a little bit just like we need all the words

10:25.400 --> 10:27.920
to make sense of the graphics.

10:27.920 --> 10:33.200
And this one is the which part of the publications

10:33.240 --> 10:39.400
saying they have produced data if they mention the use of data.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.840
So there is just like a funeral approach.

10:41.840 --> 10:45.120
Just like first, they take the one that shows data

10:45.120 --> 10:48.800
and among them, the one that produced the data

10:48.800 --> 10:53.880
and then among them, the share of data.

10:53.880 --> 10:54.880
So yes.

10:54.880 --> 11:00.240
So once again, to read this graphic,

11:00.240 --> 11:02.800
we can say that in France.

11:02.840 --> 11:10.600
So 22% of the publication that mentioned

11:10.600 --> 11:13.720
the sharing of their own data.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.920
So that's it.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.080
And as a project about open science,

11:21.080 --> 11:24.040
we had to be fully open.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.360
So all the code is open.

11:26.360 --> 11:29.280
So there is a link here on our GitHub.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.440
And the whole data set is open.

11:32.440 --> 11:36.480
And then we published our methodology somewhere.

11:36.480 --> 11:40.080
And even the talk here is open.

11:40.080 --> 11:44.360
And so this project started in 2018.

11:44.360 --> 11:49.960
But from there, the open world really moved.

11:49.960 --> 11:54.400
So Open Alex released the data about the world research

11:54.400 --> 11:55.400
in CC0.

11:55.400 --> 12:01.160
So if you don't know it, you should have a look there.

12:01.280 --> 12:04.080
And the whole set of publications

12:04.080 --> 12:07.640
across the world and the institutions and the funders

12:07.640 --> 12:09.080
and the authors.

12:09.080 --> 12:13.200
And everything is in CC0.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.840
It's quite early.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.120
And everything is not perfect.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.920
But the good point is that exists now.

12:18.920 --> 12:22.240
And it's improving from day to day.

12:22.240 --> 12:26.520
Thanks to that, people from Coqui in Australia

12:26.520 --> 12:28.480
that developed the Open Access dashboard.

12:28.480 --> 12:34.080
So it's a website where there is an open access rate

12:34.080 --> 12:36.000
for each country in the world.

12:36.000 --> 12:40.080
So it's not perfect for France because it's always

12:40.080 --> 12:43.200
difficult to detect the affiliation.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.880
So it's a good approximation.

12:45.880 --> 12:52.120
And finally, last year, the CWTS released the Leiden ranking

12:52.120 --> 12:53.600
but in the open edition.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.440
So everything is open there, the data that they used.

12:58.440 --> 13:04.880
Because they are based on Open Alex and their own methodology.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.960
So yes, that's it.

13:06.960 --> 13:07.840
Thanks for listening.

13:07.840 --> 13:15.840
Thank you.

13:15.840 --> 13:16.320
Questions?

13:16.320 --> 13:18.320
Yes.

13:18.320 --> 13:19.800
I do have a question for you.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.800
Can you make up something?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.400
Yep.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.200
Yes, I have a call.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.760
Thank you very much for this.

13:27.760 --> 13:33.680
I'm sorry, but I use it a lot to monitor open-size outputs

13:33.680 --> 13:35.760
for Wikimedia purpose this month.

13:35.760 --> 13:39.560
I have two questions that maybe will answer some of them.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.320
The first is about the timing.

13:41.320 --> 13:46.240
So how many years after the publication, year,

13:46.240 --> 13:50.360
do you think the data is reliable?

13:50.360 --> 13:54.480
Sometimes it takes years for a both ways to deposit.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.200
The second question was about Open Alex,

13:56.200 --> 13:57.640
but we already answered it.

13:57.640 --> 14:03.000
The third question was how do you share what's the best way

14:03.000 --> 14:04.880
for people to build on this data?

14:04.880 --> 14:11.600
For example, do you send new notices to HAL?

14:11.600 --> 14:15.680
And the final question was about the topic.

14:15.680 --> 14:19.240
Do you contribute upstream?

14:19.240 --> 14:23.200
So yes, thank you.

14:23.200 --> 14:26.200
I'll try to remember all your questions.

14:26.200 --> 14:31.960
So, okay, Grubit, we don't contribute to Grubit directly,

14:31.960 --> 14:36.320
but the two other tools that have been developed from,

14:36.320 --> 14:38.240
not from scratch, but from other experience

14:38.240 --> 14:40.680
from the same guy, so Patrice Lopez.

14:40.680 --> 14:47.200
We paid him for the two data sets and soft sites

14:47.200 --> 14:52.680
that have been adapted and improved for this project.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.120
But everything is open source, so if you need it,

14:55.160 --> 14:57.440
you can use it.

14:57.440 --> 15:03.400
Second was about, I don't get it, the one with HAL's notice.

15:03.400 --> 15:07.920
Like if a publication that you detect is missing from HAL,

15:07.920 --> 15:10.960
it's not HAL.

15:10.960 --> 15:15.040
No, what we do, so if a publication is missing from HAL,

15:15.040 --> 15:19.880
it's not the perimeter here of the project.

15:19.960 --> 15:25.200
But as long as, let's say, a university or laboratory

15:25.200 --> 15:30.040
asks us for a monitor about their own science,

15:30.040 --> 15:32.040
they send us the list of the publication.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.280
And in return, because we have the data,

15:34.280 --> 15:37.720
we send them the full list of the publication

15:37.720 --> 15:39.800
with the metadata that we calculated.

15:39.800 --> 15:44.800
And in this metadata, there is the HAL ID if we match it.

15:44.800 --> 15:48.360
So they might, if needed, they might have a way

15:48.360 --> 15:52.320
to find the part of their publication that

15:52.320 --> 15:56.520
are in HAL and the part that is not.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.480
But it might be interesting indicators to add it.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.120
You're right.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.400
And I forget probably one of your questions.

16:03.400 --> 16:05.080
The delay, how many years ago?

16:05.080 --> 16:05.760
Yeah, you're right.

16:05.760 --> 16:13.360
So the delay, so yeah, the delay in publication,

16:13.360 --> 16:14.640
it's always a question.

16:14.640 --> 16:20.160
So there is a delay because we grab data

16:20.160 --> 16:21.520
from multiple services.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.480
There is some delay to propagate the truth

16:25.480 --> 16:26.760
between those platforms.

16:26.760 --> 16:32.600
Plus, there is the delay when we decide to collect this data

16:32.600 --> 16:36.040
because the whole process is quite long.

16:36.040 --> 16:42.840
So us, we decide to collect the data four times a year.

16:42.880 --> 16:46.600
But we publish the new version of the data only once a year.

16:46.600 --> 16:51.480
So and it will happen the end of February this year.

16:51.480 --> 16:56.480
So we mentioned here that the data are from,

16:56.480 --> 16:59.040
so the data displayed here are from 2022,

16:59.040 --> 17:01.000
collected from 2022.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.200
So that's the reason why we only display

17:04.200 --> 17:06.880
public publication until 2021.

17:06.880 --> 17:13.760
So we decided, so in 2023, we published the monitor

17:13.760 --> 17:16.840
based on data on 2022.

17:16.840 --> 17:21.640
And this data and only the publication from 2021

17:21.640 --> 17:24.520
and are taking into consideration.

17:24.520 --> 17:25.640
So it's two years.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.960
So yes, it's two years.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.280
And that, guys.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.160
Sorry, I think too long.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, we've run out of time.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.080
Yeah, thank you.
