00:00.000 --> 00:12.960
Hi, I'm Tom DeMour.

00:12.960 --> 00:19.600
Come in. Great to be at Fasnem Sunday morning,

00:19.600 --> 00:24.200
11 o'clock and we are talking about translations.

00:24.640 --> 00:29.200
I'm a long time open source contributor and in

00:29.200 --> 00:32.440
the past four years I've been contributing to Mattermost.

00:32.440 --> 00:39.160
I started contributing with translations and then I did write some blog posts,

00:39.160 --> 00:41.120
did some quality assurance as well,

00:41.120 --> 00:45.120
and did some programming in the meantime.

00:45.120 --> 00:51.920
In that time, I became the unofficial self-declared translation community manager.

00:51.920 --> 00:55.960
I want to talk about the lessons I have learned.

00:55.960 --> 01:00.800
For the people who are not familiar with the Mattermost project,

01:00.800 --> 01:06.360
Mattermost is a chat-centered platform with a lot of possibilities for integrations.

01:06.360 --> 01:09.440
It's very versatile. It's not only for DevOps.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.760
From the beginning from the project,

01:11.760 --> 01:14.760
the translations were a community effort.

01:14.760 --> 01:18.240
We are now shipping Mattermost in 21 languages.

01:18.240 --> 01:24.520
Each language contains about 9,500 strings that are 6,500 words.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.920
That's about 150 pages of text.

01:27.920 --> 01:33.800
In total, we have more than 1.6 million words translated.

01:34.520 --> 01:39.240
In this talk, I want to focus on the following topics.

01:39.240 --> 01:46.760
I want to give you an overview of our translation community and how we try to nurture them.

01:46.760 --> 01:52.400
Further, I want to tell how developers have an impact on translations.

01:52.800 --> 01:59.880
I want to share some good practices on how we try to improve the quality of translations during time.

02:04.400 --> 02:09.120
We have 680 active translators in the past three years.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.760
I must say there is a very high turnaround of translators.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.240
When we take a deeper look at the numbers,

02:16.240 --> 02:23.320
we see that only 15% of the translators is making 75% of the translations.

02:23.320 --> 02:29.000
From that small group, most of them are long-term contributors.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.880
But we do have also translators that come in,

02:31.880 --> 02:37.840
do an amazing amount of work in a very short time for a specific language,

02:37.840 --> 02:39.840
and then they disappear.

02:40.800 --> 02:49.120
These numbers are not based on survey.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.840
This is what my experience is telling.

02:51.840 --> 02:59.120
When we look at a large group of the 85% translators that doesn't do that much of translation work,

02:59.120 --> 03:03.520
when we are looking at what is motivating them to do that,

03:03.520 --> 03:06.160
we often see it's fixing an annoying error.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.640
They see an error in the translations, it bothers them,

03:09.640 --> 03:12.480
they come in, they fix it and they leave.

03:12.480 --> 03:19.160
That's perfectly fine, that's great because it was an annoying bug for someone and it got fixed.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.080
Others just want to give it a try.

03:21.080 --> 03:25.480
They say, okay, I've heard about it, I want to give it a try.

03:25.480 --> 03:29.960
But translation work is work that's not very visible.

03:29.960 --> 03:37.960
You're doing it alone, you're not getting real feedback and people give up on that.

03:38.040 --> 03:43.800
Others start translating because they love the product and they want to contribute to it.

03:43.800 --> 03:50.320
When we look at the 15% translators that do a lot of work, of translation work,

03:50.320 --> 03:52.520
why are they doing that?

03:52.520 --> 03:56.800
We see that very often their peers are using Mattermost,

03:56.800 --> 04:01.880
their company, their friends, their community,

04:01.880 --> 04:06.280
and they want to give them the best user experience.

04:06.320 --> 04:10.560
Also, we see that they like to keep the translations up to date.

04:10.560 --> 04:14.360
They love it when they see 100% translated.

04:14.360 --> 04:19.600
They would actually go in, log in at night to get that last string finished

04:19.600 --> 04:25.920
so that before we ship the next release, they still get a 100% feeling.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.840
Another nice thing is they become experts in the product

04:30.840 --> 04:34.760
because by translating, you get to know the product very well.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.560
You see new features that are not yet in the product,

04:37.560 --> 04:40.080
but you are already translating the strings,

04:40.080 --> 04:44.280
or you see features that you are not using, but that you are translating.

04:44.280 --> 04:49.480
Oh, I wasn't aware that we can do that also with the product.

04:49.480 --> 04:54.960
And they often become ambassadors of the product and like to contribute to the product.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.200
Look at me, I'm standing here.

04:58.200 --> 05:02.600
Now that we know what is motivating translators,

05:02.640 --> 05:06.320
we also know what scares translators away.

05:06.320 --> 05:10.680
One of the things is there is some frustration when they don't feel hurt

05:10.680 --> 05:15.200
or when they give feedback to developers.

05:15.200 --> 05:20.000
It's like mostly it's about style or sometimes the direction

05:20.000 --> 05:24.560
the program of the project is following.

05:24.560 --> 05:29.840
And yeah, I've said it a few times and it still hasn't changed

05:29.840 --> 05:33.320
and people sometimes leave for that.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.400
Things that are broken.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.320
We had some issues in the past when

05:42.320 --> 05:47.480
where translations didn't get into the product.

05:47.480 --> 05:52.520
And people, yeah, we are putting time in this and we don't see it in the product.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.600
That's also something that people don't like.

05:54.600 --> 05:58.840
They want to see the result of their work.

05:58.840 --> 06:05.720
We do reach out to new translators or to translators who are really on fire

06:05.720 --> 06:07.760
and are doing a great job.

06:07.760 --> 06:12.280
And we have noticed that sometimes reaching out to them

06:12.280 --> 06:15.480
is also giving them pressure to keep contributing.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.760
And they are saying, yeah, but I don't want that.

06:17.760 --> 06:21.200
I'm just doing this in my spare time.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.760
I love doing it, but I don't want that you have got expectations

06:25.760 --> 06:27.960
that I will not be able to fulfill.

06:27.960 --> 06:32.080
So we have to be very careful with that.

06:32.080 --> 06:41.240
We do our very best to be a very warm and open, welcoming community.

06:41.240 --> 06:47.040
This means that we had to remove a long-time translator for a shit language

06:47.040 --> 06:55.040
after we made some posts in a channel that violated our code of conduct.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.320
That action was took place immediately.

06:58.320 --> 07:01.480
It was no big deal.

07:01.480 --> 07:05.480
It's hard losing a long-time contributor, but community comes first.

07:05.480 --> 07:10.480
And I'm still grateful that how they handled that situation.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.280
And that's something I...

07:12.280 --> 07:17.880
Yeah, when you are doing translations, it's working with a lot of different nationalities,

07:17.880 --> 07:22.160
with a lot of different cultural backgrounds, and that's great.

07:22.200 --> 07:28.200
I still learn every day from it, and it opens your view on the world and stuff like that.

07:28.200 --> 07:33.000
And we have to make it happen.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
Like, we don't talk about politics.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.680
There are a lot of ongoing issues in the world.

07:38.680 --> 07:39.960
We don't talk about politics.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.960
I don't take a stand in them.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.480
I look at the people.

07:43.480 --> 07:48.560
And yeah, I want every conflict to be ended as soon as possible, of course,

07:48.560 --> 07:51.280
but I will not take a position in it,

07:51.280 --> 07:52.280
because I don't...

07:52.280 --> 07:53.800
Yeah, I can't.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.800
It's too complicated.

07:57.320 --> 08:07.320
OK, communication is key for us to keep our translators together and to move forward with them.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.160
We have a dedicated channel on our community server,

08:11.160 --> 08:15.680
and I will tell you about what's happening over there in the channel.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.680
Monthly, we welcome our new translators.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.680
We name them and say, hi, welcome.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.680
It's reaching out.

08:22.680 --> 08:26.680
It's saying, OK, we see that you have started translating rather most,

08:26.680 --> 08:30.880
and you don't see your translations yet in the product,

08:30.880 --> 08:34.880
but we have seen your effort and we are saying hi to you.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.880
What else do we do?

08:39.880 --> 08:45.880
The community channel is also a place where translators ask questions to the developers,

08:45.880 --> 08:49.880
but also developers ask questions to the translators from,

08:49.880 --> 08:52.880
hey, we are having an issue with this.

08:52.880 --> 08:58.880
Is it right that in your language this will do that, or...

08:58.880 --> 09:00.880
and stuff like that?

09:00.880 --> 09:04.880
Or we can simply ask, like, I don't know, oh yeah, it's readable,

09:04.880 --> 09:09.880
like, oh yeah, there is a new term in the product.

09:09.880 --> 09:14.880
Does it mean what I think it is, or is it something different?

09:15.880 --> 09:20.880
We are very open about ongoing issues as well.

09:20.880 --> 09:29.880
We had some much conflicts and we are open about it.

09:29.880 --> 09:33.880
People like it because they know that we care about these issues

09:33.880 --> 09:36.880
and that we want to solve them and that we are working on it,

09:36.880 --> 09:42.880
and that it makes them feeling at ease, like, OK, we are important,

09:42.880 --> 09:45.880
we do matter and they are working on it,

09:45.880 --> 09:50.880
and when they see your effort of getting things fixed,

09:50.880 --> 09:54.880
they have a little bit more patience and a little bit more love.

09:56.880 --> 10:01.880
Yeah, we also set up some webhooks,

10:01.880 --> 10:06.880
like we get notified when the translations are locked or being unlocked,

10:06.880 --> 10:10.880
because people are doing the translations very often in their spare time,

10:10.880 --> 10:15.880
and nothing is as frustrating as planning, like, OK, it's Friday evening,

10:15.880 --> 10:21.880
I have some time to work on the translations, and then, oh yeah, it's still locked.

10:21.880 --> 10:26.880
But if people know, OK, it's still locked, I don't have to check in

10:26.880 --> 10:33.880
to see if I can do my translations, it's just, yeah, being user-friendly.

10:33.880 --> 10:39.880
We have a weekly update as well, it's running for about three years now.

10:40.880 --> 10:45.880
It contains roughly the following information, it depends from week to week,

10:45.880 --> 10:50.880
but we have some topics that always come back, the current workload.

10:50.880 --> 10:56.880
It's very nice to know that, OK, the current workload for the next release is low,

10:56.880 --> 11:00.880
it only are about 40 strings or so, then you know, OK, I'm still at ease,

11:00.880 --> 11:05.880
but there are times that we have a very high workload for the next release,

11:05.880 --> 11:10.880
and that you have about 200, 250 strings, and if you are one of those guys

11:10.880 --> 11:15.880
that says, I want a 100% fully translated product for each release,

11:15.880 --> 11:21.880
then it's important to know, OK, I have to make some more time for this week,

11:21.880 --> 11:23.880
of this month.

11:24.880 --> 11:28.880
We also put in the deadline for the next release.

11:28.880 --> 11:34.880
I know myself, if I don't have a deadline, I will keep, I will do it,

11:34.880 --> 11:39.880
I will do it, but when I see the deadline facing, oh yes, here I am.

11:41.880 --> 11:48.880
We also ask feedback to the community, when we are changing things, stuff like that.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.880
Yeah, it's working well.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.880
Yeah, what else do we do?

11:58.880 --> 12:05.880
Swag, we often make a joke that, matter most, is a swag driven company.

12:05.880 --> 12:12.880
That's not always true, but as you can see, to prove my point,

12:12.880 --> 12:18.880
I've got socks with me, people who want socks or stickers after the talk, please,

12:18.880 --> 12:22.880
come over, we do ship some swag to our translators as well.

12:23.880 --> 12:27.880
What else do we do?

12:27.880 --> 12:34.880
In each release, with the release notes of each release, we add the names of our translators.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.880
They are contributors like everyone else.

12:38.880 --> 12:45.880
Each release has most valued professional elected translators,

12:46.880 --> 12:51.880
do get elected as well and get that reward as well.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.880
We reach out to new translators, I already said that,

12:55.880 --> 13:03.880
but we actively are reaching out by mail as well, sending them an email,

13:03.880 --> 13:09.880
but we only get a 2% response rate, so it's not really high,

13:09.880 --> 13:13.880
and we are not really sure if it's working, but it's still saying,

13:13.880 --> 13:17.880
we are seeing that you are doing something that we really like,

13:17.880 --> 13:19.880
and we want to say thank you.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.880
And we had our first virtual meetup.

13:22.880 --> 13:31.880
It seemed fun to me to bring all the translators together and to have a nice chat.

13:31.880 --> 13:35.880
We were actually with three people the first time.

13:35.880 --> 13:42.880
Okay, translating is something that you do alone,

13:42.880 --> 13:46.880
but we want to give it a try and we will make it grow.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.880
It's also hard to find the good moment,

13:49.880 --> 13:55.880
because we are spreading it all over the world and the time zones are not really working with us.

13:55.880 --> 14:01.880
But we're going to keep it, we're going to see how it continues.

14:01.880 --> 14:06.880
Maybe I would be happy if there was about 7 to 10 people,

14:06.880 --> 14:11.880
right Luri, on the Rhyler base, but we'll see how it goes.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.880
Okay, time for the next part.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.880
Our developers can help translators,

14:17.880 --> 14:22.880
because developers have a positive or a negative impact.

14:22.880 --> 14:28.880
Yep, use variables for everything that doesn't need to be translated.

14:28.880 --> 14:32.880
That's a lesson we learned a little bit of the hard way.

14:32.880 --> 14:38.880
We have about 200 references in the product to our documentation site.

14:38.880 --> 14:43.880
And then we had a great idea, we're going to reorganize the documentation site.

14:43.880 --> 14:51.880
What meant that we had to change 200 strings in the product and we had to ask each translator,

14:51.880 --> 14:56.880
can you copy paste that URL to that one?

14:56.880 --> 14:59.880
And that's of course quite some work.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.880
And then we decided we're not going to do that way.

15:02.880 --> 15:05.880
We must find another way.

15:05.880 --> 15:10.880
And then we replaced all our links to the documentation site by a variable.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.880
I scripted that.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.880
Yeah, that was something.

15:15.880 --> 15:24.880
I can script, but I couldn't do React and stuff like that, so it was flying blind.

15:24.880 --> 15:33.880
But I got good support from the developers from Mattermost and we made it.

15:33.880 --> 15:38.880
Another example is the minimum requirement for the browser you're supporting.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.880
That changes also very often.

15:41.880 --> 15:46.880
If you put that in a variable, Firefox is Firefox and the number will change,

15:46.880 --> 15:53.880
then you have the benefit that when a translation is lagging for whatever reason,

15:53.880 --> 15:59.880
your product information is still up to date.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.880
Okay, a classical one.

16:01.880 --> 16:05.880
Don't split sentences across multiple strings.

16:05.880 --> 16:09.880
Mostly done for formatting.

16:09.880 --> 16:17.880
But grammar is different in every language and you will end up with a Yoda-style translation.

16:17.880 --> 16:22.880
So don't.

16:22.880 --> 16:25.880
A question we are asking ourselves as well.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.880
Everything needs to be translated.

16:27.880 --> 16:30.880
Mattermost is a quite large project.

16:30.880 --> 16:35.880
If you have to start from scratch for adding a new language to the product,

16:35.880 --> 16:40.880
then you can wonder, should I prioritize translations?

16:40.880 --> 16:42.880
Like feedback from an API.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.880
Does it need to be translated?

16:45.880 --> 16:47.880
Who sees the feedback from an API?

16:47.880 --> 16:49.880
A developer.

16:49.880 --> 17:00.880
We sometimes think that developers know a little more English than most of our end users.

17:00.880 --> 17:05.880
Strings that are not visible for end users like the system console.

17:05.880 --> 17:10.880
We think system administrators, most of them will speak a little bit of English.

17:10.880 --> 17:18.880
If you have to make priorities, maybe that is not a priority.

17:18.880 --> 17:22.880
We have been struggling with plugins as well.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.880
What do we do with plugins?

17:24.880 --> 17:27.880
It is very nice if they are translated.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.880
Because within the product everything is in the same language.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.880
That is great.

17:33.880 --> 17:39.880
On the other hand, it is also quite some work for the translators to do all the plugins as well.

17:39.880 --> 17:45.880
You have to set up a translation server for that as well.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.880
So that is not as easy as well.

17:47.880 --> 17:54.880
Some plugins come with a lot of enthusiasm and they start translating.

17:54.880 --> 17:58.880
These translations were in a language that we are not shipping.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.880
What do you do with these translations?

18:01.880 --> 18:06.880
These people did a lot of work for the translation of that plugin, but we are not shipping it.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.880
Think about it. It is a great policy.

18:09.880 --> 18:14.880
Another thing, provide context.

18:15.880 --> 18:22.880
If you want to make your translators really hard, remove all context.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.880
This is an example where we have to translate the word add.

18:26.880 --> 18:32.880
Add can be used in very different meanings and translated in very different words.

18:32.880 --> 18:36.880
It turned out that it was add to a clock.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.880
It was a reference to time.

18:40.880 --> 18:45.880
In an ideal scenario, we would like to add screenshots to the translations,

18:45.880 --> 18:50.880
but we have not found a sustainable way of doing this.

18:50.880 --> 18:57.880
We do have a dedicated playground cloud server for translators.

18:57.880 --> 19:02.880
If they are an admin on their local instance,

19:02.880 --> 19:06.880
they can be an admin in our cloud server and they can go to the system console

19:06.880 --> 19:09.880
and they can play with all the settings and see,

19:09.880 --> 19:15.880
oh, that's what that string is really doing or is meant for.

19:15.880 --> 19:20.880
That is a way we are trying to help them as well.

19:20.880 --> 19:23.880
Prepare for the unexpected.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.880
One bloke came in and said,

19:27.880 --> 19:32.880
okay, I'm going to translate to Australian English.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.880
Okay, cool.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.880
Do.

19:37.880 --> 19:43.880
Then we found out when we shipped it that it wasn't showing up in our mobile app,

19:43.880 --> 19:47.880
because our mobile app was programmed to detect the language,

19:47.880 --> 19:49.880
but not the regional variant,

19:49.880 --> 19:54.880
so we had to do some code changes to change that.

19:54.880 --> 20:01.880
Another great one was we have support in beta at this moment for Persian.

20:02.880 --> 20:05.880
That's right to left language.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.880
That's something you have to check with your layout as well,

20:09.880 --> 20:14.880
because that's something, whoa, also not really what we were expecting,

20:14.880 --> 20:17.880
but it works.

20:17.880 --> 20:22.880
A classical one, some languages are more verbose or less verbose,

20:22.880 --> 20:25.880
like the previous speaker you mentioned,

20:25.880 --> 20:30.880
his translation narrowed down with one third of the document.

20:30.880 --> 20:36.880
Other languages like French, Portuguese are more verbose,

20:36.880 --> 20:39.880
and you can get in trouble with your placeholders or your buttons

20:39.880 --> 20:43.880
when we are putting quite some text over there.

20:43.880 --> 20:48.880
Now I'm going to be a little bit unsure.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.880
I think that some languages don't use spaces,

20:51.880 --> 20:57.880
and I'm going to see what people like Chinese, Japanese don't use spaces, right?

20:57.880 --> 21:02.880
And if you want to split sentences that are very long or translations,

21:02.880 --> 21:06.880
and we're going to split it on the second of the fourth space,

21:06.880 --> 21:11.880
and you're not using spaces, yep, you run into trouble.

21:11.880 --> 21:17.880
Yep, all those nice things you learn from working with people.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.880
Last thing, some people are evil.

21:20.880 --> 21:24.880
If you haven't noticed yet, they are.

21:24.880 --> 21:31.880
Our translations have been an attack factor of, they tried to,

21:31.880 --> 21:34.880
and you have to check your translations.

21:34.880 --> 21:39.880
They tried to put some nasty stuff in there.

21:39.880 --> 21:47.880
Also check, very often you can already see the username tells a lot.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.880
If you are evil-devil 666,

21:50.880 --> 21:53.880
then you are probably not up for something good,

21:53.880 --> 21:56.880
and you want to really contribute to the product.

21:56.880 --> 22:01.880
I'm not giving a hint to the evil hackers, change their username.

22:01.880 --> 22:03.880
Nope.

22:03.880 --> 22:07.880
But of course we want to be as open as possible to our contributors.

22:07.880 --> 22:10.880
We like contributors, the more the better.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.880
But we want to keep our product safe as well.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.880
So we have set up a permission scheme.

22:17.880 --> 22:24.880
For our work in progress languages that are not shipped and not visible,

22:24.880 --> 22:29.880
everybody can contribute.

22:29.880 --> 22:35.880
You comment, create an account on the web plate, and you can contribute.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.880
For the shipped languages, everyone can make suggestions.

22:39.880 --> 22:45.880
I don't like, this translation is faulty, I would change it like that.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.880
It's only a suggestion.

22:47.880 --> 22:53.880
Our shipped languages, for translating these, you have to get an extra permission.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.880
And we are just doing a small check,

22:56.880 --> 22:59.880
who are you, welcome to the community.

22:59.880 --> 23:04.880
Why are you wanting to translate, no matter most, and here you are.

23:04.880 --> 23:09.880
But it keeps the bad guys away.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.880
Okay, we are almost there.

23:14.880 --> 23:18.880
How do we try to increase the quality of our translations?

23:18.880 --> 23:25.880
I mentioned already that we have a very high turnaround of translators.

23:25.880 --> 23:30.880
And translating is an ongoing effort that never ends.

23:30.880 --> 23:36.880
And we recommend translators to create a stylite for their language,

23:36.880 --> 23:43.880
that they use the same phrase every time for the same English phrase.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.880
Because, yeah, you can translate it in many ways,

23:47.880 --> 23:51.880
but try to be consistent through time and through the product.

23:51.880 --> 23:54.880
This is something that we are recommending.

23:54.880 --> 24:01.880
Some languages do have it, some others don't have it.

24:01.880 --> 24:06.880
Translators are language experts.

24:06.880 --> 24:10.880
At matter most, we use an informal, friendly tone in our products.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.880
And we ask our translators to follow that tone.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.880
But it's very language specific.

24:16.880 --> 24:20.880
And I learned that in some languages, people say,

24:20.880 --> 24:26.880
yeah, but if we are going to use that tone, it will sound childish or even offending.

24:26.880 --> 24:32.880
So how can we find a solution to be friendly and open

24:32.880 --> 24:38.880
and a little bit more informal, but still correct in our language?

24:39.880 --> 24:45.880
Another issue we ran into was that people were translating product names.

24:45.880 --> 24:50.880
We have channels, calls, playbooks as product names within the product.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.880
And of course, people say, oh, I'm going to translate it.

24:54.880 --> 25:01.880
But we don't want to have our product names translated.

25:02.880 --> 25:08.880
And so we made an agreement if they are written with a capital,

25:08.880 --> 25:11.880
they start with a capital, they don't have to be translated.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.880
So that, of course, if they are in the beginning of a sentence,

25:15.880 --> 25:17.880
then you still have to check.

25:17.880 --> 25:21.880
But it's something that we had to train some translators like,

25:21.880 --> 25:25.880
OK, it's not what we expect that you translate product names.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.880
OK.

25:27.880 --> 25:30.880
That was it.

25:30.880 --> 25:33.880
Do you have some great questions?

25:39.880 --> 25:42.880
How do you decide which languages are shipped?

25:42.880 --> 25:44.880
Oh, very good question.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.880
The question is just for the people on the live stream,

25:47.880 --> 25:51.880
how do you decide when a language is shipped or not?

25:51.880 --> 25:55.880
When 85% of the languages, of the strings is translated,

25:55.880 --> 25:59.880
then it becomes a beta language.

26:00.880 --> 26:04.880
And it has to be 85% for three months.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.880
Then it goes into the product as beta language.

26:07.880 --> 26:13.880
And if we see an increasing, then it goes to really in production

26:13.880 --> 26:18.880
after three months when it's about 90%, 95% translated.

26:18.880 --> 26:23.880
That means also that when a translation is lagging

26:23.880 --> 26:28.880
and is not longer being maintained, that it goes to beta again.

26:28.880 --> 26:32.880
But we keep them in the product, even if they are about 60%,

26:32.880 --> 26:38.880
because a faulty translation is sometimes a way to get new translators.

26:42.880 --> 26:45.880
How fine-grained is the permission schema,

26:45.880 --> 26:49.880
especially for languages you are already shipping,

26:49.880 --> 26:52.880
like there is a very active translator,

26:52.880 --> 26:56.880
how and when do you decide if the casual contributor

26:56.880 --> 26:59.880
becomes someone who can write translation?

27:02.880 --> 27:04.880
By reaching out to the translator.

27:04.880 --> 27:09.880
We reach out to the translator and first we watch.

27:09.880 --> 27:15.880
If you create an account, Lozen makes three suggestions

27:15.880 --> 27:20.880
for a new, for a shipped language, and then we don't see him anymore.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.880
Okay, thank you for the suggestions.

27:23.880 --> 27:25.880
We will take a look at it.

27:25.880 --> 27:30.880
But if you see that he's making suggestions on a regular base,

27:30.880 --> 27:35.880
and yeah, then we contact the person and we say,

27:35.880 --> 27:39.880
okay, we see that you are doing, you're making suggestions.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.880
We like them.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.880
Don't you want to be translating the product?

27:44.880 --> 27:49.880
And if the person says yes, we elevate them in the permission.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.880
Do you don't interact with the UTS team?

27:52.880 --> 27:55.880
Yes, yeah, we will, yeah.

27:55.880 --> 28:00.880
We're looking for a style, especially.

28:00.880 --> 28:07.880
Yeah, but then we say we have some localization channels

28:07.880 --> 28:09.880
for each language as well.

28:09.880 --> 28:14.880
We have a channel for German and we join the channel

28:14.880 --> 28:16.880
and have a conversation.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.880
And we do have some, yeah.

28:19.880 --> 28:23.880
I implement encodings a lot.

28:23.880 --> 28:27.880
There's no white space and no points and whatever.

28:27.880 --> 28:32.880
But I have a big problem with translations always

28:32.880 --> 28:36.880
with German, English, French and Dutch, for example.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.880
So in English you just have you.

28:39.880 --> 28:43.880
And in German you have this formal and informal, do and see or...

28:44.880 --> 28:48.880
And it's very funny, it doesn't matter which software I use.

28:48.880 --> 28:53.880
It's always, however, even when I translate from German to French,

28:53.880 --> 28:58.880
I say the German informal do and in French it's translated Brazil.

28:58.880 --> 29:02.880
And do you have anything to present because you said

29:02.880 --> 29:06.880
just take places always and take always the same places.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.880
But I think...

29:09.880 --> 29:11.880
The style guide.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.880
Like an open discussions.

29:13.880 --> 29:18.880
We have open discussions about it, like one of our French contributors

29:18.880 --> 29:20.880
is in the back of the room.

29:20.880 --> 29:24.880
And he decided, we decided, OK, we are not going to try a...

29:24.880 --> 29:32.880
And in German we decided to have do.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.880
And we let the...

30:03.880 --> 30:08.880
They are created by the community.

30:08.880 --> 30:12.880
I got a very good French contributor who made a very nice format.

30:12.880 --> 30:15.880
And I'm happy to share it with you.

30:15.880 --> 30:21.880
It's open source guidelines and after the talk I will share it with you.

30:21.880 --> 30:26.880
And people who want the style guide ping me and I will share it.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.880
No problem.

30:29.880 --> 30:37.880
Last year, distribution had an evil contributor,

30:37.880 --> 30:42.880
an evil translator who translated two-thirds of the job perfectly.

30:42.880 --> 30:47.880
And in the last third of the file they used swear words and bad words.

30:47.880 --> 30:52.880
The distribution had to pull down their ISO files

30:52.880 --> 30:55.880
and to re-release everything.

30:55.880 --> 31:00.880
And all this in the timeframe of two weeks or so.

31:00.880 --> 31:06.880
Do you have an idea how this can generally be prevented?

31:06.880 --> 31:10.880
It could be an issue at Mattermost as well.

31:10.880 --> 31:15.880
We try to have two translators, a maintainer and a reviewer.

31:15.880 --> 31:22.880
But actually that is quite informal and we are actually not really checking it.

31:22.880 --> 31:32.880
So we... I don't want to bring people on bad ideas but it's a risk.

31:53.880 --> 31:58.880
Yeah, that's a good idea.

31:58.880 --> 32:02.880
You can easily script it if you have a list with all the swear words.

32:02.880 --> 32:10.880
The good part is that we do a check-up on our translators for the shipped languages.

32:10.880 --> 32:14.880
It's not that everybody just comes in and we do...

32:14.880 --> 32:23.880
And especially the new translators, we do some Google Translate checks on their strings

32:23.880 --> 32:26.880
to be sure before we merge them.

32:26.880 --> 32:33.880
Yeah, the long-time contributors, I don't check them because I'm quite sure about it.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.880
It's an answer.

32:36.880 --> 32:39.880
LNMs are very good at that.

32:39.880 --> 32:43.880
It's not as comfortable as free, it's slow, but it's a long way.

32:43.880 --> 32:50.880
The other is using the distance from machine translation to try to understand how far,

32:50.880 --> 32:56.880
like the distribution case would have been called by distance between the machine translation

32:56.880 --> 33:02.880
and the existing swear words.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.880
But yeah, nothing comes from this.

33:10.880 --> 33:12.880
Yep.

33:12.880 --> 33:18.880
All your translations in the language, are they all community-provided?

33:18.880 --> 33:22.880
Is all community-provided.

33:22.880 --> 33:30.880
Sometimes for a specific language, a company pays someone or says to someone of the staff,

33:30.880 --> 33:37.880
please translate it, but we are not actually paying our translators.

33:37.880 --> 33:40.880
What's the answer using AI for translation?

33:40.880 --> 33:42.880
AI for translation.

33:42.880 --> 33:49.880
We tried it and we found the results not good enough.

33:49.880 --> 33:54.880
You notice that it's AI.

33:54.880 --> 33:57.880
I'm going to take him first.

33:57.880 --> 34:05.880
Can you welcome translators who don't have technical knowledge in the community?

34:05.880 --> 34:12.880
Because it's sometimes difficult for them to understand how to do translation.

34:12.880 --> 34:20.880
Yeah, we have a very user-friendly, web-late environment and we made a video recording

34:20.880 --> 34:27.880
where we go through the product and show how do you translate and web-late.

34:27.880 --> 34:36.880
That's something we use indeed because you have to be as user-friendly as possible.

34:36.880 --> 34:41.880
Some people come in and try to translate and make a pull request and then we have to say,

34:41.880 --> 34:45.880
no, you have to go through web-late.

34:45.880 --> 34:48.880
How do you deal with partial localizations?

34:48.880 --> 34:56.880
You mentioned that you have limits like 60% to 85% above which you are shipping a product with this localization,

34:56.880 --> 35:00.880
but that clearly means that there are some messages that are on-day in that locale.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.880
How do you present these to the user?

35:02.880 --> 35:03.880
In English.

35:03.880 --> 35:04.880
English is the default.

35:04.880 --> 35:11.880
If we don't find the translation, it shows up in English.

35:11.880 --> 35:16.880
You mentioned that you don't actually know any card using AI,

35:16.880 --> 35:25.880
but I do think you mentioned that when you can just use machine translation and you can learn the translation language,

35:25.880 --> 35:31.880
and then perhaps you can also re-edit language and use the cultural language.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.880
And therefore, you can use the power of that and with this long-term, would this long-term,

35:35.880 --> 35:38.880
would actually reach the up-stay level?

35:38.880 --> 35:43.880
In web-late, we do use D-Pill to make suggestions,

35:43.880 --> 35:50.880
but I noticed myself that for Dutch it's quite good, for German it's quite good as well,

35:50.880 --> 35:52.880
but sometimes you have to change it.

35:52.880 --> 35:56.880
Often the do-and-see problem and the two...

35:56.880 --> 35:58.880
On the left, and not in left,

35:58.880 --> 36:03.880
instead of why did you left it because of loss or so?

36:03.880 --> 36:11.880
So, it increases the performance of your translations a lot,

36:11.880 --> 36:22.880
but you have to manually go over them because you can't press the AI enough yet.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.880
How many translations per language do you have?

36:24.880 --> 36:29.880
Mostly one, sometimes two.

36:29.880 --> 36:38.880
In German, it's only allowed to add documents in passive form,

36:38.880 --> 36:42.880
and in English, you usually have reactive form with you.

36:42.880 --> 36:46.880
Do you also have an automatic form?

36:46.880 --> 36:53.880
I should ask the German translator what he does for me.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.880
Okay, thank you.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.880
Don't forget the socks.
