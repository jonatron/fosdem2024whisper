WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.560
I have two affiliations, Manis with Evolvium, which is company behind open source IGA system

00:11.560 --> 00:18.040
midpoint and also I'm active in academia helping scientists across the world get together

00:18.040 --> 00:24.040
and solve their identity problems and in this talk I will kind of combine all of my experience

00:24.080 --> 00:30.920
with this rather complicated topic. So let's see with some introduction. If we're talking

00:30.920 --> 00:36.880
about multilateral identities we are meaning basically the whole scale of identities that

00:36.880 --> 00:42.480
are available to the users because the users today have a lot of identities that they just

00:42.480 --> 00:50.520
own and they can use to access systems. So it can be like identities from one's institution

00:50.520 --> 00:58.040
but it can also be social identity, identity on for example GitHub or even though states

00:58.040 --> 01:05.920
especially here in Europe are pushing some European IDs, digital wallets, some academic

01:05.920 --> 01:10.320
identities, banks and so on and so on. There's a little lot of them and all of these identities

01:10.320 --> 01:18.000
can be used somehow. Then the next item in the name of the talk was access management.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.560
So it's a component basically responsible for really giving access to people and do

01:24.560 --> 01:29.280
everything related to access. So one thing you can do is of course just type your username

01:29.280 --> 01:35.440
and password in but in principle you can use all these identities as well and that we have

01:35.440 --> 01:41.760
IGA which is identity governance administration for those who don't know this term is basically

01:41.760 --> 01:48.640
an extension of identity management and its main purpose is get the identity management

01:48.640 --> 01:54.000
rather technical stuff for administrator to people who are actually making decisions.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.720
So some managers or even support just get them in, let them manage what they supposed

01:59.720 --> 02:05.960
to manage, not have everything done by technical people when the others call them. And in this

02:06.040 --> 02:12.400
talk the identity governance system will be represented by midpoint and I will try to

02:12.400 --> 02:18.600
show you how all these pieces fit together and what can you do with the combinations.

02:18.600 --> 02:25.520
So let me introduce midpoint as well. As Zawar said it's identity governance and identity

02:25.520 --> 02:32.440
management system and because I'm here of course it's fully open source and usually

02:32.920 --> 02:37.400
suppose it's not important to say it but when you are dealing with identity management and

02:37.400 --> 02:42.520
access management areas a lot of the products there are claiming to be open source but in

02:42.520 --> 02:49.320
reality they are just open core or something even else but with midpoint we are really doing our

02:49.320 --> 02:55.240
best to make it fully open source including all the documentation guidelines for the developers

02:55.480 --> 03:03.240
whatever is needed everything is open and available to use. And the product itself is

03:03.240 --> 03:10.200
maintained by Evolveum and we have few external contributors. We would happy to have more of

03:10.200 --> 03:16.760
them but it's kind of hard. The identity management, identity governance is very complex tool contains

03:16.760 --> 03:24.040
a lot of code so it's very tough to get contributors. But luckily we have some contribution at least

03:24.040 --> 03:31.080
to some integration part something that is easier to get to. So about midpoint it's very

03:31.080 --> 03:36.840
feature rich and I would say it's really comparable to any commercial alternative. So I consider it

03:37.480 --> 03:42.840
a big success and even we are recognized by some analytics company which is really nice

03:43.720 --> 03:50.040
and what we can expect from open open source system it's really customizable is using as much

03:50.040 --> 03:55.320
standard as possible if you want to get more there is a link that you can find all the information.

03:57.320 --> 04:04.600
So let's get to access management integration because this is quite a common but I think there is

04:04.600 --> 04:11.320
a lot of potential if you are integrated IGA system of access management. So from the IGA to access

04:11.320 --> 04:17.320
management this is the more common path so the IGA because from the identity management part

04:17.320 --> 04:25.000
most less information about users and their accesses naturally IGA can provision all this

04:25.000 --> 04:31.240
profile information about users to access management and also provide data for authorization.

04:31.240 --> 04:37.000
It might be attributes, might be roles, even some combination. So this is quite natural.

04:37.800 --> 04:43.160
The other way around it's something not that heavily used and then I think there is a lot of

04:43.160 --> 04:49.080
potential in that because the access management especially when we when using some external

04:49.080 --> 04:56.600
identities have a lot of information to pass back to the IGA because and if we are talking about

04:56.600 --> 05:01.320
single organization, if you're using a password and you have no new information, if we are using

05:01.320 --> 05:06.440
these external identities usually with the identity we are getting some attributes that can be used.

05:07.160 --> 05:12.680
So if it's a state identity we at least know this person was verified by state and we have

05:12.680 --> 05:17.160
some identifier from the state that can be laid to use. For example if we are dealing with some

05:17.160 --> 05:22.920
big security incidents, if we have academic identities we can get information whenever

05:22.920 --> 05:28.280
this person is an academic employee or student and again use it for access control later.

05:29.000 --> 05:34.280
If we have social identities at least we have some social identifiers of the person

05:34.280 --> 05:39.880
that we can use for some integrations for example or we might have also other attributes like names,

05:39.880 --> 05:44.440
emails, whatever that can be used such as to make life of the person easier just to

05:44.440 --> 05:50.120
request them just use the information that we already have. Second thing that we can get from

05:50.120 --> 05:55.480
access management is access timestamp because the access management of course know when the user

05:55.480 --> 06:00.200
was accessing the system so we can get these timestamps and work with them later and I will get

06:00.200 --> 06:07.240
to this. What are the typical interfaces for the integration? There is no standard unfortunately

06:07.240 --> 06:13.400
but we have some standard common option so from the identity management part integrated

06:13.400 --> 06:18.440
anything is usually through some kind of connector basically writing custom connector to

06:19.480 --> 06:25.720
to get whatever API is that for the access management or there can be some middle layer like

06:25.720 --> 06:31.640
some let's say LDAP or Active Directory some standard database that access management can use.

06:32.120 --> 06:37.880
And to get some information back I do if there's this direct synchronization of connector

06:37.880 --> 06:44.920
identity management can read it back or if you want some like just like runtime integration

06:44.920 --> 06:53.800
you can always call some API and do some something that. Let's move to identity governance benefit.

06:55.080 --> 06:59.400
Basically if you are familiar with identity governance it probably won't be anything new

06:59.400 --> 07:05.960
but I will just repeat it. The very important one is overall visibility. If identity governance

07:05.960 --> 07:11.480
deployed because you usually deploy it within a single organization you want to be in control

07:11.480 --> 07:17.080
and have some visibility of it's happening in your organization mostly to tight your security

07:17.080 --> 07:24.600
be able to go through audits and so on. So the main feature is some kind of reporting or web pages

07:24.760 --> 07:30.200
dashboards who has access to what and why so you can visualize for example if you are using

07:30.200 --> 07:35.640
role based access control who has which role what the role is entitled to to which applications

07:35.640 --> 07:43.960
and why every person has this role. In midpoint we are using something that we call they are calling

07:43.960 --> 07:51.640
policy driven RBEC because the RBEC is very good tool it's very easy to visualize it to explain

07:51.640 --> 07:56.040
to people but you need something more in order to work with some attributes with some automated

07:56.040 --> 08:04.760
rules so we have kind of extension of RBEC and if we are thinking about this talk how we can get

08:04.760 --> 08:09.560
this multilateral identities and this data we can get through the access management to AGA I have

08:09.560 --> 08:17.160
to use it. So first one is use these attributes for example if I know the person was wedded by state

08:17.400 --> 08:23.960
come with state identity I may note this as a level of assurance attribute I have big

08:23.960 --> 08:30.600
restaurants in this identity and based on it I can give some access through RBEC classically

08:30.600 --> 08:35.960
and then I can visualize it in the standard way using dashboards and really know what the

08:35.960 --> 08:43.400
person has access to. Also when I have time stamp when the user is accessing each system

08:43.400 --> 08:48.600
for the last time again through the access management I can use it to build some policies

08:48.600 --> 08:55.400
either to remove unused accounts and to tighten security or I can naturally work with some kind

08:55.400 --> 09:02.360
of expiration renewables of account whatever I need for my particle workflow and of course

09:02.360 --> 09:08.840
AGA wants to automate all of this so using airbag automated rules some provisioning through

09:08.840 --> 09:13.480
connectors and integration in the system make sure that everything that I just said is completely

09:13.480 --> 09:19.560
automated and you don't have to worry about it. If the full automation is not enough you want some

09:19.560 --> 09:25.240
human element some kind of interaction you can have some approval processes, expirations, renewables

09:25.240 --> 09:33.080
and so on. So let's get to some interesting feature about integration all of this together

09:33.160 --> 09:39.080
and I will start with integration of basically access management to given surveys using just

09:39.080 --> 09:46.120
in time provisioning now without identity governance. What you can do and this is very nice trick

09:46.120 --> 09:51.000
you can basically create accounts on the fly because when we are using these multilateral

09:51.000 --> 09:58.120
identities which are coming already with attributes we can just pass this identity to target system

09:58.120 --> 10:03.560
and by passing it we basically authorizing the identity to access the system and the system

10:03.560 --> 10:08.520
if the system supports it can create the identity and accounts for it on the fly,

10:08.520 --> 10:12.680
use the attributes and give proper permissions within the system.

10:14.520 --> 10:20.120
What this basically here is how to how to deprovision such accounts because this

10:20.120 --> 10:26.360
creating of accounts is ideal it's very simple you can use it really on the fly but you have no

10:26.360 --> 10:32.200
way how to disable these accounts the only way how to do it is again by the end system itself to

10:32.200 --> 10:38.440
have some kind of expiration because what is important here if the person accessing losing the

10:38.440 --> 10:44.120
access they are not going to the system anymore and the system doesn't know never gets the information

10:44.120 --> 10:50.280
there's no way how to get the information and also with this we have no central visibility

10:50.280 --> 10:56.520
who has account where and why which might be tough for doing some audits or resolving security

10:56.520 --> 11:03.880
incidents you have to manually go through all the systems and get through it. So with midpoint

11:03.880 --> 11:11.400
if identity governance component in place we can basically extend this using some extra tricks

11:12.040 --> 11:18.760
so the basic premise is in midpoint we are managing entitled users so I'm not saying the user

11:19.720 --> 11:23.240
should have active account on the target service at the moment we're just saying

11:23.880 --> 11:31.160
he or she is entitled to have it and whenever the user decides to access the system again using

11:31.160 --> 11:37.880
just in time provisioning we can create the account on the fly using this entitlement at

11:37.880 --> 11:44.360
midpoint midpoint managers. Also what is nice about midpoint midpoint supports provisioning and

11:44.360 --> 11:50.200
it's really quick it can be done in real time so even though if the target system doesn't support

11:50.200 --> 11:55.000
just in time provisioning can create in accounts immediately basically access management can

11:55.560 --> 12:00.680
ping midpoint and say now it's time to provision this account midpoint checks if the user is

12:00.680 --> 12:07.320
entitled and if so triggers the provisioning so we can have just in time support even for system

12:07.320 --> 12:13.960
doesn't support it not that able. Also midpoint and is this provisioning connector can read some

12:14.040 --> 12:20.040
data back so regardless if the account was created on the service or through midpoint

12:20.040 --> 12:26.360
midpoint will get the information the account is there is active and also we can read any additional

12:26.360 --> 12:33.560
information and basically then we have full scale information for the IGA we have who has the

12:33.560 --> 12:39.320
account active who is entitled but doesn't activate the account and we can build all the policies on

12:39.320 --> 12:45.800
top of that including some expiration renewals work with last access timestamp and combine this

12:45.800 --> 12:51.720
all together so for example if the user doesn't use the system for a long time it's kind of a

12:51.720 --> 12:57.240
security risk we can deprovision but we still know the user is still entitled so for the next

12:57.240 --> 13:00.520
next usage we can we can still work with that.

13:00.520 --> 13:09.480
And now gets to this part with multi lateral identities because that's brings just another

13:09.480 --> 13:16.120
level of complexity because with multi lateral identities we are expecting that a single user

13:16.120 --> 13:23.880
can have multiple identities and we can even combine them because we can say okay one identity

13:23.880 --> 13:30.280
for example the state identity brings your account to the higher level of assurance we

13:30.280 --> 13:35.640
are know this account was vetted then you can have some social accounts saying okay this is your

13:35.640 --> 13:41.080
social ID and we can connect with some with some system with some social systems and we can

13:41.080 --> 13:47.640
integration because we know this ID because we know this ID if we have some academic scenario

13:47.640 --> 13:52.520
we know the person is a student or employee of given university or even more universities

13:52.520 --> 13:58.600
you can combine it all together. Tough part is how to correlate these identities because

14:00.680 --> 14:06.040
there is no common identifier nothing that we can automate it. In midpoint we support

14:06.040 --> 14:12.920
two way we call it smart correlation and it enables you to configure how the individual

14:12.920 --> 14:19.720
accounts could be correlated and you can you can base it on the source so if in the source you know

14:20.360 --> 14:25.240
this is the email which was verified and I'm happy to correlate with existing accounts based on

14:25.240 --> 14:33.000
this email you can set up this rule you can set up some fuzzy rule like matching on name or even

14:33.000 --> 14:38.680
even have fuzzy matching counting with typos and some something like that but this probably you

14:38.680 --> 14:44.920
want to fully automate because there is some risk if it's really the real person so you can also

14:44.920 --> 14:50.120
define what match should be like processed in an automatic way and just connect these identities

14:50.120 --> 14:57.880
together and what rules need some human interactions and there are two ways how to do it. If you want

14:57.880 --> 15:04.280
strict control it can be done by some administrator or some other delegated responsible person

15:04.280 --> 15:09.880
basically manually whatever process you need you will just see okay this is attributes you have

15:09.880 --> 15:15.320
this is the new identity you have to decide here are some potential matches decide if one of the

15:15.320 --> 15:21.320
matches is real or if you want to create a new account for this user. Second option might be to

15:21.320 --> 15:28.520
again use the access management part because basically the user in principle own all these

15:28.520 --> 15:35.480
identities and can use any of them to sign in so let's just the user sign in with first one then

15:35.480 --> 15:40.280
the second one in the same session and then we know for sure that the user's own both identities

15:40.280 --> 15:48.440
and can be connected together. Also what is nice here you can combine all these external identities

15:48.440 --> 15:54.440
like state, social, academic with local one if I have deployed IGN and usually I have within a

15:54.440 --> 16:00.440
single institution I have some local accounts managed by HR department so even combination of

16:00.440 --> 16:05.480
these local accounts and this like remote identities is possible using the same principle

16:05.480 --> 16:13.480
there's nothing really different there and what I can do with that is build some kind of unified

16:13.480 --> 16:20.520
profile so take all these attributes that I'm getting from different sources and then usually

16:20.520 --> 16:26.920
I want to build a single user profile I don't want to work with users who has six names from

16:26.920 --> 16:32.200
six sources and most of them are exactly the same the value is the same maybe sometimes if you have

16:32.200 --> 16:36.520
like your name from the social network maybe you have different biospelling because you like it or

16:36.520 --> 16:44.360
something like that so we can just gather this data and then put a formula how to build single user

16:44.360 --> 16:50.600
profile how to select which name is the one how to select which email is the one that should be used

16:51.240 --> 16:57.160
or if we need it we can just build this like one profile which is always handy to have if you

16:57.160 --> 17:02.840
don't have any special requirements but then we can also have some extension of this profile for

17:02.840 --> 17:07.800
example we can have like official email within the institution and then like a personalized

17:07.800 --> 17:13.400
preferred email and then we can decide based on the target application which one of the emails

17:13.400 --> 17:20.920
should be used which one should be provisioned and this is basically or possible with midpoint

17:20.920 --> 17:25.880
just put all the rules in how it should be processed of course the most difficult part is how to

17:25.880 --> 17:31.960
decide it because we want to have it simple so people can understand and also give an option to

17:31.960 --> 17:37.000
select for example they prefer the email or preferant address at least for the system when this

17:37.960 --> 17:45.560
this is not that important and what we can also do it thinking about these rules and how to

17:45.560 --> 17:51.720
combine all this data together how to put some organization policies in because it's really

17:51.720 --> 17:57.240
nice to have if you use this freedom to select their mail or they prefer preferred name or

17:57.240 --> 18:02.760
preferred email but sometimes we have some systems that we really want to enforce strict rules

18:03.320 --> 18:09.640
because this is something that I don't know is sent to send to authorities for for some validation

18:09.640 --> 18:15.800
or I don't know it's it's might be tied to to your payroll and you want to have real data there

18:15.800 --> 18:20.040
but then you can have like a company social network and let user give them the freedom

18:20.680 --> 18:27.160
so when constructing these rules we can combine like organization policy with some user preferences

18:27.160 --> 18:32.600
and even based on the target system decide it what results should be used and where

18:33.320 --> 18:40.200
sounds complicated it is but it's all about programming and how to put it together for your

18:40.200 --> 18:47.080
organization and again with the end goal to have fully automated processing at the end with some

18:47.080 --> 18:54.760
middle user inputs user preferences and so on it's not complete there are still some missing pieces

18:55.320 --> 19:01.000
we were we were experimenting with running some demos improving midpoint as a product to support

19:01.000 --> 19:08.200
this better but for sure it's not fully complex the biggest issue is user experience because yeah

19:08.200 --> 19:12.440
a lot of these options especially dealing with external identities when users needs to sign

19:12.440 --> 19:19.080
sign in actively work with them it's hard and this will be hard for a while but it's getting better

19:19.080 --> 19:25.800
how how how people are getting more and more used to work with work with their identities and use

19:25.800 --> 19:31.240
the identity to sign with completely other system now we've pushed for european evils and so on

19:31.800 --> 19:36.920
again people will be getting more getting used to this principle and it will get easier

19:38.040 --> 19:44.600
also the interface between access management and aga is not well defined now we are just writing

19:44.680 --> 19:50.760
custom integrations on both sides dependent on the on the needs for sure it will be better to have

19:50.760 --> 19:57.720
some like prepared interface that we can use and we can connect our product midpoint to

19:57.720 --> 20:04.280
existing access management systems that would be really really handy also life cycles of the

20:04.280 --> 20:11.080
individual identities because we are combining different identities to a single profile and also

20:11.640 --> 20:16.600
we should think about life cycle of the individual identities some of them are pretty

20:16.600 --> 20:22.520
persistent like the state ones but other like if i if i know that someone is a student probably i

20:22.520 --> 20:28.120
should verify this this this statement once in a while and i can put some policies or condition

20:29.400 --> 20:34.200
it would be nice if the protocols where we're going to support this so we can for example query

20:34.200 --> 20:39.640
each day but with other protocols like samble basically until the user didn't sign in you

20:39.640 --> 20:45.640
don't know the current state of the information so have some maybe some explorations some renewables

20:45.640 --> 20:53.400
here as well would be really nice also the whole assurance and trust model in this might be very

20:53.400 --> 20:59.960
complex again working with different sources of information which are trustworthy which are not

20:59.960 --> 21:04.920
how we can process them how we can use it what's our assurance on this information

21:05.480 --> 21:12.680
it's difficult to even decide what we want to do and we are and when we are when we are have this

21:12.680 --> 21:19.640
decision is an essential thing is how to process it we experiment with some kind of small project

21:19.640 --> 21:27.080
which we called mid privacy and it was about putting metadata to each value that we are storing at

21:27.080 --> 21:33.720
the metadata source of the identity the assurance level and also for example how we can be used

21:34.360 --> 21:40.600
within the gdpr framework so having this all tied up and again automated so we can use it for

21:40.600 --> 21:46.440
automated processing and provisioning rules would be really nice we started as an experiment just to

21:47.400 --> 21:53.320
get some feeling for it it's fully available to people but as far as i know nobody tried to put

21:53.320 --> 21:58.600
it in practice yet which is which is a bit pity and again there is a link if you want to read more

21:58.680 --> 22:07.960
about it so just to conclude and hope to leave some time for the questions it is it is really

22:07.960 --> 22:13.160
possible to combine these worlds and really tightly connect identity governance system

22:13.160 --> 22:18.760
with access management and basically unlocks new potential for new features

22:20.440 --> 22:26.440
and nowadays there is a lot of identities that people can use to sign in to our systems

22:27.080 --> 22:33.640
state banks and i'm expecting there will be more and more of them and people will get

22:33.640 --> 22:39.160
think more and more custom to use them especially with these eids on the european level so this

22:39.160 --> 22:47.720
is something that we should be prepared for and i ga even though and i think about i ga is mostly

22:47.720 --> 22:54.040
within a single institution to make sure everything is tied everything is well well ordered everything

22:54.040 --> 23:01.480
is automated it can be audited it can work very nice in this world of multilateral identities and

23:01.480 --> 23:06.920
bring these same conditions and the same the same benefits from the i ga to this world as well

23:08.040 --> 23:14.440
but having a full implementation covering order english is complex and it will take probably

23:14.440 --> 23:21.080
some time when we all get it there midpoint is kind of halfway through and that doesn't mean halfway

23:21.080 --> 23:26.360
exactly we have something now that can be used it can be experimented with but if you want to

23:26.360 --> 23:32.120
reach maximum potential it will need to improve the product as well and because everything is open

23:32.120 --> 23:38.120
source and available all the contributions are always welcome so thank you for your attention

23:38.120 --> 23:40.040
and we have a few minutes to get some questions

23:40.040 --> 23:43.000
yes

24:00.120 --> 24:03.480
the question was if we have some machine learning on our roadmap

24:04.440 --> 24:10.120
we have we are already experimenting with that not for this particular problem we decided to

24:10.120 --> 24:15.960
first start with role mining so if you are importing roles usually within the existing

24:15.960 --> 24:21.480
role that you already have how to mine some business roles out of it because if you have if you are

24:21.480 --> 24:28.200
migrating towards i ga you have a lot of roles manually manage and it's good to build some business

24:28.280 --> 24:31.720
roles that can be easily managed and we are using machine learning principles for that

24:33.160 --> 24:39.640
it could be good to use it for example for this identity matching but so far we were happy with

24:39.640 --> 24:53.400
some customers yes so this identity of management is only one side of the picture because if i have

24:53.480 --> 25:00.360
a user he might be a suicide man or whatever he's leaving traces in the application you grant access

25:00.360 --> 25:07.480
to okay so if this is now leaving the company the institute the university how do you deal with the

25:07.480 --> 25:15.000
traces do you have a mechanism like maybe scramble the username and change the username in the

25:15.000 --> 25:23.240
application so if it's reused that yeah re-usage of usernames in the target application might

25:23.800 --> 25:30.680
be a big problem yes so so the question was we have all this in place and what we what we can do

25:30.680 --> 25:37.720
when user is leaving the organization with his or her data scramble them remove them somehow

25:37.720 --> 25:45.160
something with that and this is a tough question because one part is the application itself and

25:45.160 --> 25:51.160
when you have this automated identity management identity governance system in place usually you

25:51.160 --> 25:56.360
can deprovision the data completely out of the application but then you have this central point

25:56.360 --> 26:01.880
of the identity governance and the question here how long you want to keep the data for

26:01.880 --> 26:07.000
security incidents for example and that's valid and probably you want to have them unscramble

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
for year two depending on your policy and then you should again automate the process how to

26:13.000 --> 26:20.120
either scramble the data or just completely get rid of it i would say accept identifiers because

26:20.120 --> 26:26.520
especially if you are talking about usernames you probably don't want to reuse that or at least

26:26.520 --> 26:32.760
not within a central period of time so i would recommend to keep that yeah but it's a bit more

26:32.760 --> 26:38.680
than that like in the talk before we had the wasuo what we have some web application and

26:38.680 --> 26:45.000
some person is creating a dashboard so within the application it belongs to that person and

26:45.080 --> 26:51.720
everyone else is using it so i kind of delete it but the the creator is done so it's more complex

26:51.720 --> 26:57.800
than this yes yes so the so the comment was if the user is creating something like a dashboard in

26:57.800 --> 27:03.880
web application that others are using if the original owner leaves can we delete it or not

27:04.760 --> 27:09.080
and if you are within an organization when you have complete control over your users

27:09.880 --> 27:14.760
you need some process to pass this work to someone else and i would say you have to i

27:15.000 --> 27:20.440
process for levers in the same way you are returning your keys to your office you should

27:20.440 --> 27:25.640
also return all your digital systems or transfer this to someone else but what you can at least

27:25.640 --> 27:30.600
automate in this case if you have this like a dashboard something have a process that

27:30.600 --> 27:35.880
before the deletion will send the notification or let someone approve it and that could help to

27:35.880 --> 27:47.400
automate it okay time is up thank you and we can continue this question later
