WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.600
Okay, so thank you very much for staying for the last talk of the day and last talk of

00:09.600 --> 00:11.200
the year for the collaboration day room.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.200
So thanks a lot.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.440
I see people that stayed a lot during the day.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.120
So thank you.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.120
So the last presentation is about Matheus, which will be the challenges of creating

00:21.120 --> 00:23.880
a fast fact-checking platform for the Brazilian community.

00:23.880 --> 00:24.880
Thank you.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.880
Thank you.

00:25.880 --> 00:26.880
Yeah, can you hear me okay?

00:26.880 --> 00:27.880
Yeah.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.800
And thanks, appreciate everyone here.

00:29.800 --> 00:34.080
I thought there would be less people, so I really appreciate that.

00:34.080 --> 00:36.400
It's my first time at FOSDEM as well.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.880
Let me introduce myself.

00:37.880 --> 00:44.800
I am a senior product manager at the Wikimedia Foundation working on MediaWiki.

00:44.800 --> 00:49.040
But this product is a different hat that I wear.

00:49.040 --> 00:55.400
I'm a volunteer on an NGO in Brazil and we are trying to combat fake news and make something

00:55.480 --> 01:02.320
that is open and in software, in data and in knowledge.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.560
So what I want to talk about here is the mission of this project and I'm going to go over the

01:08.560 --> 01:14.600
challenges of trying to do something against misinformation in Brazil.

01:14.600 --> 01:23.640
Brazil is like a very fertile soil for misinformation, information, especially recently.

01:24.080 --> 01:34.240
The reason for that to arise in my will was basically because seeing how my family was

01:34.240 --> 01:39.240
sharing and spreading misinformation, it all started.

01:39.240 --> 01:45.720
So I started imagining, so I'm a co-founder, I'm not the only one that volunteer on this

01:45.720 --> 01:51.320
project, but we started imagining a society where everyone can freely access and engage

01:51.400 --> 01:54.880
with true and reliable information about autonomy.

01:54.880 --> 02:01.200
And I kind of stole a little bit of the Wikimedia Foundation mission here because we share

02:01.200 --> 02:02.200
similar values.

02:02.200 --> 02:08.680
So the mission for this project is to encourage ad-edu communication.

02:08.680 --> 02:13.840
I'm not going to talk about it because the other co-founder, which is a journalist, is

02:13.840 --> 02:18.680
the one that kind of coined or uses that term.

02:18.680 --> 02:24.440
And basically it means that we can only achieve our mission if we actually educate people

02:24.440 --> 02:27.480
and we need to communicate that.

02:27.480 --> 02:33.640
So the platform and everything, all the product what entails, it all focuses on the specific

02:33.640 --> 02:36.640
pilot.

02:36.640 --> 02:42.400
But the idea is that for the values on accessibility, credibility and autonomy, we're creating individuals

02:42.400 --> 02:48.040
or we're making autonomous individuals in Brazil being able to access information or

02:48.040 --> 02:55.040
at least question information without losing the credibility.

02:55.040 --> 02:59.040
And so when we started, so this is a study from Caspersky.

02:59.040 --> 03:06.040
And so more than 70% of Brazilians with internet have believed in the fake news and 62% of Brazilians

03:06.560 --> 03:08.960
failed to recognize false news.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.920
So this was a study that at the time was what motivated us to keep going.

03:15.920 --> 03:22.920
And challenges were immense because it forced us to tweak planning and change and pivot

03:25.040 --> 03:31.440
a lot in the years of the foundational years, which is kind of the timeline, which I call

03:31.440 --> 03:33.200
the foundational years.

03:33.200 --> 03:38.640
So I'm even excluding here all of the technical exploration that I did since 2018.

03:39.320 --> 03:45.960
And in 2020 when I thought that, okay, we have technology and maybe we're ready to proceed,

03:45.960 --> 03:48.640
we signed up for the Mozilla Open Lab.

03:48.640 --> 03:55.640
We participated in receiving product mentorship and preparing an ideation which came to be

03:56.160 --> 03:59.400
Alete Effect.

03:59.400 --> 04:05.400
And from that exploration with Mozilla it was very interesting because we decided, so

04:05.400 --> 04:09.840
we came as dreamers like we want to do something multilingual for everyone.

04:09.840 --> 04:16.840
We want to fix the world because the logo of that program that we participated was fixing

04:17.800 --> 04:19.720
the internet.

04:19.720 --> 04:24.200
And then we learned that it wouldn't be like that.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.680
So we would have a focus group.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.360
We would only focus in Brazil.

04:28.360 --> 04:35.360
We would look into people that is already engaging with fact checking or at least a

04:35.480 --> 04:37.000
reading about fact checking somehow.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.600
So active readers or independent fact checkers, even professional fact checkers.

04:42.600 --> 04:49.600
And then we would even look into a specific demographics, which would be from the age

04:50.280 --> 04:54.680
of 18 to 29, would represent like 16% of Brazil.

04:54.680 --> 05:01.440
And we set a goal that if we get 0.1% of that, 35,000 potential independent fact checkers,

05:01.480 --> 05:06.800
which is an increase of 7,000% of professional fact checkers in Brazil.

05:06.800 --> 05:12.800
And I'm going to talk about this a little bit because, so we did this exploration on

05:12.800 --> 05:14.240
Mozilla Open Lab.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.600
Then we started working on the infrastructure and launched the infrastructure and tried

05:17.600 --> 05:19.640
to experiment more.

05:19.640 --> 05:26.640
We participated on the trust, it's the TTL, it's the trust and truth online, yeah, conference

05:27.360 --> 05:34.360
and so we introduced the concept of the democratization of fact checking in Brazil, which is something

05:37.680 --> 05:40.880
that we are looking forward.

05:40.880 --> 05:47.880
And in the same year, we started a residency at Projeto Comprova, which is a group of

05:47.880 --> 05:54.880
news outlets and independent organizations that combat fake news in Brazil.

05:56.480 --> 06:03.480
And by participating on that, we actually engaged with our personas or professional

06:04.360 --> 06:05.960
fact checkers.

06:05.960 --> 06:12.960
And from that point, we started exploring a platform focused on professional fact checkers

06:12.960 --> 06:16.120
only.

06:16.120 --> 06:22.120
So we wanted to do something to speed up their process, make sure that they were, the process

06:22.120 --> 06:29.120
were optimized and they could actually chase fake news and combat it.

06:29.720 --> 06:36.720
So with that in mind, we thought that we are ready to formalize and then we started understanding

06:37.360 --> 06:38.880
what that would entail.

06:38.880 --> 06:45.880
So with these learnings, we defined that with process transparency and the didactic

06:47.160 --> 06:52.960
of representation, we could enable a fact checking manual or operational guideline and

06:52.960 --> 06:58.480
then we could replicate that and create autonomy of the individuals that we wanted.

06:58.480 --> 07:05.480
So the methodology should be accessible and understandable and that's the requirement

07:05.760 --> 07:11.760
that forced us to be aligned with the Creative Commons license for our data and also everything

07:11.760 --> 07:18.760
that we create from courses or workshops are all open and available.

07:18.960 --> 07:25.380
And we also had some, in the last year, I'll also talk about that, but we had multiple

07:25.380 --> 07:32.380
workshops and partnerships with universities in Brazil and all of that was free and based

07:32.460 --> 07:36.820
on the knowledge sharing proposed.

07:36.820 --> 07:43.320
And the platform or the product that I mainly worked on would be just a facilitator or a

07:43.320 --> 07:47.700
place where people could use and engage with.

07:47.700 --> 07:54.420
And our main goal was that, so we were here in 2021, we wanted to reach the Brazilian

07:54.420 --> 08:01.420
elections with something that could be used for good.

08:02.980 --> 08:09.140
So then we formalized and then we participated on the Global Fact Nine conference, which

08:09.140 --> 08:14.580
is organized by the IFCN, the International Fact Checking Network.

08:14.580 --> 08:20.260
And when we got there, we went to validate some of the use cases that we have built

08:20.260 --> 08:27.260
and it was like a bucket of ice on us because we understood that there is a different dynamics

08:27.260 --> 08:31.560
happening on fact checking community.

08:31.560 --> 08:38.560
So one of the things is they are very worried of being open, mostly because that can be

08:40.800 --> 08:44.320
weaponized by bad actors and create more problems to them.

08:44.320 --> 08:51.320
So every software that they write, it's not always open, sirs.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.320
It's not always open.

08:53.320 --> 09:00.320
Licenses, because they are mostly tied to news outlets, they don't always follow the

09:00.560 --> 09:01.720
Creative Commons license.

09:01.720 --> 09:06.920
So everything that we have built to create a shared space, like a public digital space

09:06.920 --> 09:11.600
for people, was not going to work with professional fact checkers.

09:11.600 --> 09:18.600
So we understood that, we pivoted, but we kept the same model, the same values and we

09:20.080 --> 09:27.080
went forward and launched a platform with a few people, like 15 volunteers.

09:27.640 --> 09:34.640
So in the platform, we created a process where we would listen to the debates during

09:36.600 --> 09:40.600
the Brazilian elections and do live fact checking.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.760
And it was good.

09:42.760 --> 09:47.720
So this is just a screenshot of some of the parts of the functionality.

09:47.720 --> 09:52.640
So here, if you have something highlighted, it means that it was fact-checked by someone

09:52.640 --> 09:56.000
and the experiment was very good.

09:56.080 --> 10:02.240
Very small as well, because if you look into our views, you're going to see that we only

10:02.240 --> 10:04.320
have like a thousand views.

10:04.320 --> 10:11.320
But the impressions from the people and what we were able to achieve was a good data to

10:11.520 --> 10:14.840
proceed forward.

10:14.840 --> 10:21.840
But because this is a very small project, it's a very small organization, we were dreaming

10:22.160 --> 10:29.160
big for a presidential election, trying to do an impact and of course, the stretch goes

10:29.200 --> 10:35.700
there, but what we learned is there is a use case, we can do that, but we need to begin

10:35.700 --> 10:36.760
small.

10:36.760 --> 10:42.960
So we took a step back and looked into what we can really do with our resourcing.

10:42.960 --> 10:49.400
And from that, we decided that we would have three product pilers, the fact checker productivity,

10:49.400 --> 10:53.880
reduce to credible information and reduce obstacles to product.

10:53.880 --> 11:00.880
So talking about the last one first, because we were very small, it doesn't work like

11:04.120 --> 11:06.800
our reference, which is Wikipedia, it doesn't work like that.

11:06.800 --> 11:12.400
You cannot just go anonymously and do a fact-checking, you cannot go and create an account and start

11:12.400 --> 11:16.840
doing it because we don't have a governance model or we didn't have at the time.

11:17.120 --> 11:21.240
We didn't have a governance model, we had a lot of obstacles, so we put obstacles on

11:21.240 --> 11:28.000
purpose so we could only test with a few people and understand what we need to do.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.680
And then we need to now remove those obstacles because now we are becoming more confident

11:34.680 --> 11:39.320
that now this can be used by everyone and we are going to have a procedure, a code of

11:39.320 --> 11:43.360
conduct and a governance model that will help.

11:43.400 --> 11:48.520
Access to credible information is the one that we are not focused too much right now

11:48.520 --> 11:54.160
because we believe that from the model that we have plus the productivity, we are going

11:54.160 --> 12:00.360
to create the credible information, but access to it is a little bit different.

12:00.360 --> 12:05.000
So we need to be able to make sure that the audiences that we serve are actually being

12:05.000 --> 12:12.000
able to access this and they can access the platform, we also provide goods SEO using

12:13.000 --> 12:20.000
the claim review schema and to be able to be searchable without people having to go

12:20.720 --> 12:27.720
to the platform. However, in Brazil we have a lot of people that, so there is an inequality

12:30.520 --> 12:37.520
or disparity of resources in Brazil that includes internet access in a sense that people can

12:38.120 --> 12:44.620
have data plans that can only work with WhatsApp but they cannot access internet. They can access

12:44.620 --> 12:51.620
Instagram but they cannot access Wikipedia. So the access level is a total different

12:51.800 --> 12:58.800
gain that we are still studying how we are going to approach, but because these are not

12:59.800 --> 13:04.960
our focus we should not lose sight as well, so that's why it's a pilot. And the productivity

13:04.960 --> 13:11.600
was because of an opportunity that we had because in 2023 we started a partnership with

13:11.600 --> 13:16.560
the University of the State of São Paulo which I actually came from and did my bachelor

13:16.560 --> 13:23.560
there and we had four interns and this is the other co-founder, our SEO, I like to call

13:25.640 --> 13:32.640
her my president and these four students were our focus group, we had a group of students

13:35.040 --> 13:41.040
in a sense that they are very fresh like first year journalists they know nothing about life

13:41.040 --> 13:48.040
more or less, maybe, I don't know, maybe they can learn from Tik Tok now but the idea is

13:48.520 --> 13:55.360
that they should have no knowledge at all and be just willing to work on. And we had

13:55.360 --> 14:02.360
a very smooth process and it was very refreshing because they finished four months of internship

14:03.360 --> 14:10.360
having the same level of productivity than news outlets when we were delivering fact-checking

14:11.280 --> 14:18.280
material. So of course different levels of comparison but in any way as I mentioned the

14:19.280 --> 14:25.440
platform was launched a while ago this 2022 is when we did the experiments with the debates

14:25.520 --> 14:32.520
and then we see that at least from the platform we are increasing the engagement of the functionality

14:34.400 --> 14:40.900
so we still have pretty much the same unique visitors but now people are using the platform

14:40.900 --> 14:47.900
more because now we actually have productivity for the team. So these are just a few screenshots

14:48.200 --> 14:55.200
of the platform, the code is in GitHub and you can access the link in the end of the

14:55.440 --> 15:02.440
presentation. And so this is an example of a fact-checking report that is available after

15:02.520 --> 15:09.520
the fact and as I mentioned so we focus a lot on the productivity of the fact-checkers

15:12.640 --> 15:19.640
so we started putting in place tools that would be tied to a specific workflow which

15:20.040 --> 15:26.520
is flexible. The way technically speaking we are using state machines here to control

15:26.520 --> 15:32.280
everything and we adjusted the processes and adding different steps depending on how we

15:32.280 --> 15:39.280
learned with the team. And the idea is to have a visibility of the productivity and

15:39.320 --> 15:46.320
also be able to collect data and see is this actually improving because once we, if we

15:46.600 --> 15:53.600
actually go, if we actually reach the goal that I mentioned before like 35,000 people

15:53.600 --> 16:00.600
checking facts in Brazil it's going to be a very different thing to administrate and

16:03.200 --> 16:10.200
make sure it runs smoothly. So yeah, this is I think that the learns. A few things that

16:11.200 --> 16:18.200
I think I would like to mention from the experiment, it was in Brazil the open source community

16:24.320 --> 16:31.320
is very spread, not so much well organized so the whole period of creating the software,

16:31.320 --> 16:38.320
trying to test the software only captured six volunteers like actively working on it

16:38.320 --> 16:45.320
which it looks like well this is actually pretty good but I forced most of my friends

16:46.400 --> 16:53.400
to actually go there and hey come on you know how to QA things, can you help me QA this,

16:53.720 --> 17:00.720
you are a DevOps engineer, can you create a pipeline to me so this was kind of a best

17:02.760 --> 17:09.760
effort from a community but after all of this what happened was that a lot of entry-level

17:11.320 --> 17:17.320
engineers were starting to looking for something to work on and they were, because we had

17:17.320 --> 17:22.320
partnerships with universities we started having people just coming in and they were

17:23.320 --> 17:29.320
trying to learn with the software which was a very good experience and something that

17:29.320 --> 17:35.320
I would like to explore moving forward it requires more management on the technical

17:35.320 --> 17:42.320
side being able to actually provide good feedback to them but it has, we now have like two or

17:43.800 --> 17:50.800
three active volunteers that they are 20 years old and just learn how to code and now they

17:50.960 --> 17:57.960
actually provide good development for the platform of course there is a skill to consider

17:59.960 --> 18:06.960
but so yeah there was this challenge so the time frame when I look to this project like

18:06.960 --> 18:12.760
five years is a lot for the stage that we are at but there were multiple factors there

18:12.760 --> 18:19.760
like it's a product for a very specific area it's a problem that no one solves yet and

18:19.840 --> 18:26.840
the only way that I see moving forward is doubling down the educational effort for the

18:26.840 --> 18:33.840
actual goal which is being able to provide credible information and stop the spreading

18:37.680 --> 18:42.400
of misinformation there is no other way around there is no other software there is no AI

18:42.400 --> 18:48.720
there is nothing that can help other than having humans understanding what they are reading

18:49.560 --> 18:56.560
and being able to have something that is accessible so I also put here multi-generational

18:57.720 --> 19:04.720
because in Brazil the disparity on misinformation spread is based on age as well so the older

19:08.120 --> 19:15.120
you are the bigger the chance to be a victim of misinformation and what we are also going

19:16.120 --> 19:23.120
to be looking at the general TV AI so and I write here with all the truth in my heart

19:25.920 --> 19:32.120
that I have no clue what we are going to do about it and the reason that I put it here

19:32.120 --> 19:36.720
is because it's not that we need to use the general TV AI but we need to defend against

19:36.720 --> 19:43.720
it which is I think very different perspective to look at of course maybe we need to put

19:45.120 --> 19:52.120
it here and make pieces with the devil who is the same tools to combat at the same level

19:52.280 --> 19:58.800
but the concerns are different because we are already seeing on multiple elections around

19:58.800 --> 20:05.800
the world the usage of deep fakes and general TV AI to manipulate public speech and so this

20:06.080 --> 20:13.080
is going to be a very difficult thing to do however because we are losing the battle

20:16.080 --> 20:23.080
we need to consider and that's it the code is open source it works specifically for an

20:27.360 --> 20:34.360
audience in Brazil it has been tailor suited for that but because since the beginning we

20:35.360 --> 20:42.360
were concerned about having this for multiple audiences so it allows internationalization

20:43.240 --> 20:50.240
the code is the reason that so the stack that we chose and one of the things so the stack

20:52.440 --> 20:59.440
we chose was no JS and React because the ability to find more people to join the effort but

21:00.320 --> 21:07.320
that of course we are now considering if it makes sense to keep the same stack or rewrite

21:07.840 --> 21:14.520
some of the stuff because if we want to be lean and optimize for some use cases we might

21:14.520 --> 21:21.520
also consider performance and other things that right now the platform doesn't provide

21:22.800 --> 21:27.960
and I forgot to mention something very important everything that we do is integrated with Wicked

21:27.960 --> 21:34.960
data right now and we have efforts to integrate with the whole public data infrastructure

21:38.040 --> 21:44.640
the idea is that we only have what it needs to be done for fact checking but information

21:44.640 --> 21:51.640
about personality more information on Wikipedia all of that should be included and integrated

21:52.520 --> 21:59.020
with the ecosystem and in the end we encourage other people to build their own communities

21:59.020 --> 22:05.220
and be part of the movement fork and change toss it off test the same things that we did

22:05.220 --> 22:12.220
I think that because it's something very very important and it's going to change a lot

22:13.240 --> 22:20.240
in the next few years I believe that we should double down the effort as much as we can that's

22:20.880 --> 22:27.880
it it was supposed to be a gift but it's a PDF so thank you thank you very much for

22:27.880 --> 22:34.880
the attention thank you Matheus any question?

22:39.880 --> 22:45.440
Hello so I was looking at the website and I see the personalities and the declarations

22:45.440 --> 22:49.960
and I see the reviewers but then how do you define or who puts the new declarations in

22:49.960 --> 22:52.520
for the fact checkers to really check it?

22:52.520 --> 22:57.880
Yeah so one of the things that we learned from the procedure of the fact checking is

22:57.880 --> 23:04.880
that monitoring has a specific operational guideline so one example that a fact checker

23:05.720 --> 23:12.240
might find to is that they receive this information but they look into how is this happening on

23:12.240 --> 23:19.240
Twitter X how is this being spread into Facebook how is this being spread on WhatsApp is this

23:19.240 --> 23:26.040
a big effort does it make sense to to actually check because there is one thing which is

23:26.040 --> 23:33.040
called the strategic silence because if someone checks it makes more public and it spreads

23:33.040 --> 23:40.040
more so the the decision on what to put in there is for the volunteers that have been

23:40.680 --> 23:47.680
have the capability to operate the platform so right now in order to operate the platform

23:47.680 --> 23:54.680
you need to go over the training understand how our code of conduct works sign that you

23:54.880 --> 24:00.320
understand and you are going to vouch for it and once you understand the whole process

24:00.320 --> 24:04.040
then you are able to operate the platform and you will be you will be responsible for monitoring

24:04.040 --> 24:11.040
so these volunteers are the ones that also select what is putting there but we receive

24:12.040 --> 24:19.040
we receive suggestions from community in Brazil from people that follow us and we use that

24:20.040 --> 24:26.560
into consideration to decide on if we are going to put on the platform or not and because

24:26.560 --> 24:32.000
it's a small group it's going to be small data now but the idea is to streamline this

24:32.000 --> 24:39.000
process and grow and possibly monitoring will be we will need to evolve based on on on

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
that does that make sense thank you it's the last one from the UK we have a few fact checking

24:49.200 --> 24:55.560
organizations there do you connect or are you intending to connect with other similar

24:55.640 --> 25:02.640
organizations from the world yeah so we did when I talked about being part of the global

25:05.720 --> 25:12.280
fact nine which is part of the the international fact checking network we learned a lot and

25:12.280 --> 25:19.280
met a lot of the the I think full fact is one the biggest one and one that we get in

25:20.280 --> 25:27.280
touch we got in touch and now we are in the process of being part in part of this network

25:27.280 --> 25:32.960
there's a lot of criteria it's if we do it we are going to be the first open project

25:32.960 --> 25:39.960
that actually enters so we are having some trouble to actually match on some of the criteria

25:39.960 --> 25:46.960
that they ask but we can we have some connections with India we have some connections with the

25:50.200 --> 25:57.200
Latin America network as well and recently we joined the the the network that is only

26:00.160 --> 26:06.440
on Brazil so every out Nils out in Brazil are also part of this network and we are connecting

26:06.440 --> 26:13.440
with them as well yeah we need that okay thank you other questions no

26:20.280 --> 26:27.280
okay thank you very much and well that was the collaboration they've room for 224 so

26:29.880 --> 26:31.880
thank you for staying until the end
