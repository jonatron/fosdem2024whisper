Hello. Good morning, everyone. I'm using the mic for the transmission, but basically,

00:15.400 --> 00:22.480
we don't need a sound here. So, my name is Paulo. I'm from Brazil. And this is the second

00:22.480 --> 00:32.080
time you have a translation's Dev Room here at Fosden. So, nice to have you here. Welcome

00:32.080 --> 00:37.920
to the translation's Dev Room. I hope you have a nice morning with all the talks. We

00:37.920 --> 00:44.640
will have six talks today. And so, basically, I'm sitting there. If you need something,

00:44.640 --> 00:51.800
if you have some questions, I can help with that. We will start today with Cecilia. Talk

00:51.800 --> 01:01.120
about some translations. And during this morning, we have one talk after the other. And we have

01:01.120 --> 01:09.160
some time between one talk and another, with five minutes to change the speaker here. So,

01:09.160 --> 01:17.240
that's it. I have contributed to Debian with translation. I helped Debian to translate

01:17.880 --> 01:24.200
from English to Portuguese because I'm from Brazil, as I said. So, this is a nice idea. I have

01:24.200 --> 01:32.840
a translation's Room as we can talk about this topic here. Welcome, everybody. And let's start

01:32.840 --> 01:34.360
with Cecilia. Thank you.
