00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Okay, so next up we have Emily O'Mear with Project Websites that don't suck.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.880
Okay, hi everyone.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.520
Thank you for coming to the talk.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.680
I'm going to talk about Project Websites that don't suck, at least from a content perspective.

00:28.680 --> 00:33.640
So my specialty is the words that you put on the website, not how it looks, as you will

00:33.640 --> 00:39.160
discover from my slides, which honestly kind of suck from a design perspective.

00:39.160 --> 00:44.440
But anyway, the words on your website, the content really matter, and a lot of projects

00:44.440 --> 00:45.560
get this wrong.

00:45.560 --> 00:49.120
So that's what I'm going to talk about.

00:49.120 --> 00:52.400
Before I dive in too much, a little tiny bit about me.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.120
I am a positioning consultant, and I work with open source startups.

00:56.120 --> 01:01.280
And what this means is that a lot of the things that are relevant to positioning is

01:01.280 --> 01:06.480
about determining what kind of content, what ideas you need to get across on your website.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.040
The first thing, once you've determined your positioning, whether we're talking about something

01:10.040 --> 01:14.040
that's commercial or an open source project, the first thing you want to do is put that

01:14.040 --> 01:18.800
information or translate that information into something you're going to put on your website.

01:18.800 --> 01:22.040
I also host a podcast that's called The Business of Open Source.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.040
So there you go.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.440
Now you know a little bit about me.

01:25.440 --> 01:29.640
And now let's talk a little bit about the goal of a homepage.

01:29.640 --> 01:33.080
And I'm going to focus most of this talk on the homepage, because honestly that's the

01:33.080 --> 01:35.760
most important part of your website.

01:35.760 --> 01:42.080
The goal of a homepage is to help people understand very quickly what your project does and whether

01:42.080 --> 01:48.360
or not this project is worth investing another five minutes or another 30 minutes of their

01:48.360 --> 01:54.000
time into figuring out if this project is going to work for their needs or not.

01:54.040 --> 01:59.840
People make these decisions like they come to your website, they look at it for 20 seconds,

01:59.840 --> 02:03.360
and then they're like, okay, am I going to invest another five minutes in this?

02:03.360 --> 02:06.960
You want people to accurately self-select both in and out.

02:06.960 --> 02:11.440
So if you have somebody come to your website, stay on it for 20 seconds and be like, oh,

02:11.440 --> 02:16.640
this is not for me because it's not appropriate for whatever my use case is, and they go away.

02:16.640 --> 02:22.840
This is a success, provided that they actually made an accurate evaluation of the fact that

02:22.880 --> 02:25.520
this is not an appropriate fit for them.

02:25.520 --> 02:29.120
There's a third thing that I think is really important to call out here, which is that

02:29.120 --> 02:35.600
a good website that communicates clearly what your project does, and it doesn't have any

02:35.600 --> 02:39.200
major screw-ups in terms of content, is going to improve your credibility.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.840
It makes you look like you know what you're doing.

02:42.840 --> 02:48.600
So keeping in mind, these are the things that your homepage should do.

02:48.640 --> 02:51.680
A couple of random notes about homepages.

02:51.680 --> 02:57.880
A lot of people can get really caught up on bounce rates, and bounce rates are not a

02:57.880 --> 03:03.000
super great evaluation of whether or not your homepage sucks, because again, the goal is

03:03.000 --> 03:06.280
to repel people who are bad fits.

03:06.280 --> 03:11.600
When you repel a bad fit, you are doing them a favor because they did not have to invest

03:11.600 --> 03:17.640
five minutes or 30 minutes, or particularly in the case of open source projects, half

03:17.680 --> 03:22.720
of a day in order to discover that your project just doesn't work for them.

03:22.720 --> 03:28.720
You're also doing yourself a favor because these are dumb questions that don't get asked,

03:28.720 --> 03:32.000
or almost, I would say, off-topic discussions.

03:32.000 --> 03:36.080
We like to say there's no dumb questions, which is sort of true, but when you get a lot

03:36.080 --> 03:41.680
of questions that are clearly off-topic from what the goal of your project is in your community,

03:41.680 --> 03:47.200
this is a sign that you're not doing a good job of repelling bad fits.

03:47.240 --> 03:52.080
Moving beyond the homepage conversation, when you think about how people usually navigate

03:52.080 --> 03:58.040
through a website of a project, if your main audience is developers, which is not the case

03:58.040 --> 04:04.560
for every single open source project, usually they'll go directly to the docs from the homepage,

04:04.560 --> 04:09.040
and if there isn't a prominent docs link, the other really important page is your about

04:09.040 --> 04:10.040
page.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.080
I'm going to talk about about pages at the end of this talk.

04:13.320 --> 04:18.760
Okay, so let's talk about the anatomy of a homepage.

04:18.760 --> 04:23.960
The first thing that's really important that you want people to see as soon as they come

04:23.960 --> 04:28.360
onto your homepage before they scroll anywhere is your market category.

04:28.360 --> 04:31.320
What that means is basically how do you describe this project?

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
What is it?

04:32.320 --> 04:35.440
Usually, that's a noun, by the way.

04:35.440 --> 04:40.040
You want people to understand also why should anyone use this project, which is to say what's

04:40.120 --> 04:44.720
the outcome that somebody can expect from using this project.

04:44.720 --> 04:49.680
You need to make it really clear who is an ideal fit and who is a bad fit.

04:49.680 --> 04:55.640
Again, you want to make it as easy as possible for people to understand which bucket they

04:55.640 --> 04:56.640
fit into.

04:56.640 --> 05:02.920
Then last, absolutely not least, is what differentiated value do you provide?

05:02.920 --> 05:08.000
In any market category, you're going to have a number of different options.

05:08.040 --> 05:11.840
Every project has competitors that are other projects.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.360
They have competitors that are closed source software.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.240
They have competitors that are the status quo.

05:17.240 --> 05:22.720
You want to communicate why somebody should use this particular project.

05:22.720 --> 05:28.080
What is unique about it in terms of what they're going to get as an outcome?

05:28.080 --> 05:31.960
Those are the really important things to communicate in a homepage.

05:31.960 --> 05:36.000
Let me give a little bit of a couple of examples.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.760
This is the homepage from OpenTelemetry.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.240
What is OpenTelemetry?

05:40.240 --> 05:41.920
Boom, it's obvious.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.040
It's telemetry.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.040
Success right there.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.320
We understand what this project is all about.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.520
What kind of telemetry is it?

05:50.520 --> 05:53.640
High quality, ubiquitous, and portable.

05:53.640 --> 06:00.960
Ideally, those three adjectives also describe the differentiation of what makes OpenTelemetry

06:00.960 --> 06:03.560
different from all the other options.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.240
Why should I use it?

06:07.240 --> 06:08.240
What am I going to get out?

06:08.240 --> 06:11.960
What's the outcome that I would get from using OpenTelemetry?

06:11.960 --> 06:13.640
Because I want observability.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.120
I want effective observability.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.360
I really like this except for the word effective.

06:19.360 --> 06:23.800
The reason is ideally when you're describing the outcome that somebody is going to get,

06:23.800 --> 06:29.560
you are describing it in a way that makes it clear who is a good fit and who is not

06:29.560 --> 06:31.840
a good fit.

06:31.840 --> 06:35.760
Effective is the kind of word that nobody is going to self-select out of.

06:35.760 --> 06:41.400
Nobody is like, yes, this is not going to, or yes, I'm not looking for effective observability.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.480
I'm looking for ineffective observability.

06:44.480 --> 06:47.040
Nobody is going to say that.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.480
What they could say, for example, is observability at scale.

06:50.480 --> 06:54.680
There's going to be some people in that case who would say, I don't operate at scale.

06:54.680 --> 07:03.080
I have relatively small needs, small scale, so I don't need something that's built for

07:03.080 --> 07:04.760
scale.

07:04.760 --> 07:09.600
Keeping in mind, again, that idea of repelling bad fits.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.320
Who is this for?

07:12.320 --> 07:14.000
Here's a couple of examples.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.640
The first one is from the Go website.

07:16.640 --> 07:18.440
It's great for teams.

07:18.440 --> 07:23.160
That is an indication that if you are not a team, you're not an ideal fit and that you're

07:23.160 --> 07:26.520
not who this programming language is built for.

07:26.520 --> 07:30.120
The second example is actually my favorite one.

07:30.120 --> 07:35.840
This is from Glue, which is maintained by solo.io.

07:35.840 --> 07:40.200
You can see how they're described as networking for applications, not infrastructure.

07:40.200 --> 07:45.520
If you come to their website and you're looking for a networking solution for infrastructure,

07:45.520 --> 07:50.920
you go away.

07:51.040 --> 07:55.880
This is from the Apache Cassandra website.

07:55.880 --> 08:01.200
You notice that in that first bit, they're describing what the heck Cassandra is.

08:01.200 --> 08:05.040
They have three differentiated values here.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.440
Runs in hybrid environments.

08:06.440 --> 08:13.240
It's very fault tolerant and it's reliable and stable.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.360
The good thing about that is it's really clear.

08:16.360 --> 08:19.680
The other good thing about it is there's three things.

08:19.720 --> 08:23.600
The bad thing about this website that you do not see on my slide is that if you scroll

08:23.600 --> 08:25.560
down, there's another row.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.120
If you scroll down, there's another row.

08:27.120 --> 08:30.200
They actually chose nine differentiated values.

08:30.200 --> 08:35.560
The problem is we're actually writing a website for humans and not robots.

08:35.560 --> 08:40.840
Websites also have robot visitors, but you don't care about them for this part of the

08:40.840 --> 08:42.720
exercise.

08:42.720 --> 08:46.200
Humans tend to have trouble remembering nine things.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.080
Three or four is where we max out.

08:49.120 --> 08:56.600
You want to choose the three, maybe four maximum, but ideally three things that really make

08:56.600 --> 09:00.240
your project unique and highlight them on your website.

09:00.240 --> 09:05.400
All that other stuff, you can put it somewhere in a comparison chart that has Xs and checks

09:05.400 --> 09:06.440
on it.

09:06.440 --> 09:11.480
You can make it discoverable on a project page or a use case page, but don't put it

09:11.480 --> 09:17.440
on your homepage because your homepage is really for focusing on making people understand

09:17.480 --> 09:22.040
really quickly and getting the things that people are going to be able to stick in people's

09:22.040 --> 09:23.040
heads.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.320
All right.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.200
Now, let's talk about about pages.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.840
I mentioned that about pages are one of the most important pages on a website.

09:32.840 --> 09:37.280
Quite frankly, most of them are garbage and the ones that are not garbage usually don't

09:37.280 --> 09:39.080
exist.

09:39.080 --> 09:43.800
The reason that I say that they're garbage is, first of all, they'll say things like,

09:43.800 --> 09:45.520
we believe in kindness.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.520
Great.

09:46.600 --> 09:47.880
Not that everyone believes in kindness.

09:47.880 --> 09:51.840
This does not make your project unique and it does not tell me anything about what outcome

09:51.840 --> 09:52.840
I'm going to expect.

09:52.840 --> 09:55.840
It doesn't build your credibility either.

09:55.840 --> 10:00.760
Nobody is going to self-select out of we believe in kindness.

10:00.760 --> 10:06.520
Or a lot of about pages are not human.

10:06.520 --> 10:11.040
This can be especially the case when there's a solo maintainer of a project that doesn't

10:11.040 --> 10:16.200
want to appear like they're a solo maintainer or wants to appear bigger than they are.

10:16.200 --> 10:22.520
But about pages are a place to talk about the team behind this project, the humans.

10:22.520 --> 10:27.720
They're a place to talk about your point of view, why you thought that this project was

10:27.720 --> 10:31.640
worth creating in the first place.

10:31.640 --> 10:35.680
And they're also a place to build credibility.

10:35.680 --> 10:39.080
Credibility in terms of showing what sort of credentials you have.

10:39.080 --> 10:45.080
I took this example from a company called TestifySec.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.640
They build a couple of open source projects, one of them is called Witness, the other one

10:48.640 --> 10:50.800
is Archivista.

10:50.800 --> 10:55.920
And you notice on their website they talk about how their team has contributed to all

10:55.920 --> 11:01.880
these publications that are about software supply chain security.

11:01.880 --> 11:06.440
Basically they're taking the opportunity to really showcase why you should trust them,

11:06.440 --> 11:13.280
why you should trust their team with your software supply chain security.

11:13.360 --> 11:17.920
If you scroll down on their website, in fact you will see the human beings that are on

11:17.920 --> 11:18.920
the team.

11:18.920 --> 11:25.400
That is really important about pages are really about being human.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.440
Last thing, it is unfortunate that I have to mention this, but it is really important,

11:29.440 --> 11:33.000
don't screw up the basics.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.680
You're probably not an English major, still use consistent capitalization, try not to

11:39.680 --> 11:46.960
have really glaring punctuation errors, really glaring grammar errors.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.800
I see this all the time.

11:48.800 --> 11:56.000
And the thing, the way that it comes off to visitors is that if you're not careful enough

11:56.000 --> 12:01.680
to get these sort of basics right on your website, are you getting it right in your project?

12:01.680 --> 12:04.000
Are you getting the details right in your project?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.600
It just looks sort of unprofessional.

12:06.600 --> 12:09.000
You should get someone to proofread your website.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.840
And if your website isn't a language that you do not speak natively, try to get a native

12:12.840 --> 12:16.400
speaker of that language to proofread your website too.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.240
Just so you can make sure that you're actually getting your point across that you're not

12:20.240 --> 12:22.720
screwing up the basics.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.360
Okay.

12:25.360 --> 12:30.000
So I'm sure everyone is out here thinking like, oh no, does my website suck?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.760
How do I figure out if my website sucks?

12:32.760 --> 12:35.160
It's really hard to tell from just metrics.

12:35.160 --> 12:39.640
Because like I said, a bounce rate is, it could mean that you're repelling a bunch of

12:39.640 --> 12:42.200
bad fits and that's okay.

12:42.200 --> 12:48.080
What you can do to determine if your website sucks is have conversations with people or

12:48.080 --> 12:51.160
even ask people like in a Slack or a Discord group.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.400
This doesn't require massive interviews.

12:53.400 --> 12:57.160
It doesn't have to be super qualitative interviews.

12:57.160 --> 13:01.920
Just asking questions like, when you came to our homepage, did you understand what our

13:01.920 --> 13:03.600
project was?

13:03.600 --> 13:09.080
How well did your expectations that were set by visiting our website match your experience

13:09.080 --> 13:13.480
of actually using our project once you got up and running?

13:13.480 --> 13:14.480
Okay.

13:14.480 --> 13:20.000
So I'm going to do a quick recap to remind everybody what I've talked about.

13:20.000 --> 13:25.600
Websites exist to help people self-select in or self-select out further evaluation of your

13:25.600 --> 13:26.600
project.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.600
They're making that decision.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.520
Am I going to invest another five minutes?

13:30.520 --> 13:33.560
Is this worth like reading through the docs?

13:33.560 --> 13:38.600
You want people to understand your project quickly and you do not want to neglect your

13:38.600 --> 13:42.520
about page and you don't want to get the basics wrong either.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.520
Okay.

13:43.520 --> 13:45.360
So that's about it.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.600
I will be outside if you want to chat.

13:47.600 --> 13:53.800
If you have questions, if you want an e-book that is about positioning for free open source

13:53.800 --> 13:57.360
projects, you can use a QR code to get it.

13:57.360 --> 14:02.480
And positioning is if you do not know what the differentiated value of your project is,

14:02.480 --> 14:07.800
if that's a question you cannot answer, you need to figure that out before you start thinking

14:07.800 --> 14:09.360
about what goes on your website.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.360
Anyway, I'm Emily O'Mear and thank you so much.
