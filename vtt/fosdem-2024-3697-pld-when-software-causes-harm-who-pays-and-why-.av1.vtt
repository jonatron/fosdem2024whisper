00:00.000 --> 00:12.080
Okay, so I'll advance the next lightning talk, which is about the second big legislative

00:12.080 --> 00:19.000
effort that went on during the past, well, couple of years, really, smiling at one of

00:19.000 --> 00:23.340
the people that worked on it in the European Commission, which is the Product Liability

00:23.340 --> 00:28.960
Directive. And with us today is Rob Carolina, who is the General Counsel for ISC, Makers

00:28.960 --> 00:38.280
of Bind, who's going to give you an introduction into product liability in five minutes, which

00:38.280 --> 00:39.280
is...

00:39.280 --> 00:43.440
So, take it away for Rob.

00:43.440 --> 00:48.280
Martin's original idea was do the product liability thing in three minutes, and then

00:48.280 --> 00:52.400
you can do some other stuff for two.

00:52.400 --> 01:01.880
So what I'm doing here is giving you a reading test, and I'm trying to condense down to two

01:01.880 --> 01:13.360
and a half minutes a topic that we spend about 40 to 60 hours on in law school.

01:13.360 --> 01:16.240
So the reason that I'm giving you this reading test is because I want you to be familiar

01:16.240 --> 01:20.760
with this fact pattern. I'm going to tell the story in reverse from how I usually do

01:20.760 --> 01:27.000
it. This is a story about an automated car that hits a pedestrian in Ireland, Pat

01:27.000 --> 01:34.920
Victim. That car has on board a piece of software called Bravo Drive, which has included within

01:34.920 --> 01:41.120
it a piece of software called Open Sesame. The car was imported by Exotic Imports. The

01:41.120 --> 01:46.040
car was manufactured by Einstein Motors in California. Einstein Motors got Bravo Drive

01:46.040 --> 01:51.360
software from Bravo Bits BV in the Netherlands, and Bravo Bits VB got Open Source, Open Sesame

01:51.360 --> 02:03.760
from Firefly APS in Denmark. Terry Dastardly hacked into the automobile because of a weakness

02:03.760 --> 02:11.640
in the authentication package, provided a few inputs. And the next thing you have is

02:11.640 --> 02:18.360
a car that runs over Pat Victim in Ireland. Don't worry about Terry Dastardly. He dies

02:18.360 --> 02:23.880
or she dies in a horrible paragliding accident or without money or is run over by a bus.

02:23.880 --> 02:29.120
Just take them out of the equation. The question that product liability seeks to answer is,

02:29.120 --> 02:35.520
in a situation like this when we have an injured victim like Pat Victim, who pays for their

02:35.520 --> 02:43.400
injuries. Two slides that look like this. This slide is designed to teach you the difference

02:43.400 --> 02:50.160
between two different legal theories on how you sue people who manufacture things. The

02:50.160 --> 02:55.320
left-hand side is the law of negligence, at least as it's practiced in common law countries.

02:55.320 --> 03:01.680
I would not come to a civil law country and teach people about the Napoleonic Code. However,

03:01.680 --> 03:05.800
I will talk to you a little bit about common law and suggest that the two are not worlds

03:05.800 --> 03:12.040
apart. As you can see from the chart, when our victim tries to sue all these various

03:12.040 --> 03:18.040
peoples, Johnson, exotic imports, Einstein, Bravabits or whatever, Victim is in a little

03:18.040 --> 03:26.280
bit of difficulty because the people who manufactured and imported the car did everything reasonably.

03:26.280 --> 03:31.200
They selected good components. They selected trustworthy producers of things. They did

03:31.200 --> 03:40.120
not act rashly. Whereas the error in the situation came from a software vendor called Firefly

03:40.120 --> 03:47.800
and maybe, just maybe we could establish that they owed what's called a duty of care to

03:47.800 --> 03:52.260
the victim. If someone like Pat Victim was a foreseeable victim when someone wrote this

03:52.260 --> 03:56.980
authentication package in Denmark, but as you can see, it's going to be difficult to

03:56.980 --> 04:02.940
establish that. Now, in the reading test that I gave you one slide ago, I did put in there

04:02.940 --> 04:09.460
that the folks at Firefly, they had a bad week. The problem with their package was because

04:09.460 --> 04:15.340
someone made a coding error and the QA people were kind of asleep that week because we're

04:15.340 --> 04:19.220
going to get that in a forensics report from an expert who's going to come to trial. The

04:19.220 --> 04:23.420
right hand side of this slide is designed to teach you a different area of law that

04:23.420 --> 04:28.460
was adopted in the U.S. in the 1960s and in Europe in 1985, which says what do we do in

04:28.460 --> 04:35.860
situations like this where everybody acts reasonably but Pat Victim still has injuries?

04:35.860 --> 04:42.100
And the answer is we don't look for people who did things unreasonably. We don't care

04:42.100 --> 04:49.580
how careful they were, how cautious they were. We look for people who manufactured and put

04:49.580 --> 05:00.060
into circulation a dangerous product. We tried really hard to make it safe. It doesn't matter.

05:00.060 --> 05:07.100
If it's dangerous, it's called no fault liability for this reason. And as you can see, because

05:07.100 --> 05:10.780
the automobile manufacturer and the importer, and this is the law as it exists today in

05:10.820 --> 05:16.900
Europe under the 1985 directive, because they were dealing with a product that is dangerous,

05:16.900 --> 05:21.220
they will be strictly liable, but the software vendors will not because software has not been

05:21.220 --> 05:29.060
deemed to be a product. Enter the PLD, which changes things on the right hand side of this chart.

05:29.060 --> 05:38.140
And as you can see, what happens here, one of the design characteristics of the PLD, and the

05:38.780 --> 05:43.740
origin of these slides, by the way, was I did a talk at Etsy five years ago, which said this is

05:43.740 --> 05:49.420
coming. So I keep using the same slides for five years, and they're still accurate, is that we

05:49.420 --> 05:57.820
recharacterize software as a product, and now we can attribute liability to Firefly because they

05:57.820 --> 06:05.220
distributed a dangerous product, a piece of authentication software that had been, that

06:05.260 --> 06:12.460
didn't work properly. We'll just leave it at that for right now. And since we're running a few

06:12.460 --> 06:16.700
minutes ahead, I have one last slide that I'll show you, and I'm just going to hold on this for

06:16.700 --> 06:18.020
60 seconds while you read it.

06:35.220 --> 06:53.780
If you're looking for a copy of this, I just posted it half an hour ago on X and on LinkedIn.

06:53.780 --> 07:07.380
So whatever the answer is, depends on what questions we're asking. I know a question I'm

07:07.380 --> 07:12.860
asking, I'm the guy on the left. It appears the questions on the right were the questions asked

07:12.860 --> 07:18.980
by the European Commission. And that's how we have the answers that we're talking about today. Thank

07:18.980 --> 07:28.060
you. Thank you, Rob.
