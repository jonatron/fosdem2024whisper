00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Hello, hello.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
You can take that one.

00:13.000 --> 00:18.000
Hello everyone and welcome to the 2024 legal and policy dev room.

00:18.000 --> 00:25.000
It's the 12th annual.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.000
We're really glad you're here. We've got a short program, but it's packed with exciting content.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
I'm excited to hear what people say.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
We're going to probably just, do we say our names real quick?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
Yeah, go ahead.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Hello, I'm Tom Marble and thank you so much for coming.

00:42.000 --> 00:49.000
Tom is the founder of the dev room. I'm Bradley Kuhn, one of the co-organizers.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
I'm Matthias Kirchner, also one of the co-organizers.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.000
I'm Alexander Sander from the FSFE also co-organizer.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
And I'm Karen Saylor.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
And I'm on this panel. Without any further ado, shall we begin?

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
Hello everybody. It's cool that this room is so full again, but it's not a big surprise.

01:15.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm Marcus Falner and I'm going to be the host or moderator with this wonderful panel with Liam, Karen and Penny.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
And I'm pretty sure you already know what we're going to talk about.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
So here we are.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
Me, I'm Marcus. I'm an open source journalist.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I've been doing writings for Linux and open source for many, many years.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
And I have disclaimer. I was working also for Susie once.

01:41.000 --> 01:50.000
And actually today I was thinking which hoodie to wear because yesterday I got a CentOS hoodie at the CentOS Connect event.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
And I have a Susie hoodie, but I thought both of them wouldn't be appropriate.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
So I'm here without any advertisement.

01:57.000 --> 02:06.000
And on this panel, we're talking about Red Hat, CentOS and hopefully also the general move that at least I see.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
And I hope that others also see towards an old demon that is sort of waking up again.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
And that's the demon, as I call it, of open core.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
There was an open core summit and there is open core investment funds that invest into open source, but only if you're doing open core.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.000
And that all came to my interest as a journalist because I was writing articles about the topic last year.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
And then I found lots and lots of articles of a guy from England that I knew from the past.

02:35.000 --> 02:44.000
And this is already where I hand over sort of to the self introduction of my, our guests here.

02:44.000 --> 02:49.000
So I'm not starting with the ladies. I'm very sorry because I already mentioned Liam.

02:49.000 --> 02:55.000
And okay, I'm not just briefly, Liam, open source journalist at the register.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
Everybody knows Karen. She has already introduced her just a minute ago and from the free software conservancy.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
It's actually software freedom.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
Software freedom. I'm so bad at that. Sorry.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
The slide is wrong too.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
The slide is wrong. Oh, good.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yeah, the slide is wrong.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Oh, thanks for giving me an excuse.

03:12.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah. And it's Benny Vasquez from the board of directors and the chair of the board of directors of the Alma Linux OS Foundation.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
So I hand over to Liam, who actually is a very skilled and long time writer.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
And yeah, he, I even hired him when I was at Susie. I was team lead documentation.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.000
And so Liam, watch what you're saying. I'm not your boss anymore.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
So we have them.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Can we ask, can we ask you a question first?

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yes, please.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
Why did you choose such a controversial title?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Why did I choose such a controversial title?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh, you don't know, you don't know me that much.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm, yeah, I'm, I have quite a reputation in, in what I write.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
I often write technical things, but I also like doing some kind of investigative stuff.

03:58.000 --> 04:05.000
And so I have also some, some friends out there in the world of free or not so free on the open source software.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
The FSVE can tell you lots of stories.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
We've been working together a lot of times in doing research.

04:11.000 --> 04:23.000
So last time that was about data port phoenix, German, the story about a public institution being funded with lots and lots of millions for developing open source and never delivering anything in open source.

04:23.000 --> 04:38.000
Many years before I did lots of writings about the Luca app in Germany and an app, a tracking app for health services during the Corona epidemic, pandemic and similar things.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
So I'm kind of, yeah, I like to go where it hurts sometimes in journalism.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
I guess that's my reputation, isn't it?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Yeah.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
So Liam, you just take.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
I think we have one.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Hello.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Okay.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
As you like.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
So yes, hello.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
My name is Liam Proven.

04:56.000 --> 05:03.000
These days I write for the register, a UK and US IT news site.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
I'm the open source guy at the register these days.

05:06.000 --> 05:15.000
For the previous roughly eight years, I was working in the area of tech documentation.

05:15.000 --> 05:24.000
And before I went to work for the register, I worked for SUSE for about four years where for a while, Marcus here was my boss.

05:24.000 --> 05:31.000
And before that, a couple of jobs before that, I worked for a short time for Red Hat.

05:31.000 --> 05:41.000
I actually moved to the Czech Republic to work for Red Hat and did not pass my probation period with the company.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
I moved to a whole new country for this job.

05:45.000 --> 05:54.000
And as was recommended in the onboarding pack, I started a flame war on the company wide mailing list.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
This is a recommended way to get to know people in the company.

05:58.000 --> 06:06.000
Mine ran massively out of control and resulted in me being let go after just two months.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.000
I am not a big fan of Red Hat.

06:11.000 --> 06:17.000
Now, I've been using Linux for about 30 years now.

06:17.000 --> 06:23.000
And Red Hat Linux back in the 90s was one of the first distributions I used.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
I wrote quite a lot about it back in the day.

06:27.000 --> 06:39.000
I do not generally use any Red Hat products or services anymore, but bizarrely enough in the Red Hat CentOS source code,

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
I have found myself in a very strange position of defending the company and defending its actions.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
And I think I might be doing so here again today.

06:51.000 --> 07:02.000
Just for context, one of the articles I wrote, which Bradley kindly linked to from an SFC article analyzing this,

07:02.000 --> 07:11.000
I had at one point simultaneously a thread attacking me on hacker news for being an obvious Red Hat shill,

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
and they told me that I should quit my job and go and work for Red Hat Public Relations,

07:16.000 --> 07:24.000
while simultaneously another guy on Twitter backed by multiple Red Hatters was saying that I was an evil hostile troll

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
who obviously hated Red Hat, Linux, open source and everything it stood for, and I should be ashamed of myself.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
So when those came to a peak simultaneously, I just told them go and talk to each other and sort it out.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
But by the way, I'm not going to go and work for Red Hat because those guys fired me, so no, I don't have the option.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
So yeah, my position is a strange and conflicted one. But let's see.

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
Karen, you never worked for any distributor, did you? Did you work for Red Hat?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
No, I've never worked for it.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
Susie?

07:54.000 --> 08:03.000
No, no, my path goes straight from engineering school to law school to corporate law to nonprofits.

08:03.000 --> 08:08.000
So my perspective is really from the public interest of software.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
My interest in software freedom originates from the fact that I have a pacemaker defibrillator.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
I have a heart condition. That's actually quite common.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
I just, like, we found out as a society recently.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
It's really exciting, but I've been at a very high risk of suddenly dying, so I need this defibrillator.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
I can't see the source code in my own body.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I was shocked unnecessarily while pregnant.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.000
The whole thing is just wild, and it really makes you wake up and say,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
boy, I really care about what happens with my software.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I really care that we have control over it.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
I really care that we can take collective action.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
And so I'm at Software Freedom Conservancy as executive director.

08:40.000 --> 08:43.000
I am a lawyer, but I'm not your lawyer.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
I've never been Red Hat's lawyer.

08:46.000 --> 08:57.000
And I'll just say that everything from my analysis is just what's going to be good for the state of software.

08:57.000 --> 09:07.000
And that's why we also have Benny here on stage as one of the persons representing one of the entities affected by Red Hat's moves in the last years.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
Yeah, so I'm Benny. I work with the Amalenics OS Foundation.

09:13.000 --> 09:21.000
My path to this is through, shall we say, I started as part of the CentOS community.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
I was a user for many, many years.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
When I started using CentOS, I didn't know that Red Hat existed.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
It was just, I walked into a place where we were using CentOS, so that's what I knew.

09:32.000 --> 09:39.000
And the last 20-ish years have been a wild ride, shall we say.

09:39.000 --> 09:45.000
And I'm excited to be here because the perspective that we have is 100%.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
As users of CentOS, we needed a solution.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
So that's where we came from.

09:51.000 --> 09:57.000
I also had some points in my career where I got in contact with Red Hat.

09:57.000 --> 10:02.000
Both as a journalist and also with many, many people, of course.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
As I said yesterday, I was on the CentOS Summit and I talked to Red Hat.

10:06.000 --> 10:12.000
And I'm very happy that we have a panel here with such exquisite friends, I have to say.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.000
Because, believe it or not, the number of people that said, yes, yes, I want to be on that panel

10:17.000 --> 10:24.000
that agreed to me when I asked them, exceeds the size of this panel by double, I would say.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
So we had like, I have like six or seven people that said, yes, I would come and then they said,

10:28.000 --> 10:32.000
oh, we are sorry, but corporate and things you know.

10:32.000 --> 10:39.000
And so that's, it seems to be a very controversial topic if anybody had ever needed that proof, after all.

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
And controversial, controversial, there was one on this panel that I wanted, I have Liam, the journalist with him.

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
You made yourself kind of an expert in this topic because when I started writing about it,

10:53.000 --> 10:58.000
I found lots of your articles on the register and I read them and they sort of,

10:58.000 --> 11:03.000
they changed my mind, my attitude to the whole thing because at the beginning for me everything was clear.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Well, Reddit is doing something evil here and I need to write about it.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.000
And I wanted to find out the true facts and then I read your stuff and there seemed to be over the, since 2021,

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
when Reddit started or did the harsh moves, let's say against Centaurs,

11:17.000 --> 11:22.000
there has also been a change in the public opinion about what they're doing and why they are doing.

11:22.000 --> 11:28.000
So last sentence, yesterday I talked to people from Centaurs and they said, well, it's actually not against us,

11:28.000 --> 11:34.000
it's more against Oracle, this move, and or not against Alma, more against Rocky

11:34.000 --> 11:38.000
because those two entities are trying to make money out of Reddit code.

11:38.000 --> 11:46.000
So can you give us a short introduction about what happened and why in opinion what...

11:46.000 --> 11:52.000
Okay, so, well, okay, context setting first maybe.

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
I have been a journalist mostly freelance since about 1995,

11:59.000 --> 12:05.000
but I freelanced for the register for about 15 years before I joined them full time.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
So I've been there just over two years now.

12:07.000 --> 12:12.000
I have learned some very interesting things about people's reading skills.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
An awful lot of people are completely unable to skim.

12:19.000 --> 12:26.000
However, they don't know that they are completely unable to skim.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
So they will read a headline and have a look at an article and read a paragraph or two

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
and jump around a bit through the later bit.

12:33.000 --> 12:37.000
And they think they've got the gist and they move on.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
Now, gist is an important word here.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Amongst other things, I'm an English teacher and I used to be a professional English teacher.

12:44.000 --> 12:50.000
Scanning for gist is a key test of skill when you're reading in a foreign language or speaking in a foreign language.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.000
And it's something as a teacher, you look for people's ability to get gist.

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000
What I've discovered as a writer is an awful lot of people reading technical stuff online

12:59.000 --> 13:04.000
cannot extract the gist of a piece of text that they have read.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
So when I started hearing about Red Hat changing the terms of the license under which...

13:11.000 --> 13:16.000
The terms under which the Red Hat Enterprise Linux source code was distributed,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
a lot of people got very angry and started going,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
well, this contravenes the GPL.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
No, it doesn't.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
What it means is an awful lot of people feel entitled to talk about the GPL

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
and either they've never read it or they've read it and they didn't understand it.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
Because I get people every day for two and a half years who read stuff I wrote and didn't understand it.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
This is a really big problem and I'm willing to bet half the people in this room to pick a random number

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
will read stuff and not understand the gist of what they've read.

13:50.000 --> 13:58.000
The GPL says if you sell software that is based on open source code,

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
you have to provide the source code to the customers to whom you sold the software.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
And that's all.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
It does not say you have to give the software to the world.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
You have to give it to your customers and nobody else.

14:17.000 --> 14:25.000
That's a really big point of the GPL which I think most of the people getting angry about GPL infringement have not grasped.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
Secondly, not everything in a Linux distribution is GPL.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
There's GPL 2 and there's GPL 3 and there's MIT and there's X.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
There's loads of licenses in there and some of them are much more permissive.

14:35.000 --> 14:43.000
But Red Hat said the license to the REL source code means customers get the source code

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
and now only customers get the source code.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.000
But it's GPL source code.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
Once you get the source code, you can then do with it what you want.

14:54.000 --> 14:58.000
You can then put that source code on GitHub and give it to the world.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
That is fine.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
But Red Hat are then perfectly free to say, hey, we sold you the source code.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
We sold you the product.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
You got the source code.

15:08.000 --> 15:14.000
You have infringed your customer agreement by giving it to a million other people on the Internet.

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
So we're terminating your customer agreement.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
This is my basic understanding of the situation here.

15:21.000 --> 15:30.000
That they provide the source, still, yes, the version that is compiled into REL, but only to customers.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
It's still open source because customers get the source.

15:33.000 --> 15:39.000
However, customers are not free to share the source with anybody else and stay customers.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.000
And that's the critical difference.

15:43.000 --> 15:46.000
How does that affect CentOS?

15:46.000 --> 15:51.000
Can you briefly say what Red Hat did with CentOS?

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Was upstream downstream from REL before?

15:53.000 --> 16:00.000
There was CentOS stream and there was some article saying that CentOS stream, Red Hat kills CentOS stream.

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
No, Red Hat kills CentOS by introducing Red Hat CentOS stream.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
Do you want a whole potted history of CentOS Linux?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
Just a sentence.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Can we just take a quick seat and respond?

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
I just want to clarify that explanation of the legal situation.

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
There are some bits of it that are a little more nuanced than that.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.000
If you have an offer for source, it needs to remain valid.

16:24.000 --> 16:31.000
It's not just simply your obligations continue if you've got an offer for source available.

16:31.000 --> 16:39.000
I also just want to say that while this kind of issue dances up to the line of GPL compliance,

16:39.000 --> 16:46.000
you're looking at the really tight letter of the license and wondering where is that line.

16:47.000 --> 16:58.000
Frankly, I would prefer that many of our analyses are not about how do we just follow the very tight license,

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
but instead to say what's in the spirit.

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
It's crummy to ask customers to have to choose between distributing the source to customers who have a right to habit,

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
which is the spirit of the GPLs, and choose between that and support.

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
I otherwise agree with your analysis, but it leaves out that important component.

17:22.000 --> 17:31.000
One, since an awful lot of people don't actually understand what the license says about the source code,

17:31.000 --> 17:36.000
what the letter of the law, if you will, says about the source code.

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
Trying to analyze the spirit is a whole other and much more difficult problem.

17:41.000 --> 17:48.000
Look, if you've chosen to pay for a commercial Linux distribution, then you're not on board with the whole, it's all free for the whole world thing.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
If you pay for corporate support, you're buying into a corporate subscription.

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
And if you're buying into a corporate subscription, that puts you in a different market segment to all those

17:59.000 --> 18:09.000
Debian and Arch and Gento and whatever users who don't have a commercial version and are exclusively relying on the community for support.

18:09.000 --> 18:19.000
Suzer and Red Hat are in this almost unique position that they sell support subscriptions for a corporate tool.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
There's also free products you can use if you so wish, but you don't get the support.

18:24.000 --> 18:31.000
You're not buying the software, you're buying a support subscription. This is important, but is it against the spirit?

18:31.000 --> 18:36.000
I don't know. Can somebody show me a strict documentation of what the spirit is?

18:36.000 --> 18:41.000
Because there's a strict definition of what the GPL is and half the people haven't read that.

18:41.000 --> 18:54.000
Let me ask the lawyer about the letters of the law. In our case, it's the license and the spirit.

18:54.000 --> 19:02.000
Because I'm pretty convinced that what Red Hat is doing here is both legally and license wise correct.

19:03.000 --> 19:08.000
That is an opinion. I consider it legitimate if I see what the target is.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.000
I think it's like many others, I think they did bad marketing on it, definitely.

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
But the thing is, I think it's against the spirit of open source if they don't share because they are so sorry.

19:18.000 --> 19:24.000
I think it's kind of stupid to have big letters on the Red Hat website what open source is.

19:24.000 --> 19:29.000
And that says, developed in the community, shared publicly and everything.

19:29.000 --> 19:37.000
So they really on their own website, they have these words and then they make part of their product only available under limitations,

19:37.000 --> 19:43.000
which is again something that is nitpicking, I would say. It is limitations.

19:43.000 --> 19:49.000
You are free to use it, but you shouldn't share your gun. That is for big customers. That's a threat.

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
If you lose support from a big, that's a threat.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
So I think it's against the spirit of open source.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Karen, can you explain why it's also against the letters?

19:59.000 --> 20:04.000
This is so interesting because I'm going to agree with both of you, even though you're disagreeing,

20:04.000 --> 20:07.000
which is to say that I agree that here the customers are sophisticated.

20:07.000 --> 20:12.000
This is like a different type of... Oh, can you all hear me when I have it over here?

20:12.000 --> 20:15.000
Yeah. So the customers are sophisticated.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
So the result of the violation, if there is a violation, or the result of the policy is different

20:21.000 --> 20:26.000
than if you have consumers who are less sophisticated, who are in a negotiating position,

20:26.000 --> 20:30.000
who aren't knowingly entering into it. So I agree with that.

20:30.000 --> 20:42.000
But then on the other hand, I also agree with Marcus that we are not about necessarily expecting contributors

20:42.000 --> 20:48.000
in the free and open source software space to just do a bare minimum all of the time.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
We are here because we want something better.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
So I am not going to secure and say that this is a violation. I'm not.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
But I am going to say it was sure nice when we had sent us and we could see, like, you know,

21:00.000 --> 21:05.000
we had like a canary in a coal mine in a way. We knew, you know, we had access.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
And now we don't have that canary. The canary is gone.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
And so we may be... Benny wants to say something about this.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
No, go for it. You guys are doing a good job of fighting.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
I don't even think we're fighting. I don't think we're fighting.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
I'm prepared for getting asked.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
I completely agree with you that everybody should read the GPLs, like, read those licenses.

21:22.000 --> 21:30.000
Some of them are easier to read than others, but like, check them out and like, especially read the offer.

21:30.000 --> 21:40.000
I'm kind of torn on CentOS because I do not use it personally.

21:40.000 --> 21:51.000
One of the things that shocked me when I joined Red Hat is I had not really looked at a Red Hat product since Red Hat Linux 9.

21:51.000 --> 22:00.000
And they gave me a laptop and they said, you got a choice. You can run RAL and you get support or you can run Fedora and you're on your own.

22:00.000 --> 22:05.000
We don't support staff running Fedora. Obviously, server-side stuff, yeah.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
But all your colleagues mostly run Fedora.

22:07.000 --> 22:19.000
So junior management and so on ran RAL, senior management, have Max, and all the actual techies ran Fedora.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
So I put the latest Fedora on my staff-issued laptop and it didn't work.

22:24.000 --> 22:31.000
The touchpad didn't work right and the graphics didn't work right and it broke if I undocked it.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
And I asked on the support list inside the company, I went, yeah, it does that.

22:36.000 --> 22:45.000
What? I mean, it took me two days to install this wretched thing because your installer is so awful and it doesn't support the hardware it was written on.

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
Yeah, we know. We're going to fix it one of these days maybe when we can if we can get open source drivers and stuff.

22:50.000 --> 22:56.000
But for now it doesn't work. And I went, this sucks. The user experience for Fedora 14 was awful.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
I defected over to Ubuntu in about 2004.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Talk to them about...

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
The 90s were hard.

23:03.000 --> 23:15.000
But I started a thread and I said, look, I have not used Red Hat in over a decade, but I am a bit of an expert in some of your rival products.

23:15.000 --> 23:21.000
I use Ubuntu, I use Debian, I use some related products and the installation experience is considerably worse.

23:21.000 --> 23:28.000
The driver support is considerably worse. The stability is not good.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.000
Is there a team in the company looking at rival products that wants to help?

23:34.000 --> 23:38.000
If so, I'd like to join. And if there isn't, can I start one? Because I think we can do better.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
And that got me kicked out because I offended the company code.

23:42.000 --> 23:49.000
But you know what? About the free distro and do you get the source code and stuff?

23:49.000 --> 23:56.000
The question of the killing of CentOS Linux as opposed to CentOS Stream, well, that's a whole other question.

23:56.000 --> 24:03.000
But I think... I don't like to say it. I don't buy Linux-based server operating systems.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
I'm very happy I don't run servers anymore.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
But if you buy into a commercial Linux, you're buying into a different kind of deal too if you use a free Linux.

24:10.000 --> 24:16.000
And if you complain that the paid-for one isn't like the free one, well, why do you pay for it then?

24:16.000 --> 24:22.000
Well, in some cases you pay for blameware, so I like outsourcing the blame.

24:22.000 --> 24:30.000
But the thing is also, I talk to many people these days and they said,

24:30.000 --> 24:39.000
well, if you're CentOS, Rocky, Alma, all of this is just people that want to use Red Hat style software but don't want to pay for it.

24:39.000 --> 24:49.000
So, and that is where I'm asking you, Benny, is that what impact did all of that Red Hat movement over the last years have on a project like Alma Linux?

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
I mean, once you get on...

24:51.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah, so as I said before, the move is said to be more targeting Oracle and not actually that much CentOS because Oracle and also, I was told, Rocky,

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
they are doing business with it undercutting Red Hat prices, which Alma is obviously not doing.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
So you're kind of the good ones in this game and that's also nice to have you on the stage here.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
But how did it affect Alma Linux over the last years?

25:20.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah, so, well, let's start with the supposition that the people who are using CentOS and Alma Linux and Rocky Linux are the ones that don't want to pay for Red Hat.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
That is not true.

25:35.000 --> 25:43.000
The number of people that have come to me and said, I used CentOS and now I use Alma Linux, not because I don't want to pay Red Hat,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
but because I was never going to pay Red Hat.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
I was always going to look for a free Linux.

25:48.000 --> 25:57.000
So the idea that we're somehow pulling funds or customers away from Red Hat is incorrect.

25:57.000 --> 26:08.000
There are certainly people, certainly companies who use a Red Hat-compatible operating system to decrease the amount of money they have to pay Red Hat,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
but that is not our primary audience at all.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
So we start there.

26:13.000 --> 26:22.000
But if you just look at the impact of what changed in December 2020, we were all, was it 2020 or 2021, whatever it was,

26:22.000 --> 26:35.000
we as users of CentOS were very frustrated, very uncomfortable with the idea that we weren't going to have CentOS 8 as long as we wanted,

26:35.000 --> 26:40.000
and we weren't going to have any CentOS 9 that was the Linux version, right?

26:40.000 --> 26:43.000
We all needed it for a variety of reasons.

26:43.000 --> 26:51.000
Everything from, I got to meet somebody today who uses Alma Linux to serve museums in Sweden.

26:51.000 --> 26:56.000
All of the point of sales stuff is done using an Alma Linux server.

26:56.000 --> 27:00.000
They were never going to switch to an operating system they had to pay for.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.000
They want an operating system that serves their need and is free.

27:04.000 --> 27:09.000
That's the kind of people that have come to us.

27:09.000 --> 27:16.000
In June, when things shifted again, it completely broke our pipeline, right?

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
We had a built pipeline that was very good and very secure and very stable.

27:21.000 --> 27:28.000
When our pipeline was broken by the changes where the licenses or where the code was stored,

27:28.000 --> 27:32.000
it was, again, frustrating and uncomfortable.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
But Open Source did what Open Source always does, which is solve the problem.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.000
We will get around it. We'll find a way to do the things that we want to do,

27:41.000 --> 27:44.000
whether or not we have access to the source code.

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
In this case, we do. We find it in other places to do the things that we want to do

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
without violating RID hats agreements.

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
It's easy for us to, I mean easy, relatively easy, right?

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
But it's still possible.

28:02.000 --> 28:12.000
When I hear that, that kind of fosters my opinion that it's not really in the spirit of Open Source,

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
what's happening here.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.000
But there may be different views from different sides on the whole thing.

28:18.000 --> 28:25.000
I think Red Hat is doing this also because of business model topics.

28:26.000 --> 28:32.000
There is business models like Oracle Linux or Rocky Linux,

28:32.000 --> 28:40.000
which Red Hat is not very happy about, and you are kind of like the collateral damage to that.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
To a certain degree, yeah.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
To a certain degree, sure.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
I do, just to be fair to Rocky and the people who work on Rocky,

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
I do want to distinguish slightly between Rocky Linux and CIQ.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
CIQ and Rocky Linux are obviously very closely tied, but there is difference, right?

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
So yeah, CIQ has a commercial thing.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Red Hat has a commercial approach.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.000
We don't have customers. We have users.

29:05.000 --> 29:11.000
And it is, whether or not it's, like we get into the letter of it, right?

29:11.000 --> 29:14.000
It is certainly harder to do the things that we want to do,

29:14.000 --> 29:18.000
but I think that it proves the strength of Open Source.

29:19.000 --> 29:22.000
Whether or not they are violating the spirit at all.

29:22.000 --> 29:28.000
And I would add about the spirit that, you know, the problem with trying to do the bare minimum going for the letter

29:28.000 --> 29:32.000
and not thinking about the spirit is that you get so close to that line

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
that it is easy to cross over it in other circumstances, right?

29:36.000 --> 29:41.000
So my colleague Bradley Coon who is here actually wrote a blog post that I actually was referring to earlier,

29:41.000 --> 29:45.000
that identified a couple of violations that we had had in the past.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
And that's what happens when you're looking for the bare minimum.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
And so I think you just have to be cognizant of that.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
So I guess that's also the point where we want to open this discussion up to you,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
as seen where many hands raised.

29:59.000 --> 30:04.000
Yeah, so many people. Just like 200 questions we will accept, I guess.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
Correct?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
We have 20 minutes.

30:07.000 --> 30:11.000
Yeah, so my main question, you were so right with that.

30:11.000 --> 30:17.000
My question that is on my mind is, do we have to change something in the open source community?

30:17.000 --> 30:25.000
Do we need a GPL4 that also covers the issue of not only to customers

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
or that is maybe more precise or more clear on the limitations?

30:30.000 --> 30:35.000
Because I think what Red Hat is doing here is posing the limitations on those that get the source code.

30:35.000 --> 30:41.000
They are not really, but in a way, that is the effect and it has some side effects.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
And so maybe, so I start here.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
Thank you.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
I mean, I hope it's alright that I don't answer your question,

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
but I want to say something about the spirit again, because I think,

30:58.000 --> 31:03.000
I wasn't involved in any drafting of the licenses and stuff like that,

31:03.000 --> 31:09.000
so it's just like from what I've read, but my understanding is when you read the writings of stall men,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
can you think further away?

31:11.000 --> 31:12.000
Okay, better like that?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Okay, cool.

31:14.000 --> 31:22.000
I think it's very clear to me that the intention, one of the intentions of the copy left movement was to prevent software monopolies.

31:22.000 --> 31:29.000
And you can comply with a copy left license, and I'm not saying Red Hat is doing that, right?

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
I have no idea, I am no position to judge that, but hypothetically speaking,

31:34.000 --> 31:44.000
if a company starts hiring all the developers of a software ecosystem and pay for their livelihood,

31:44.000 --> 31:52.000
and then go to the customers and say, of course you can go out on your own and be on your own,

31:52.000 --> 31:58.000
and no longer be a customer of us as a company, but good luck finding anybody else

31:58.000 --> 32:04.000
and just a technical skill to do anything with that software, because we control like 90% of the ecosystem.

32:04.000 --> 32:10.000
I think that is a problematic situation as a community to have that, right?

32:10.000 --> 32:17.000
Whether it is legal or within the rights of the license, I think to me, it is very clear that this is a problem.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
And to bring it back with two sentences to the questions you've asked,

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
I honestly, I have no idea if that is a problem that can be solved by the legal framework,

32:25.000 --> 32:31.000
because it is so far beyond just copyright and copyright issues with the licenses

32:31.000 --> 32:38.000
that I don't know what the solution can be, I am very sure that it is a problem

32:38.000 --> 32:45.000
and a problem that we need to think on, because these are monopolies that are coming up in very new and very different shapes.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
And that is something that I came across with the research on these articles,

32:48.000 --> 32:52.000
so there is an open core conference, an open core summit that happened first time last year,

32:53.000 --> 32:56.000
the year before last year, second time this year in December,

32:56.000 --> 33:04.000
and it is driven by a company or entity, open source software.oss.capital,

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
and they promise investment capital if you are doing open core.

33:07.000 --> 33:14.000
So they are, and Redhead founder, John Ewing, is it John or Jack Ewing, I think?

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Mark?

33:15.000 --> 33:18.000
Redhead founder, you are talking about the one who was at that open course?

33:18.000 --> 33:19.000
Yes, exactly.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
Bob Young.

33:20.000 --> 33:28.000
Bob Young gave an opening speech on this event, and so that is where I came across and I thought,

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
okay, there is a lot of money that is looking for a new home,

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
and they see that open source is a threat for investment,

33:35.000 --> 33:41.000
they see it as a threat to investments, because if you don't own intellectual property

33:41.000 --> 33:47.000
or all the developers on a certain market, then the investment money can vanish,

33:47.000 --> 33:51.000
because everybody else can do what you did before.

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000
And so that is also a very important matter in this thing, I guess,

33:56.000 --> 34:05.000
because what Redhead is doing is trying to avoid others from making money off their development.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
Which is the opposite of what Bob Young said.

34:11.000 --> 34:16.000
He talks about it at the open course, so it is interesting because he, you know,

34:16.000 --> 34:21.000
I don't want to be the only one who is here saying, you know, I love them and I hate them,

34:21.000 --> 34:26.000
I am here giving a positive view and really I am at heart, I am negative,

34:26.000 --> 34:31.000
I did the keynote this morning about outreach and I gushed about...

36:41.000 --> 36:51.000
...

36:51.000 --> 36:57.000
...

36:57.000 --> 37:02.000
Thank you.

37:02.000 --> 37:10.000
So you said the question is about who is a user and Redhead is talking about customers.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Is that correct?

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
So Karen, can you say something about that?

37:15.000 --> 37:20.000
I mean, a user of the software is everybody who gets it, right?

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
They are only handing it out to their customers.

37:23.000 --> 37:28.000
Is that wording? Is there a difference in any way? Can you say something to that?

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
It's really, you know, the license is written so that the obligations flow,

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
so that the obligations flow downstream.

37:35.000 --> 37:39.000
So you are asking for distinctions that are not that relevant in the way you analyze the license

37:39.000 --> 37:43.000
and the company's obligations are when they distribute the first code.

37:43.000 --> 37:51.000
So now we have got to resolve the technical issues and the new microphone is running around.

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
To answer the next question I can't see.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Yeah. Hi up there.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
Come in, Houston.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
To everybody at home, this is a room like two kilometers long and one mile up on the left

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
is a very nice friendly guy asking a question.

38:08.000 --> 38:13.000
Hi, I'm Jim from Oracle, otherwise known as Big Evil in this crowd.

38:13.000 --> 38:19.000
So section six of the GPL provides, and pardon me, in part,

38:19.000 --> 38:26.000
that you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of rights granted herein.

38:26.000 --> 38:33.000
The Redhead subscription terms provide that you may not redistribute the software,

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
and if you do, it's a material breach.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
It doesn't just say we can terminate you.

38:38.000 --> 38:41.000
That gives them the right to sue you.

38:41.000 --> 38:47.000
Beyond that, they could also say just as easily, you don't have the right to modify,

38:47.000 --> 38:50.000
you don't have the right to make copies.

38:50.000 --> 38:57.000
If they are allowed by contract to restrict the rights granted under the license,

38:57.000 --> 39:04.000
how does the end user end up with any of the protections that the license is intended to provide?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
How is the license meaningful?

39:06.000 --> 39:12.000
Can Vizio, by way of example, provide a license with its TV that says,

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
if you ask for the source, it's a material breach and you owe us money?

39:16.000 --> 39:23.000
Well, in my readings, I learned about the term in at least US law,

39:23.000 --> 39:29.000
that is the caveat-emptor thing, that means actually something like buyer-beware.

39:29.000 --> 39:34.000
I'm looking forward a lot to how European law will see this whole situation,

39:34.000 --> 39:42.000
but in the end, it's the freedom of a vendor by law to choose his customers.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.000
And if I'm doing messy things with the stuff they give to me, because of the GPL,

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
they cannot infringe my law to use it and share it and change it,

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
but they can still say, stay away, we will give you no support.

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
You can call us 20 times a day, we won't do anything for you.

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
Did I get that right again, Karan? The caveat-emptor thing?

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
I mean, I'm not...

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
You're not our lawyer.

40:05.000 --> 40:10.000
Let's move on in the conversation.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
Okay.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.000
Here.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
Yes.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
Thank you. Hi, I'm Christian.

40:20.000 --> 40:27.000
I have to say I'm in the spirit of free software, so what I say now is a bit against my own conviction,

40:27.000 --> 40:33.000
but I think we have to put things a bit different.

40:33.000 --> 40:38.000
Reddit, Linux is not consistent completely from GPL software.

40:38.000 --> 40:43.000
There's different licenses, so we have permissive licenses in there and it doesn't apply.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.000
And then the next thing is the question of packaging it is, consider the right work

40:48.000 --> 40:53.000
or is it just a way of distribution, just as Storman wrote,

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
it's okay if you put it on the tapes back in the 1980s and if you sell these tapes,

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
you can charge money for this.

41:01.000 --> 41:05.000
So this is the question I have to you, Karan Phelps, as a lawyer,

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
and putting that way,

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
if it is derived work, then I think it's in conflict with GPL

41:16.000 --> 41:19.000
to not provide the packages as the derived work

41:19.000 --> 41:24.000
or not allow the customer to provide the packages on their behalf to the wider community

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
because they have the right to share.

41:28.000 --> 41:32.000
On the other hand, for permissive license stuff, that's not true.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
If it's not derived work, then it would be okay for Reddit to just cite the sources

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
because you still get the software from the Internet,

41:41.000 --> 41:45.000
but you have no right to basically get their distribution work.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
I don't really know, so I'm very interested in your answers.

41:48.000 --> 41:52.000
Armand Linux is completely out of the packaging of CentOS, right?

41:52.000 --> 41:55.000
There's no packages anymore, anyhow, right?

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
So you're doing packaging yourself?

41:58.000 --> 42:03.000
Yeah, so we pulled the source code from a couple of different places.

42:03.000 --> 42:06.000
Shameless plug, if you want to know exactly where we get it from,

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
you can come to our talk at the distro's room tomorrow at noon.

42:10.000 --> 42:15.000
Thank you.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.000
The packages where the code that we pull is from...

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Where's the other microphone?

42:20.000 --> 42:21.000
I don't know.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.000
That's not the anthem.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
The code that we pull is from CentOS Stream,

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
or from other places you can get it where it's free.

42:27.000 --> 42:33.000
And pulling that code and repackaging it from everything that we've seen

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
does not violate anything, right?

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
The reality...

42:39.000 --> 42:43.000
I think the thing that I would like to talk about at this point

42:43.000 --> 42:46.000
is kind of the question that we started with.

42:46.000 --> 42:51.000
This is going to continue to be a thing because humans are the way they are.

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
We are going to end up in situations...

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
This isn't like a new cycle to what we're doing, right?

42:56.000 --> 43:01.000
But he said openwashing is coming around again, because that's what happens.

43:01.000 --> 43:05.000
How do we, as an open source community, react to that?

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
That's the thing that's interesting to me.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
Like debating whether or not Red Hat is violating GPL is...

43:12.000 --> 43:17.000
We've got 230 people in here and 230 opinions.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
I think how we fix what we're doing going forward

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
is going to be the interesting conversation.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Do you have a question?

43:25.000 --> 43:28.000
My question was more legal one.

43:28.000 --> 43:32.000
For instance, if we look at the GNU or FSF website,

43:32.000 --> 43:35.000
we have a GPL FAQ.

43:35.000 --> 43:39.000
And that's inform us on how to interpret the license, for instance.

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
And as I understand, this has some legal weight.

43:43.000 --> 43:49.000
In the GPL v3, there is also a section about terminating services.

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
Does that give us some information, even if it's not about source code distribution,

43:54.000 --> 43:59.000
but installation of software or modification of software?

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Maybe.

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
I think it's really up for debate, if any commentary outside the license.

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
At least from a US law perspective, it's really...

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
The license says what it says.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
I mean, for my personal, like, two pence worth, a tough enough worth,

44:20.000 --> 44:26.000
I think Red Hat made a huge mistake in, so to speak, acquiring CentOS in the first place.

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
That was a really dumb move, because they legitimized and sanctioned

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
what was effectively a free rival to their commercial product.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
Now, when I've said this in print, people have said,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
oh, well, CentOS was dying.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
They rescued it by adopting it.

44:42.000 --> 44:45.000
Well, tomato, tomato, it doesn't really matter.

44:45.000 --> 44:50.000
It was a really dumb move to start supporting and offering a free rival to their own product.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
But that was a long time ago.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
They decided to stop offering it.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Okay, fair enough. They're within their rights to do that.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
It inconvenienced a bunch of people.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
Well, they'd mainly inconvenienced rivals.

45:01.000 --> 45:05.000
But, yeah, I think it probably is against the spirit.

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
Yes, I don't argue with that, and I do not wish to defend them.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
But since we can't really codify what the spirit is,

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
somebody's got to pay for all this work.

45:17.000 --> 45:21.000
My basic overall position here is, right,

45:21.000 --> 45:26.000
I started my career with DOS, Novel Network, and tools like that,

45:26.000 --> 45:32.000
which were tiny and maintained by tiny numbers of people,

45:32.000 --> 45:35.000
and most of them were not written in C.

45:35.000 --> 45:42.000
The industry has gradually shifted to vast and vastly complex stacks of software,

45:42.000 --> 45:48.000
the lower levels of which are built in the most unsafe programming language known to humanity.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Okay, that was a dumb move.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.000
Right?

45:52.000 --> 45:57.000
And the result of that is a vast multi-billion, in fact, nowadays, multi-trillion dollar industry,

45:57.000 --> 46:03.000
and paying people to fix it and maintain it and document it and try and make it all work together.

46:03.000 --> 46:07.000
Rightly or wrongly, that's kind of where we are.

46:08.000 --> 46:14.000
There are free products. There are paid for products.

46:14.000 --> 46:21.000
You've kind of already taken a seat on the edge of the shark tank if you started using one of the paid for products.

46:21.000 --> 46:29.000
I think life would have been simpler if there'd been a much clearer line between real official Red Hat Linux

46:29.000 --> 46:35.000
without an enterprise and a totally free one, which is not official.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
But that isn't where we started from.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
I think the company was repairing a mistake.

46:43.000 --> 46:50.000
So, I would like to add a thought to the question, how could we act as a community on this,

46:50.000 --> 46:55.000
and I think this goes right away to the panel later this afternoon.

46:55.000 --> 47:01.000
What can we do with additional obligations that someone tries to add onto the GPL?

47:01.000 --> 47:08.000
So, I think we could agree that Red Hat tries to add some obligations.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
I would even go a step further and say they made at least an unclear subscription agreement,

47:14.000 --> 47:18.000
and you can read it as you have to pay for every copy which is made,

47:18.000 --> 47:25.000
and we have an extra right to terminate your subscription if you should dare to redistribute the code.

47:25.000 --> 47:31.000
So, I would say if this is the right reading, you would have a conflict with the GPL,

47:31.000 --> 47:39.000
but if I were to have made it unclear by intent that you can always say,

47:39.000 --> 47:45.000
no, no, no, we just may consider the fact that you made distributions.

47:45.000 --> 47:51.000
So, from a political side, I would say Red Hat already partly won the debate

47:51.000 --> 48:02.000
in a sense that we are always saying, well, but Red Hat may most likely not renew your subscriptions,

48:02.000 --> 48:09.000
but the subscription terms are more harsh, way more harsh than what you actually are saying.

48:09.000 --> 48:17.000
So, I would like to ask to the panel, did you get the gist of the Red Hat subscription agreements?

48:17.000 --> 48:25.000
Yeah, personally for the article I even got an explanation which was, as Leon said, very open and clear from Red Hat,

48:25.000 --> 48:35.000
how they handle it and they will say they are free to kill the subscription contract with the user at any time,

48:35.000 --> 48:41.000
at any given time once they find out he or she or they changed and shared it.

48:41.000 --> 48:48.000
So, it's very simple. If they want, I don't think they are that ill, but if they want, they can just from today to tomorrow,

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
they say, oh, we saw you flipped a bite here, no, we don't support you anymore.

48:52.000 --> 49:01.000
And I would really recommend I was briefly in Bradley's talk just before and the few minutes that I saw there

49:01.000 --> 49:08.000
made me really want to watch the video as soon as possible because you were also talking about companies imposing limits on their employees

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
in terms of open source and transferring intellectual property and things.

49:12.000 --> 49:16.000
And first, before I give a word to Bradley, I saw...

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
You could just say whatever.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
You sure? Karen? Okay.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.000
You can respond.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Yeah, so...

49:22.000 --> 49:23.000
You wanted the mic right after that.

49:23.000 --> 49:29.000
Yeah, so I think, so I'm not on the panel because I talk about this issue too much

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
and so I really shouldn't have the microphone, but Don gave it to me.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
So, I...

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
You're in your hands.

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
That's true.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
I thought he wasn't going to give it to me.

49:39.000 --> 49:47.000
So, when I first was given a copy of the rel, I think at that time it was called the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Agreement,

49:47.000 --> 49:51.000
in 2001 and asked, does this comply with the GPL?

49:51.000 --> 49:56.000
I never would have imagined this many people would be in a room to actually care about that question

49:56.000 --> 50:01.000
because it was kind of a how many angels dance on the head of a pin question at the time

50:01.000 --> 50:02.000
and in some sense it still is.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
It's an incredibly nuanced question.

50:04.000 --> 50:12.000
I think everyone wants to give these very pithy answers, Jim Wright from Oracle being glad to give us an incredible pithy answer,

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
that of course it violates the GPL.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.000
I think that Red Hat is extremely sophisticated in their drafting

50:19.000 --> 50:26.000
and I have read every single version of the rel services agreement that's ever been published

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
and on paper, I don't find a GPL violation.

50:31.000 --> 50:36.000
The problems that I have discovered are of the nature that I've often called,

50:36.000 --> 50:41.000
if a GPL violation falls in the woods and nobody's there to hear it, did it actually occur?

50:41.000 --> 50:51.000
And I say that because there are probably hundreds of Red Hat salespeople who walk in and sell seat licenses

50:51.000 --> 50:57.000
and there are hundreds, possibly thousands of Red Hat customers who believe they own seat licenses to rel.

50:57.000 --> 51:04.000
I have met many, dozens of people who tell me their company has N seat licenses to rel.

51:04.000 --> 51:08.000
That's not what the agreement says but that's what everyone believes is happening.

51:08.000 --> 51:15.000
And that I think goes to your earlier point, that there's something happening that is perception

51:15.000 --> 51:23.000
and while the letter of the rules don't violate the license, everybody believes it's proprietary software

51:23.000 --> 51:28.000
and I don't know how we solve that problem but jumping to a conclusion either direction

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
of it must be a violation or it can't be a violation is not going to get us very far

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
in figuring out the community problem that we face.

51:36.000 --> 51:43.000
That goes for me that also goes in the direction of the caveat emptor thing.

51:43.000 --> 51:50.000
So you, like, I mean in the US it seems to be very normal to assume that somebody that you're buying something from

51:50.000 --> 51:57.000
might be trying to fool you or to get some more extra money out of you.

51:57.000 --> 52:05.000
And so that's probably also the biggest failure or the biggest mistake that Red Hat did in all of this.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
I talked to them and they said, yeah, marketing wasn't very good on that.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
So obviously, oh no, shit man.

52:11.000 --> 52:19.000
But the thing is, is there anything that we as a community can do to be maybe more precise or whatever

52:19.000 --> 52:28.000
to counter these things? I don't think so. Actually it's the market, huh?

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
I'll try to keep it short because I have two things now and one of those really got my blood boiling.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
So I try to start with the more nuanced one.

52:37.000 --> 52:43.000
And the nuanced one is we can quote the current GPL to each other all day long, right?

52:43.000 --> 52:50.000
But from what I understand from the history, the reason that a GPL exists is because GPL was written at a time

52:50.000 --> 52:55.000
where something like the cloud was in nobody's mind.

52:55.000 --> 53:04.000
And I think we're at a point now where nobody ever thought that there might be a player in open source

53:04.000 --> 53:13.000
who has just war money to buy 80% of the developers of an ecosystem and provide for their jobs

53:13.000 --> 53:20.000
and comply with the license. And there is no doubt in my mind, like Bradley, as you said,

53:20.000 --> 53:25.000
I'm completely certain that they comply with the license and I believe REL is free software.

53:25.000 --> 53:32.000
If they distribute REL to you, you get free software. You're free to exercise your full rights, right?

53:32.000 --> 53:38.000
But they have built something that we didn't think of when the license was drafted. So that's the one.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
And the second one.

53:39.000 --> 53:42.000
Let me keep it because Liam wants to directly answer to that.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
Okay.

53:43.000 --> 53:47.000
But the second one with the emotional one, I already wonder if it was something I said or he said

53:47.000 --> 53:50.000
because that's usually how the reactions that we get with it.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.000
I think it was more Liam.

53:51.000 --> 53:52.000
Can you answer?

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
Absolutely.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
And then keep the thought.

53:55.000 --> 53:59.000
We're running out of time, so maybe we should move to the next question.

53:59.000 --> 54:03.000
I think you've got this completely backwards in how you should look at this.

54:03.000 --> 54:09.000
And I speak as a former member of staff. It is not. Oh my God, one company owns 80% of Linux developers.

54:09.000 --> 54:19.000
No. One company, rightly or wrongly, and I am no fan of theirs, came up with a very, very lucrative model for selling Linux distributions.

54:19.000 --> 54:25.000
And that has enabled them to pay for something like 80% of the development of Linux and associated systems.

54:25.000 --> 54:32.000
I don't like them. I enjoyed working there. Don't get me wrong.

54:32.000 --> 54:38.000
There are friends here at FOSTEM this weekend that I have spoken with that I made in my short time at Red Hat.

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
It was a fun job. Well, actually, the docs are very dull, but you know.

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
But it was a fun job. It was a great community.

54:44.000 --> 54:50.000
It's a friendly company as long as you don't violate the company religion that there is only one Linux and its name is Red Hat.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
But that's a whole other question.

54:52.000 --> 54:59.000
One company found a way to make Linux very lucrative and they pay for a vast amount of development, and that's a really good thing.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.000
I agree.

55:00.000 --> 55:05.000
Because Debian can't do it. Ubuntu, Canonical can't do it. Nobody else can pay for all this stuff.

55:05.000 --> 55:10.000
It's not they've got a monopoly. They're funding us and they're keeping us in a job.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
This is a last question here.

55:12.000 --> 55:18.000
We have something like two or three minutes left.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.000
So maybe a slightly different point of view.

55:22.000 --> 55:30.000
So I'm working for a large company and because the company pays my salary, I can do open source work.

55:30.000 --> 55:34.000
I'm a maintainer for open source projects and I like to do this.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.000
But I'm getting some kind of paid for this.

55:37.000 --> 55:44.000
And I guess for all open source that someone develops, all the people need to do a living.

55:44.000 --> 55:48.000
I'm getting paid for the work that I do for the company.

55:48.000 --> 55:53.000
I'm doing private open source project and I don't want to have money for that.

55:53.000 --> 55:58.000
But in general, someone needs to do a living by writing open source software.

55:58.000 --> 56:02.000
So this is something that we need to secure.

56:02.000 --> 56:07.000
And we've seen in the past that like elastic search or something,

56:07.000 --> 56:17.000
if big organizations take open source, provide it with their business model and let's say deny small companies to earn money,

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
then we will lose open source.

56:20.000 --> 56:25.000
And I had discussions with Red Hat.

56:25.000 --> 56:30.000
I had discussions with lawyers of Red Hat and they made it very clear up to this point,

56:30.000 --> 56:36.000
we will talk friendly to you, but the next stage will only be possible if you pay money.

56:36.000 --> 56:41.000
You're using our open source software, so you will not get further answers.

56:41.000 --> 56:47.000
I don't think that is a good habit, but I would like to get back to what Bani said

56:47.000 --> 56:52.000
because it's what do we about this, not necessarily against Red Hat,

56:52.000 --> 56:58.000
but how do we as a community, how do we just get around it?

56:58.000 --> 57:06.000
So let Red Hat do what they want to do as long as we can have open source software on the right side.

57:06.000 --> 57:11.000
That's exactly the last question that I have on my list for the panel actually.

57:11.000 --> 57:16.000
That's exactly the question that I'd like to hear from all of those guys, those experts here,

57:16.000 --> 57:21.000
telling me what they think we should do or if we should do something about it

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
or if we should just wait.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
So who wants to start?

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
So what are we going to do?

57:29.000 --> 57:33.000
We're going to do what open source always does, which is fix the problem.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I said it earlier.

57:35.000 --> 57:42.000
The reason open source continues to exist from my perspective is that we all continue to care about it.

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
We continue to put in our time, we continue to put in our effort.

57:45.000 --> 57:50.000
We, whether or not somebody is getting paid for it, we show up because we care.

57:50.000 --> 57:53.000
There will always be people who commercialize it.

57:53.000 --> 57:58.000
There will always be people who feel fundamentally that open source is the way to go.

57:58.000 --> 58:05.000
And we're going to end up hopefully continuing to balance each other out.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
With people like that.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
I run Debian. It works pretty great.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Maybe we're on Debian.

58:23.000 --> 58:26.000
I don't think this is a problem to be fixed.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
I mean, you know what? It might be nice in the spirit of doing it, but you know what?

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Somebody's got to pay for all this.

58:33.000 --> 58:47.000
My last three FOSDEM talks were more or less on the subject of how can we find a way to dump this entire stack from line one of LS and replace it with something a bit better built because I think that's what we should do.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
And I'd like that to be open source as well.

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
So, are you still unmated?

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
Thanks for joining us.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
We're out of time.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
We are done. Thanks for joining us.

59:01.000 --> 59:05.000
Thanks for joining us. I'm very sorry that we couldn't answer all the questions.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.000
Goodbye.

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
I'm sorry.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.000
It's okay.

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Yeah, I know I'm sorry.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
What was it that made you emotional?

59:16.000 --> 59:17.000
I don't know.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
I don't know.

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
Thank you.
