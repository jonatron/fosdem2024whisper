WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Language barrier and open source.

00:07.000 --> 00:19.600
Here's my biology. I'm an open source advocate, educated, in-through asset, e-commerce and

00:19.600 --> 00:25.560
e-commerce practitioner. In recent years, last year, I switched my direction to the

00:25.560 --> 00:36.800
e-commerce. I'm also a patch open meetings contributor. I joined the project in 2012,

00:36.800 --> 00:43.160
so I got about many years experience. I'm also an interpreter and translator for some

00:43.160 --> 00:50.840
largest China's open source communities. I'm a member of Microsoft for startup founders

00:50.840 --> 01:02.440
in China. Also, I'm a founder of omoforce.com and www.omoforce.com. Last year, I was very

01:02.440 --> 01:11.280
honored to be a patchy community coach and a Force Asia conference speaker.

01:11.280 --> 01:17.760
So today, first, I'm going to introduce a little bit about my translation experience.

01:17.760 --> 01:23.920
First thing, I'll share you some experience and lessons we learned from the New York's

01:23.920 --> 01:32.080
open source Congress report, 2023, and open source initiatives, deep dive AS series, which

01:32.080 --> 01:37.880
those two projects we finished last year. Then I'll talk a little bit about the team

01:37.880 --> 01:44.560
build strategy. Finally, I want to show you a patch open meetings website translation.

01:44.560 --> 02:00.160
So here comes to my translation experience. Back two months ago, 2002, when I worked in

02:00.160 --> 02:08.760
college, I taught course like in ABUK courses. For example, information system analysis and

02:08.760 --> 02:18.560
design and also data structure. We used English textbooks for students, but to help students

02:18.560 --> 02:25.680
to better understand the concept, we use Chinese translation course materials.

02:25.680 --> 02:36.440
And then late in year 2011, I was Oracle offshore outsourcing project manager in China for

02:36.440 --> 02:45.360
an Alcon logic development, Alcon logic clinical trial study management platform. I was a project

02:45.360 --> 02:51.000
manager. We translate like a source, emails, testing, package, delivery, everything. So

02:51.000 --> 03:00.200
for one year, then I joined a patch open meetings team, I translated a website into Chinese

03:00.200 --> 03:10.760
and promote the website, promote the project in China. In recent years, most of my translation

03:10.760 --> 03:17.760
experience related to Kai Yuan Shou. That's probably somebody you never heard of, but

03:17.760 --> 03:25.400
in China is a famous open source community. We have each year, we have open source conference

03:25.400 --> 03:33.920
in China called Coastcom. And we got a lot of communication and cooperation with the

03:33.920 --> 03:40.880
Patch and the Neelix Foundation. So in year 2018, I was an interpreter for the Patch and

03:40.880 --> 03:48.640
the Sofa Foundation speakers for Coastcom, China. And in 2021, I gave my first talk in

03:48.640 --> 03:55.000
how to integrate AFDAP and AD with the Patch Open Meetings. In 2022, I was a translator

03:55.040 --> 04:02.400
for China Open Source Report. And last year, I mentioned before, right, in FOSA Asia and

04:02.400 --> 04:09.000
the Community Code over China for the role-based access control mechanism by unifying AD, Neelix

04:09.000 --> 04:18.920
and Patch Open Meetings. So in English session and the Chinese session. For the 2023 China

04:18.920 --> 04:27.880
Open Source Report, I was a translator. And last year, around November and December, I

04:27.880 --> 04:33.640
was involved in Open Source Congress Report reviewer and also a translator and a reviewer

04:33.640 --> 04:44.880
for OSI Deep Dive AS sessions, which is a video captioning project. So here I just got some

04:44.880 --> 05:01.560
images, photos. This is my first visit to Europe. This is my second time. And this is

05:01.560 --> 05:11.080
Coastcom 2018 in China. Those speakers from Patch. The interesting thing is, after five

05:11.160 --> 05:17.480
years, last year in Beijing, I fortunately met these two gentlemen again five years later.

05:17.480 --> 05:24.240
We made friends, right? But you can see the change after five years, all hair turned gray.

05:24.240 --> 05:35.280
Okay, this is the talk in the virtual, my first talk in the Open Source community,

05:36.000 --> 05:44.200
how to integrate FDAP and Active Directory with Patch Open Meetings. At that time, I was the

05:44.200 --> 05:52.720
personal former member of Kaiyuan City. This is last year, the FOSA Asia. We got both here

05:52.720 --> 06:01.080
right at the second floor and that's in Singapore. We have a group of Chinese developers from

06:01.200 --> 06:07.840
different cities in China like Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Changsha. And also is a Japanese guy

06:07.840 --> 06:18.200
from Japan. We have a second group to the meeting. This is last year, a committee of

06:18.200 --> 06:28.760
code in China, in Beijing. See many Chinese developers, commuters. And I also gave a talk

06:29.640 --> 06:44.640
in the integration check. For Open Source Congress report, 2023, the title of the report is

06:44.640 --> 06:50.840
Standing Together on Shared Challenges. Report on the Open Source Congress. Probably somebody

06:51.480 --> 06:59.080
here, maybe you read the English or other versions reported, right? But in China, we are absolutely

06:59.080 --> 07:05.600
very honored to be part of the group. We do the translation work. The project created on November

07:05.600 --> 07:16.760
17th, project complete on January 12th, 2024. The whole report length is 34 pages. We got six

07:16.760 --> 07:29.160
translators, two reviewers. We divide the task into six subtexts, including infographics. We use AI

07:29.160 --> 07:38.360
assistant such as DPL, CloudIn, ChagBt, Co-Panel, Google Documents to help us to facilitate

07:38.360 --> 07:46.720
translation. Usually, we use like a Google, Google translate to do translation. But when we

07:46.720 --> 07:56.000
compare the result, we find that Google translate is not accurate as DPL. So we just use the AI

07:56.000 --> 08:08.560
tool to help us. We labeled the whole translation process in different stages, like in-process,

08:08.560 --> 08:14.120
like translated, like reviewed. So each team member, okay, each team member, you can look

08:14.200 --> 08:22.800
at the labels, okay, got it. If the former process finishes, then I can start my process. The initial

08:22.800 --> 08:30.560
translation finished on December 2nd. And then we start our first round of QA and the second round

08:30.560 --> 08:40.800
of QA and final review. So left side, the English version front page, and the right side is Chinese

08:41.480 --> 08:51.360
version front page. Here is six subtexts, and here is my nickname. So I reviewed the two parts.

08:51.360 --> 09:00.280
So for the infographics, we know in the translation, for text translation, it's

09:01.240 --> 09:13.000
comparably easy, right? But for the image translation, we need to use more time. For example, we speed

09:13.000 --> 09:19.840
the infographics, there's 12 images, we speed it and get one of them, and we use the Google

09:19.840 --> 09:24.960
translator to get the Chinese version. But you can see the title and the content is unreadable,

09:25.000 --> 09:34.480
right? It's too small. So we just use, clean everything out and use Photoshop to add the content.

09:37.480 --> 09:42.320
So finally, we combined the 12 images together to get the infographics.

09:47.760 --> 09:53.440
Can you see? Sorry, it's not very clearly. Left side is the content of English version,

09:53.560 --> 10:00.080
and the right side is the content table in Chinese version. You can see the page number here.

10:00.080 --> 10:06.200
The English version is 28 pages. In Chinese version, it's 20 pages, which means after the

10:06.200 --> 10:12.120
translation, the five sides shrink. Just I only got two thirds of the source file.

10:13.120 --> 10:20.600
So here comes the lessons I learned. Original paper has some quotes, which some experts,

10:20.600 --> 10:26.240
some leaders, they say something, right? But the translation has some discrepancies, so

10:26.240 --> 10:30.040
we need a final review. After we send the paper to the latest foundation, they say, okay,

10:30.040 --> 10:35.160
we got some discrepancies. You guys need to pay attention. You need to have a final review.

10:35.160 --> 10:40.240
So when we check these discrepancies, we need to keep constantly looking at the content

10:40.240 --> 10:46.600
discrepancies. We need to keep consistency and one format, otherwise it would cause confusion.

10:46.600 --> 10:53.320
Because we are sending tasks based on the source file in Google documents, but the discrepancies

10:53.320 --> 11:00.880
exist in the target PDF files we send to the latest foundation, right? Okay, then we identify

11:00.880 --> 11:06.920
how many book codes and in which part of the paper so the corresponding translators will be

11:06.960 --> 11:15.960
able to check the codes. Because of the five sides shrink adjustment, right? And in PDF format,

11:15.960 --> 11:21.480
we got two column format. So talk to the file page number, it's different from source file

11:21.480 --> 11:28.040
page number. So if we didn't keep consistency on source file, then we got confused. This

11:28.040 --> 11:33.880
happened in the communication process. Okay, we found this postcode. Who did this? Nobody

11:33.920 --> 11:40.240
knows because when we check the PDF format, I didn't do this, I didn't do this, right? So the final

11:40.240 --> 11:46.840
solution is the leader, the leader of the project, he took all the responsibility. He checked all

11:46.840 --> 11:56.320
the protocols and the translated by himself. After we send the paper to the latest foundation,

11:56.400 --> 12:05.240
they used us some badges for just four. I'm very happy to get this for the recognition.

12:12.960 --> 12:23.280
For Year 2023 OSI DeepDive AI sessions, this is a video caption project. Project created on

12:23.320 --> 12:30.880
November 7th and the project will be completed on February 14th, which means we're still in the

12:30.880 --> 12:41.440
process. Total, there are 17 sessions. We had 10 translators in two groups. Only have two

12:41.440 --> 12:48.400
reviews. So we follow the steps. First, we use the raw video material to get the scripts. And then

12:48.880 --> 12:54.800
we check each word and the sentences by translating ears. We also use like TPL,

12:54.800 --> 13:02.000
charge PTE, quite easy, GNY. This is a Chinese automatic translation platform and YouTube to

13:02.000 --> 13:11.040
help us. We also put the status in translation translated in review under reviewed to identify

13:11.520 --> 13:21.040
the progress of each process. The initial translation finished on December 2nd. Then we

13:21.600 --> 13:29.760
immediately started the first round QA, round QA and final review. Then we have the second group to

13:29.760 --> 13:38.000
help us to publish in different social media like in WeChat as a web pop in China and also in

13:38.000 --> 13:52.720
Facebook and Twitter and YouTube. Sorry, it's too small. See the 17 sessions and we are forcited

13:52.720 --> 14:00.800
the publishing process. We subgrouped the 17 sessions into different groups. We got three

14:01.440 --> 14:07.600
groups. First one is open risk and challenge. And the second one is governance. And the last one

14:07.600 --> 14:16.720
is the fireside track. So for each group, we also got some subgroups. For the year about which

14:16.720 --> 14:25.200
are the sessions, I either reviewed or be a translator. I am the reviewer. So you can see it's

14:25.200 --> 14:37.840
almost half of the sessions. So this is project management system in Chinese. That's my role.

14:37.840 --> 14:45.040
So you can see the yellow bar is my role. And here the arrows pointed to the different process.

14:45.040 --> 14:52.960
First one that means reviewed. And this one means in translation. So we can identify the process

14:52.960 --> 14:58.000
because the team members, we will work together and work on different cities.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.400
Okay, here comes the lessons I learned.

15:07.440 --> 15:14.720
We need to check subtitles versus warriors to make sure every word matched. It is very time consuming.

15:14.720 --> 15:21.840
For the video session, usually like if it is 30 minute session, we usually take about

15:23.040 --> 15:34.400
10 or more than 10 times time for a 30 minute session. We need like 6 or 7 hours for the

15:34.400 --> 15:43.440
check. Because subtitle has 120 character length restriction for bad audience sense of reading.

15:43.440 --> 15:51.040
So we need to split every sentence, longer than 120 characters into small parts and also split

15:51.120 --> 15:58.480
the subtitle time frame. The split caused some subtitles didn't show up because the time frame

15:58.480 --> 16:05.360
didn't match. So we need to listen every word very carefully and adjust the corresponding time frame

16:05.360 --> 16:18.000
into secondary seconds, which is 100 seconds. So it's a time consuming. Especially when some

16:18.720 --> 16:24.160
adjectives and longer sentences come up, we need to adjust the front and back word time frames

16:25.120 --> 16:26.800
next to get perfect effects.

16:31.280 --> 16:42.080
Here are some links of some published sessions. See Facebook, Twitter and let's we check.

16:48.400 --> 16:56.160
Team build the strategy. Right now we have more than 50 translators. Most of them come from

16:57.680 --> 17:08.720
universities, some students in Europe. So team leaders recruit some new translators from various

17:08.720 --> 17:13.680
sources, companies, universities. Then new translators will introduce to team members.

17:14.320 --> 17:22.880
Every member assigns the workload by identifying tasks by one theory. So you can just okay when

17:22.880 --> 17:31.920
the project comes up, you just pick whatever task you want to get involved with. Then we have basic

17:31.920 --> 17:37.200
benchmark scoring system, student trial period to record every member's performance.

17:37.520 --> 17:42.640
For the benefits, we each code tokens for technique on the long technical

17:42.640 --> 17:48.960
contributors. For those team members who have good performance, we grant them the

17:48.960 --> 17:55.120
privilege to use community resources such as DPL and the crowdfunding platform.

17:58.960 --> 18:05.680
Community also provided the chances to team members as a voluntary for each year's

18:05.760 --> 18:13.040
conference. And the students can also add the voluntary experience to resume.

18:14.960 --> 18:19.600
So here is the code K token system. But that's in Chinese.

18:22.160 --> 18:29.120
Upside is for technical translators. Low side is for non-technical translators. We got like

18:29.760 --> 18:35.840
ABC three different kinds of tokens. You use the tokens, you can

18:38.080 --> 18:43.920
to cooperate with open source community for different kinds of like Hexen,

18:43.920 --> 18:47.120
like different kinds of events. You can join the events.

18:50.240 --> 18:57.280
Here is the basic benchmark system. We have a different contribution type like

18:58.240 --> 19:04.880
principal, helper, consultant, informer. For each different role, we have basic score weight.

19:06.240 --> 19:14.480
So the benchmark score value is 10. So after you just use the score value 10 times by

19:15.520 --> 19:22.880
score weight, you get the basic score for different roles. Then here is the task management system

19:23.840 --> 19:32.880
for the team members you join the project. We use the system to calculate the contribution score.

19:35.920 --> 19:42.080
Finally, we sum up all the scores of your contributions. You can see on the top one is

19:42.080 --> 19:52.320
my name. I got 51. So they grant me some privilege. I can use the crowdfunding, I can use DPL.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.080
Some AI translation tools help me.

20:00.560 --> 20:04.000
Okay, here's my Apache Open Meetings Translation.

20:07.760 --> 20:13.920
Apache Open Meetings, may I ask, have anybody heard about the project or used the project before?

20:15.280 --> 20:22.000
Never have I heard? Okay, this online video conference system. Originally, it is

20:22.960 --> 20:33.120
from European. It is Apache project. It is only fully web browser based open source video

20:33.120 --> 20:39.200
conference system. No need to download apps, no need client-side installation. You can

20:39.200 --> 20:45.920
create a middle server for remote collaboration. The server can be installed either locally or

20:45.920 --> 20:53.840
via container. But I recommend use locally because if you're not very familiar with container,

20:53.840 --> 20:57.920
in the installation or in the configuration process, probably you've got to trouble, right?

20:57.920 --> 21:03.040
Sometimes, you know, if you do not do the commit, you probably will lose the original configuration data.

21:06.320 --> 21:10.800
Usually, we need to install the server behind the term server for NAT configuration

21:10.800 --> 21:17.440
for the whole function. Otherwise, you cannot use system. The system supports multi-language.

21:17.440 --> 21:26.720
The latest version now is 7.2.0. It supports 39 different languages.

21:29.920 --> 21:36.320
So, for the translation website, we cannot use just like Google Translators. You can

21:36.880 --> 21:42.880
use Google Translators for static website. But that's interactive, right? It's an interactive

21:42.880 --> 21:51.520
website. We've got actions. We've got scripts. So, you can only use the original, use the building

21:51.520 --> 21:57.680
framework to change the language. So, you need to change the labels and text strings. All language

21:57.680 --> 22:03.600
strings should be localized and stored in the language section. You have full future language

22:03.600 --> 22:08.720
editor with every installation of open meetings. So, you need to check out the language editor

22:09.440 --> 22:15.360
to look up the label IDs in the GUI. Just you need to run the open meetings client with the debug

22:15.360 --> 22:21.120
model. You cannot use the deploying model. The way every text string has label ID in

22:21.120 --> 22:28.720
places additionally in the text field. Later on, I'm going to show you the difference between the

22:28.720 --> 22:40.800
deploying model and the debug model. Sorry, this one. So, the upside image is the original

22:42.320 --> 22:51.840
language, this configuration file in Chinese. So, okay, when I first started,

22:52.800 --> 23:00.000
this is the one issue I found. I sent the issue to the JIRA for Apache. So, I said, okay, this

23:00.000 --> 23:05.600
configuration file didn't work. Some labels didn't get translated. They said, okay, you can do

23:05.600 --> 23:11.760
translation and you can send the file to the JIRA and we're going to update the source.

23:13.520 --> 23:17.920
See, can you see the difference between the first image and the second image? There is one

23:18.560 --> 23:25.840
actual space, right? You can see here, braces, the number braces, but upside means braces, space,

23:26.400 --> 23:34.400
braces. So, they used the file compare, found this problem and send emails to the group,

23:34.400 --> 23:39.760
to the email list. There is an issue in Chinese translation, actual space characters. So, that's

23:41.040 --> 23:46.560
not the lesson I learned, which means for the translation file, you cannot change anything

23:46.560 --> 23:50.400
except the translated content. You cannot even add one more space.

23:55.760 --> 24:02.960
Okay, I almost finished my presentation and there is some time left and I'm going to show

24:02.960 --> 24:10.240
very quickly about the debug model and the debug model. So, here is my contact information and my

24:10.240 --> 24:27.920
emails. This is my website. Okay, excuse me.

24:40.240 --> 24:50.240
I used that mean log in system.

24:55.760 --> 25:03.040
This is already Chinese version because we set the added profile here. I already set the

25:03.600 --> 25:10.800
language in Chinese, set time zone in Asian Singapore, but here you cannot see every

25:11.680 --> 25:18.880
label. There is no label ID, right? No label ID. So, how can I bring out the label ID? Because

25:18.880 --> 25:26.400
if you want to change, if you have no label ID, okay, let me bring back to English so you can read it.

25:33.200 --> 25:51.520
So,

25:51.520 --> 25:53.520
current password request.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.520
Okay, we'll change.

26:04.520 --> 26:06.520
Every time you change the language configuration,

26:06.520 --> 26:11.520
it will take effect immediately after you log in and log out again.

26:22.520 --> 26:27.520
So now you can see the interface already changed to English, right?

26:27.520 --> 26:31.520
But for each label, like if I wanted to do translation,

26:31.520 --> 26:36.520
so if you don't know the label ID, you need the Geltron Language Editor,

26:36.520 --> 26:41.520
you need find the corresponding language file,

26:41.520 --> 26:43.520
which is...

26:46.520 --> 26:49.520
We got a language configuration file here.

26:50.520 --> 26:54.520
So you can see total is 39 different language files, right?

26:54.520 --> 26:57.520
For example, for Chinese, that's 11.

26:57.520 --> 27:02.520
And also you can change it to French or to Dutch.

27:05.520 --> 27:14.520
So for example, if I want to change like a project website, right?

27:14.520 --> 27:16.520
If you want to rebranding or to do something,

27:16.520 --> 27:19.520
if you want to change this one, if you have no label ID,

27:19.520 --> 27:21.520
you got to remember the text ID.

27:21.520 --> 27:26.520
So go to the language editor, go to the...

27:28.520 --> 27:30.520
Then you need the remember.

27:30.520 --> 27:33.520
I remember because I test many times, I remember the label ID.

27:33.520 --> 27:38.520
It's 282, so you can change it here, right?

27:41.520 --> 27:44.520
Okay, then let's see the deploying model.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.520
Oh, so...

28:06.520 --> 28:11.520
There is a configuration file, WIPER.xml here,

28:11.520 --> 28:15.520
so you need to go to your WIPER.xml,

28:15.520 --> 28:22.520
then you search the deploying model.

28:26.520 --> 28:30.520
You can see that's a deploying model.

28:30.520 --> 28:34.520
You need to change the deploying to the development model.

28:45.520 --> 28:55.520
To deploy model, now the added command...

28:55.520 --> 28:58.520
Oh, sorry, small case.

29:04.520 --> 29:05.520
Okay.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.520
Now you can see we change it, right?

29:09.520 --> 29:11.520
Change and then...

29:17.520 --> 29:22.520
Come out, then restart the server.

29:22.520 --> 29:27.520
Okay.

29:37.520 --> 29:40.520
We restart the server, then...

29:52.520 --> 29:54.520
I need to...

30:00.520 --> 30:03.520
I need to make sure the server is start up.

30:07.520 --> 30:09.520
Okay, so we start.

30:09.520 --> 30:13.520
Then I used admin to login again.

30:22.520 --> 30:29.520
You only need to be slow.

30:35.520 --> 30:38.520
Let's sort install the virtual machine,

30:38.520 --> 30:43.520
so all the memory is already exhausted, almost exhausted,

30:43.520 --> 30:46.520
so you only need to be slow, sorry.

30:53.520 --> 30:59.520
Do the thing.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.520
Sorry.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.520
Some bad things happened.

31:23.520 --> 31:34.520
Okay, now you can see this is in the DIPWIPER model.

31:34.520 --> 31:38.520
See, from here you can see each text label,

31:38.520 --> 31:41.520
you got a label ID, right?

31:41.520 --> 31:43.520
So if you want to change the label,

31:43.520 --> 31:45.520
you just go to your language editor,

31:45.520 --> 31:47.520
find the label ID number, change it,

31:47.520 --> 31:49.520
then you can get a different version.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.520
Okay, thanks.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.520
I finished my presentation.

31:55.520 --> 31:59.520
If you got any questions, I would be more than happy to answer.

32:00.520 --> 32:02.520
Thank you.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.520
So translating the open source report,

32:20.520 --> 32:26.520
what was the format of the files that you used as a translator?

32:26.520 --> 32:29.520
Was it Google Docs, was it PO,

32:29.520 --> 32:34.520
was it actually for what you used in which format?

32:34.520 --> 32:40.520
For the source file, we upload the file to the Google Documents,

32:40.520 --> 32:44.520
and each team members, if you want to identify which part

32:44.520 --> 32:48.520
you want to translate, you just label,

32:48.520 --> 32:51.520
select text and say, okay, this part I'm going to do it.

32:52.520 --> 32:56.520
So the translator works directly in the Google Docs?

32:56.520 --> 32:57.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:57.520 --> 33:01.520
Translate it, we got no problem to access the Google Documents

33:01.520 --> 33:05.520
because almost everybody we use the VPN, you know.

33:06.520 --> 33:08.520
Good question.

33:08.520 --> 33:10.520
Thanks.

33:13.520 --> 33:18.520
You have some way to detect space issues

33:18.520 --> 33:23.520
or using the maybe double width character

33:23.520 --> 33:28.520
instead of the format character, the spaces?

33:28.520 --> 33:31.520
Yeah, for the spaces,

33:31.520 --> 33:36.520
I'm not 100% sure how the project leader he found the spaces,

33:36.520 --> 33:40.520
but I know some guys, they use the file compression.

33:40.520 --> 33:44.520
Like in VSS Studio, there is a file compression function.

33:44.520 --> 33:47.520
You can use the file compression to compare the source file

33:47.520 --> 33:50.520
and the translation file to find the extra space.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.520
Yeah, I don't appreciate it.

33:59.520 --> 34:04.520
Do you use translation memory to speed up your translation process?

34:04.520 --> 34:06.520
Excuse me?

34:06.520 --> 34:08.520
Can you repeat the question again?

34:08.520 --> 34:13.520
Do you use translation memory to speed up your translation process?

34:14.520 --> 34:17.520
When you have a good question,

34:17.520 --> 34:22.520
I guess the translation memory is the crowding function.

34:22.520 --> 34:26.520
Crowding, you use such kind of translation memory, right?

34:26.520 --> 34:28.520
Yeah, we use translation memory.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.520
That's the building function.

34:30.520 --> 34:34.520
And we also use machine translation,

34:34.520 --> 34:41.520
which is AI tools such as child GPT or Microsoft translator,

34:41.520 --> 34:44.520
which do the integration with the platform.

34:51.520 --> 34:52.520
Thank you.

34:52.520 --> 34:54.520
Thank you very much.

34:54.520 --> 34:56.520
Thanks.

34:56.520 --> 34:58.520
Thank you.

35:26.520 --> 35:28.520
Thank you.
