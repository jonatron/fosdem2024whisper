00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
Thank you.

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
Thank you.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.000
My name is Nico Riecke and I'll give it to Lucas to start it off.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.480
Hello everybody and welcome.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.800
I'm very glad to be here.

00:14.800 --> 00:17.800
Thank you for the organizers to invite us to this talk.

00:17.800 --> 00:23.960
I'm very happy to see that there are a lot of interest to DMA because we have been working

00:23.960 --> 00:29.000
already on this for some time and I would like to contestalize all the problems that

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
we already started hearing here about interoperability, about security, about having access to infrastructure

00:36.000 --> 00:42.600
from the telecom perspective because together with Nico we would like to prompt you with

00:42.600 --> 00:48.040
our experience on advocacy on routers.

00:48.040 --> 00:53.560
And I think that contestalizing this example on routers and router freedom in Europe can

00:53.560 --> 00:59.120
help us to understand a little bit better what expects us when we start dealing with

00:59.120 --> 01:02.360
smartphones from the DMA perspective.

01:02.360 --> 01:09.600
So let's talk about end user control of devices, this contestalization about the DMA and telecom

01:09.600 --> 01:17.160
and then I will give the word to Nico so he can tell us our experience with router freedom.

01:17.160 --> 01:24.240
So the first question I would like to ask us, do we have control of our devices?

01:24.240 --> 01:30.640
Devices are becoming ubiquitous, we are using that for everything in life but I have the

01:30.640 --> 01:34.080
feeling that we are losing control over our devices.

01:34.080 --> 01:41.680
We cannot change the battery, we cannot uninstall the programs, we cannot even install programs.

01:41.680 --> 01:48.600
Today people call it side loading but in laptop we cannot, we don't call that side loading

01:48.600 --> 01:51.440
because we are just downloading and installing.

01:51.440 --> 01:56.400
But well big tech now says to us that if we wanted to install something outside Dev Store

01:56.400 --> 01:58.240
we needed to side load.

01:58.240 --> 02:02.000
This is not good for software freedom but let's talk about that.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.560
So I think that we are losing a little bit control of our devices and here are some key

02:07.560 --> 02:11.280
aspects of gatekeeper control of our devices.

02:11.720 --> 02:17.280
They are imposing online accounts us so if we wanted to use our devices they say first

02:17.280 --> 02:19.800
you need to create an account with me.

02:19.800 --> 02:25.800
And then I think when I bought my Android phone I was prompt, the first thing that I

02:25.800 --> 02:31.280
showed in the screen was you need to create an online account.

02:31.280 --> 02:38.240
Then when we use our smartphones we are already trapped into vendor lock-in because we have

02:38.240 --> 02:42.400
no access to third parties repositories and app stores.

02:42.400 --> 02:48.800
And this is really key because on these repositories is where we can find apps and we can exercise

02:48.800 --> 02:55.360
our software freedom in order to populate our devices with our software.

02:55.360 --> 03:02.560
And last but not least we are not free even to uninstall software that comes to our devices.

03:02.560 --> 03:09.120
And we check that sometimes on drive devices or iOS devices there are a list of apps there

03:09.120 --> 03:12.720
that is draining our battery and they are doing stuff because it's proprietary but we

03:12.720 --> 03:16.920
don't have access to the source code so we have absolutely no clue what is happening there.

03:16.920 --> 03:22.680
So based on these facts I think that we are losing control of our devices.

03:22.680 --> 03:27.680
And therefore some questions that I would like to prompt the audience and perhaps in

03:27.680 --> 03:33.560
the coming moments of the workshop we need to answer is that how we can re-empower users

03:33.560 --> 03:35.280
to have control of our devices.

03:35.280 --> 03:41.440
So we already heard that DMA is a very important piece of that and I believe so I think DMA

03:41.440 --> 03:43.600
is crucial but we need to go further.

03:43.600 --> 03:50.120
First, we need to recognize that devices or ecosystems are mostly proprietary.

03:50.120 --> 03:55.760
So the largest two operating systems smartphones they are proprietary, Android and iOS they

03:55.760 --> 03:56.960
are proprietary.

03:57.640 --> 04:03.720
And therefore being that and since they are so large we are calling the gatekeepers due

04:03.720 --> 04:07.200
to the monopolistic power over termination bottlenecks.

04:07.200 --> 04:12.680
So basically everything that we needed to do with this device we need to go through this

04:12.680 --> 04:14.680
company.

04:14.680 --> 04:21.280
That's why we are calling a monopoly over the term features of these devices such as

04:21.280 --> 04:24.960
one example operating systems, browsers and app stores.

04:24.960 --> 04:30.520
And of course we hear them since they have this power of devices they can hinder interoperability

04:30.520 --> 04:35.320
and they exercise type controls of APIs, apply proprietary standards that we heard today,

04:35.320 --> 04:38.960
hampering functionalism, block access to drives and hardware.

04:38.960 --> 04:43.960
So in the FSFE, the Free Software Foundation Europe we have been working on a concept that

04:43.960 --> 04:45.960
we call the device neutrality.

04:45.960 --> 04:54.240
And this we want to re-empower users and to give control over devices back to them by

04:54.320 --> 05:01.120
software freedom, eliminating vendor lock-in and giving end users control over data.

05:01.120 --> 05:06.800
And last but not least I would just quickly because I'm a lawyer and I would like to point

05:06.800 --> 05:11.160
to what is happening nowadays in the EU, right?

05:11.160 --> 05:17.000
So for 10 years we have been working on the open internet regulation also called the net

05:17.000 --> 05:18.760
neutrality regulation.

05:18.760 --> 05:23.520
And this regulation had very clear rules over internet access devices.

05:23.520 --> 05:29.760
So it applies to routers, modens and other internet access devices.

05:29.760 --> 05:37.760
Then in 2018 there was a reform of the telecom law in Europe called the European Electronic

05:38.280 --> 05:40.320
Communications Code.

05:40.320 --> 05:47.040
And it then implemented some rules over iOS, over operating systems and apps and also to

05:47.040 --> 05:48.400
network operators.

05:48.400 --> 05:55.200
But now comes the DMA with rules over devices and operating systems and apps.

05:55.200 --> 06:00.400
And in order to contest to allies all these challenges I would like then to give the word

06:00.400 --> 06:06.960
now to Nico, I'm sorry, so we can learn a little bit how DMA can connect to that from

06:06.960 --> 06:09.400
the perspective of routers.

06:09.400 --> 06:15.320
Okay, as a case study, yeah, yeah.

06:15.320 --> 06:19.880
Routers of freedom, well, my wife and I were really excited.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.840
We got our first house, we were moving in together so we had to prepare for the move

06:23.840 --> 06:26.160
and one of the things we had to do was get an internet contract.

06:26.160 --> 06:30.720
And we didn't think much of it, we were doing some comparisons and said okay we got this

06:30.720 --> 06:32.400
contract.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.720
It was some all in one provider and you could recognize it from the box, it was an all in

06:36.720 --> 06:40.920
one box, it was a TV, telephony and internet.

06:40.920 --> 06:47.160
But also outside of being a box that did everything, it was a modem, a router and it

06:47.160 --> 06:48.320
did so badly.

06:48.320 --> 06:52.560
It filled quite a bit of times at a certain point, it filled entirely and we had to wait

06:52.560 --> 06:56.320
three days without any of the services to get a replacement.

06:56.320 --> 06:59.800
But after another failure getting dropped out of an internet call I said okay this is

06:59.800 --> 07:04.760
it, I'm going to get a router myself so I know I can trust it and it's reliable.

07:04.760 --> 07:08.600
But I found out that this internet provider didn't really support that.

07:08.600 --> 07:12.840
It was all to me because previously it was on a telephone network connection and they

07:12.840 --> 07:17.560
were even advertising that you could use your own router and modem and some of my friends

07:17.560 --> 07:18.560
were doing so.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.760
Also if you would call them for support they say are you using your own modem?

07:22.760 --> 07:27.840
They would just assume there was something you could do but not with this provider.

07:27.840 --> 07:33.480
So that was all then I learned about router freedom and of course there's a lot of benefits

07:33.480 --> 07:34.480
here on the slide.

07:34.480 --> 07:39.640
Some personal but also some in the grander scheme of things like competition and creating

07:39.640 --> 07:42.880
a healthy ecosystem of devices.

07:42.880 --> 07:47.960
Now internet providers put up quite some barriers to prevent you from exercising router freedom,

07:47.960 --> 07:50.960
the ability to choose your own modem and router.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.400
Some of them actually have some technical merit.

07:54.400 --> 07:58.840
For example the telephone network is laid out differently than a coaxial network.

07:58.840 --> 08:04.440
If your modems are doing bad things on a television network, the coax network, as the lines are

08:04.560 --> 08:08.920
shared you might interfere with the devices of your neighbors.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.800
But that of course is why we have standards.

08:11.800 --> 08:16.920
If your device is compliant and the standard you can get one from the store, plug it in

08:16.920 --> 08:21.600
and it will work and there's no reason to deny you those freedoms.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.360
Actually one of my FSV friends said oh it works just fine.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.200
I have these and these devices running at some friends.

08:28.200 --> 08:32.720
I could really recommend to use your own router and get the freedom you want.

08:32.720 --> 08:35.960
So it wasn't really a technical barrier.

08:35.960 --> 08:41.400
Now at the FSV we've been at this for 10 years as Lukas said and we keep an interactive

08:41.400 --> 08:46.720
map keeping all the states and working with regulators to ensure that router freedom is

08:46.720 --> 08:49.120
actually achieved.

08:49.120 --> 08:54.200
One thing in 2015 is that we had the EU net neutrality act and it was like yeah, Inno

08:54.200 --> 08:58.880
says users should be able to replace or change their device.

08:58.880 --> 09:04.720
So you think okay router freedom everything is good but not unless the regulators regulate.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.480
That's the main thing and that's why we have this map to keep up with the regulator and

09:08.480 --> 09:10.200
the state.

09:10.200 --> 09:16.000
Now about two years ago in Belgium there was a consultation about modemvrijheid, a freie

09:16.000 --> 09:20.600
modemköser, basically the ability to choose your own modem.

09:20.600 --> 09:24.760
There was a consultation and I saw this like okay we have to get in on this even though

09:24.760 --> 09:28.520
I'm from the Netherlands, I care about this, I can do in Dutch.

09:28.520 --> 09:33.880
We got a different volunteer, some from Belgium, and together with Lukas we responded.

09:33.880 --> 09:39.400
We were quite alone initially not having other parties that had the technical knowledge

09:39.400 --> 09:44.240
to go through this legislation and have the community behind them.

09:44.240 --> 09:49.600
But eventually through a survey we were able to actually engage the crowd and come over

09:49.600 --> 09:52.800
the argument and we achieved router freedom.

09:52.800 --> 09:57.800
So shortly here are some examples of people in our community using their routers at home

09:57.800 --> 10:01.400
to also establish the practice of router freedom.

10:01.400 --> 10:05.800
There's also benefit of free software on routers but that's something else.

10:05.800 --> 10:11.440
And myself I now happily using fiber with my own router and Lukas if you want to wrap

10:11.440 --> 10:12.440
it up.

10:12.440 --> 10:20.920
Yeah, so yes, so it's a big win when we have router freedom and we fought against the operators

10:20.920 --> 10:26.480
that and they always came to say that interoperability is a problem, security is a problem.

10:26.480 --> 10:31.480
But with router freedom we could prove that this cannot be a problem and I hope that with

10:31.480 --> 10:36.720
our discussion with DMA we can bring our experience and say that we can also overcome this problem.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.240
Thank you very much.
