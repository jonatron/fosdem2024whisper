WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
All right.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Hey, everybody.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
Welcome to the Web Performance Dev Room.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
I facilitated this year with Missyla and Wickey Media.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
We're going to go ahead and get straight into it.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
And I'm going to introduce Baz Skroten.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
And, yeah, I'll pass this over.

00:19.000 --> 00:28.000
In Yemen, the cost of a gigabyte of data is approximately 6,000.

00:28.000 --> 00:32.000
A gigabyte of data is approximately $16.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
In Chad, the cost of a gigabyte of data is around $20.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.000
In Yemen, the average income, or the median income, is about $250 a month.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
In Chad, the median income is about $60 a month.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Hundreds of millions of people in the world live in areas

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
where they spend a significant portion of their income on their data bundles.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Often, lack stable charging facilities,

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
and they can only imagine what it would be like to have the kind of high end,

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
or even mid-end devices that people like you, I, or anyone else in this room have.

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
Often, when we think about performance, we're thinking of making our websites faster.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
We're looking at making them faster and more fun to use

01:19.000 --> 01:25.000
in order to improve our conversion rates to sell more products.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm Bas Faldan. I am a principal engineer at Mozilla,

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
and I am the tech lead for Firefox Performance,

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
and I'm going to talk about how performance is so much more than that.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm sure that most of you are familiar with countless statistics

01:40.000 --> 01:47.000
about the limited means that the poorest half of the world's population live with.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
There can be no doubt that those people deserve the same access to information

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
as you, I, or anyone in this room.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
Understanding the importance of that information equity

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
means understanding the importance of web performance.

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
When we're talking about performance, we're usually talking about one of three things.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
The primary thing, and the most obvious one, is speed.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Speed is about how fast and how smooth

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
the results of a user's interaction with your sites or services

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
actually renders on their device.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
Another aspect of that that sort of directly leads into that is data usage.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Obviously, before you've actually sent the data to the device,

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
there is no way that they're actually going to be able to see what you're about to render.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.000
But something that's a little bit less obvious is that power usage

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
is also an important aspect of performance.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
Not only are you going to help the environment by using less power,

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
but you're going to extend the lifetime of people's devices,

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
making their batteries last longer, but also causing them to heat up less,

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
have less fan spin up, keeping the devices more comfortable to use,

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
and decreasing the wear and tear and increasing the longevity.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
And finally, you're going to reduce the amount of heat, obviously.

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
In the time we have together, I want to talk about how people living with more limited means

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
are at a disadvantage for all three of these pillars of performance,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
and specifically also web performance.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
We'll go over what the global landscape looks like

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
and the situation, particularly in the global south,

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
that people are dealing with when we're thinking about some of these things.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
I'm confident that you will be left more motivated

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
to improve your sites and services,

03:47.000 --> 03:54.000
and as a result, you'll pay extra close attention to the speakers that are here the rest of this day.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
For now, the first thing I want to talk about is raw speed.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
When I talk about raw speed, what I mean is the performance of the CPU

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
of the device that we're talking about.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
This is basically how quickly, once a device has all the instructions

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
that it needs to render something onto the screen, how quickly can it do that?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
What does that look like?

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Well, over here, I've compiled a list of the most common, most popular smartphones

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
for Africa versus Europe.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Now, getting good public data for Africa is actually kind of hard,

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
but that's not too important right now.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
The most important thing is that this list for the phones in Africa

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
is probably a lot for you like it was for me.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
This high sense, what now? I've never heard of these things, right?

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
And the important thing here is the trend.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Most of these devices on the list for Africa, or actually almost every single one of them,

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
is at least 2x to 3x slower than devices we see here.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
And do not let their names fool you.

04:59.000 --> 05:06.000
That Itel S23, that cute naming trick, that device is nothing like the same model from Samsung.

05:09.000 --> 05:17.000
So what that means is that if my LCP takes 500 milliseconds of CPU time,

05:17.000 --> 05:23.000
delivering that same LCP in another part of the world will take at least a second.

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
Now, we know that LCP impacts conversion rates quite significantly.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.000
A one-second improvement to LCP means a 27% of improvement to conversion rates.

05:33.000 --> 05:41.000
And that does not just mean, that is not just about how fast or how likely you are to sell your products.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
It's also about how likely people are to access the information that you are looking to present to them.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
And of course, this is not limited to the global south.

05:55.000 --> 06:02.000
The performance improvement that that Samsung S23 offers over that Itel S23 comes at a hefty price tag.

06:03.000 --> 06:11.000
With a Samsung S23 costing over 650 euros and an Itel S23 costing under 150.

06:11.000 --> 06:18.000
It doesn't take a genius to know which class of society is more likely to own one device over the other.

06:21.000 --> 06:28.000
But obviously, the raw performance of the devices is not the only thing that is different here,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
where most of us live, and in the global south.

06:32.000 --> 06:39.000
And there are other aspects of those differences that have a much more direct impact on people living with more limited means.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
And the most important one there that I'm going to talk about is data usage.

06:45.000 --> 06:51.000
Let's take a look at what the global landscape looks like when it comes to data usage.

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
I've pulled a list off Wikipedia here for the countries with the slowest mobile data connections.

06:57.000 --> 07:06.000
One of the first things you'll notice here is that the mobile speed of none of these countries exceeds 20 megabits a second,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
or about 2.4 megabytes, right?

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
And for some of these, the landlines don't even exceed 1 megabyte a second.

07:15.000 --> 07:24.000
But an important thing to note here is that this list from Wikipedia is built based on results from speedtest.net.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
Now, we can sort of assume that people aren't likely to run speedtest.net when they're not actually trying in a good connection situation.

07:33.000 --> 07:44.000
And we can see that because even the slowest here, 3 megabits per second, that's almost a maximum speed of 3G.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.000
3G has a maximum speed of about 500 kilobytes per second.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And let's look at that a little bit.

07:52.000 --> 08:05.000
Displayed here is a 4G coverage map for one of the major carriers in Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa with a population of approximately 225 million.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
What you can see here is that outside the major population centers, there's not much.

08:13.000 --> 08:20.000
And a lot of that on the really less densely populated areas isn't even 2G.

08:20.000 --> 08:29.000
So you can assume that a lot of these people, the fastest connections that they could possibly have access to are about 500 kilobytes a second.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.000
Now, let's compare that to a 4G coverage map by the FCC of the United States of America.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.000
Unless you're visiting a national park, you're probably going to have 4G.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
And if not, you're still going to get 3G.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
That's a very different situation.

08:49.000 --> 09:01.000
But now, of course, the speed of mobile data transfer is not the only component here, which is different between here and western countries and the global south.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
A more pronounced impact your users will experience through cost.

09:08.000 --> 09:16.000
Visualized here is the cost per gigabyte of mobile data.

09:16.000 --> 09:21.000
If we look at Chod, the cost of a gigabyte of data is over $20.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
If we look at the United States, that cost is less than $10.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
And in most European countries, the cost lies even lower.

09:31.000 --> 09:39.000
But even if we ignore the outliers, it's important to realize that the global average is roughly $4 per gigabyte.

09:40.000 --> 09:45.000
Compare that to a global median income of about $300 a month.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
Half of the population has to do with less than that.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
So let's think about that for a second and think back to the introduction of the talk.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
A gigabyte of mobile data in Chod costs about $20.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.000
A monthly income in Chod is about $60.

10:07.000 --> 10:19.000
That means that if your site ships one megabyte to the median user in Chod, that costs them about 0.03% of their income.

10:20.000 --> 10:31.000
If your website takes about three megabytes per visit and a user visits it once a day, that will cost that user about 1% of their income.

10:32.000 --> 10:36.000
Now, to make that even a little bit more concrete, I went to bbc.com.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I looked at about five articles and I read them.

10:41.000 --> 10:45.000
During that time, bbc.com consumed about 17 megabytes.

10:46.000 --> 10:58.000
If a median user in Chod chooses to read five articles a day on bbc.com, every day that consumes about 15% of their income.

10:59.000 --> 11:08.000
Add to that the consideration that 95% of sub-Saharan Africa accesses the internet solely through mobile devices.

11:09.000 --> 11:17.000
You can see what an immense impact the data consumption of your websites can have on the disposable income of the people living there.

11:18.000 --> 11:25.000
And of course, when thinking about that data usage, it's not just that you're making it faster.

11:26.000 --> 11:35.000
You're, after all, on 3G, that three megabytes to show your site takes at least six seconds to retrieve.

11:36.000 --> 11:45.000
It's saving you and your user's money, as we already talked about, and it's going to lower the carbon impact of your sites and services.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
And talking about carbon impact, let's talk a little bit more about power.

11:52.000 --> 12:00.000
When we're thinking about optimizing power, we shouldn't just think about reducing the power usage by making our websites render faster.

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
Obviously, if your website consumes less CPU, it's also going to use less power.

12:06.000 --> 12:13.000
But more impactful for power is, what are we doing when a user isn't really actively interacting with our websites?

12:14.000 --> 12:20.000
We should be avoiding animations, videos, or animated ads when a user is just reading on our sites.

12:21.000 --> 12:26.000
Of course, we should be minimizing the amount of JavaScript that's associated with simple interactions.

12:27.000 --> 12:36.000
And this comes with a myriad of benefits, even though those two watt-hours a visit to your site might consume might not sound like much.

12:37.000 --> 12:47.000
If your site has a million visitors, those two watt-hours become 2,000 kilowatt-hours, 2,000 kilowatt-hours a day for your millions of visitors.

12:47.000 --> 12:56.000
The average power consumption per capita, or the per capita power consumption in Africa, is about 150 kilowatt-hours a year.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.000
But when we delve a little deeper, there's a lot of other advantages.

13:05.000 --> 13:11.000
You're going to be decreasing the amount of heat users' devices produce, particularly on slower devices.

13:11.000 --> 13:19.000
You're going to be reducing the amount of fans that spin up, reducing the wear and tear, making them more comfortable to use.

13:20.000 --> 13:27.000
But most importantly, you're going to be reducing or increasing the lifetime of their batteries.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
And this is again the area where particularly the global south is disproportionately affected.

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
There is about 1.1 billion people living in sub-Saharan Africa.

13:39.000 --> 13:48.000
By estimates of the International Energy Agency, about 40% of that 1.1 billion people live without access to electricity.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I want you to stop and think about that.

13:52.000 --> 14:00.000
There are more people living in sub-Saharan Africa without access to electricity than there are living in the United States and Canada combined.

14:01.000 --> 14:08.000
For many others living there, access to electricity is limited and power outages are frequent.

14:10.000 --> 14:18.000
Of course, those people with no access to power are also going to be less likely to have mobile phones.

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
However, for those millions of users that do own mobile phones and do not have access to power, or more limited access to power,

14:26.000 --> 14:32.000
and all those countless users that are going to be coming online over the next decade,

14:33.000 --> 14:37.000
they are often dependent on centralized charging facilities to charge their devices.

14:38.000 --> 14:45.000
Needless to say, for them, their phone running out of battery is a very different situation.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
They're for most of us in this room, where your phone running out of battery means you have to grab a charger, it's a nuisance,

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
or maybe you grab your power bank, right?

14:56.000 --> 15:03.000
So now that we have a better understanding of what the world looks like in terms of the internet, where does that leave us?

15:04.000 --> 15:16.000
The internet is going to play an increasing role in everybody's lives from how you do your taxes and how you are billed by your service providers.

15:17.000 --> 15:27.000
And the potential to do good for the internet is immense there, and that potential can particularly benefit those people and organizations with limited means

15:28.000 --> 15:37.000
by reducing their costs for staffing, travel, and time spent for those people and organizations that are least able to afford that.

15:38.000 --> 15:50.000
At the same time, it reiterates the role that we have as developers to ensure that we have a responsible impact on the most vulnerable communities on the planet.

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
Now, we're here at FOSDEM, which means that hopefully most of us are working on open source projects,

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
and if you're anything like me, other projects, commercial or otherwise, using your code is a great source of pride.

16:09.000 --> 16:17.000
And that means that when we're designing our components, our code, we may not be thinking about those particular use cases.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
We may be thinking about users that are not affected by these particular disadvantages.

16:22.000 --> 16:31.000
However, we have to think about what other projects may be using the code that we're writing and what users they might be reaching out to,

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
and those users may be in those vulnerable positions. Thinking about them means thinking about what performance.

16:39.000 --> 16:52.000
The great news is that the work we do to make our sites faster, make them use less data, and make them use less power isn't just good for those users.

16:53.000 --> 17:00.000
You're going to be making your websites for your users, especially when they're riding a train through a tunnel or riding an elevator.

17:02.000 --> 17:06.000
You're going to be keeping their devices cooler, making them more comfortable to use and making them last longer.

17:07.000 --> 17:20.000
You're going to be helping the environment. The greenhouse gas emissions that are produced by the internet and the devices that we consume it are vastly more than all of global aviation combined.

17:22.000 --> 17:33.000
And of course, this works the other way around as well. When you're making your websites faster for your users here, you're also going to be helping those people in more vulnerable positions.

17:36.000 --> 17:47.000
Since you're all here at this early hour, I'm certain that many of you were thinking about web performance already, and thank you for that, and thank you for being here.

17:48.000 --> 17:57.000
I'm confident that you're going to be even more excited to make all your websites faster, and there are a bunch of great speakers coming up the rest of this morning to help you do exactly that.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Enjoy the rest of your day.

18:06.000 --> 18:15.000
Are there any questions?

18:36.000 --> 18:49.000
It's an interesting question. The answer... Oh, yes. So the question is, what do we do, or what do I do? I guess that means Mozilla, right?

18:50.000 --> 18:59.000
To make sure that Firefox works well on devices with limited CPU. I think the short answer is not enough.

19:00.000 --> 19:15.000
I think that, like probably most of you and most developers out there, almost everyone working on Firefox is on fast devices, fast phones, many, many iPhones where we don't even chip our own engine, right?

19:16.000 --> 19:25.000
And I think that is a hard thing to change. That's a hard mentality to change in the business of software development in general.

19:25.000 --> 19:32.000
We do explicitly test certain low-powered devices and their performance characteristics.

19:33.000 --> 19:50.000
But the global landscape is very diverse. I think that the reality of it is that we tend to work a lot on making Firefox faster and consume less resources on fast CPUs,

19:50.000 --> 19:55.000
and then we hope that translates to a better experience on slow CPUs.

19:56.000 --> 20:06.000
One day, perhaps, we'll have optimizations and work that targets very specifically the different types of CPUs and different compositions of CPUs,

20:07.000 --> 20:15.000
in terms of heterogeneous architectures and things like that, that are more common in the global south, but we do not currently do that.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.000
Anybody else?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
The next speaker has five minutes to set up.
