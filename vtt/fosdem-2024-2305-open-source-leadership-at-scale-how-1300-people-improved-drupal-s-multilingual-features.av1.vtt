00:00.000 --> 00:15.000
Keeping on, keeping on schedule and with one microphone per person.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.720
Gabarhojji, very old friend of mine and open source original.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.640
Drupal Core maintainer several times.

00:26.640 --> 00:33.640
And now talking about a really powerful contribution project in the Drupal community.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.640
Roughly right?

00:35.640 --> 00:40.640
Thank you, Jim. Yeah. Great. Hi everybody.

00:40.640 --> 00:48.640
Thanks for coming. I think it's going to be interesting for everyone hopefully in some degree.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.640
Because this is about open source leadership at scale.

00:52.640 --> 00:56.640
As Jim said, I'm Gabarhojji.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.640
And...

01:00.640 --> 01:04.640
They called it one slide, Gabarhojji.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.640
No, it's done. So I'm Gabarhojji.

01:08.640 --> 01:12.640
My own made up title is Full Stack Community Organizer.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.640
Which means that I can put on an event for you.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.640
I can manage social media, design graphics, do a keynote,

01:20.640 --> 01:25.640
build developer tools and like basically everything in between.

01:25.640 --> 01:29.640
Write marketing copy and do everything in between.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.640
So whatever is needed at the time.

01:31.640 --> 01:35.640
So I've also been working with Drupal since 2003.

01:35.640 --> 01:39.640
Much like Mathias with Type or 3 since 2003.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.640
Just picked a different system.

01:41.640 --> 01:46.640
But it's around the same time and I'm a Drupal core committer and did a bunch of stuff that are...

01:46.640 --> 01:49.640
That helped in getting here where I am now.

01:49.640 --> 01:53.640
But I'm more interested right now in where you are coming from.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.640
Who's using Drupal for anything in the room?

01:56.640 --> 02:00.640
Alright, some of you who have no idea what Drupal is.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.640
Just here for the title because it was nice.

02:03.640 --> 02:07.640
Okay, I didn't explain Drupal that much. That's great.

02:07.640 --> 02:12.640
Who are you consider yourself primarily developers?

02:12.640 --> 02:14.640
Okay, great.

02:14.640 --> 02:20.640
Nice. So those were the main questions that I wanted to have so I can direct the talk properly for the audience.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.640
So I got into open source from open content.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.640
In the 1990s I went to high school.

02:27.640 --> 02:33.640
And the high school got dial-in modems and we got on the internet.

02:33.640 --> 02:36.640
And I was really interested in how we can publish stuff on the internet.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.640
How we can put something on the internet.

02:38.640 --> 02:45.640
And I decided to be the lazy teacher that reads five pages ahead and then teaches everybody else what they learned.

02:45.640 --> 02:56.640
So I started looking at how is this done and started to go into documentation and started to translate the W3C standards into Hungarian.

02:56.640 --> 03:00.640
And then the PHP documentation into Hungarian.

03:00.640 --> 03:05.640
And then distributing that and then starting to look for news and articles and translate those.

03:05.640 --> 03:09.640
Summarize and translate those into Hungarian and publish it for the Hungarian community.

03:09.640 --> 03:15.640
And so it basically turned out to be a thing where I needed to set up a website to publish all of these things.

03:15.640 --> 03:23.640
And I got together with a person in Vienna, Shandor Shromkuti, who I've never met ever in my life, ever since.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.640
Now we work together very well online.

03:26.640 --> 03:31.640
And we created this website called Vabla Bor that was hosting these things.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.640
And I went on a side quest with the PHP community.

03:34.640 --> 03:42.640
I became the lead of the PHP documentation and the lead of the PHP.net website in the beginning of the 2000s.

03:42.640 --> 03:47.640
And growing this Hungarian community website as well.

03:47.640 --> 03:55.640
But the Hungarian website grew out so much that we needed some kind of system to manage the community, to publish these things,

03:55.640 --> 03:59.640
manage the forums that we've had and the meetups that we had.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.640
And so we needed to have some system that managed this.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.640
And that's where I found Drupal.

04:04.640 --> 04:08.640
And Drupal was tiny and nice.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.640
And this was the whole Drupal conference in 2005, all the attendees.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.640
There's a certain person sitting there.

04:15.640 --> 04:19.640
So it was a tiny community that was very tight-knit.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.640
And we would get together.

04:21.640 --> 04:26.640
The software was managed through a mailing list where you would post a patch to the mailing list.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.640
And it was reviewed on the mailing list and then committed to CVS.

04:30.640 --> 04:36.640
So it was very tight-knit and everything was reviewed by these few people.

04:36.640 --> 04:39.640
And so it was very easy to join.

04:39.640 --> 04:42.640
And I needed it for a Hungarian website.

04:42.640 --> 04:47.640
So my main problems that I would go in and fix were usually about translatability into Hungarian.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.640
Or I wanted to have the path aliases in Hungarian.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.640
I wanted to have everything in Hungarian.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.640
And I always bumped into bugs and I submitted bugs and they got fixed.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.640
So I fixed them, then they got committed.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.640
So that was basically the natural way to get into the community.

05:02.640 --> 05:09.640
Small was easy to approach and they would receive those fixes very well.

05:09.640 --> 05:16.640
Fast forward, ten years later, this was the Drupal conference ten years later,

05:16.640 --> 05:19.640
there's people up there as well.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.640
They're hard to notice.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.640
So this is Drupal condomber.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.640
So it's kind of hard to get started in this community.

05:25.640 --> 05:30.640
Like who do you walk up to that I have this bug and please work with me on fixing this bug?

05:30.640 --> 05:31.640
It doesn't work.

05:31.640 --> 05:33.640
Like there's no way to do that.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.640
Like, I don't know, it's hard.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.640
It's like walking up to people on the street and like trying to convince them of something.

05:40.640 --> 05:45.640
When I got in here, all of the buses, I think bus 71 was always full.

05:45.640 --> 05:47.640
Like I waited for two or three buses.

05:47.640 --> 05:48.640
All of them were full.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.640
I decided to call an Uber yesterday.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.640
And I was myself in the Uber.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.640
So I walked up to the people waiting for the bus.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.640
Like, how do you want to come with me?

05:57.640 --> 05:58.640
And they were like, no.

05:58.640 --> 06:00.640
Who are you?

06:00.640 --> 06:04.640
Like that's the kind of feeling that you walk up to someone and like, no, who are you?

06:04.640 --> 06:06.640
Like, why are you approaching me?

06:06.640 --> 06:08.640
So I was alone in the Uber.

06:08.640 --> 06:13.640
But when you have this tight small community, it's much easier to work with them.

06:13.640 --> 06:19.640
So when we got to this point, it started to get very hard to manage what people are working on

06:19.640 --> 06:21.640
and organize that and motivate that.

06:21.640 --> 06:28.640
We kind of went by pretty long without more structural organization.

06:28.640 --> 06:33.640
But around this time, the project lead, Drew Spreiter, decided to set up initiatives.

06:33.640 --> 06:38.640
And so that initiatives could get back to this tight knit small feeling

06:38.640 --> 06:42.640
and they could sit together and know each other and have a sense of community

06:42.640 --> 06:44.640
in this much smaller scale.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.640
And they could work together very well.

06:46.640 --> 06:51.640
And when this started, I was approached to work on the multilingual initiative

06:51.640 --> 06:56.640
because even 10 years after I joined, the multilingual was still a problem space

06:56.640 --> 06:58.640
that had a lot of problems to be solved.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.640
And so I was happy to accept that.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.640
And so I started working on the multilingual initiative.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.640
And everything was rosy and happy and I started working on things.

07:06.640 --> 07:13.640
And then a bit later, something bad happened for me.

07:13.640 --> 07:20.640
And the least I considered that was super bad that happened is that another initiative was announced.

07:20.640 --> 07:22.640
The views in core initiative was announced.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.640
And so multilingual was especially in Europe pretty important.

07:26.640 --> 07:36.640
But views in Drupal is basically the, so if you don't know Drupal, that in that detail,

07:36.640 --> 07:41.640
then views is basically a query builder based on Drupal's very rich structured data.

07:41.640 --> 07:44.640
And it's also an output generator based on the query.

07:44.640 --> 07:46.640
And you can choose how the output is generated.

07:46.640 --> 07:52.640
And it can generate APIs and REST endpoints and lists and sliders and all kinds of things.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.640
So basically it's a query builder and an output generator.

07:55.640 --> 08:01.640
And views was four times more popular than any of the multilingual modules.

08:01.640 --> 08:06.640
And they got funding from Sony and other companies.

08:06.640 --> 08:07.640
So they had money.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.640
They were four times more popular.

08:09.640 --> 08:13.640
And they started to steal some of the people that were working on the multilingual initiative.

08:13.640 --> 08:16.640
So I felt totally betrayed and I was super angry.

08:16.640 --> 08:22.640
And I wrote this email to project leadership and core committers that this will jeopardize my initiative.

08:22.640 --> 08:26.640
It will make my work super hard to do because they're going to steal the thunder

08:26.640 --> 08:29.640
and will be very hard to do this going forward.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.640
And now I'm here talking about how successful it was.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.640
So we sort of resolved this.

08:35.640 --> 08:42.640
But I was super angry and very jealous and also felt betrayed.

08:42.640 --> 08:48.640
And I think what was interesting is I didn't get responses to my feelings there.

08:48.640 --> 08:52.640
I did get responses to the facts that I stated and they were refuted.

08:52.640 --> 08:56.640
But my feelings were not contested.

08:57.640 --> 09:02.640
And I think what I realized after a while, after I had time to think about this,

09:02.640 --> 09:09.640
is the problem that I had is I was thinking of Drupal as this small pie that we are eating from.

09:09.640 --> 09:14.640
And if everybody's eating from the same pie, then it's kind of be over after a while

09:14.640 --> 09:17.640
and you don't really have more to eat.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.640
So if you steal my people, then I don't have people and I'm not going to have people.

09:21.640 --> 09:28.640
And so I think that was the key understanding that I had is that I need to think about how to grow this pie.

09:28.640 --> 09:32.640
And even though we had all of those thousands of people at the conference,

09:32.640 --> 09:38.640
I think we still didn't have a good grasp on how we involved new contributors very well

09:38.640 --> 09:41.640
and how we make them successful, which was even more important.

09:41.640 --> 09:45.640
And my other problem that I had is I didn't have money.

09:45.640 --> 09:49.640
And this realization that I need to grow the pie didn't make me have more money.

09:49.640 --> 09:53.640
Some of the companies that were involved in the Multilingual Initiative had money

09:53.640 --> 09:57.640
and they were investing into sponsoring some of their people.

09:57.640 --> 10:01.640
But I didn't have money on the scale of 1,300 people.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.640
Like, that was not possible to achieve.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.640
So I need to figure out something else.

10:09.640 --> 10:13.640
And so what I started to look at is how to make people happy.

10:14.640 --> 10:20.640
Because they would come here if there's something in it for them.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.640
They would join us if there's something in it for them.

10:22.640 --> 10:28.640
And I did, I read a bunch of stuff and some of this clicked together afterwards

10:28.640 --> 10:31.640
and it provides a great structure for this talk.

10:31.640 --> 10:35.640
But some of this, I basically figured out on the go.

10:35.640 --> 10:41.640
And so I think the best structure for this talk is these three words.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.640
This is from Dan Pink's book called Drive,

10:45.640 --> 10:49.640
which is one of the three books that I suggest you read on this topic.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.640
So Dan Pink Drive.

10:51.640 --> 10:56.640
And he highlights that people like working on things when they have autonomy.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.640
So they decide for themselves.

10:58.640 --> 11:02.640
They decide how they solve problems, who they solve problems with,

11:02.640 --> 11:04.640
how they move forward, etc.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.640
People strive if they have mastery so they can get better at things.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.640
They improve.

11:09.640 --> 11:13.640
They can try new things and improve in them and get challenged.

11:13.640 --> 11:17.640
And they strive when there's a purpose of what they are working on.

11:17.640 --> 11:23.640
And so if we can figure out, if we can correct the code on those three things,

11:23.640 --> 11:24.640
then it works really well.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.640
And I think we correct the code in the multilingual initiative and this is how we did it.

11:28.640 --> 11:32.640
So I think the purpose is sort of easy,

11:32.640 --> 11:35.640
at least for the people that were involved in my initiative.

11:35.640 --> 11:41.640
They were primarily in Europe but also somewhat in Canada and somewhat in Northern US.

11:41.640 --> 11:45.640
And they had personal needs for multilingual.

11:45.640 --> 11:48.640
So obviously they had the purpose of solving their own problems.

11:48.640 --> 11:55.640
But there was also some higher purpose, like if you just look at where Drupal is used,

11:55.640 --> 12:03.640
the UNESCO uses multilingual Drupal to help with education and children and refugees and stuff like that.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.640
The CERN uses multilingual Drupal to advance science.

12:07.640 --> 12:12.640
Tesla is using multilingual Drupal to promote their technology.

12:12.640 --> 12:16.640
And you can like configure your car through Drupal on the Tesla.com website.

12:16.640 --> 12:22.640
Rathetti is using Drupal extensively and they invest money back in open source as well.

12:22.640 --> 12:27.640
While we are in Brussels, it's hard to avoid the European Commission.

12:27.640 --> 12:30.640
It's using Drupal super extensively.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.640
This is in Hungarian, aropa.eu.

12:33.640 --> 12:38.640
But they have 300 websites that are in Drupal.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.640
Most of them are multilingual obviously in Europe.

12:40.640 --> 12:43.640
It's hard to do anything without.

12:43.640 --> 12:49.640
And they have more than 100 people on staff, developers on staff that are working on their Drupal websites.

12:49.640 --> 12:51.640
So it's super extensive.

12:51.640 --> 12:56.640
But I mean these companies can pay their way to solve their problems.

12:56.640 --> 13:01.640
If you have 100 developers, even if multilingual is hard, you can solve that.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.640
If you're a Tesla, multilingual is hard, you can solve that.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.640
So that's not really what gave me purpose.

13:06.640 --> 13:14.640
What gave me purpose is my high school's website where I started working on open content is running on Drupal.

13:14.640 --> 13:19.640
Totally accidentally as I was not involved.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.640
Totally randomly.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.640
So this is the high school I went to.

13:22.640 --> 13:27.640
So it can make a Hungarian Drupal website that's fully Hungarian and works very nicely.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.640
It's not multilingual, but it's Hungarian.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.640
So that gives me purpose.

13:32.640 --> 13:38.640
If we can make it work in a way that the little websites can do it very easy that we succeeded.

13:38.640 --> 13:43.640
So that was my purpose in here.

13:43.640 --> 13:51.640
The autonomy part, I think, is much harder to solve if you come from a traditional open source developer background.

13:51.640 --> 13:55.640
Because I think many people that start open source projects, they're great developers.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.640
They have this idea of what they want to do.

13:57.640 --> 14:02.640
They have this architecture in mind that they know how to get there and the steps to get there and they are building it.

14:02.640 --> 14:11.640
And they want to have people along for the ride, but they don't want to have people to tell what the architecture should be and what the steps should be to implement, et cetera.

14:11.640 --> 14:22.640
So to give autonomy, you need to agree or understand that you need to agree on the high level goals and get rid of your idea of micromanaging anything below that.

14:22.640 --> 14:31.640
So you need to be comfortable with the idea that you define these high level goals and it's up to the team to figure out the rest.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.640
And maybe it's not the same architecture that you wanted.

14:34.640 --> 14:40.640
Maybe it's not going to be exactly on the timeline that you expected or the steps that you expected, but other people will implement it.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.640
If you share the same goal, there's going to be shared ownership and they will implement it.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.640
So I think this is hard for...

14:48.640 --> 14:51.640
So this is one of the things that's been...

14:51.640 --> 15:00.640
I've been trying to mentor initiative leads on in the Drupal community ever since because it's very hard to get from a developer background and have an idea of how this should be done.

15:00.640 --> 15:07.640
And then give up that idea and work on organizing the whole thing instead of implementing the whole thing.

15:11.640 --> 15:14.640
But to achieve some scale, you need to give that up.

15:16.640 --> 15:33.640
The next one is, especially in the Drupal community, is to set up space because when you have this big thousands of people at the conference, there is no identity, there's no space, there's no feeling of community for the team that you have unless you set up the space.

15:33.640 --> 15:38.640
So for example, what we did here is we have a chat room.

15:38.640 --> 15:44.640
This used to be IRC now, it sounds like, that is shared in the team.

15:44.640 --> 15:51.640
We use chat meetings and threads so that it's easy to get involved with multiple language backgrounds.

15:51.640 --> 15:59.640
It's much harder to follow live audio meetings and video meetings when it's not your native language and it's very fast.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.640
Chat meetings much easier to follow.

16:02.640 --> 16:12.640
We had this identity that was created by one of the sponsor companies, because the logo of the multilingual initiative, we had stickers of this, we had t-shirts of this, etc.

16:12.640 --> 16:21.640
When we went to events, we had tables where we set up a big sign that this is the multilingual initiative so people came in, they would recognize us, they would join us.

16:21.640 --> 16:29.640
We were always there in the morning, by the way, that's a good trick, so that we were the default choice at the contribution room.

16:29.640 --> 16:33.640
When people came in in the morning, they were like, oh, multilingual initiative, great.

16:33.640 --> 16:44.640
So that allowed us to have this sense of small community that we need to achieve in this big community, to have a sense of belonging and to have a sense of connection,

16:44.640 --> 16:53.640
and so that people stay and will have those personal connections that otherwise are not possible in this big community.

16:53.640 --> 17:07.640
We also had our own website, which you may or may not need, but it was nice to have our goals set out there, and we basically pulled issues from the IssueQ and used tagging and labeling on issues to prioritize them and then display them nicely,

17:07.640 --> 17:12.640
so we didn't need to do a bunch of work manually on the website itself.

17:12.640 --> 17:18.640
Now then you have people, I think the next important thing is to have buddies, set up buddies for things.

17:18.640 --> 17:24.640
At least in the Drupal community, there's always at least three people that you need for an issue to be committed.

17:24.640 --> 17:31.640
There's somebody that works on the fix, there's somebody that reviews the fix, and then somebody that commits the fix.

17:31.640 --> 17:40.640
So if you need three people to work on an issue, you need to set up those three people to be successful, like, that's not going to accidentally happen.

17:40.640 --> 17:45.640
Like, if you walk into this keynote room, I have an issue, there's nobody going to listen to you.

17:45.640 --> 17:55.640
So what we did is when new people came in and they were like, I want to help, we always assigned them to something that somebody else was already working on,

17:55.640 --> 18:08.640
because then they had a buddy that was already invested in the issue that they came in to help with, so there was already shared understanding between those two people that they want to solve this problem.

18:08.640 --> 18:17.640
And once we had that, we had these buddies that if one of them went away, we still had a solution for how do we move this along.

18:17.640 --> 18:26.640
There was still one person left that could serve as a successor to the person that used to introduce the problem to the next person.

18:26.640 --> 18:32.640
So it was pretty useful to keep things going because stuff happens to people.

18:32.640 --> 18:41.640
Like, all the main people that I had in the initiative, something happened to them, and it was always useful to have buddies that shared the same goals.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.640
And that was basically the only way to get stuff done in the Drupal community anyway.

18:45.640 --> 18:50.640
So I think that was pretty much a key to our success.

18:50.640 --> 18:56.640
And the next thing that I realized is we need to praise the smallest of results,

18:56.640 --> 19:05.640
because people don't really recognize that they are going towards a goal and they are achieving something towards the goal unless you point that out.

19:05.640 --> 19:11.640
And often people forget about, like, after a week or so that they did something great, so it's great to get back to that.

19:11.640 --> 19:22.640
And in the meetings, we always had a section where we were praising the results from the previous meeting and figuring out who did those things and call them out as well.

19:23.640 --> 19:35.640
And the other thing that's super important, I think, is to praise the people that go away, because when they go away, they probably already burnt out two or three months before they just didn't realize it.

19:35.640 --> 19:42.640
And it's good that they went away. It's good for them because they need the break.

19:42.640 --> 19:50.640
And it's good for you because they're not going to be here and, like, maybe have negative effects on the team.

19:50.640 --> 20:01.640
And it's good for you because if you are praising that they need this break now, it shows the team that they don't need to overwork here and they don't need to kill themselves through this project.

20:01.640 --> 20:11.640
We'll figure this out. And the person that you celebrated for taking the break may actually come back after they took the break if you've been kind through this process.

20:11.640 --> 20:21.640
So it's like there's no other option, I think, that's like the win-win-win-win-win to praise people that go away because it's the best for everybody.

20:21.640 --> 20:28.640
So if you do these things, you have those buddies, you have a small tight-knit community, even in the bigger community.

20:28.640 --> 20:35.640
You have this space. You give them autonomy to work on their own ways. You just share the high-level goals.

20:35.640 --> 20:46.640
And then you have this shared ownership about things. And maybe it's not going to be implemented in a way, maybe it's not going to be implemented by the same people you started with or on the timeline you wanted, but it's going to have shared ownership.

20:46.640 --> 20:54.640
And that was kind of useful for me when I had a problem. So a couple of years into this initiative, it was a long initiative.

20:55.640 --> 21:08.640
I had breakfast with my wife and she started to having very strong stomach pain that didn't end. And so we stopped our breakfast there and we went to the emergency room.

21:08.640 --> 21:15.640
And they figured out that her blood results are getting worse and worse, but there was no blood to be seen anywhere.

21:16.640 --> 21:23.640
So they figured out that it's internal bleeding and she was about to die in a couple hours if not operated immediately.

21:23.640 --> 21:34.640
And so they assembled a team of doctors that would operate her that night and they saved her life.

21:35.640 --> 21:46.640
But she lost one ovary on the way. But she now lives on and we still remember this day.

21:46.640 --> 21:53.640
And at the same time, Drupal Karnasdin was happening. I was supposed to be there and do all of this magic with the multilingual initiative.

21:53.640 --> 22:00.640
And I was obviously not going to travel to Drupal Karnasdin when my wife was recovering from a life-saving operation.

22:01.640 --> 22:11.640
So because we had this shared ownership and shared understanding of the initiative, all the stuff that we were planning for the multilingual initiative happened in Austin.

22:11.640 --> 22:23.640
They sent us flowers and guards and well wishes and they sent us this photo of some of the people on the Contribution Day to wish us well.

22:24.640 --> 22:29.640
But this was because we built this initiative to do it together.

22:31.640 --> 22:37.640
And so mastery is the final one, I think, which is probably the most interesting thing, I think.

22:43.640 --> 22:47.640
Because people want to get better and you want to have people on your open source project.

22:48.640 --> 22:56.640
And so the question is what is that you want to have people on your open source project and they want to get better at and what do you need that they may want to get better at.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.640
So that's what we are looking for.

22:58.640 --> 23:06.640
So one of the things that I've been doing at events is therapy sessions because multilingual used to be very painful in Drupal and people had pain.

23:06.640 --> 23:11.640
And so I set up a multilingual therapy barf, is what it was called, on the schedule.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.640
And I would sit back and I was like, do you want to talk about it?

23:15.640 --> 23:18.640
And they wanted to talk about it.

23:18.640 --> 23:30.640
And so what this was great for is, A, I got in the users that had pain about multilingual so I could have a requirements list of what I want to solve in the multilingual initiative.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.640
They got to talk about their pain so they felt heard.

23:34.640 --> 23:43.640
The people that were contributing on the initiative came in to the barf and they felt like they are the experts because they could give advice to the people that had the pain.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.640
So I was basically sitting there, I didn't do anything at this barf.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.640
I said, do you want to talk about this?

23:48.640 --> 23:55.640
And the experts came in from the initiative naturally and the people with the pain came in and I just sat there and I enjoyed it.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.640
So that's the investment.

23:58.640 --> 24:04.640
So the experts, basically the people working on the initiative came in and they gave advice to people with the pain.

24:04.640 --> 24:10.640
And we got to show at the barf, this is what we're working on, this is how it's going to make your life easier.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.640
We feel your pain.

24:11.640 --> 24:16.640
Yes, it is something that's hard right now, but this is how we are solving it.

24:16.640 --> 24:20.640
And so we could build in that feedback into what we were working on.

24:20.640 --> 24:24.640
We could review with the people with the pain the solutions that we had.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.640
Does this solve your pain or not?

24:26.640 --> 24:30.640
So it was very good to get direct feedback, it was very good to have them listened,

24:30.640 --> 24:36.640
it was very good to provide visibility to the people that were contributing and get professional recognition for them,

24:36.640 --> 24:46.640
sometimes business because they were giving advice to clients that were showing up in the room and they may get a business relationship after the barf.

24:46.640 --> 24:48.640
So it was great.

24:48.640 --> 24:55.640
So I think it was important to acknowledge that multilingual was a pain and provide this space in person as well.

24:55.640 --> 25:00.640
The next thing we did was radical openness about how we organized this initiative.

25:00.640 --> 25:05.640
So we created an open source slideshow for example that anybody could present anywhere.

25:05.640 --> 25:14.640
And they translated this slideshow into multiple languages presented in Japan and Poland and France and bring it to companies and a lot of places.

25:14.640 --> 25:18.640
So we just gave this slideshow and we didn't ask for anything in return.

25:18.640 --> 25:25.640
And this brought the news of the initiative into far and wide on the globe everywhere that this is happening and made people excited.

25:25.640 --> 25:33.640
And also gave people the opportunity to deliver sessions that have not done it before, they didn't build a slide deck that was compelling or anything.

25:33.640 --> 25:36.640
And this was useful for them as well.

25:36.640 --> 25:42.640
We made the Drupal distribution which had a demo of how this multilingual thing will work.

25:42.640 --> 25:47.640
It had demo content and demo menus and a bunch of features set up so that people can try out how they can do it.

25:47.640 --> 25:52.640
And they can try out how this will work and they can test this out and we can get feedback.

25:52.640 --> 26:02.640
We created a two hour workshop with a 23 page handout that detailed the steps of how you get to build this distribution basically.

26:02.640 --> 26:08.640
How you get to build out a multilingual menu, how you get to build out a multilingual content structure, etc.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.640
Super detailed. That's why it was 23 pages.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.640
It was like click here, right this, click here, right this detail.

26:14.640 --> 26:23.640
So this was very useful for people to do these workshops and teach people how to use the multilingual Drupal system before it was even done.

26:23.640 --> 26:28.640
Like we were already training people on multilingual Drupal before we were done.

26:28.640 --> 26:38.640
And with the help of Acquia we created a user testing script that could be crowdsourced so that people can do user testing at their meetups at their local events

26:39.640 --> 26:53.640
and record them and publish their results and we could aggregate the results and use that to inform how we are doing and where we need to improve the user interface or the flows or how all the things are connected.

26:53.640 --> 27:01.640
And so I've been doing a bunch of research and reading in the meantime and read a bunch of interesting tricks on how to involve more people.

27:01.640 --> 27:05.640
So this is one of them, car wash loyalty.

27:05.640 --> 27:09.640
So that was one interesting story about car wash companies.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.640
They want to have people come back to wash their cars.

27:12.640 --> 27:21.640
And so they did an experiment where they had a car wash loyalty card with eight slots that you could stamp in and then get a free wash at the end.

27:21.640 --> 27:27.640
And they did another card that had ten slots but two were already stamped in.

27:27.640 --> 27:31.640
It's the same eight slots but there was two more that were already stamped in.

27:31.640 --> 27:37.640
How much better did this one work for people? What do you think?

27:40.640 --> 27:43.640
This worked twice as good.

27:43.640 --> 27:53.640
So the ten slots two already stamped in worked twice as good to get people to get to ten stamps than the eight slots, eight empty slots.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.640
They had the same exact number of empty slots.

27:55.640 --> 27:59.640
But this one told you that you are already on your way to achieve your goal.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.640
So it was like you already started.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.640
You had two stamps even though you didn't do any car wash.

28:05.640 --> 28:09.640
It was just two stamps and the first stamp was the third stamp that you got there.

28:09.640 --> 28:14.640
And the people that had this card, they got there faster as well.

28:14.640 --> 28:17.640
Not just twice as many people got there but they got there faster.

28:17.640 --> 28:20.640
So I have to translate this to open source contribution.

28:20.640 --> 28:26.640
So one thing that I did is I wrote blog posts about how Drupal Multilingual is going.

28:27.640 --> 28:31.640
And I broke down the initiative basically I think 18 posts or so.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.640
Like this is what we do for multilingual installation.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.640
This is what we do for interface translation, etc.

28:37.640 --> 28:43.640
And at the end of the post I had a section of by the way this doesn't exactly work well yet.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.640
And these are the issues that you can be involved with.

28:46.640 --> 28:49.640
So people read about what's exciting thing coming up.

28:49.640 --> 28:50.640
They got informed.

28:50.640 --> 28:54.640
And at the end they got rubbed into helping with solving the problems

28:54.640 --> 28:58.640
because they already felt like we are getting this great solution

28:58.640 --> 29:00.640
and they was like it's just almost there.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.640
I just need to help with this one.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.640
That helped a lot.

29:08.640 --> 29:12.640
So at the end we got 1,300 people involved

29:12.640 --> 29:19.640
and that included people from companies like NBC Universal and Pfizer and Carefor

29:19.640 --> 29:25.640
and the University of Waterloo, University of Iowa, Biologist, Genetic Information Management,

29:25.640 --> 29:31.640
McGill University, Johnson & Johnson, Ticketmaster, Google Summer of Code, Google Code and you name it.

29:31.640 --> 29:36.640
So all of those sources had people that were involved.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.640
So this is the list of people.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.640
Too fast.

29:43.640 --> 29:45.640
Wanted to spot yourself?

29:46.640 --> 29:49.640
So there's a lot of people.

29:49.640 --> 29:56.640
And so basically all it took is for me to understand that this is not a fixed pie

29:56.640 --> 29:59.640
that we need to look at how we grow this pie.

29:59.640 --> 30:06.640
We need to figure out what's in it for people to come in here and grow and be involved.

30:06.640 --> 30:11.640
And for me to figure out that I need to give people the autonomy in this project

30:11.640 --> 30:14.640
to figure out how they're going to solve this problem.

30:14.640 --> 30:18.640
So they have a shared ownership of solving this issue,

30:18.640 --> 30:23.640
for them to have ways to get better at things, for them to master their craft,

30:23.640 --> 30:28.640
for them to improve on their own terms,

30:28.640 --> 30:32.640
and for us to have a shared purpose on why are we doing this.

30:32.640 --> 30:36.640
So if you want to read a lot more about all of these things,

30:36.640 --> 30:39.640
these are the three top books that I would suggest in this area.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.640
So David Marquez turned the ship around.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.640
This is great for handing off autonomy.

30:43.640 --> 30:48.640
He's a nuclear reactor, nuclear submarine captain

30:48.640 --> 30:51.640
that was training for one type of submarine for two years

30:51.640 --> 30:54.640
and then got reassigned in one week another type of submarine

30:54.640 --> 30:57.640
that he had no idea how to operate.

30:57.640 --> 31:02.640
And so he can need to figure out how to give autonomy to the crew.

31:02.640 --> 31:04.640
It's a great book.

31:04.640 --> 31:09.640
Danny Alping's drive is about this whole structure of autonomy, mystery, and purpose.

31:10.640 --> 31:15.640
And the switch from the Chip and Don Heath is a lot of great stories

31:15.640 --> 31:21.640
and solutions and tips about how do you make people do things that they probably wanted,

31:21.640 --> 31:23.640
but you need to convince them.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.640
So the car wash story comes from there, but it's all...

31:26.640 --> 31:30.640
There's no software stories in there, by the way, nothing.

31:30.640 --> 31:34.640
But there's a lot of stories about what do people do about glove ordering

31:34.640 --> 31:41.640
in the hospital or kids' cancer treatment or a bunch of other things.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.640
There's a lot of great stories in there that you can apply in one way or another

31:44.640 --> 31:46.640
to open source as well.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.640
So there was my talk.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.640
Any questions?

32:01.640 --> 32:03.640
You've left a speech list.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.640
All right.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.640
When does your book come out?

32:09.640 --> 32:11.640
I don't have one on my own. Thank you.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.640
All right.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.640
Oh, there we go.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.640
Yes.

32:34.640 --> 33:02.640
So the question was that Drupal has this challenge in all kinds of other areas as well.

33:02.640 --> 33:07.640
So I think that is the 10x or 100x to apply to all kinds of other topics.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.640
I think so, yes.

33:10.640 --> 33:17.640
So I think we've seen some of the recent initiatives that people were really driven to implement

33:17.640 --> 33:21.640
that had similar approaches, like the single directory components initiative,

33:21.640 --> 33:26.640
for example, had a very similar approach and a smaller scale.

33:26.640 --> 33:31.640
So I think we could apply a lot of these to other initiatives.

33:31.640 --> 33:36.640
We've been trying to mentor initiative leads on these ideas.

33:36.640 --> 33:44.640
And we've been successful in some of these ways of like how do we involve people from events in initiatives.

33:44.640 --> 33:49.640
That's been a track that we've been really successful on working through.

33:49.640 --> 33:52.640
But there's definitely a lot more that could be applied from here.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.640
Yes.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.640
Yes.

33:56.640 --> 33:59.640
Please submit a proposal to the 5.3 developer next.

33:59.640 --> 34:01.640
All right, please.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.640
I was suggested to submit the proposal for the 5.3 developer days.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.640
When and where is it?

34:06.640 --> 34:10.640
It's the first and second and third of August and it's in Koffrüh in Germany.

34:10.640 --> 34:14.640
It's the first three days of August in Koffrüh in Germany.

34:14.640 --> 34:15.640
It's for the camera.

34:15.640 --> 34:17.640
5.3 developer days.

34:17.640 --> 34:18.640
You.

34:18.640 --> 34:22.640
Yeah, me too, but the listeners as well.

34:22.640 --> 34:24.640
Great.

34:24.640 --> 34:26.640
Yeah, thank you everyone.

34:26.640 --> 34:28.640
Have a nice day.

34:28.640 --> 34:31.640
Thank you.
