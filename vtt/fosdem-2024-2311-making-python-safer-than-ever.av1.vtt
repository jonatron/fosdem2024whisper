WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Thank you.

00:05.000 --> 00:12.840
Yeah, so I'm glad that actually like so many people nowadays like really care about security.

00:12.840 --> 00:16.400
I think it wasn't the case when I first started doing Python.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.720
I was one of those people who just put things together with duct tapes.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.440
So that's good.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.480
And I'm going to dive deeper into you know what the PSF has been doing and also what

00:27.480 --> 00:30.520
you should do and also maybe some information that like you may find

00:30.520 --> 00:32.360
interesting to know like what we are doing.

00:32.360 --> 00:38.960
So this is the most important slide of the whole slide deck because it has a link to the whole slide deck.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.800
So with this you don't have to take pictures after.

00:41.800 --> 00:46.360
So maybe you want to keep this you know the picture of this slide just in case.

00:46.360 --> 00:50.960
And also you can also you know tag me, message me, I love that.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.000
So I'm Czech.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.520
I love open source.

00:54.520 --> 00:58.120
People ask me oh how can you get involved in like Python.

00:58.120 --> 01:03.000
Well I just step by step like most of you I was like you know it was the data scientists

01:03.000 --> 01:06.440
are doing Python and then you know go to meet up and then people ask do you want to organize

01:06.440 --> 01:09.160
meet up. Yes I organize meet up and then do you want to come to the conference.

01:09.160 --> 01:11.240
Yes I come to the conference and then you want to organize the conference.

01:11.240 --> 01:12.680
Yes I won't organize the conference.

01:12.680 --> 01:16.040
So after saying yes multiple times and then I'm here.

01:16.040 --> 01:22.280
So now I am a Python software foundation but members are one of the directors and fellow.

01:22.360 --> 01:27.480
So that's my volunteer work so how do I do like what I do in my day job.

01:27.480 --> 01:30.280
I am a community manager at OpenSSF.

01:30.280 --> 01:35.240
So a lot of things I talk about here actually like related to these two hats that I'm wearing

01:35.240 --> 01:37.880
from time to time which is very special.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.800
So yeah you know OpenSSF we are part of Linux foundation.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.360
We have a stand at the building K level 2.

01:44.360 --> 01:46.200
So come to us we have stickers there as well.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.720
So that's OpenSSF stickers so you can come and get some stickers for me.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.400
I would tell you more about that there.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.400
I won't talk about it here now.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.280
So let me ask you a question.

01:56.280 --> 02:01.000
So when you let let's imagine you have to move tomorrow.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.840
You have to choose a place to live.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.000
So what are the criteria right?

02:05.800 --> 02:07.080
What are what are you looking for?

02:07.080 --> 02:11.960
Like if you go to like do a viewing what questions you would ask that stay agent or people show

02:11.960 --> 02:12.840
you around.

02:12.840 --> 02:17.880
So for me one of the things I'll ask like is this neighborhood safe right?

02:17.880 --> 02:22.040
Safety is very important no matter who you are you know you don't want to live in somewhere

02:22.040 --> 02:27.320
that maybe you every time you go back home in the dark you feel scared or maybe you worry

02:27.320 --> 02:30.600
that someone may break into your house and stole things you know.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.360
So safety is very important also same as software right?

02:34.360 --> 02:36.920
You don't want someone to break into your house but you also don't want someone to

02:36.920 --> 02:39.640
hack into your computer or your system or things like that.

02:39.640 --> 02:45.000
So that's very important and I'm glad that a lot of us care about that these days.

02:45.960 --> 02:49.880
Security in Python is even more important.

02:49.880 --> 02:54.360
A lot of times I make the analogy because like I love Python and the community so much it feels

02:54.360 --> 02:59.000
like my family they're like I don't want these people to be vulnerable and got attacked so

02:59.000 --> 03:03.800
I'm protecting you know Python and the community is very important.

03:03.800 --> 03:10.440
So why Python is you know why do people care about security in Python?

03:10.440 --> 03:16.280
I think one of the things special about Python is that we have a lot of different people using

03:16.280 --> 03:21.160
Python including people who may not be traditionally like trained as a you know

03:21.160 --> 03:25.960
a software engineer like for example some researcher we have a huge scientific computing

03:25.960 --> 03:31.800
community that they maybe a researcher themselves they use Python to help them with their research.

03:32.520 --> 03:36.920
Data scientists I was a data scientist you know I was the one who doesn't care about

03:36.920 --> 03:39.240
security so I know.

03:39.240 --> 03:45.560
Bank you know this is you know again like you know I have worked in a bank before at some point so

03:45.560 --> 03:52.440
I know that bank use Python and you know this is a very important you know organization and you know

03:52.440 --> 03:57.400
Python is there. Government as well government also use Python I have like friends who have

03:57.400 --> 04:00.920
worked in the government before there are lots of governments actually using Python.

04:00.920 --> 04:05.160
Teachers teaching young people teaching the next generation of software developers

04:05.240 --> 04:10.360
they also use Python maybe this this is the first language a lot of young people these days

04:10.360 --> 04:14.840
like the first language is instead of like us you know who have a little bit like gray hair

04:14.840 --> 04:19.720
is like oh we just see when we're learning but now it's like maybe they're learning Python.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.440
And anybody you and me like we're here in the Python death room so we use Python.

04:24.920 --> 04:33.400
Yeah so Python is vulnerable because again like these people may not be trained as a you know

04:33.480 --> 04:40.520
software developer so they just kind of go to code in the first day you know and like you know

04:40.520 --> 04:44.360
then the profile is very different we can't just like for example we can't just focus on

04:44.360 --> 04:49.400
securing the Python in bank that's not good enough where how about the government how about the

04:49.400 --> 04:54.760
people who are writing software as a hobby and like you know all this we have to try to cover

04:54.760 --> 05:00.440
everybody and it's very hard when you have a diverse user profile and again a lot of people

05:00.440 --> 05:03.880
nowadays especially young people this is the first programming language and

05:04.600 --> 05:08.680
you know they may learn Python before they know what is cyber security right so

05:09.720 --> 05:15.960
that's very important because they may not know it so yeah how can we help these people

05:15.960 --> 05:23.080
to be more secure when they're coding so also is like to make things more complex now you know

05:24.040 --> 05:29.160
in the last talk you have heard about all these so and also enforce them you know we have a death

05:29.160 --> 05:34.520
room we have a talk yesterday about cra you know or this policy actually are coming to affect us

05:34.520 --> 05:38.520
it's not that like oh we are just a bunch of people who love coding and have fun no like we

05:38.520 --> 05:44.760
also care about especially when you're making a living with coding policies were affectual because

05:44.760 --> 05:51.000
it's kind of policies trying to protect the customers if you are creating a product that you

05:51.000 --> 05:56.760
are distributing them so that would actually you have to have a look at least as what's going on so

05:57.560 --> 06:03.000
you know in us we have the you know the espon bill or you know that that's the real name but we just

06:03.000 --> 06:08.120
call it espon bill a lot of times and cra you know we have a lot of section about cra is coming

06:08.120 --> 06:13.240
you know because it's going to be effective in a few years so a i ag i hope you have heard

06:13.240 --> 06:19.720
about those terms a i ag prd so these things are happening now so that's why we care so we have to

06:19.720 --> 06:24.440
protect the python users not just those people that i talk about that are using python but also

06:24.440 --> 06:29.320
you and me who may be developing in python we don't want to get caught in those policies that you

06:29.320 --> 06:34.120
know we don't want to do anything that actually we have to be liable so we have to protect everybody

06:35.880 --> 06:41.160
so before i jump into what we are doing so i'm going to talk a little bit about

06:42.040 --> 06:47.960
what are the most common open source issues so hopefully you you are now you are aware you're

06:47.960 --> 06:53.560
trying to like avoid those issues but also you can it's kind of like a homework that when you

06:53.560 --> 06:57.640
you know maybe after the talk you can kind of link back of what we are doing is related to which

06:57.640 --> 07:04.280
one which problem that we are solving so this ten risk actually is uh you know i i didn't develop

07:04.280 --> 07:08.600
them myself i copied from somewhere so the reference there you can have a look at the book post so

07:09.400 --> 07:16.520
top ten risk so now you can evaluate right have you made those mistakes hopefully you or you know

07:16.520 --> 07:21.960
how you can avoid those mistakes so first of all known uh vulnerability so uh you know have you

07:21.960 --> 07:26.760
been using a software that actually got a security issues evolved but you haven't upgraded

07:29.400 --> 07:34.760
have you you know sometimes sometimes there's like compromise of legitimate packages so let's say if

07:34.760 --> 07:40.040
you are a maintainer of a very important package that everybody used if your account got hacked and

07:40.040 --> 07:45.720
someone puts some malicious code in your code base then everybody's using that package so um yeah you

07:45.720 --> 07:51.160
you feel very bad if you are doing that so that's one of the risks you want to avoid name confusion

07:51.160 --> 07:56.200
attacks how many times like you forgot to type the s at the end of pandas so you install panda in

07:56.200 --> 08:03.000
stuff pandas then you know you can be vulnerable to that attack if you're typing the name wrong um

08:03.000 --> 08:08.920
so uh unmaintained software you know i've done that before i you know i was a data scientist trying

08:08.920 --> 08:13.880
a lot of things so i found this library that this model is quite cool install it and try but

08:13.880 --> 08:18.920
it doesn't work because it hasn't been updated for four years so um yeah unmaintained software so

08:19.000 --> 08:23.480
so risk outdated software is similar you know outdated we should always keep your

08:23.480 --> 08:29.640
software up to date because there may be some security patches um and tracking dependence this is

08:29.640 --> 08:35.880
again like i know that a lot of us are you know using a very good package manager but for people

08:35.880 --> 08:40.040
who are maybe new they don't know you know maybe or they are again like learning python that's the

08:40.040 --> 08:44.360
first program language they don't know that like managing the dependencies is very important

08:44.360 --> 08:50.600
especially when you're writing some code that need to be in production so a license risk this is

08:50.600 --> 08:55.160
not actually like cyber security risk but again like how many times before you pip install something

08:55.160 --> 09:00.680
you have checked what license they have because some license they may not be copy you know they

09:00.680 --> 09:03.880
they you may have to be open source if you are using them even though they're open source so

09:05.480 --> 09:10.120
license could be again like is another topic that i can give another like talking like you know about

09:10.120 --> 09:16.600
but you know check the license all the time immature software sometimes you know again if you

09:16.600 --> 09:21.320
are just trying different things someone may write a soft you know a package that you could

09:21.320 --> 09:26.360
pip install but maybe it's immature because it's not production ready it's just someone's like

09:26.360 --> 09:34.120
experiment a prototype so uh and unapproved changes uh so have have you like give everybody push

09:34.840 --> 09:42.440
right to the main branch so avoid those because you know maybe you give a junior death like push

09:42.440 --> 09:48.440
the main branch and they may erase everything so yeah that's not good um and uh you know oversized

09:48.440 --> 09:54.200
dependency we always have this problem you know python we have so many package available and um so

09:54.200 --> 10:01.720
yeah that that may be a problem that your dependency is too big so um now so we have so many problems

10:01.800 --> 10:09.240
that we want to avoid we have to get extra power to solve this problem so uh i know that like a lot

10:09.240 --> 10:13.560
of times we are just relying on volunteers to help out and really appreciate all the volunteers

10:13.560 --> 10:19.320
who help out that that's why we can survive for so long but uh security is so important so hiring

10:19.320 --> 10:24.680
someone to full time and take care of it is actually a very good thing that we could do so that that's

10:24.680 --> 10:29.240
what we could do right now so i would like to introduce you to these two amazing gentlemen

10:29.240 --> 10:35.800
that is helping like full time now working in python software foundation to um to do work on

10:35.800 --> 10:43.000
security for python so uh seph seph is a security developer in restaurant so this row is actually

10:43.000 --> 10:48.200
funded by alpha omega project so thank you for that you can see his beautiful face there yes

10:50.440 --> 10:57.000
and the next gentleman i want to introduce you is mike so mike is uh you know papi safety and

10:57.000 --> 11:02.680
security engineer so this row is funded by aws so again like he's working probably working a lot

11:02.680 --> 11:08.440
with uh you know together with packages so maybe they are trying to you know maybe you are using

11:08.440 --> 11:15.960
the packages that like mike has put some effort in so thank you very much um so this is what uh what

11:15.960 --> 11:20.840
has been done like well it's to be honest this is a few months ago i i put this together a few

11:20.840 --> 11:25.160
months ago so maybe not most updated one but like you can look at seph's block for the most

11:25.160 --> 11:34.040
updated work anyway so um so now like you know python releases so when you use python you have

11:34.040 --> 11:39.720
to actually get your c python right so c python usually just go to you know the official python

11:39.720 --> 11:44.760
website and download c python but how do you know this version of the c python is actually

11:44.760 --> 11:50.120
the real c python instead of maybe someone hack our website and put a malicious c python there

11:51.080 --> 11:57.960
uh the best way to ensure that it's legitimate is to sign it right so sixth door again like

11:57.960 --> 12:03.160
someone mentioned it in the last talk already uh is a new mechanism that you can you know use

12:03.160 --> 12:10.200
a certificate to sign the release so it's kind of very easy to verify to sign and uh it's keeler

12:10.200 --> 12:15.240
so it's more secure and um so everything's locked so you can check so there's a transparency

12:15.240 --> 12:20.040
law so you can check like who signed it and when is this go sign and you fully trust this c python

12:20.040 --> 12:26.040
is the right c python that you're supposed to be using oops i skipped some size okay so uh so all

12:26.040 --> 12:32.680
these like new uh you know from from certain time that is like you know c python release has been

12:32.680 --> 12:37.960
signed so um it's not just like the newest release of course they are signed but also like all these

12:37.960 --> 12:44.200
versions upward they are all signed so you can always verify them um sorry it's a bit hard to see

12:44.200 --> 12:48.360
but uh you know all these you can see who has signed it you who are the release manager and you

12:48.360 --> 12:53.640
know you have you can check all those logs and you know check the the you know the e-short and

12:53.640 --> 12:59.880
like check check off stuff so okay so yeah you can actually write some this this is you know i hope

12:59.880 --> 13:04.600
you're familiar with that it's kind of like a yaml file that you could probably use your you know

13:04.600 --> 13:09.720
c i c d to check it to check whether your python that you're using in your c i c d pipeline is the

13:09.720 --> 13:17.400
right python so um also what if i found an issue right what if i have discovered a security problem

13:18.360 --> 13:23.960
actually in python we have a response team that's really great um so it's not just uh staff or

13:23.960 --> 13:32.040
mic themselves but also like it's it's a team help out so uh so if you found something about c

13:32.040 --> 13:37.000
python hopefully it's not happened that often uh you know it applies to both supporter or the

13:37.000 --> 13:44.360
n of live version or pib then you can actually file those reports so uh the team will work with you

13:44.360 --> 13:49.480
to handle it so how how do they work so first of all um they would work with you if you are the

13:49.480 --> 13:54.600
reporting so you are the reporter so they will work with you privately so privately is the key

13:54.600 --> 13:58.840
because you don't want to shout out to the whole world oh we have an issue with python and it's not

13:58.840 --> 14:05.400
secure no you don't want this so so we'll work with your privately right so after that like when a you

14:06.360 --> 14:11.000
know after that of course i the developers you know call developers work and then we'll try to find a

14:11.000 --> 14:16.680
patch and then okay so now it's patch now there's new release right so okay we have a solution now

14:16.680 --> 14:22.840
has been solved now it will be publicly announced now we can tell the world say like okay we had a

14:22.840 --> 14:28.040
problem but now has been solved so everybody please use the newer version of python which this issue

14:28.040 --> 14:34.280
has been resolved right so this is usually how it works so first step you know instead of posting it on

14:34.280 --> 14:40.920
you know your social media you report it to the response team don't post it on social media

14:40.920 --> 14:45.560
write a blog post report it and then after when you know it can be go public then you can write

14:45.560 --> 14:53.000
blog posts saying how awesome you found a bug or something like that right so um this is a really

14:53.000 --> 14:59.720
good news so python software foundation has also become a cna so what is cna so cna is actually a

14:59.960 --> 15:07.560
organization that can give out the cve numbers so we what are cve numbers so cv numbers actually are

15:07.560 --> 15:15.560
a unique identified identify each security issue that has been reported so for example you know cve

15:15.560 --> 15:21.240
that that example there you can see that like first of all there's four digits of the year and then

15:21.240 --> 15:27.720
there's like five digits of unique identifiers so you would see that um when people you know talking

15:27.720 --> 15:33.080
about oh is this new patch solving this issue so instead of this issue which we don't know what is

15:33.080 --> 15:40.600
that issue and naming thing is hard we just use a number saying like this cve 2022 4h 5 64 issue

15:40.600 --> 15:46.840
has been resolved right so we can clearly say that this you know this new version is not affected by

15:46.840 --> 15:54.760
that so that's a good thing um so yeah this help to discuss and you know communicate and make everybody

15:55.480 --> 16:01.880
easy to identify where the problem is and where has been resolved so um by becoming a cna which

16:01.880 --> 16:08.840
means that we the finance software foundation is taking is taking this security issues very seriously

16:08.840 --> 16:16.920
now we can assign cv id's to any issues that you have reported about c python and pip so if we see

16:16.920 --> 16:23.800
that that is actually a issues that you found will give it a cve so we would actually be very quick

16:23.800 --> 16:30.520
to respond and make sure that everything got resolved um so that's the that's the c is the you

16:30.520 --> 16:36.680
know cna is hard we are so glad that now we are thought a 4t that we can give our cve's um the

16:36.680 --> 16:44.120
next thing is that actually knowing the cve's we how can we keep a lock keep a database of what cve

16:44.120 --> 16:50.280
has been discovered and what has been been affected and that kind of thing so uh of course we will

16:50.280 --> 16:56.280
have a database we'll store all those data um you know we have a pi ta advisory database um so it

16:56.280 --> 17:01.320
will store what it will store right it will store the c python from the cve's so the so all these

17:02.360 --> 17:07.640
security issues affecting c python will be stored there um so you so there are also some packages

17:07.640 --> 17:12.360
there sometimes they have problems but we won't give cve's for the packages they kind of work

17:12.360 --> 17:17.800
by themselves so um but people that you can kind of check it check those packages on pi bi so if it's

17:17.800 --> 17:24.680
known then it will be there um also all these uh the the pi pa advisory database this information is

17:24.680 --> 17:30.760
now also synced with uh osv from our bloody database so osv from our bloody database is not just

17:30.760 --> 17:36.600
limited to python it's also including other vulnerabilities in other software so if your

17:36.600 --> 17:42.360
application is not just python it's also have other components you can actually use osv to check

17:42.360 --> 17:49.000
everything so um yeah so that's good you can use both um so it's there's more visibility so people

17:49.000 --> 17:55.640
can easily find the issues in python ecosystem in the osv and also vice versa we can also see

17:55.640 --> 18:01.560
other issues as well so it's good so um but that's not it so that's the thing that we have been

18:01.560 --> 18:06.120
doing at the organizational level so that's something that maybe as an individual developer you don't

18:06.120 --> 18:11.400
have to put too much work in it but um let's let's go to this section which i have listed

18:11.560 --> 18:17.560
what you can do as a developer as a user or as a company so uh first of all we want you to help us

18:17.560 --> 18:25.320
to secure our community um if you are maintainers of python project first rule of thumb enable two

18:25.320 --> 18:30.520
f a everywhere you know this is always like very important you know you don't want someone to hack

18:30.520 --> 18:37.320
into any of your you know github pi bi or email account to you know gain access of these things

18:37.320 --> 18:42.760
that you're publishing and someone may be using right um so you should learn about how to develop

18:42.760 --> 18:47.400
a better like saver software you know open ssf we have some free guys that you can follow talk to

18:47.400 --> 18:52.840
me afterwards at the booth or something um use tools like you know scorecard and sex store um you

18:52.840 --> 18:59.080
know the these are the tools that again open ssf has uh you know associated with and then we have

18:59.080 --> 19:03.720
actually these are you know i won't talk in detail talk to me about how to use those tools after

19:04.280 --> 19:09.560
also subscribe to the pi bi blog for security features those are the official announcements

19:09.560 --> 19:13.880
but saft also got a very very good blog i highly recommend you follow him he's

19:13.880 --> 19:20.120
lovely you have a lot of you know very useful information that's given out on his blog um

19:20.760 --> 19:25.560
but as a user maybe you're using python project you can be a maintainer and use at the same time right

19:25.560 --> 19:30.920
so uh as a user you should keep your dependency locked and up today you know don't be someone like

19:30.920 --> 19:37.240
me you know five seven years ago that just just duct tape everything no keep your dependency

19:37.240 --> 19:44.360
locked and make sure they use the good um package manager um subscribe for advisories uh you see the

19:44.360 --> 19:49.320
email coming from that email after you have subscribed to that mailing list you would be first

19:49.320 --> 19:54.520
notified if there's any information that you should know um so pay up that it may be a good tool to

19:54.520 --> 19:59.720
check your dependencies but again like if you're your application is not just python so obviously

20:00.520 --> 20:08.200
would have everything that you need to know so if you are working well so if well i assume that most

20:08.200 --> 20:13.000
of us are working in the company um so if you're using python in the company or any open source

20:13.000 --> 20:19.640
project i think uh there's more you can do you can convince your company to become a member of

20:19.640 --> 20:25.640
open ssf so contribute to all this open source security work or support python software foundation

20:25.640 --> 20:31.800
we want to hire more people to help so uh you know the most easy way is like if your company has a

20:31.800 --> 20:37.560
big budget then you can maybe support us to hire another person that would be great um so also

20:37.560 --> 20:44.200
educate the employees so if you for example if you're like kind of a lead or a manager maybe you

20:44.200 --> 20:51.320
can encourage your teammate to study to learn more about security so you know on a limit foundation

20:51.320 --> 20:57.800
we have a lot of free courses it's a very good you know resource that you could maybe use also

20:57.800 --> 21:03.480
follow best practice like just make sure your team don't duct tape things together make sure that

21:04.120 --> 21:08.920
the product is production ready follow good practice make sure that it's safe and then

21:08.920 --> 21:13.000
it's it's better in the long run so maybe you'll be easier for you to get ready to be

21:13.000 --> 21:19.080
complianced to when cra coming to effect or something like that right so uh last thank you so

21:19.080 --> 21:25.960
much for alpha omega and aws to support python software foundation so we can hire two amazing

21:25.960 --> 21:31.560
gentlemen that we have today um and it would be great if we can have a third person so please if

21:31.560 --> 21:38.760
you if your company have like want to support please point them our way um so yeah thank you so much

21:38.760 --> 21:43.000
this is the end and this is the link to the slide and i'm happy to talk to you afterwards i have

21:43.000 --> 21:48.520
coffee with me or anything or message me um i'll be here um today so
