WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.200
So, we're going to be presenting the rooms in only office doc space and it's going to

00:09.200 --> 00:11.120
be presented by Alex.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.680
Hello, hello everyone.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.680
My name is Alex.

00:14.680 --> 00:19.640
I'm with only office, so this is my second time here at Forstum in Brussels.

00:19.640 --> 00:22.680
Thank you a lot guys, so the same clusters.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.720
That's everything is brilliant.

00:24.720 --> 00:31.880
And today I'm going to take you through the challenges of only office and of document

00:31.880 --> 00:36.640
collaboration and how only office can help you to overcome all these challenges.

00:36.640 --> 00:41.360
So I will also be introducing you to some existing features in only office and some

00:41.360 --> 00:42.360
updates.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.120
So let's get started.

00:44.120 --> 00:52.720
In our today's world is very important to work online and if teams have a lot of documents

00:52.720 --> 00:56.760
so the things can get messy very fast.

00:56.760 --> 01:02.000
So for us developers it is important to create and for users to pick a good solution for

01:02.000 --> 01:06.600
organizing online document collaboration.

01:06.600 --> 01:13.120
We at only office have more than 200 unique connections, unique integrations and we have

01:13.120 --> 01:19.480
a long, long list of requirements from the people who are trying to integrate our solutions

01:19.480 --> 01:24.200
into their services and that's why we are absolutely sure that we know almost everything

01:24.200 --> 01:25.200
about the integration.

01:25.200 --> 01:32.560
So wondering what is the most interesting cases, here are our points.

01:32.560 --> 01:40.560
So first we want to make sure that we save your time and efforts by automating the everyday

01:40.560 --> 01:42.720
routine.

01:42.720 --> 01:48.280
Having a lot of features is very important and it should be easy to add new features

01:48.280 --> 01:50.360
if needed.

01:50.360 --> 01:57.720
The next thing to consider is support for all popular file formats.

01:57.720 --> 02:04.000
If a software is built on their up-to-date technologies it will most likely be reliable,

02:04.000 --> 02:09.280
suit user needs and even have some killer features, so like we do.

02:09.280 --> 02:13.840
And of course security will always remain one of the most important questions for everyone

02:13.840 --> 02:18.920
who works on their documents online.

02:18.920 --> 02:26.680
Cross-platform apps give us ability to work on any document in any browser, from any device

02:26.680 --> 02:32.680
and remote workers need to be able to work together and all these challenges can be difficult

02:32.680 --> 02:41.400
to overcome without using write tools but only office can ensure your effective teamwork.

02:41.400 --> 02:48.080
Talking about usability, we want to provide real-end user experience.

02:48.080 --> 02:54.680
If a software is easy to use it boosts your productivity and accessibility, how it is

02:54.680 --> 02:59.800
easy for people of all abilities to use your product.

02:59.800 --> 03:09.560
If software have lots of bug fixes and updates it indicates that it is well maintained and

03:09.760 --> 03:16.200
here big thank you to our community which plays significant role sending us information

03:16.200 --> 03:22.400
about bugs, troubles and of course feedback.

03:22.400 --> 03:24.960
And last but definitely not least is availability.

03:24.960 --> 03:36.040
We are constantly increasing the number of distribution forms or builds of our products.

03:36.040 --> 03:41.880
Considering all these factors we at only office decided to create a new product, only

03:41.880 --> 03:49.480
office doc space, a product for organizing secure online document collaboration.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.720
Actually today is the first time when we are talking about that product.

03:53.720 --> 04:01.280
I was talking about that at FOSS Asia in 2023 but there was only better version available

04:01.280 --> 04:06.800
and now we have already a ready to go product that can be integrated and is already integrated

04:06.800 --> 04:09.600
into many well-known services.

04:09.600 --> 04:15.600
So before we dive into each factor I would like to share the history behind that idea.

04:15.600 --> 04:23.440
So the journey started in 2021 when we decided to rewrite, to completely rewrite our productivity

04:23.440 --> 04:24.440
platform.

04:24.440 --> 04:29.800
I am talking about that platform I mean the package with CRM, project management, mail

04:29.840 --> 04:31.840
clients and many many other features.

04:31.840 --> 04:42.440
So the main idea was to implement infinite scalability and in that same year we released

04:42.440 --> 04:49.640
free for personal use app server that made it faster, more stable and more functional

04:49.640 --> 04:53.600
and the idea shifted slightly.

04:53.600 --> 05:02.360
So we decided not only to rewrite the architecture but also to change the mechanisms of working

05:02.360 --> 05:12.880
with documents and in 2023 we released on office doc space.

05:12.880 --> 05:19.720
The main point for everyone who tries to integrate our solutions into their services is that

05:19.840 --> 05:25.680
there can benefit from our extended experience in the integration.

05:25.680 --> 05:30.920
So many office solutions and productivity platforms when working with the files create

05:30.920 --> 05:37.480
a mess of unstructured files, folders, subfolders but with only office doc space you are able

05:37.480 --> 05:44.280
to create rooms, doc space rooms which allow you to clearly structure your files depending

05:44.280 --> 05:47.960
on your requirements on the project goals.

05:48.080 --> 05:55.800
And when you have a long to do list every day so it is smart not to waste much time on

05:55.800 --> 06:00.400
every day routine like creating sharing or anything with the files.

06:00.400 --> 06:05.160
In only office there is no need to work with each file individually.

06:05.160 --> 06:13.120
You can create a room and all files within that room will be available according to the

06:13.120 --> 06:15.520
access level of the room.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.560
So there are few types of the rooms at the moment.

06:18.560 --> 06:21.120
Let's start with collaboration room.

06:21.120 --> 06:26.400
These rooms are perfect for those who are trying to work on the documents together to

06:26.400 --> 06:28.000
co-edit their documents.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.920
So here in these rooms you can make use of all beautiful co-editing features of only

06:34.920 --> 06:42.320
office software like using commenting, mentioning track changes, using revision controls and

06:42.320 --> 06:43.600
many many other features.

06:43.600 --> 06:52.320
So we do have built-in chat and telegram plugins right within the editors to communicate and

06:52.320 --> 06:57.560
we also allow to make audio and video calls using plugins for Zoom, GCE and Rainbow.

06:57.560 --> 07:03.320
So when inviting a user into your room you are able to set the access level.

07:03.320 --> 07:09.720
It may be administrator with full rights, power user with extended rights for editor

07:09.720 --> 07:10.920
or viewer.

07:11.920 --> 07:15.840
So the next type is public rooms.

07:15.840 --> 07:25.960
You can invite anyone using public links and what's very important there is no need to

07:25.960 --> 07:35.800
register somewhere and you can generate multiple links with different access rights.

07:35.800 --> 07:42.040
But you also are able to apply password for all files in the room or for example restricting

07:42.040 --> 07:49.040
the copy of the content of the file is available here or just the downloading and printing

07:49.040 --> 07:51.040
can be disabled.

07:51.040 --> 07:59.040
Yeah and there are also custom rooms that allow you to apply your own settings for any

07:59.040 --> 08:02.000
custom purpose you have in your mind.

08:02.400 --> 08:07.640
Again here everything depends on your use case.

08:07.640 --> 08:13.080
You can create a room for requesting form filling, for requesting commenting or document

08:13.080 --> 08:14.320
reviewing.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.760
Everything depends on your use case.

08:17.760 --> 08:24.880
So on the Office Doc Space includes different viewers and editors for all file types.

08:24.880 --> 08:29.240
Let's start with the digital forms.

08:29.240 --> 08:35.840
Here you are able to work with your forms with your form templates in DocXF or PDF format.

08:35.840 --> 08:41.920
So these PDF forms can be filled in, can be shared with anyone for filling or you can

08:41.920 --> 08:49.800
create or work with the files created by alternative applications of course.

08:49.800 --> 08:54.800
So you can easily view, create or edit text documents.

08:54.800 --> 09:00.080
I hope you are aware that only Office works with almost all text file types.

09:00.080 --> 09:04.320
Office Open XML files are supported but if you'd like you're welcome to work with Open

09:04.320 --> 09:09.400
Document Format or RTFT, TXT, HTML or anything else.

09:09.400 --> 09:17.320
The same for spreadsheets where you can work with your sheets and use more than 400 of

09:17.320 --> 09:20.720
different formulas and functions.

09:20.720 --> 09:27.360
You are also able to create slides using a variety of different animations, transitions

09:27.360 --> 09:32.120
and different objects.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.120
And now to PDF again.

09:34.120 --> 09:45.960
So PDF is widely used in the document workflows from meeting brochures to contracts for signing.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.480
And now you have PDF editor.

09:48.480 --> 09:53.360
You are able to annotate your PDF files using only Office editors.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.600
You are able to work with your PDF.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.640
You can convert your Office Open XML to PDF and vice versa.

09:58.640 --> 10:06.680
You can convert PDF files to Office Open XML to edit them.

10:06.680 --> 10:13.320
Additionally you are able to work with your electronic books that can be converted.

10:13.320 --> 10:20.200
Next feature is integrated media players for working with images or video and audio files.

10:20.200 --> 10:29.760
So the functionality of the described solution can be extended by using plugins and AI integration

10:29.760 --> 10:31.600
in the form of chatGPT plugins.

10:31.600 --> 10:38.680
So you can work with your text, you can make simple requests, generate keywords or images.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.320
Everything depends on your license with chatGPT.

10:41.320 --> 10:47.200
So if you do have chatGPT license you are able to work in the editors with your paid

10:47.200 --> 10:49.080
functions.

10:49.080 --> 10:53.280
If not just work with a free version.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.920
So Office Docspace is created using up-to-date technologies.

10:57.920 --> 11:07.440
We do use .NET Core and .NET Server to ensure reliable backhands and for frontend we do

11:07.440 --> 11:12.320
use React to make sure that everything is mobile friendly.

11:12.320 --> 11:16.240
Office Docspace is a safe way to handle your documents.

11:16.240 --> 11:22.680
So we follow all GDPR and HIPAA rules treating your personal information very carefully.

11:22.680 --> 11:29.080
With flexible permissions and JWT you are able to have complete control over your files

11:29.080 --> 11:36.680
but you are also able to add password protection or watermark everything you have in your room.

11:36.680 --> 11:42.880
For data and transit we do use HTTPS of course and for data at rest we do use industry leading

11:42.880 --> 11:45.600
AES256.

11:45.600 --> 11:51.040
And moreover the administrators can allow some additional settings like trusted mail

11:51.040 --> 11:56.560
demand configuration or session lifetime configuration or for example use two-factor

11:56.560 --> 12:02.560
authentication or single sign-on to have control over the login procedure.

12:02.560 --> 12:07.680
And of course backups and recovery are also here.

12:07.680 --> 12:14.280
So I'm glad to inform you that in the middle of 2023 we have included on the Office Docspace

12:14.280 --> 12:17.280
and our main HackerOne program.

12:17.280 --> 12:22.560
We received few reports and all these reports have been fixed in a timely manner.

12:22.560 --> 12:29.640
So thanks to Ethical HackerSchoolWorks with us in the HackerOne.

12:29.640 --> 12:36.200
On the Office Docspace is primarily designed for web-based operations and we understand

12:36.200 --> 12:41.880
the importance of using it on mobile devices.

12:41.880 --> 12:47.560
On the Office Docspace offer a user-friendly interface with interactive negation between

12:47.560 --> 12:50.800
rooms and settings for example.

12:50.800 --> 12:58.400
And we conducted several usability tests with more than 200 people from different countries

12:58.400 --> 12:59.840
and different industries.

12:59.840 --> 13:07.640
So and according to their feedback only Office has overall usability score 4.1 and the main

13:07.640 --> 13:15.560
advantages were so simplicity, clarity and modern interface.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.720
Of course you can customize your product.

13:17.720 --> 13:22.800
You can change the space name and URL of the portal, Docspace portal.

13:22.800 --> 13:30.360
You can change a color scheme and to support your corporate style you are able to use your

13:30.360 --> 13:35.560
own logo or to change the welcome page.

13:35.560 --> 13:41.680
As for accessibility on the Office Docspace and on the Office Editors are designed to

13:41.680 --> 13:45.720
accommodate users with spatial needs.

13:45.720 --> 13:53.520
So there are few options like screen readers, hotkeys but we do also support different plugins

13:53.520 --> 13:58.400
like voice to text, text to voice or translation for example.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.960
There are a lot of different plugins.

14:00.960 --> 14:08.400
For developers and integrators on the Office provides the ability to extend the functionality

14:08.400 --> 14:12.920
and here you can find the information about our plugin SDK.

14:12.920 --> 14:18.880
So you are welcome to create your own plugins and we do have few plugin samples on our GitHub

14:18.880 --> 14:20.200
page.

14:20.200 --> 14:25.000
For example PDF converter allows you to convert your PDF files to Office Open XML and vice

14:25.000 --> 14:27.240
versa as I said already.

14:27.240 --> 14:34.880
And the next one is draw IOR plugin for working with your professional looking diagrams.

14:34.880 --> 14:41.560
There is a plugin available that converts your audio and video files to text and of course

14:41.560 --> 14:47.000
you store it into your rooms.

14:47.000 --> 14:57.560
Open API documentation allows you to see how to integrate on the Office Docspace rooms

14:57.560 --> 15:07.760
into your product and to give your visitors, I mean visitors of your website ability to

15:07.760 --> 15:13.480
view and interact with documents right on your web page.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.760
Docspace rooms can be integrated into your service as an iframe.

15:16.760 --> 15:25.000
So the same we already have with only Office Docs, just iframe and of course data display

15:25.000 --> 15:27.320
settings can be configured.

15:27.320 --> 15:37.000
And now the main point, so there are a lot of services without document management functionality,

15:37.000 --> 15:44.520
without document editing functionality or without any cloud storage functionality.

15:44.520 --> 15:52.200
And only Office Docspace allows you to add everything you want here.

15:52.200 --> 15:58.960
All these features are available and anything can be used here.

15:58.960 --> 16:05.560
I mean it can be integrated into CRM, into CRMess, into any messenger and the next example

16:05.560 --> 16:11.040
is one of the most popular collaboration solutions on the today's market.

16:11.040 --> 16:12.540
Just an example.

16:12.540 --> 16:22.120
So I'm glad to say that we have only Office Docspace for Zoom integration.

16:22.120 --> 16:26.840
So just go to Zoom marketplace and look for only Office Docspace.

16:26.840 --> 16:33.920
You will be able to install Docspace for working on your documents right within the Zoom meeting.

16:33.920 --> 16:38.640
No additional actions like registration are required here.

16:38.640 --> 16:47.320
I think that everyone can remember him sharing a document and saying, okay, let's write

16:47.320 --> 16:48.880
it down together.

16:48.880 --> 16:56.960
So I mean in the Zoom session, but with only Office there is no need to share your document

16:56.960 --> 17:04.600
with anyone or to give someone access to your screen to work on the documents together.

17:04.600 --> 17:07.960
So just use only Office Docspace application.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.200
The same for WordPress.

17:11.200 --> 17:15.280
Only Office Docspace can be integrated into your WordPress pages.

17:15.280 --> 17:22.120
These are just two examples that show that our product can be integrated into any service.

17:22.120 --> 17:30.040
In 2023 released on the Office Docspace 1 and on the Office Docspace 2 with more than

17:30.040 --> 17:33.000
50 new features.

17:33.000 --> 17:39.560
For example, public rooms are available now right to left interface and better and system

17:39.560 --> 17:41.700
plugins are supported.

17:41.700 --> 17:49.440
And for online editors, as the part of Docspace platform, we delivered three major updates

17:49.440 --> 17:54.600
with more than 200 bug fixes and about 200 new features.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.280
And the last version of only Office Docspace is available now.

17:57.280 --> 18:01.240
So release just a few days ago.

18:01.240 --> 18:09.040
So in the latest release on the Office Docspace 8, we have few very important features.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.040
Again, fillable PDF forms.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.800
We have PDF editors right now.

18:14.800 --> 18:22.000
Another interface for plugins has been updated and we do have long awaited right to left

18:22.000 --> 18:23.880
interface.

18:23.880 --> 18:28.640
That's very important and we understand that we have a long, long way to go with that functionality.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.740
I mean right to left.

18:29.740 --> 18:34.800
This is why we are looking forward for your feedback about that functionality right to

18:34.800 --> 18:35.800
left.

18:35.800 --> 18:41.920
I mean, and we really need feedback from our clients and integrators.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.480
The next point is our performance optimizations.

18:44.480 --> 18:46.320
So here you can see some numbers.

18:46.320 --> 18:50.880
We have moved some portions of the service to the client side.

18:50.880 --> 18:58.000
So and I think this definitely will add some more points to only Office editors.

18:58.000 --> 19:04.840
And thanks to our partners from own cloud, we have now the lower testing results for

19:04.840 --> 19:09.600
100,000 of simultaneous connections.

19:09.600 --> 19:16.040
Having 100,000 of simultaneous connections, I mean that all these connections are active,

19:16.040 --> 19:21.120
sending some information from your client to their server.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.640
You can see the details of the infrastructure.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.920
Everything is in Kubernetes.

19:24.920 --> 19:31.880
So 12 big machines for documents server and two big machines for K6 just to generate that

19:31.880 --> 19:34.920
huge traffic.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.480
On the Office Docspace, we'll soon include private rooms.

19:38.480 --> 19:42.600
We are also going to implement electronic signatures.

19:42.600 --> 19:48.680
And there are more features that we plan to add.

19:48.680 --> 19:54.720
It can be used on the Office Docspace, can be used as a cloud solution, just look for

19:54.720 --> 19:56.760
on the Office Docspace.

19:56.760 --> 20:01.720
And if you'd like, you are welcome to install it as an on-premise.

20:01.720 --> 20:06.600
So in Kubernetes or any type of deployment.

20:06.600 --> 20:10.240
To try in the cloud.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.840
To try download in server version.

20:12.840 --> 20:17.440
So and thanks a lot for your attention.

20:17.440 --> 20:20.200
If you have any questions, we'll be happy to assist.

20:20.200 --> 20:25.200
We are here to guys in this on the Office t-shirts.

20:25.200 --> 20:26.200
Yeah.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.680
Thank you.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.640
Thank you very much.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.640
Are there any questions?

20:32.640 --> 20:33.640
Yes.

20:33.640 --> 20:46.320
Just a question about interfacing type of document worksheets.

20:46.320 --> 20:55.080
And so also because the documents in database formats and Writers and so on have problems

20:55.080 --> 21:05.080
to with Google from Google Docs to Google Sheets, it doesn't work.

21:05.080 --> 21:07.480
And so you have this kind of functionality.

21:07.480 --> 21:14.480
And also it was very interesting for me to gain a lot of text, a lot of time with converting

21:14.480 --> 21:19.560
speech to document.

21:19.560 --> 21:23.720
So there's a first question about whether there's an integration between sheets and

21:23.720 --> 21:28.320
documents and the second one about converting speech to document.

21:28.320 --> 21:33.360
So the first question, yes, we do have.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.360
Sure.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.360
Yeah.

21:35.360 --> 21:40.520
We do have plugins to add that functionality right within the editors.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.840
You can work with that.

21:41.840 --> 21:46.160
But you need to install an extra plugin for working with that.

21:46.160 --> 21:50.400
So and what about the integration between two types?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.040
Yeah, two types of the editors.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.040
Yeah, I see.

21:53.040 --> 21:57.480
But as far as I understand, you are working with X-Wiki right now.

21:57.480 --> 21:58.480
And no.

21:58.480 --> 21:59.480
No.

21:59.480 --> 22:00.480
No.

22:00.480 --> 22:01.480
No.

22:01.480 --> 22:02.480
Yeah.

22:02.480 --> 22:04.480
It's a free question.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.480
Yeah.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.560
And no, I mean the product.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.560
I mean the product.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.720
So maybe you just have one of the previous versions of OnlyOffice, for example.

22:12.720 --> 22:16.480
And there was your question about interface.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.480
Yeah.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.720
There was your question about interface.

22:18.720 --> 22:19.720
Yeah.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Yeah.

22:21.000 --> 22:26.400
And I think that your question before, you are before.

22:26.400 --> 22:33.640
So you will be able to find a solution in one of the next version of the OnlyOffice.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.640
And what about the integration between these two types of editors?

22:36.640 --> 22:40.840
Yes, we do have that again in the latest versions of the OnlyOffice.

22:40.840 --> 22:44.720
For example, let's try work with OnlyOffice docs 8.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.720
Great.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.720
Any other question?

22:48.720 --> 22:50.720
There was somebody there I think.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.720
No, yes, no.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.720
Okay, thank you very much.

22:55.720 --> 22:56.720
And.

22:56.720 --> 22:57.720
And.

22:57.720 --> 22:58.720
And.

22:58.720 --> 22:59.720
And.

22:59.720 --> 23:00.720
And.

23:00.720 --> 23:01.720
And.

23:01.720 --> 23:02.720
And.

23:02.720 --> 23:03.720
And.

23:03.720 --> 23:04.720
And.

23:04.720 --> 23:05.720
And.

23:05.720 --> 23:06.720
And.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.720
And.

23:07.720 --> 23:08.720
And.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.720
And.

23:09.720 --> 23:10.720
And.

23:10.720 --> 23:11.720
And.

23:11.720 --> 23:12.720
And.

23:12.720 --> 23:13.720
And.

23:13.720 --> 23:14.720
And.

23:14.720 --> 23:15.720
And.
