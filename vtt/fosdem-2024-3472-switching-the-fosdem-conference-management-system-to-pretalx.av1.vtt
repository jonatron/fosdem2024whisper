WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.680
Okay, so next we have Johan van de Waal speaking on switching the FOSDEM conference management

00:14.680 --> 00:15.680
system to pre-talks.

00:15.680 --> 00:16.680
It's already time?

00:16.680 --> 00:17.680
It's not too early?

00:17.680 --> 00:18.680
Okay.

00:18.680 --> 00:19.680
Wow, thank you.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
Hello, everyone.

00:20.680 --> 00:31.640
I'm going to talk about, well, maybe not such a technical issue, but I'm going to talk about

00:31.640 --> 00:37.600
how we migrated from PENTABARV, which is a logo on the left, to pre-talks as our conference

00:37.600 --> 00:41.000
management system.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.440
So very short thing about me.

00:43.440 --> 00:44.920
I do scientific programming.

00:44.920 --> 00:50.640
I developed together with my friend over there, fiber-based monitoring solutions.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.880
And apart from that, I've been in FOSDEM team for quite some time.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.040
I visited for the first time in 2007.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.880
I did some research for this presentation.

01:00.880 --> 01:05.280
And I've managed the geospatial dev room, and since a few years I've been coordinating

01:05.280 --> 01:09.560
the dev rooms, and I'm part of the server team of FOSDEM.

01:09.560 --> 01:14.680
I am not a web developer, and I'm also not good at slides, as you can see.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.240
It's important to know.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.800
So what is pre-talks?

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
Oh, no.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.800
What is PENTABARV?

01:19.800 --> 01:20.800
And what is pre-talks?

01:20.800 --> 01:21.800
What do we use it for?

01:21.800 --> 01:27.360
PENTABARV and pre-talks are the tools that we use where people will submit their talk,

01:27.360 --> 01:33.680
where dev room managers or we or staff will choose our talks, we will review, we will

01:33.680 --> 01:38.880
build a schedule, and then finally we will publish it on the website using that tool.

01:38.880 --> 01:43.320
This is the tool we used, which was called PENTABARV.

01:43.320 --> 01:48.720
This is the new tool pre-talks, which we use this year for the first time.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.520
Why did we switch?

01:51.520 --> 01:56.040
Anyone here, who of you has actually submitted a talk this year?

01:56.040 --> 01:57.040
Okay.

01:57.040 --> 02:00.640
Who are the dev room managers in the room?

02:00.640 --> 02:02.920
Well, okay, at least one.

02:02.920 --> 02:05.280
Yeah, most of them are in their dev room, of course.

02:05.280 --> 02:10.640
So I would love to get some feedback from them.

02:10.640 --> 02:15.240
So what was the main issue with PENTABARV before?

02:15.240 --> 02:18.360
The main issue with PENTABARV is that it's Ruby on Rails.

02:18.360 --> 02:23.800
I tried to get it running on my computer for a few years because we wanted to improve it,

02:23.800 --> 02:25.040
but it didn't work.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.000
I couldn't get it working.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.560
Actually my next slide is maybe more interesting.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.480
This is a screenshot I made.

02:32.480 --> 02:35.280
So this was a state of pre-talks.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.120
This is their master repository.

02:37.120 --> 02:41.440
So you can see it has been abandoned for quite some time.

02:41.440 --> 02:48.240
We made a fork with a nice name Postgres9, which gives you an ID about when it happens.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.440
And you can see we did some updates, but not too much.

02:51.440 --> 02:54.520
You would get people making pull requests like this.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.400
So yeah, I could not install it.

02:56.400 --> 03:02.840
So in the web archive, I found install instructions, and they wanted to add that.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.960
I also found those install instructions, and we had some in our internal wiki, but without

03:07.960 --> 03:13.320
that, even with those, I could not get it running.

03:13.320 --> 03:19.600
That's why at some point I said no, I will not improve PENTABARV.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.720
I went to improve another project, which is still in use for other conferences.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.440
So I had a look at pre-talks.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.680
Pre-talks is a Django application.

03:28.680 --> 03:32.480
And when I tried it, I was struggling with that for a very, very long time.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.880
And at the end of the evening, I said, well, let's try the other one.

03:35.880 --> 03:40.200
So I just did this Docker compose stuff, and I had this thing running, and I could import

03:40.200 --> 03:42.200
a schedule which was generated before.

03:42.200 --> 03:47.720
And I almost had something that looked like a full conference system for FOSM ready, maybe

03:47.720 --> 03:49.120
after one hour.

03:49.120 --> 03:52.800
So I was quite happy with that.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.920
Yeah.

03:56.920 --> 04:02.400
So I was not the first one who had planned to move from pre-talks, because what are actually

04:02.400 --> 04:04.280
the issues with PENTABARV?

04:04.280 --> 04:06.440
The main issue was nobody could install it.

04:06.440 --> 04:10.640
It was still running, but we didn't know for how long.

04:10.640 --> 04:15.560
And if some strange bug would occur, I'm not sure anyone in our team would be really capable.

04:15.560 --> 04:20.020
Well, if there's really a bad bug, people will start to become a bit better, and they

04:20.020 --> 04:24.360
might fix it, but it was unmaintained for such a long time.

04:24.360 --> 04:28.880
So there have been many plans to move, but they usually failed because then they said,

04:28.880 --> 04:32.480
well, we need to have that feature, and that feature, and that feature, and that feature.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.840
And the other thing is nobody works on FOSM until, let's say, September.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.720
In September, we do a kickoff, then we open the call for dev rooms, and then it's like,

04:41.720 --> 04:42.960
okay, yeah, we're too late.

04:42.960 --> 04:43.960
It's not yet ready.

04:43.960 --> 04:44.960
We cannot use it.

04:44.960 --> 04:49.040
And then the next year, nobody will work on FOSM until September when, again, they kick

04:49.040 --> 04:50.600
in, and it's not ready.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.640
There's also some resistance to change.

04:52.640 --> 04:57.040
People will say, it works for us, so we don't need to change it.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.640
That's part of the...

04:58.640 --> 05:00.160
This is mostly the internal people.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.560
This is not the people submitting.

05:01.560 --> 05:06.240
We had people, kernel developers, sending videos of trying to login and do PentaBARF

05:06.240 --> 05:07.240
without it working.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.760
So I think that's quite a bad state.

05:10.760 --> 05:18.800
So in order to avoid those things, there are a few things I wanted to have before the kickoff

05:18.800 --> 05:20.040
that we have in September.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.400
And for me, there's were two things.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.280
It was building a website.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.800
It should be possible from PTOX.

05:25.800 --> 05:30.200
And the second thing is having an audit log.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.800
What is an audit log?

05:31.800 --> 05:34.040
This is an example from PentaBARF.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.720
It is everything which is entered into the system.

05:36.720 --> 05:43.000
It's actually interesting that somebody gave feedback on a talk of a year ago, but it was

05:43.000 --> 05:45.440
the last thing I could find.

05:45.440 --> 05:48.520
But it shows the difference everywhere in the system.

05:48.520 --> 05:54.240
And this is really useful because we have had these discussions.

05:54.240 --> 06:02.200
This year, some deaf room manager approved a talk in another deaf room.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.720
And then, yeah, that's a bit...

06:03.720 --> 06:07.520
It's not nice because the speaker, he books a stick and he thinks he can go.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.280
And then, oh, that was a mistake.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.240
We fixed that, by the way, so they can no longer approve each other's talks, but in the beginning

06:13.240 --> 06:15.400
it was possible.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.920
We had a presentation where they completely changed the scope after it was approved.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.080
It was also not very nice.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.680
And then you can always go back and see what was history.

06:23.680 --> 06:27.440
I actually would really recommend people if they do something.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.880
Use such a log even for normal database, but definitely for a conference management system,

06:32.880 --> 06:35.040
it makes sense.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.360
So this was one of the two things I wanted to have ready by September.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.360
It didn't have to look nice.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.440
This on the left is very useful.

06:41.440 --> 06:46.480
This on the right, well, you can do those things if you need them, but you will not

06:46.480 --> 06:48.040
get happy from it.

06:48.040 --> 06:53.200
But at least we had a way to find out if strange things happened, how they were happened.

06:53.200 --> 06:57.700
It was also a template for both changes, or if we changed some configuration, then at

06:57.700 --> 07:04.120
least we could trace back what was history.

07:04.120 --> 07:10.080
The second big thing which we needed, which I said, was to be able to build a website.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.080
Why?

07:11.080 --> 07:16.320
Because our website is used by all of our other integrations, or most of them, which

07:16.320 --> 07:23.400
include Matrix S review, which is what people use to review their videos, and all the scheduling

07:23.400 --> 07:26.600
applications that you have on your phone.

07:26.600 --> 07:31.920
So that was also one of the things which had to be ready, at least in some form, before

07:31.920 --> 07:34.600
we could switch.

07:34.600 --> 07:38.960
Yeah, I forgot.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.240
Oh yes, now I know again.

07:41.240 --> 07:46.800
A third thing which I did, but this actually only started after this initial session.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.920
This was during the actual organization of the event.

07:49.920 --> 07:56.720
I created a plugin for pre-talks, which has some specific settings for FOSDM.

07:56.720 --> 08:01.800
For example, people, they will pull out a call for papers on the website.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.240
They could enter it here.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.520
Well actually, all of them, they send it by mail before I had the system ready, but at

08:06.520 --> 08:09.000
least next year they will be able to do it.

08:09.120 --> 08:12.680
It's a bit similar for most of the other boxes which are there.

08:12.680 --> 08:19.480
So they can close their call for papers, so people can stop submitting to their track,

08:19.480 --> 08:23.160
because some tracks like to keep it open for a longer time, but then at least they get

08:23.160 --> 08:24.880
a URL where they can still submit.

08:24.880 --> 08:30.000
So if you're really quick, you can get that code and submit to the main track, but I don't

08:30.000 --> 08:33.800
think anyone will accept it.

08:33.800 --> 08:39.840
During the event, this is actually something I actually fixed this morning.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.720
Dev room manager will find some instructions.

08:42.720 --> 08:46.000
I hope that this will grow a bit over the next year, so that they have only one place

08:46.000 --> 08:50.920
to look while doing their team.

08:50.920 --> 08:58.480
Yeah, so I wrote here most of the things were already a bit late, but it was also only the

08:58.480 --> 09:03.520
way during the conference that it was like enough vibe to add those things, to build them,

09:03.640 --> 09:07.400
to realize that we needed them, because if you just click around in the interface, it

09:07.400 --> 09:11.120
all looks fine, but it's only when you start using it that you notice that you need some

09:11.120 --> 09:14.320
extra tools, unless you're really good at testing.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.960
I'm not.

09:16.960 --> 09:25.800
We had to make some changes to pre-talks itself, mostly to limit Devroom managers to edit other

09:25.800 --> 09:29.160
people's things.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.880
I made some changes to the review system.

09:31.880 --> 09:34.480
As I said before, sometimes it is too late.

09:34.480 --> 09:37.600
This was something I didn't understand that no one of them complained, because if they

09:37.600 --> 09:41.760
did reviews and they clicked next review, they would get a random track from another

09:41.760 --> 09:42.760
thing.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.800
That doesn't really make sense, so I changed it.

09:44.800 --> 09:50.920
It would always stay in the same track.

09:50.920 --> 09:51.920
So what are submissions?

09:51.920 --> 09:56.120
This was by default not enabled, but we have some people who submit a lot of talks.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.760
One person submitted 15 talks for this Boston.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.760
So if all of those are in different tracks, all of these Devroom managers, they would

10:02.760 --> 10:05.880
spend time in looking at the same proposal again.

10:05.880 --> 10:11.600
Well, now if they see the list, then at least they know, okay, he is already there.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.040
Let's keep him.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.320
The last things we've had to change, which are a bit complicated and where I'm maybe

10:17.320 --> 10:22.000
not completely happy about the workflow, is the fact that we have parallel scheduling.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.440
So pre-talks in itself, it's actually made for, you have a large group of reviewers,

10:26.440 --> 10:30.160
and then you have a small group of people who actually built a schedule, which works

10:30.160 --> 10:35.280
for most conferences, but which doesn't work for FOSM, because we have a lot of people

10:35.280 --> 10:40.280
scheduling.

10:40.280 --> 10:44.200
So well, that's actually the nice side.

10:44.200 --> 10:48.880
Some of the last things which I want to mention, these are like the annoyances of at least

10:48.880 --> 10:53.520
some of the people, mostly from the staff.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.440
Pre-talks is much less information dense.

10:55.440 --> 10:59.960
If you look just even to the resolution, you see that here, all information is a bit spread

10:59.960 --> 11:03.040
out over the screen, while here it's very close to each other.

11:03.040 --> 11:04.040
You have a search book.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.400
If you start typing here, you will get to any talk.

11:06.400 --> 11:11.800
Here you would go to proposals, then click on talks, then type in the checkbooks, then

11:11.800 --> 11:12.800
search.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.200
It will take you much more time.

11:14.200 --> 11:23.400
So this is one of the annoyances we had this year, which we hope to improve for next year.

11:23.400 --> 11:27.080
Things that we had over Penta, so these are things which already went better this year,

11:27.080 --> 11:29.920
even though it was like a migration year.

11:29.920 --> 11:35.160
There were much more reviews, so that was, we could reach a larger group, I think, because

11:35.160 --> 11:39.840
it was easier to use, or maybe because we promoted a bit more.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.920
Devroom managers, they can now send mails.

11:43.920 --> 11:48.800
Before they had to export all the email addresses, then run it through their own mail program

11:48.800 --> 11:51.160
and then send mails.

11:51.160 --> 11:54.380
While here they are in the system, if you would go back as a speaker, you can click

11:54.380 --> 12:02.280
open those things and find your mails by yourself.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.040
So finally, I have only three minutes left.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.040
What are the roadmap?

12:06.040 --> 12:08.720
What are the IDs?

12:08.720 --> 12:11.560
First of all, the audit log, which I showed you, it's a bit integrated.

12:11.560 --> 12:15.720
Well, actually, the code is quite separate, but as soon as pre-talks makes another release,

12:15.720 --> 12:21.080
I want to make it a separate plugin, which can be installed completely apart from Falsum,

12:21.200 --> 12:25.600
because I think it's interesting for all pre-talks users who choose Postgres, they just should

12:25.600 --> 12:26.600
use it.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.640
It will always help you.

12:28.640 --> 12:32.680
And then the next part is actually a bit going back to what I told earlier, Pentabar

12:32.680 --> 12:34.400
which was so hard to install.

12:34.400 --> 12:39.280
I don't want to create a new plugin which is as hard to install as pre-talks.

12:39.280 --> 12:42.200
Well, nowadays it's a bit hard.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.400
We have a demo site, which is that one, pre-talks test.

12:45.400 --> 12:51.520
So I actually want to make that into something that you can install with.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.320
It will not be one click, but it will be quite easy to install.

12:54.320 --> 12:58.720
So people who want to improve it, that they at least can do.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.120
Yes.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.400
Then the other thing is we made some custom changes.

13:03.400 --> 13:08.560
I hope to get rid of them, integrate either them into pre-talks or make sure that there

13:08.560 --> 13:14.760
are signals which are like places in the interface where we change something, but that it's already

13:14.760 --> 13:18.880
ready for it so that we can put it into the plugin instead of in the code itself which

13:18.880 --> 13:19.880
is forked.

13:19.880 --> 13:25.640
The last thing is we want to get more information about previous year submissions because it's

13:25.640 --> 13:30.560
interesting especially for main track speakers to see has this person presented before, how

13:30.560 --> 13:32.480
was the feedback?

13:32.480 --> 13:37.240
Maybe he gave the same presentation already, then we will skip him, those kind of things.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.320
Finally, my last slide.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.320
You can help.

13:41.320 --> 13:46.160
Well, an obvious way is to help upstream with the project.

13:46.160 --> 13:47.760
Pre-talks is used by a lot of other conferences.

13:47.760 --> 13:52.160
I believe they have about 100 conferences or something like that organized every year with

13:52.160 --> 13:53.800
pre-talks.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.840
Maybe much more than, sorry for it.

13:57.840 --> 14:02.920
We have our own repos, but especially the first one is useful.

14:02.920 --> 14:09.720
That's a pre-talks integration because that's the place where we really do the bug tracker.

14:10.080 --> 14:16.160
I put some questions there and I intend to put a few more also with questions for you.

14:16.160 --> 14:21.920
Then especially I mean you are the users like the dev room managers.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.640
Which settings do you want to have for reviews?

14:23.640 --> 14:28.800
Do you want to score from 0 to 10 or from 0 to 100 or in different categories?

14:28.800 --> 14:34.480
I just made a random choice and you should get some feedback.

14:34.480 --> 14:39.280
Then there are the two forked repos which are actually only useful in combination with

14:39.280 --> 14:40.640
the other one.

14:40.640 --> 14:45.640
I just give them for completeness.

14:45.640 --> 14:46.140
That's my talk.
