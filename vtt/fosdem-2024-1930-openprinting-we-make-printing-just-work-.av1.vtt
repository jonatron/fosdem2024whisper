Dear audience, please give a warm welcome to Peter Kirtel Kampeter, who is the leader

00:14.880 --> 00:21.840
of the Open Printing Project, being an employee of Canonical, doing all the great works to

00:21.840 --> 00:29.400
make printing easy, not only on Linux, but also on quite an amount of other operating

00:29.400 --> 00:33.080
system. Thank you. Have a nice talk.

00:33.080 --> 00:37.080
Thanks.

00:37.080 --> 00:46.360
So I will tell about how Open Printing has emerged and what we are doing, what are the

00:46.360 --> 00:53.760
challenges, and in the end I will also even tell a little bit about printing under Windows,

00:53.760 --> 01:00.720
but I am not developing the printing part of Windows and Windows does not use cups.

01:00.720 --> 01:13.560
So let's start. What we are doing is the central part of our work is naturally that

01:13.560 --> 01:22.840
we have cups and we integrate cups in the, we develop cups. This is done by Michael

01:22.840 --> 01:30.640
Sweet, but it's a part of Open Printing. Michael Sweet has left Apple. We are also,

01:30.640 --> 01:38.720
we are also integrating cups into the operating system. We are doing it by cups filters, for

01:38.720 --> 01:46.320
example, and that I am also also contributing to GoScript and I am also coordinating with

01:46.480 --> 01:57.720
desktops and we are working together with a printer working group. This is a consortium

01:57.720 --> 02:05.560
of industry, of printer industry and software industry. They are developing standards, especially

02:05.560 --> 02:18.200
the Internet Printing Protocol, IPP, and we work together with them. We have also annual

02:18.200 --> 02:30.920
meetings and we are implementing these standards in software. For example, cups is all IPP-based

02:31.000 --> 02:39.120
and what changes and comes new in IPP like driverless IPP printing, we are updating everything

02:39.120 --> 02:44.840
and implementing this so that it can be used in our operating systems.

02:47.160 --> 02:47.680
And,

02:48.280 --> 03:03.920
yes, and we are also cooperating naturally with printer manufacturers. I had also, I was also

03:03.920 --> 03:09.280
a lot in dialogue with printer manufacturers, especially longer ago when one still needed

03:09.280 --> 03:19.800
printer drivers to help them to design drivers and to do it the right way. And so these are the

03:19.800 --> 03:27.480
principal tasks also to the, also part of the integration of printing is that one, that we,

03:27.480 --> 03:35.560
that the packaging, for example, I am doing not only the package, the Debian packaging for Ubuntu,

03:36.560 --> 03:46.560
but I am also doing the cup snap, so a snap package of cups, which one can easily download from

03:46.560 --> 03:55.080
the snap store and this we are having the always the newest upstream cups on any distribution,

03:55.080 --> 04:01.320
but also for snap only distributions like Ubuntu Core Desktop. But about this I will talk at

04:01.400 --> 04:09.080
130 in the distribution zoom with a snap and Ubuntu Core Desktop talk and,

04:12.840 --> 04:21.800
so how did it all begin? One thing is I had a printing problem like Richard Stallman had also

04:21.800 --> 04:29.000
a printing problem. He invented the principle of free software and therefore we are all here. And

04:29.960 --> 04:39.400
I had also, I was system administrator in the late 90s and there we had also printers and

04:39.400 --> 04:51.320
they only worked so more or less because we were in the dark times of LPD and in the beginning of

04:51.400 --> 05:02.760
2000 cups appeared. Michael Sweet has released the 1.0 of cups in 2000 and there was an article,

05:02.760 --> 05:09.560
a news, a Linux magazine article by called Pfeifler about cups and I have read it and I have seen

05:09.560 --> 05:15.640
all of this, this will help us a lot and I have installed it and everything worked better with it

05:16.520 --> 05:23.960
and so, but it was all command line and so I have written a little print dialogue and put it on

05:23.960 --> 05:31.240
fresh meat in that time in 2000 fresh meat was the place where one told about new free software and

05:32.920 --> 05:40.600
then the court Pfeifler the author of this article saw this invited me to the Linux

05:40.600 --> 05:48.200
talk, a big Linux conference to show it on the booth of his company and so I showed it there

05:49.160 --> 05:55.080
and most distros were not interested in cups and print dialogue and so, but Mendox soft.

05:55.880 --> 06:05.240
The show was in the beginning of July 2000 and first of August I lived in Paris because Mendox

06:05.240 --> 06:18.680
soft invited me to work with them to switch to switch mandrel Linux from LPD to cups so I lived

06:18.680 --> 06:31.480
six years in Paris but please don't try to speak French to me and then I had and then I have in

06:31.480 --> 06:41.720
a few months already switched mandrel Linux to two cups so the fall edition of mandrel Linux in 2000

06:42.360 --> 06:50.360
was the first Linux distribution with cups and there were also some challenges so that

06:52.360 --> 06:53.880
especially I

07:01.960 --> 07:17.800
had not only two package cups and RPM packages this was the easiest part but I had also to take care

07:17.800 --> 07:24.760
that all the printers which worked before they work afterwards after the switch over there were

07:24.840 --> 07:31.880
drivers many were built into Go script and many were a small little filter program which some

07:31.880 --> 07:38.680
student has written to get their printer working and but they all did not come with PPD files because

07:38.680 --> 07:47.320
they were written with only LPD in mind and not with cups in mind and I needed a way to get PPD

07:47.320 --> 07:53.000
files for them all because cups needs PPD files and there was linuxprinting.org

07:55.240 --> 08:02.280
someone has created a website linuxprinting.org and there was a database with printers how

08:02.280 --> 08:09.480
will they work and with which driver and especially with the PPD file generator and the database for

08:09.480 --> 08:17.800
the PPD file generator needed also much more information options paper sizes and resolutions and

08:17.800 --> 08:26.520
whatever but most of these entries did not have that some have that and so I knew that this works

08:26.520 --> 08:33.320
and so I asked the author to to fill in the rest and he did not have the time and so he gave me

08:33.320 --> 08:41.320
right access and in 2000 and in 2001 even the full control of the site so that I continued

08:41.320 --> 08:49.240
maintaining it and so I filled in this database and this way I could make all the printers working

08:49.240 --> 08:56.840
with cups and therefore the mandrake linux the first mandrake linux with cups was working perfectly

08:56.840 --> 09:04.920
and printing was work much much easier than with in old LPD times and I also gave talks on

09:04.920 --> 09:11.480
conferences organized every year on the linux tag and open printing booth and so on and so I

09:11.480 --> 09:20.760
spread the news of cups as Michael sweet themselves was stage shy he did not go to conferences and so

09:21.320 --> 09:28.120
and so the other distros saw it and switched all over in 2003 also all the distros used cups

09:28.200 --> 09:37.080
and so I made cups the standard and I also found it open printing in 2001

09:38.360 --> 09:53.320
in together with some people from the PWG and so this was the start

09:58.920 --> 10:01.320
and

10:03.880 --> 10:12.920
and in an LPD and any other approach to make printing better like PPR, PDQ or whatever they were called

10:13.480 --> 10:22.200
they all stopped maintaining because everyone used cups and nobody wanted to use all these other things

10:28.520 --> 10:36.600
yes I found it open printing in 2001 it was not what it is now it was at first that I worked

10:36.600 --> 10:47.400
together with some people of the PWG to to uh on printing APIs I had every every week

10:49.320 --> 10:56.520
a phone meeting a phone meeting not yet video phone classic phone uh to talk about

10:57.480 --> 11:00.200
APIs and to develop APIs

11:02.520 --> 11:12.280
and I continued naturally to maintain to to my work with cups and with linux printing.art

11:12.280 --> 11:27.400
database and so on and one thing is back in in 2006 I organized my very first

11:28.760 --> 11:39.640
open printing summit in Atlanta Georgia in the US at uh at RICO and it was a lanyere that time but

11:39.720 --> 11:49.080
probably now they are all called RICO and there there were there I brought something like 40

11:49.080 --> 11:58.680
people together from printing projects desktop projects uh printer manufacturers, printer driver

11:58.680 --> 12:07.720
projects and so on to work together on the future of printing on improving print dialogues especially

12:07.720 --> 12:17.080
on on improving drivers and so on and on this meeting there was also Jan Murdoch one of the

12:17.080 --> 12:27.240
founders of Debian therefore the Jan in the end of Debian and I asked him I talked with him in a

12:27.240 --> 12:35.480
hallway session and I asked him this I told told him that the the linux printing.art server the

12:35.560 --> 12:44.600
database server is standing in the house of the of its original author and it's already carrying

12:44.600 --> 12:52.280
official ppd files of manufacturers and it should be for security and reliability that

12:52.280 --> 12:59.320
that should be in the data center whether they're at Debian they could perhaps host it or at the

12:59.320 --> 13:08.520
free standards group we uh uh uh Jan Murdoch was also uh was also engaged in the free standards

13:08.520 --> 13:16.040
group and open printing this api effort was also part done as part of the free standards group

13:16.040 --> 13:23.960
and so Jan told me I can host it at the free standards group but he did not only want to host

13:24.920 --> 13:31.800
the database server he also wanted to host me he invited me to work at the free standards group

13:31.800 --> 13:43.160
full time to manage open printing to to join the linuxprinting.org and the open printing

13:43.880 --> 13:54.520
work in one call it open printing and this is the open printing of now and the free standards group

13:55.160 --> 14:07.080
has eaten up the OSTF the open source developer laboratory in one year later in 2007 and founded

14:07.080 --> 14:13.800
the linux foundation and so open printing is part of the linux foundation and I was working at the

14:13.800 --> 14:23.000
linux foundation that time but in parallel in 2006 in 2006 on the open printing summit where I also

14:23.000 --> 14:30.360
was where I was organizing an open printing booth I bumped into Mark Shuddleworth he also asked me

14:30.360 --> 14:39.000
whether I want to work at canonical and so I started part-time at canonical also and then I was at

14:39.000 --> 14:48.520
canonical and at linux foundation full-time working for open printing and I could leave Paris because

14:48.600 --> 14:49.640
I worked from home

14:57.000 --> 15:08.360
and then in the time and then time was going on and the next step was that in 2008 I started

15:08.360 --> 15:15.880
meant I started to to be the org admin for the linux foundation for the google summer of code

15:16.440 --> 15:23.080
every year up to now and the open printing a part of it so open printing was in the google summer

15:23.080 --> 15:31.880
of code and I was mentoring students mentoring open print open google summer of code contributors

15:31.880 --> 15:38.600
for open printing and this was very important because printing is not really sexy for volunteers

15:38.600 --> 15:48.840
to choose this and so by means of heavily engaging in open printing I get contributors who contribute

15:48.840 --> 15:57.880
code and some even stay and continue mentoring or the website we have now is also done by former

15:57.880 --> 15:59.960
google summer of code contributors

16:07.000 --> 16:14.840
and also from 2006 on I organized every year an open printing summit later on together with a pwg

16:14.840 --> 16:33.880
and another another milestone more more recently on the open printing summits every year I was

16:34.680 --> 16:45.080
I've met avik bazu from lexmark in India and he has contacts to universities in India and from

16:45.080 --> 16:53.240
2015 on every year he was reaching out to the universities and finding for us contributors we

16:53.240 --> 17:02.520
have then done some some selection they have done fixed some issues for us and so on to learn

17:03.240 --> 17:10.520
to work with open printing and so we had five or six every year working coding for us

17:12.200 --> 17:18.120
they were mainly from therefore they were mainly from Indian universities and mainly from the iit

17:18.600 --> 17:28.600
Indian Indian Institute of Technology Monday and therefore I have also organized a conference last

17:28.600 --> 17:44.840
year in Monday and met them in person so and what we have all done is that at first we have

17:45.160 --> 17:55.800
we have made cups the standard printing system as I told and it is used in more in all posic

17:55.800 --> 18:04.440
style operating systems including mac os michael sweet has been for a long time at apple and

18:05.240 --> 18:13.240
worked on cup and developed cups and integrated and mac os mac os he has left in the end of

18:14.120 --> 18:24.040
2019 and he continues to develop cups and now it is hosted at all and since then it's hosted at

18:24.040 --> 18:33.000
open printing and all I have made off three printer drivers working with cups as I told and I have

18:35.560 --> 18:43.000
and another thing is in former times in LPD times the standard print job format was post script

18:43.000 --> 18:49.080
because the only printers in that time which could print graphical content and were used with

18:49.080 --> 18:56.280
unix machines and computing centers at universities were typically a post script printers and so

18:56.280 --> 19:05.480
post script was the standard format for printing graphical content and this got and in 2006

19:06.760 --> 19:12.360
as there were so many printers with so many different printing languages and post script is

19:12.360 --> 19:19.000
also rather awkward it's not secure it's a two-in-complete programming language so one can

19:19.000 --> 19:27.080
inject malware with it so we did we mic sweet and me have decided to switch the standard print job

19:27.080 --> 19:39.720
format to pdf and so since 2006 the standard printing format is pdf not really in real life it took

19:39.720 --> 19:49.320
some years until the distributions actually were using pdf as standard print job format I think 2010

19:49.320 --> 20:01.560
or so pdf was always used I also I also did a grand unified ghost script as in the 2000s when Mike

20:02.120 --> 20:09.880
wrote cups he made a false fork of ghost script for the cups last format and to integrate some third

20:09.880 --> 20:19.000
party printer drivers because the ghost script the original ghost script the top of the line the newest

20:19.000 --> 20:25.480
version was not free software they released it as free software only one year later and so

20:25.640 --> 20:35.800
we so this was also a reason why Mike did the fork and in 2008 the ghost folks decided to

20:37.000 --> 20:44.040
release the ghost from the top of the line also as free software and this was for me then the point

20:44.600 --> 20:51.640
to do the grand unified ghost script to to do the reunification of ghost script to put Mike's ghost

20:51.640 --> 20:57.320
script and the original ghost script and third party driver all together and then all was there at

20:57.320 --> 21:09.240
artifacts but unified in one ghost script and and system config printers also maintained by

21:09.240 --> 21:22.840
open printing it was originally the printer setup tool of wetted and wetted was and later on when I

21:22.840 --> 21:35.000
have left mandu xsoft and I entered canonical and Ubuntu needed a printer setup tool I I ended up to

21:35.000 --> 21:44.680
take system config printer for that and improved it a lot for especially for the association of

21:44.680 --> 21:51.960
drivers and printers with each other that this works fully automatically and correctly and then

21:52.680 --> 22:02.840
in then in 2011 also 2010 to I think 2011 Apple has decided to not maintain the cups

22:02.840 --> 22:09.480
filters anymore which Apple does not need because Apple uses their own proprietary filters and I've

22:09.480 --> 22:16.760
overtaken this code as the cups filters project and maintain and then I have maintained it on open printing

22:20.040 --> 22:26.040
and another thing the common print dialogue backends this is something the print dialogue

22:26.040 --> 22:35.240
contains the print dialogue communicates with cups for printing and there are many print dialogues

22:35.240 --> 22:47.640
and many GUI projects Mozilla KDE GNOME LibreOffice and Chromium and all of them are big projects

22:47.640 --> 22:55.240
lot of inertia difficult to find the right contact and so it was difficult on a cups change

22:55.240 --> 23:03.720
to get all these projects go with this change and update their dialogues and so I came to the idea

23:03.720 --> 23:13.880
one can put an in-between layer there that the that cups and any net and any cloud printing technology

23:13.880 --> 23:22.440
in 2017 when I started that there was Google Cloud Print is implemented in a back end and the dialogue

23:22.760 --> 23:30.200
communicates with this back end and the back end with the print technology and so we can maintain the

23:30.200 --> 23:36.440
back end at open printing the one for cups and so the dialogues always work correctly with cups

23:37.080 --> 23:42.040
so common print dialogue backends and I have snapped cups

23:42.760 --> 23:54.680
as I told earlier and now all the free all the free software printer drivers had to do a transition

23:54.680 --> 24:01.160
again because the cups three I will tell it later will not support ppd files and classic

24:01.160 --> 24:07.400
printer drivers anymore and so I had to put all the printer drivers into printer applications which

24:07.560 --> 24:15.480
emulations of driverless IPP pointers as the cups we will only support driverless IPP pointers and so

24:16.520 --> 24:24.040
this way we had another transition and this I also have already done

24:24.040 --> 24:36.680
what is this

24:36.680 --> 24:55.840
So, and you see what we are actually doing.

24:55.840 --> 25:02.080
We do Cups, we do Cups filters, common print dialogue, backends, and Papa Retrofit is a

25:02.080 --> 25:10.880
library to put old printer drivers, classic Cups drivers into printer applications.

25:10.880 --> 25:17.840
And then we have also printer compatibility databases.

25:17.840 --> 25:23.880
We still have the Fumatic, linuxprinting.org database from the good old times.

25:23.880 --> 25:31.320
But it is less important because the printers which one can buy currently are all driverless.

25:31.320 --> 25:36.280
And therefore, Mike Sweet has created a list of all driverless printers,

25:36.280 --> 25:41.560
which is very well maintaining, which we have on open printing.

25:41.560 --> 25:51.920
And so, and we are collaborating, as I told with the printer working group,

25:51.920 --> 25:55.160
and with printer manufacturers.

25:55.160 --> 26:02.520
But the dialogue with printer manufacturers about printer drivers came more or less to an end

26:02.520 --> 26:06.000
because we have driverless IPP printing.

26:06.000 --> 26:14.960
And we are taking care about the whole printing stack, the whole printing architecture.

26:14.960 --> 26:21.400
And integration in desktops, I talk with desktop people.

26:21.400 --> 26:31.400
I'm running Google Summer of Code projects in updating printer setup tools and print dialogues.

26:31.400 --> 26:44.040
And also the integration in distributions, I also have to take account of immutable distributions.

26:44.040 --> 26:47.200
One is Ubuntu Core Desktop, I have the Cups snap for it.

26:47.200 --> 26:54.040
But I also plan to make Docker packages of Cups and of the print applications.

26:54.040 --> 26:59.360
Because there are so many other immutable distributions which do not use snap.

26:59.360 --> 27:09.280
And in these immutable distributions, the only way to get system software in is to use Docker images or

27:09.280 --> 27:13.480
OCI containers or Podman and so on.

27:13.480 --> 27:20.120
Because the desktop applications are in those ones usually added by Flatpak and

27:20.120 --> 27:26.680
Flatpak does not support system utilities.

27:31.480 --> 27:40.440
And now one important thing, where we are very intensely working currently,

27:40.440 --> 27:43.160
is the so-called new architecture.

27:43.160 --> 27:51.520
And the new architecture means that we do not support PPD files and

27:51.520 --> 27:56.080
classic drivers anymore going all IPP.

27:56.080 --> 28:03.800
And all IPP means that we support only driverless IPP printers.

28:10.440 --> 28:16.760
We support only driverless IPP printers.

28:16.760 --> 28:23.760
And this means that the old legacy printers which need a driver, they would not work anymore.

28:23.760 --> 28:28.160
And therefore, we have introduced the printer applications,

28:28.160 --> 28:32.720
emulations, software emulations of driverless IPP printers.

28:32.720 --> 28:38.160
So it's a damon which is a very important part of the process.

28:38.160 --> 28:45.040
So it's a damon which on one end is like a driverless IPP printer.

28:45.040 --> 28:50.600
And on the other end, it communicates with the printer.

28:52.280 --> 28:57.720
And internally, it does the conversions to the printer's native language.

28:57.720 --> 29:01.120
So the driver is more or less encapsulated.

29:02.120 --> 29:08.120
And this way, the old printers can live on and

29:08.120 --> 29:12.800
we do not lose the support for them and

29:12.800 --> 29:15.800
require the users to throw them away.

29:26.120 --> 29:28.240
So here's the scheme.

29:28.440 --> 29:35.240
The old Cups 2.0 which you are currently using.

29:35.240 --> 29:41.400
And you see the old cups, the user application sends a job.

29:41.400 --> 29:45.800
And in the old cups, there are different possibilities.

29:45.800 --> 29:51.760
IPP everywhere is a driverless IPP printer and cups can directly talk with it.

29:52.680 --> 30:01.320
So the current cups 2.x already can behave like the new architecture.

30:01.320 --> 30:04.160
It supports the driverless printers directly.

30:05.160 --> 30:10.440
And the cups 2.x supports PPD files and

30:10.440 --> 30:14.640
classic drivers as any older cups too.

30:14.640 --> 30:20.640
And through this, it supports the older printer, PostScript or Asta printer.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.440
Any printer which needs a driver.

30:25.000 --> 30:29.720
But the printer applications, as they are just emulating

30:32.400 --> 30:39.120
an IPP printer, driverless IPP printer, they also work with the old cups.

30:39.120 --> 30:44.200
Because the old cups supports driverless IPP printers.

30:44.200 --> 30:47.880
So you could already switch over to a printer application.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.640
Yes, things.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.000
Switch over to a printer application.

30:52.000 --> 30:58.120
And so if you are writing a printer driver,

30:58.120 --> 31:05.200
don't write a classic printer driver anymore.

31:05.200 --> 31:07.320
Write a printer application right away.

31:07.320 --> 31:08.680
It works with the old cups.

31:08.680 --> 31:10.720
It works with the new cups.

31:10.720 --> 31:18.840
And with the new cups, you see you can only talk with driverless IPP printers.

31:18.840 --> 31:22.440
And the printer is actually one directly and

31:22.440 --> 31:30.440
otherwise, only via the software emulation printer applications.

31:42.440 --> 31:45.320
And we'd also even do driverless scanning.

31:45.320 --> 31:50.840
Because the scanners in driverless multifunction devices,

31:50.840 --> 31:58.040
they all understand ESCL, so also a standardized communication protocol.

31:58.040 --> 32:04.880
And so we can make also scanner applications which are emulations of ESCL scanners.

32:04.880 --> 32:09.960
And inside one has, for example, the same driver for the old scanner.

32:09.960 --> 32:16.960
And cups, we will this year, in a few months,

32:16.960 --> 32:23.720
we will release cups 2.5.x.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.960
This is not yet the new architecture.

32:27.400 --> 32:34.080
It's only to get all of and some other features into cups

32:34.080 --> 32:39.680
without doing the big switch over to make it easier for

32:39.680 --> 32:46.760
the enterprise distributions so that they can do this more lightweight switch.

32:46.760 --> 32:53.080
To get the all of in and in the end of the year,

32:53.080 --> 32:56.200
we will release cups 3.x.

32:56.200 --> 33:09.400
And the 2.x will, and here the cups 3.x.

33:09.400 --> 33:13.600
This is really doing away with the PPD files.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.880
But it is also doing another big change.

33:16.880 --> 33:23.880
The cups demon is replaced by two demons by a local cup server,

33:23.880 --> 33:31.480
which is a user demon and by a sharing server, which is a system demon.

33:31.480 --> 33:38.440
So the local cup server is only for getting the print jobs of local applications.

33:38.440 --> 33:42.440
And passing them on to driverless IPP pointers,

33:42.440 --> 33:47.760
either on the network connected to USB or a printer application for

33:47.760 --> 33:53.440
a legacy printer, and not for sharing printers to other users.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.680
It even does not use a network socket.

33:57.680 --> 34:04.440
It only uses a Unix socket file for communication.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.880
And the sharing server.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.000
And the sharing server, you can really share printers and

34:18.000 --> 34:24.600
you can configure the sharing printer on how to share the printers and so on.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.040
It's a system demon.

34:28.680 --> 34:36.680
And but so you install it only optionally when you really want to share printers and

34:36.680 --> 34:42.120
therefore print server, it has also ACL, it has accounting and everything.

34:42.120 --> 34:47.640
And by default for the desktop machine, you only use the local server.

34:47.640 --> 34:50.160
So this is the scheme.

34:50.160 --> 34:54.280
The very light blue is the sharing server.

34:54.280 --> 35:00.160
The medium blue is the local server and the dark blue is all which is in common.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.040
This is in the cups library.

35:03.760 --> 35:08.520
And so we will have three packages, the sharing server, the local server and

35:08.520 --> 35:09.680
the Libcups three.

35:10.880 --> 35:15.080
And here you see the two servers and

35:15.080 --> 35:17.800
the scheme how everything is together.

35:18.800 --> 35:19.300
Thank you.

35:20.600 --> 35:26.920
And now with all this,

35:26.920 --> 35:32.680
we are already working for more or less five years on it.

35:32.680 --> 35:36.760
And planning it and telling everyone how this works.

35:36.760 --> 35:41.480
We go all IPP and we want to have print applications and so on.

35:41.480 --> 35:46.440
It seems that Microsoft has heard it and that they want to go away from

35:46.440 --> 35:52.400
the crap of printing system from Windows 3 from the late 90s.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.240
And so they came with a new printing system.

35:56.400 --> 36:03.200
Microsoft protected print, which is already available in Windows 11 for testing.

36:03.200 --> 36:08.600
And in Windows 12, it will probably be the stand system.

36:08.600 --> 36:14.040
And this one is all IPP.

36:14.040 --> 36:18.120
As it is with cups three, but it is not cups.

36:18.120 --> 36:25.760
It is not that we have system DSP to one of Windows and then we put cups onto it.

36:25.760 --> 36:31.800
The code is for more pre-ar.

36:31.800 --> 36:36.520
And one already told me that it's still a little bit wonky and flaky.

36:38.920 --> 36:42.720
People who have tested it, there's no access to the source code.

36:43.920 --> 36:54.040
And Microsoft tells IPP driverless printers are all supported,

36:54.040 --> 36:58.520
but legacy printers, they are obsolete, you can throw them away.

36:59.760 --> 37:05.920
But I can tell you if someone of you has to use Windows or

37:05.920 --> 37:11.240
someone in your family uses Windows, they do not need to throw away the old printers.

37:11.240 --> 37:17.120
As under Windows we have WSL and under WSL, you can run printer applications.

37:19.320 --> 37:25.960
And so every printer which works under Linux will also in the future work under Windows.

37:25.960 --> 37:31.880
And currently works under Windows too, because we have WSL and printer applications.

37:31.880 --> 37:39.720
And Microsoft wants to do it for security because they want to get rid of the drivers.

37:39.720 --> 37:45.720
Because the drivers have vulnerabilities, it's old, often un-maintained code.

37:45.720 --> 37:50.360
And they want to do away with all these vulnerabilities.

37:50.360 --> 37:57.240
Because these old cups drivers all run in deep system, perhaps even kernel level.

37:57.240 --> 38:01.760
And so crash the whole system when someone hits these bugs.

38:04.640 --> 38:11.680
And another thing is Microsoft is telling about print support apps.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.480
These are not printer applications.

38:14.480 --> 38:17.920
They are not trying to support old printers.

38:17.920 --> 38:26.960
PSAs, they add ons to the driverless IPP printing to do something specific.

38:26.960 --> 38:32.280
So it's some way that they are fleeing a little bit out of the driverless.

38:39.960 --> 38:46.480
So, and if you want to get into, and we need naturally a lot of help.

38:46.480 --> 38:51.160
And therefore, I want to ask,

38:51.160 --> 38:56.560
therefore I am asking for volunteers that you could voluntarily.

38:57.880 --> 39:03.400
As in any other open source project, you should also,

39:03.400 --> 39:07.960
it would be great if you would step up to help us at open printing.

39:09.240 --> 39:14.920
If you can also participate as a Google Summer of Code contributor.

39:14.920 --> 39:18.400
We are also participating this year again.

39:18.400 --> 39:22.280
And we have a list of nice project ideas.

39:22.280 --> 39:27.720
If you download these slides and then click the links, then you can get to all of this.

39:29.600 --> 39:33.920
And we need people for, especially for desktop integration, for

39:33.920 --> 39:38.560
updating printer setup tools, for updating print dialogues.

39:38.560 --> 39:42.320
We need also people for maintaining the website.

39:42.320 --> 39:47.440
We need people for CI testing, for creating CI testing scripts.

39:47.440 --> 39:51.200
For OCI containerization,

39:52.480 --> 39:56.760
Wax, Docker and so on.

39:56.760 --> 40:02.240
And we need, so we are in need of many people,

40:02.240 --> 40:06.960
documentation, we need to make documentation for our libraries.

40:06.960 --> 40:08.720
And this is very, very important.

40:08.720 --> 40:14.120
Here we already need eagerly volunteers for that.

40:14.120 --> 40:19.720
And so I hope on all of you, come up to me or

40:19.720 --> 40:24.120
contact me through these channels and step up and

40:24.120 --> 40:28.560
help us to make printing just work and to make it even work better.

40:30.640 --> 40:37.400
As it seems, as Michael Tunelt told, there's no painless,

40:37.400 --> 40:41.760
there's no painless way to print under windows.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.280
And it seems to go on.

40:44.480 --> 40:48.280
And so we should have a nice printing under Linux and

40:48.280 --> 40:50.720
other operating systems with open printing.

40:51.760 --> 40:55.440
And so are there any questions?

41:06.600 --> 41:08.520
Yeah, hello, thank you for a nice talk.

41:08.520 --> 41:12.080
I have a question a bit more about the printer sharing server and

41:12.080 --> 41:13.880
accounting and things.

41:13.880 --> 41:17.640
Well, we work with schools and all the individuals are actually happy that

41:17.640 --> 41:19.400
the printing just works.

41:19.400 --> 41:23.160
But the principles are not always happy that the pupils are printing pretty

41:23.160 --> 41:25.200
pictures and using a lot of paper.

41:25.200 --> 41:29.080
So this controlling who can and how many have they are printed.

41:29.080 --> 41:33.400
Can you go a little bit to the steps also in a couple two point something about

41:33.400 --> 41:38.480
the printing sharing server and the transition to three point X2 kind of

41:38.680 --> 41:40.120
what's the right way to do it?

41:40.120 --> 41:42.640
And so the sharing

41:45.360 --> 41:50.680
the sharing server will have all the same possibilities which you have also

41:50.680 --> 41:57.480
in cups which you will also which you had also in cups two dot X and

41:57.480 --> 42:03.640
will it will also have the possibility to define profiles where you can where

42:03.760 --> 42:09.360
you can filter printers which the users can see and cannot see.

42:09.360 --> 42:14.720
And you can also tell which which printers to share to where and

42:16.680 --> 42:22.920
I don't know whether you can force option settings which would be a possibility for

42:22.920 --> 42:27.720
example to force the use to force users to print in black and white or

42:27.720 --> 42:32.560
so and not in color and only selected users can print in color.

42:32.680 --> 42:39.520
I don't know whether it's possible but you can in detail tell which users and

42:39.520 --> 42:44.360
which which clients can use and see certain printers.

42:48.640 --> 42:54.440
In cups yes in in cups three it will be in more detail.

42:54.440 --> 43:02.720
I think in cups two you can at least say to share printers to certain

43:02.720 --> 43:10.320
networks or to certain clients but in cups three you can also also tell

43:12.200 --> 43:18.280
in cups two you can also include and exclude users who are allowed to print.

43:18.800 --> 43:25.560
And in cups three you have also profiles which which you can filter which

43:25.560 --> 43:28.000
printers are visible and which are not.

43:30.800 --> 43:34.120
Hi thanks for the talk you mentioned scanning on a couple of slides.

43:34.160 --> 43:39.400
How far away are we from having internet scanning protocol and all modern

43:39.400 --> 43:40.440
scanners supporting it.

43:41.440 --> 43:46.480
We have we have already standardized protocols for scanning.

43:47.480 --> 43:53.440
The common protocol the most common one one is ESCL and if you have an

43:53.440 --> 43:59.840
a driverless IPP multifunction device it can at least it can usually scan with

43:59.840 --> 44:08.720
ESCL some few others with another protocol which is called WSD which is

44:08.960 --> 44:10.240
from Microsoft.

44:10.800 --> 44:16.440
We have a same backends for these two which is same AirScan which is not

44:16.440 --> 44:21.960
in the same core package it's a separate package but it's in all the distros

44:21.960 --> 44:28.280
currently and one of these protocol is supported by any driverless IPP

44:28.280 --> 44:33.040
multifunction device so the scanner and such a multifunction device also works.

44:33.800 --> 44:41.560
And for further more sophisticated support there's also IPP scan but this

44:41.560 --> 44:46.320
is not yet picked up by the print and scanner industry the standard is there

44:46.440 --> 44:54.240
and completed but we will perhaps use it later on at open printing for

44:54.240 --> 45:02.400
network scanning and to have more detailed permission and client server

45:02.400 --> 45:11.280
handling when using IPP scan instead of ESCL but for just scanning we currently

45:11.280 --> 45:12.400
use ESCL.

45:13.560 --> 45:13.960
Thanks.

45:17.240 --> 45:22.520
Good morning to so do you happen to know why Microsoft decided to adopt their

45:22.520 --> 45:26.040
own stuff instead of open printing.

45:28.880 --> 45:29.440
Can you.

45:29.440 --> 45:34.640
They decided to go with the Mopria and why did they do that instead of go to.

45:35.480 --> 45:43.560
Yes, yes, Microsoft is a classic commercial close source company and so

45:43.680 --> 45:49.600
they are starting with open source they have they have they have hired a

45:49.600 --> 45:56.640
Leonard Perturing and and this way they the development of system D happens in

45:56.640 --> 46:03.600
Microsoft but somehow they did never come up to me and say we want to use open

46:03.600 --> 46:12.120
printing so that into there is also consortium Mopria probably also of

46:12.160 --> 46:16.600
printer manufacturers and software companies but all close not that's the

46:16.600 --> 46:23.840
printer working group which is all open and in Mopria they have also defined

46:23.840 --> 46:29.560
the specification for driverless IPP printing which is very similar it's

46:29.560 --> 46:38.480
practically the same specification as of Apple Airpoint or IPP everywhere and

46:38.480 --> 46:43.760
therefore I call out I call it always only driverless IPP printing because

46:43.760 --> 46:53.960
it's technically the same and so Mopria is also a group of consortium and this

46:53.960 --> 47:02.440
group Mopria also writes code right puts puts the standard in code they wrote

47:02.960 --> 47:07.680
for example also an Android app which is called Mopria for printing.

47:08.720 --> 47:16.960
And so for printing on driverless IPP printers and Microsoft seems to have

47:19.080 --> 47:27.680
also worked with Mopria to get their code for for driverless IPP printing and

47:27.680 --> 47:30.280
to get into Windows protected print.

47:30.600 --> 47:36.160
They did not by themselves tell that they work together with Mopria but people

47:36.160 --> 47:39.520
from the printer working group has told this to me.

47:42.520 --> 47:49.120
And unfortunately they do it this way it it had been a dream by me if Microsoft

47:49.120 --> 47:58.440
had had overtaken cups and so we have a really all over standardization and one

47:58.480 --> 48:04.280
organization providing the printing code to everyone.

48:06.200 --> 48:08.800
But unfortunately this did not happen.

48:09.440 --> 48:09.720
Okay.

48:10.080 --> 48:15.720
Thank you to you to Michael and all the printing heroes that help printing not

48:15.720 --> 48:17.240
suck as much in Linux.

48:18.200 --> 48:18.520
What.

48:19.240 --> 48:24.280
Thank you to you to Michael and all the printing open source heroes that help

48:24.360 --> 48:26.600
printing not suck as much in Linux.

48:27.000 --> 48:27.880
You're welcome.

48:33.080 --> 48:34.280
Thank you very much.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.560
Thank you very much.
