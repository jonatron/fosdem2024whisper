WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Okay, welcome.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm Wade Krabinski.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Wade Krabinski, and you can start.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay. Good morning.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Oh, it's already a good afternoon.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
I'm here to introduce all the larger selection

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
of FOSS Free Open Source software for IC design.

00:33.000 --> 00:44.000
And mainly all we believe can support local European open access PDK in the shot.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.000
This is what I'm presenting here.

00:47.000 --> 00:54.000
It's a little bit compatible or related to previous talk where Team Nukap did

00:54.000 --> 01:04.000
introduce all and then Felix introduced one of the circuit device level simulators.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
This is a huge collaborative work.

01:08.000 --> 01:13.000
If you feel I should include your name here, just let me know.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm consultant to IHP.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
This is a research institute in Germany.

01:19.000 --> 01:28.000
And they are very first in Europe to join Open Access of Free PDK Initiative.

01:28.000 --> 01:37.000
RenÃ©, Sergei, Christoph, Alexey, they are from IHP and they are personally involved

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
in the Open Access PDK development providing technical engineering support.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
There are a couple of guys like Mario Pascal Marcos.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
They are working on Verilog compiler.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
There are teams working on the models, supporting Quax development.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
I already mentioned Al and Davies from Nukap.

02:06.000 --> 02:14.000
NGiSpy's team, by the way, they will present NGiSpy's tomorrow at Kaikad Devroom.

02:14.000 --> 02:21.000
We have independent contributors, high level, well recognized professor,

02:21.000 --> 02:35.000
Luca Benini, Boris Murman, also in the US, contributing to Open PDK.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
Mad Vent is very strong promoter of this initiative and last but not least,

02:41.000 --> 02:52.000
Tim Hansen from Google who was very first to push towards Open Access PDK.

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
So I will start with brief motivation.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
Why Open PDK is so critical, not only here in Europe but at international level.

03:08.000 --> 03:16.000
Also in a certain sense as a platform to teach, educate younger generation of designers,

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
both analog, RF, digital.

03:20.000 --> 03:29.000
I have referenced not really Open PDK but quite important in Shatif in India, the FOSI.

03:29.000 --> 03:36.000
A couple of examples of status of Open PDK around the globe.

03:36.000 --> 03:49.000
Then I will introduce all what IHP did to enable, open enable access to IC manufacturing

03:49.000 --> 04:00.000
and setting up complete tool chain of software packages to support design at different level.

04:00.000 --> 04:12.000
So static layout, verification, validation, because the process is more towards analog RF application.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
This is the level which we want to focus.

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
A couple of other points, I hope it could be interactive, really understanding where we are

04:24.000 --> 04:34.000
and what are next steps, what are important task to undertake to not really consolidate

04:34.000 --> 04:45.000
by bring all enthusiasts, volunteers, hobbyists, designers around Open PDK initiative,

04:45.000 --> 04:55.000
making a roadmap and then understanding status, think about all the challenges and opportunities

04:55.000 --> 05:02.000
which this initiative bring to the design, IC design community.

05:02.000 --> 05:08.000
Motivation, I guess you are also following all about European chip-act.

05:08.000 --> 05:16.000
This is discussion of over the last two, three years it's coming into power, into the execution.

05:16.000 --> 05:34.000
But following even public hearings here in Brussels at European Parliament, such case as an attempt to draw more attention,

05:35.000 --> 05:43.000
bring younger generation of designers to our domain, wasn't address.

05:43.000 --> 05:53.000
And at one of the public hearings of chip-axe here at EU Parliament, here in Brussels,

05:53.000 --> 06:02.000
only Jodebock, the VP of IMAIC address this point, that we can have new fobs, new production line,

06:02.000 --> 06:11.000
but we need new designers to bring new chips, new product to these fobs.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
Fabs are not running by themselves, they need the design.

06:15.000 --> 06:28.000
Exactly a year ago, less than a month, a year ago he repeat this questions again pointing to the main topic,

06:28.000 --> 06:37.000
how to build talent and skills to support IC design, not only in Europe,

06:37.000 --> 06:48.000
IC international conference run in US, how to bring this talent and skills, how to enable access.

06:48.000 --> 07:02.000
And we believe that OpenPDK could be also teaching education platform to draw more attention and bring talents to our IC design domain.

07:02.000 --> 07:09.000
I'm showing this slide, it's not really OpenPDK, but it's...

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
This is initiative, there was a group of volunteers in Mumbai at Technical University of Mumbai,

07:18.000 --> 07:34.000
and they set up really nice teaching educational environment, mainly using NG-SPICE and CHICA to introduce even teenagers to micro electronics,

07:34.000 --> 07:43.000
starting with very simple examples like Flip-flop, small generator blinking LEDs,

07:43.000 --> 07:53.000
and they were guiding them through this very simple design process with simulations,

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
helping design even PCBs assembled boards.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
This runs for a couple of years, each year they have more and more contributors,

08:05.000 --> 08:13.000
they were talking about something like couple of thousands volunteers supported this initiative.

08:13.000 --> 08:22.000
It's not about design itself, but they create huge packages, libraries of tutorials,

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
they call them spoken tutorials, mainly in English as you can guess in India,

08:28.000 --> 08:38.000
but they start to translate into other languages, they were talking about French, Spanish,

08:38.000 --> 08:51.000
opening this facility for teaching in education also in local native languages.

08:52.000 --> 09:00.000
It's teaching education platform, but they recognize importance of free open source tools,

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
and we have these two cases of NG-SPICE and CHICA.

09:09.000 --> 09:19.000
OpenPDK was triggered by Tim Ansel in the US, it's running for a couple of years,

09:19.000 --> 09:30.000
they partner with Skywater, they open the FAP, they release PDKs as open source,

09:30.000 --> 09:38.000
FAPLES was quite instrumental, helping creating all the infrastructure,

09:38.000 --> 09:52.000
they built certain tool sets to help teenagers, students, young researchers,

09:52.000 --> 10:02.000
I see designers to complete design down to tape out and manufacturing.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
There is a list of links about available resources.

10:07.000 --> 10:14.000
Skywater as I mentioned was very first, Global Foundry joined a little bit later,

10:14.000 --> 10:22.000
open two more processes, all a little bit kind of legacy, 180, 30,

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
I think Global Foundry going to 110 if I'm not mistaken.

10:27.000 --> 10:41.000
So it's really a unique place where you can design, chip both analog RF, digital,

10:41.000 --> 10:52.000
submit, tape out, manufacture, get even test board and complete all the design flow.

10:57.000 --> 11:06.000
In Europe, as I mentioned, IHP, it's a research R&D institute in Frankfurt on other,

11:06.000 --> 11:20.000
they recognize the importance of open PDK, and they, it's like middle of last year,

11:20.000 --> 11:33.000
the organ released, they PDK for 130 bicemos process, and it's high end process,

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
the bipolar part here, BJTs are working at level of half a terahertz on silicon,

11:41.000 --> 11:48.000
so 500 gigahertz on silicon, it's unique process, they open infrastructure,

11:48.000 --> 11:55.000
they support multi-project quaffers on different level, academic development,

11:55.000 --> 12:06.000
early access for commercial partners, start-up, SMC, SMEs, up to the multi-project,

12:06.000 --> 12:12.000
complete chip integration.

12:12.000 --> 12:25.000
Opening PDK is one task, what is also critical to understand what is really available in open source domain to support design,

12:25.000 --> 12:36.000
and positive sense kind of consolidate all in this domain in particle from the developer point of view,

12:36.000 --> 12:47.000
bringing all the tools working together, having equivalent to commercial tools like cadence or synopsis.

12:47.000 --> 12:57.000
The workshop they organized last June was two days, even which brought tools developer, designers,

12:57.000 --> 13:05.000
and all who are supporting this initiative, maybe from the back it's difficult to read the links,

13:05.000 --> 13:19.000
my presentation is uploaded, you can get all updates or references on PDF which I uploaded.

13:20.000 --> 13:29.000
So this is what I already mentioned, they are very first in Europe that there is no other Wafers Fab

13:29.000 --> 13:44.000
R&D institution opening the PDK and helping to access multi-wafers projects to complete design and manufacturing,

13:45.000 --> 13:56.000
because it's by CMOS process they are trying to target analog RF applications,

13:56.000 --> 14:09.000
and of course opening this environment, a lot of questions how to make all the flow reliable, support.

14:09.000 --> 14:24.000
In Germany they are quite lucky, German Ministry of Education recognize importance of this initiative and provide financial support,

14:24.000 --> 14:35.000
so this from the basic entry up to multi-project wafers and fund services.

14:36.000 --> 14:47.000
Bottom line is always money, so this is initial step, we have ongoing this discussion here in Brazil with European Union

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
to motivate them to support this initiative at European level as well.

14:55.000 --> 15:10.000
This is the status, we have Sergei Heinebeck, he is PDK manager supporting this initiative at IHP,

15:11.000 --> 15:27.000
all it's online on the IHP GitHub repository with project information, information about technology itself, devices,

15:28.000 --> 15:42.000
cells, all the layout information, what is also unique, they are not opening PDK and SPICE library,

15:42.000 --> 15:51.000
but you can also access all measurements data for semiconductor devices and passive components.

15:51.000 --> 16:00.000
This is also important for others who are working on parameter extraction, model validation,

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
they have physical data to run all the checks.

16:07.000 --> 16:18.000
There was a decision to use K-Layout as main tool for GDS generations.

16:19.000 --> 16:28.000
We are extending this and the team which Sergei leads works on all the enhancement,

16:28.000 --> 16:40.000
so you have to really follow up the GitHub repository to get all updates and new information.

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
There is still open discussion which tools we should put in the complete flow.

16:48.000 --> 16:59.000
I mentioned K-Layout for GDS tool, X-Hemp for symbolic entry, schematic entry.

17:00.000 --> 17:09.000
As the BISEMOS process targets RF application, modeling capacitive components, transmission lines,

17:09.000 --> 17:19.000
parallel inductors, integrated antenna, we can benefit using other open source tools like open EMS

17:19.000 --> 17:28.000
for electromagnetic simulation and device validation for RF applications.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
Digital flow, here it's a little bit abstract view, I'm not a digital designer,

17:35.000 --> 17:44.000
but all what is available here is well established for digital design, like complete open line,

17:44.000 --> 17:55.000
open road flow where designers they can start with high level abstract definition, RTL,

17:55.000 --> 18:09.000
behavioral, VHDL, Veriloc, go through this path, generate layout and submit new chip for production.

18:09.000 --> 18:19.000
Later on I have a couple of digital examples which are already manufactured, tested and we have working silicon.

18:19.000 --> 18:28.000
Again, all is uploaded so you want to capture slight but everything is online.

18:29.000 --> 18:44.000
This is commonly used flow, open line or open road, but in France we have alternative tool chain choreolies

18:45.000 --> 18:53.000
maintaining in France at Sorbonne University, Lipstick's department.

18:53.000 --> 19:04.000
Unfortunately they were late to provide a slight covering day tools and tool chain they developed for digital design.

19:04.000 --> 19:15.000
Again, references are in the slides so you can upload or check the slides and I guess it could be difficult to read from the back.

19:17.000 --> 19:29.000
This is what we want to have also for IHP process, open PDK, complete analog IC design flow.

19:29.000 --> 19:47.000
This is example from Stanford University where Professor Rihanna she set up all the tool chain for analog design and targeting sky water or global foundry PDK.

19:47.000 --> 20:16.000
So they have schematic entry, circuit level simulator, layout tool and all the post processing verification, validation tools, DRC, LVS and again layout editor for final check before submitting tool chip for manufacturing.

20:18.000 --> 20:32.000
Is silicon? They were supporting this and they provide standard pad frames where you can put your analog digital design.

20:32.000 --> 20:37.000
Caravan in fact is the pad frame for digital circuits.

20:37.000 --> 20:43.000
This is caravan for digital design.

20:43.000 --> 20:54.000
They have also caravan pad frame for analog design where this part is set of instrumentation like signal generator, scope,

20:54.000 --> 21:11.000
to measure your circuit without needs for external hardware to make final test after fabrication.

21:12.000 --> 21:20.000
In Europe there is a group at University of Linz, Professor Prettell and his team.

21:20.000 --> 21:34.000
They are providing seminal installer mainly as dockers where you can access these tools and set up your analog design flow.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
Again, Linz at the very bottom.

21:41.000 --> 21:54.000
This is a vision of IHP where they want to have complete analog RF open source design flow.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
This is what Sergei prepared.

21:57.000 --> 22:12.000
We are targeting Quax, it's open source simulator where it has reasonable and well established schematic entry editor.

22:12.000 --> 22:20.000
This is a new Quax S and S stands for spies.

22:20.000 --> 22:27.000
Quax can drive spies compatible tools, NG spies or ZYS.

22:27.000 --> 22:35.000
Then, yes, so Quax is the front end, schematic entry in the background.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
We have NG spies.

22:37.000 --> 22:56.000
Then for layout, we are working directly, IHP works directly with K layout developers to make sure that all verification tools and options are available in K layout.

22:57.000 --> 23:04.000
Including DRC, LBS, other verification tools.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
I've mentioned about Open EMS, Electromagnetic Simulator.

23:09.000 --> 23:22.000
This is a quite important extension to K layout where if you are RF designer, probably you have some RF components,

23:22.000 --> 23:34.000
transmission lines, interconnect, spiral inductors, embedded antenna, and not all models are available in PDK.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
So EMS helps to simulate these models.

23:40.000 --> 23:52.000
As a result, you are getting set of S parameters which you can plug into your simulator and continue RF high-frequency design.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
Parasitic extraction, it's critical.

23:56.000 --> 24:16.000
You have to really understand how your design will operate at not only in gender speaking, how analog design will operate when it's prepared for manufacturing,

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
including all parasitic effects.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
Of course, it's critical for RF too, but this is still on the discussion.

24:26.000 --> 24:42.000
And then you do post-layout simulation, prepare the flies, and submit for tape out using IHP multi-project wafers.

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
There is a lot of discussion if this flow could be part of Euro practice.

24:49.000 --> 24:55.000
Euro practice is the shell organization which provides tools and access to different technology,

24:55.000 --> 25:05.000
so that the alternative path would be complete open source design tools till GDS tape out,

25:05.000 --> 25:11.000
and they would help assembling multi-project wafers submitting to funders.

25:12.000 --> 25:23.000
Just to introduce even teenagers or students at bachelor level to IC design layouts,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
there is a couple of really nice tools.

25:26.000 --> 25:39.000
This is Maud Van Silvitz where you can place their predefined layout of simple components starting with resistor or transistor.

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
There is CMOS inverter.

25:42.000 --> 25:54.000
You are looking at layout not only to the representation, but this black line guide you for the cross section.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
So you can see the topology of your circuits.

25:58.000 --> 26:10.000
And from the layout, they can also generate very basic SPICE input file.

26:10.000 --> 26:20.000
And in this case, we have also the SPICE input for inverter.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
There is a bug.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
If you spot the bug, let me know.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
So this small challenge maybe for students.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
Okay, we go further.

26:32.000 --> 26:40.000
These two tools are part of design flows which are well established in the U.S.

26:40.000 --> 26:49.000
I already gave you an example of Stanford using X-HEM for schematic entry,

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
and X-HEM was already set up for SkyWater Global Foundry,

26:54.000 --> 27:02.000
and they did some work also for IHP by CMOS PDK as well.

27:04.000 --> 27:10.000
For layout and all the tools,

27:10.000 --> 27:19.000
verification tools, layout versus schematic,

27:19.000 --> 27:26.000
DRC post-layout extraction, magic, it's still a core tool.

27:26.000 --> 27:36.000
It's legacy tool, but it's maintained and well accepted by open source design community.

27:37.000 --> 27:50.000
In IHP, they decide to go for K-layout as main layout tools.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
And I mentioned about work in progress,

27:53.000 --> 28:04.000
expanding and enhancing this tool to make this fully compatible with the design flow.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
For schematic entry, we are still working with Quax Team,

28:09.000 --> 28:20.000
which has a really nice schematic editor and well established interface for spies or ng-spies,

28:20.000 --> 28:24.000
or generic speaking, spies-free simulation level,

28:24.000 --> 28:32.000
and this library available, spies library available in IHP PDK.

28:33.000 --> 28:41.000
There are some other teams in open source domain like this revolution EDA,

28:41.000 --> 28:46.000
and they are also working on schematic editors.

28:46.000 --> 28:53.000
They want to also add layout editor and set of the verification validation tools.

28:53.000 --> 28:58.000
And again, if you want to learn more about other tools,

28:58.000 --> 29:06.000
there are even videos introducing the tools which are available for design.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.000
Yes, maybe a few words about EMS.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.000
It's 3D electromagnetic simulator,

29:16.000 --> 29:24.000
and they start with targeting mainly high-frequency antenna design,

29:24.000 --> 29:36.000
and this tool can be also used for modeling simulations of IC components,

29:36.000 --> 29:42.000
mainly passive transmission lines of spiral inductors.

29:42.000 --> 29:51.000
And this tool, the IHP team who works with K-Lout and Open EMS

29:51.000 --> 29:59.000
to integrate and make this smooth flow from the layout to the generation of 3D models

29:59.000 --> 30:07.000
for numerical simulation to support RF device modeling.

30:07.000 --> 30:15.000
As I mentioned, the eventual output of the models are as parameters,

30:15.000 --> 30:23.000
which you can simply fetch and add to your transistor level simulation

30:23.000 --> 30:29.000
to validate your analog RF circuits.

30:29.000 --> 30:40.000
Yes, this is a snapshot of all different antennas which EMS can model and simulate

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
and generate a resulting as parameters.

30:45.000 --> 30:54.000
Unfortunately, I was not able to bring a case of integrated elements from ICs,

30:54.000 --> 30:58.000
transmission lines of spiral inductors, integrated antenna,

30:58.000 --> 31:08.000
but this work is in progress, and again, the main Open EMS website is referenced below.

31:09.000 --> 31:23.000
The talk before was also discussing all important enhancement to standard SPICE-free simulator.

31:23.000 --> 31:32.000
GNU-CAP is an interesting alternative, and they are working on their model compiler.

31:32.000 --> 31:41.000
As we are targeting NG SPICE as main transistor level simulation tool,

31:41.000 --> 31:53.000
we have OpenVaf, which is a new, true, very low-A compiler,

31:53.000 --> 32:01.000
not as it was before, where we had other tools which were generating model code,

32:01.000 --> 32:06.000
C++ code, which had to be compiled and linked with the model.

32:06.000 --> 32:14.000
Very low-A generator, the dynamic library, there is an extension to NG SPICE,

32:14.000 --> 32:28.000
which accepts new models as dynamic libraries and allows you to simulate with non-standard models

32:28.000 --> 32:35.000
which are not available in standard SPICE-free or NG SPICE.

32:35.000 --> 32:45.000
This compiler takes care about all important elements of the model,

32:45.000 --> 32:54.000
so it includes the currents, charges, the capacitances, and newest extension,

32:54.000 --> 33:05.000
and enhancement is also supporting noise analysis for semiconductor device models.

33:05.000 --> 33:15.000
This is fully integrated with the complete PDK flow, which we have...

33:16.000 --> 33:26.000
We have references, and there is a pointer to today's presentation by Arlen, Felix,

33:26.000 --> 33:36.000
and this eventually could merge with even better solution to bring new SPICE models

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
to GNU-CAP or NG SPICE in the future.

33:41.000 --> 33:51.000
This is the case where we are illustrating implementation of new model into Quax.

33:51.000 --> 34:02.000
The left-hand side is a snapshot of Quax schematic entry,

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
where you define your small sub-circuit.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
It's a dummy example, just a single transistor.

34:10.000 --> 34:19.000
Above you see all the tiny fields where you reference to PDK libraries,

34:19.000 --> 34:23.000
because the model for transistor is not standard.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
You have to also give a pointer to dynamic library,

34:27.000 --> 34:30.000
which refers to MOSFET model.

34:30.000 --> 34:38.000
In this case, it's PSP model, advanced MOSFET model for transistor level simulation.

34:38.000 --> 34:44.000
With one click, you are getting results.

34:44.000 --> 34:50.000
Single transistor, simple output characteristic of MOSFET device,

34:50.000 --> 34:59.000
which is defined in the open PDK in the SPICE library of IHP Open PDK.

35:02.000 --> 35:14.000
There is a lot of resources, main pointer for Quax as is here at the bottom of the page,

35:14.000 --> 35:19.000
as references for all slides I'm presenting.

35:21.000 --> 35:27.000
Tomorrow, there is quite interesting dev room.

35:27.000 --> 35:33.000
They will discuss KiCut PCB design tools,

35:33.000 --> 35:39.000
and part of the KiCut is also nice schematic entry.

35:39.000 --> 35:52.000
Behind schematic, there is fully integrated NG SPICE to support circuit verification

35:52.000 --> 35:57.000
before completing PCB design.

35:57.000 --> 36:04.000
You can find pointer information about KiCut,

36:04.000 --> 36:09.000
DeFrom, and Holger presentation, who will talk about NG SPICE

36:09.000 --> 36:16.000
and complete integration in the KiCut design flow.

36:21.000 --> 36:27.000
Almost immediately after opening IHP PDK, it's drawn a lot of attention,

36:27.000 --> 36:32.000
and this is something I would not expect, but Professor Mourmann,

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
he is now at the University of Hawaii,

36:37.000 --> 36:45.000
and here at close look at IHP PDK and prepare a series of classes

36:45.000 --> 36:51.000
to teach his student, giving a real example.

36:51.000 --> 36:56.000
Again, he set up in this case, it's one of the classes,

36:56.000 --> 37:04.000
simple case of modeling or simulating MOSFET device,

37:04.000 --> 37:14.000
with simple schematic example, and all the settings of control cards

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
to run SPICE simulation.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.000
And this is a part of the teaching classes.

37:20.000 --> 37:31.000
So this is also what we would like to see, the open PDKs as the teaching education platform.

37:31.000 --> 37:39.000
Not only somewhere in the middle of nowhere in Hawaii, but in particular here in Europe.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.000
Now, a couple of examples.

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
So all what we are presenting, it's last half a year,

37:47.000 --> 37:55.000
but it immediately draws a lot of attention with some pre-announcements.

37:55.000 --> 38:05.000
And here it's one of the real silicon which was submitted for tape out.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
Team at ETH in Zurich, Technical University in Zurich,

38:10.000 --> 38:16.000
they design a digital chip.

38:16.000 --> 38:24.000
It's the RISC 64-bit RISC processor implementation.

38:24.000 --> 38:31.000
And to complete design, they were using OpenRoute.

38:31.000 --> 38:42.000
The very first implementation was already presented at Free Silicon Conference last summer.

38:42.000 --> 38:55.000
If you would have a chance, I would strongly recommend to also join and eventually contribute to upcoming Free Silicon Conference,

38:55.000 --> 39:02.000
which will be organized later this year at Sorbonne University in Paris.

39:02.000 --> 39:06.000
We have Thomas, he's very active at Free Silicon.

39:06.000 --> 39:12.000
He can give you updates about organization status of the conference.

39:12.000 --> 39:26.000
So this, I'm not the digital design, but you can learn a little bit more about status of this tape out on the website.

39:26.000 --> 39:31.000
And the silicon should be coming very, very soon.

39:31.000 --> 39:36.000
So you can capture and deliver a similar presentation in China.

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
All of Rome are with mobile phones making screenshots.

39:42.000 --> 39:57.000
Okay, this is internal IHP design, which was also completed using Open Source PDK

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
and the tools which we are trying to integrate.

40:01.000 --> 40:07.000
And it's not only the layout or tape out.

40:07.000 --> 40:16.000
There is a small photo of real Sekit, which is working, was measured and qualified.

40:16.000 --> 40:26.000
Okay, the links, you probably have to click to get all updates on this project.

40:27.000 --> 40:39.000
This is not directly implementation, Sekit implementation of design using IHP.

40:39.000 --> 40:49.000
Professor Prettl and his team at the University of Linz in Austria, they make a couple of digital designs.

40:49.000 --> 40:56.000
And they start working all these exercises with sky water.

40:56.000 --> 41:10.000
But now they are in progress of like transferring the design and preparing new tape out using IHP by CMOS process.

41:10.000 --> 41:18.000
And they should be ready soon with a tape out.

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
And all these exercises help us to improve the flow.

41:24.000 --> 41:35.000
In particle analog part, we still need a lot of integration between different tools in this flow.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.000
There is other paper by Professor Prettl and his team.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
So it's open access paper.

41:44.000 --> 41:59.000
So you can learn more about all the digital flow they are using to create or prepare the chip for tape out.

41:59.000 --> 42:04.000
So again, X-hem for schematic, magic for layout.

42:04.000 --> 42:11.000
There was some presentation today, earlier today about Yossi system.

42:11.000 --> 42:26.000
All what we can have in open line, open route going down to all the files you need to complete layout and prepare tape out.

42:26.000 --> 42:42.000
So there is a lot of documentation in a certain sense guiding you for the process, design process and helping you also setting up the tools on your side.

42:42.000 --> 42:50.000
So now we are coming to the point that we have really a lot of available.

42:50.000 --> 43:12.000
Again, FOSSI, ECME initiative, it's not open PDK, but they created platform to teach and to educate teenagers, beginners, students and maybe young injures to expose them to integrated circuit design.

43:12.000 --> 43:19.000
Maybe on PCB level, but this is important point.

43:19.000 --> 43:41.000
Other groups and organization like IEEE in Particle Solid State Circuit Society, they financially support small group students enabling access to IEEE.

43:41.000 --> 43:51.000
Please, US organization enabling access initially to sky water and global fund that it PDKs.

43:51.000 --> 44:02.000
And they are running hackathons and competitions for I think for second class tape out.

44:02.000 --> 44:08.000
I was surprised that most of the design were coming from Pakistan.

44:08.000 --> 44:13.000
So this draws attention truly internationally.

44:13.000 --> 44:23.000
Of course, it's a little bit easier in US because they have huge sponsors as Google.

44:24.000 --> 44:50.000
If FABLIS, they help them to manage designs creating all this reference, pad frames or analog design, pad frames or analog and digital circuits, which then manufacture always sky water or global fund.

44:51.000 --> 44:57.000
There is initial work done also in Japan.

44:57.000 --> 45:13.000
They call this minimal FABL and they are opening quite legacy process, but they are recognizing the critical importance of this again for teaching education.

45:14.000 --> 45:29.000
And Europe, we are always behind and we have only one R&D wafer FAB, which opened the process as open PDK for circuit design.

45:29.000 --> 45:33.000
Risk five, this group is huge.

45:33.000 --> 45:38.000
I think this could be a reference for our activities.

45:38.000 --> 45:55.000
They did excellent job bringing CPU to public to open source and there are plenty of tools supporting this digital design.

45:56.000 --> 46:14.000
In case of our IHP open PDK, the target is analog RF, but of course we can also have digital chip and there were a couple of examples already.

46:14.000 --> 46:22.000
So what we want to have cooperation, I mean this is the key point.

46:22.000 --> 46:38.000
We want to help others to access PDK and removing this kind of legal barrier because it's open PDK.

46:39.000 --> 46:52.000
You do not need to go through legal procedure, sign NDAs or have quite restrictive in many cases ED licenses.

46:54.000 --> 47:03.000
We need more contribution to showcase the advantages of open PDK.

47:04.000 --> 47:18.000
Within the last half a year there is a huge response and we have a couple of final complete integration, but it's coming from academia.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
I hope this is our plan.

47:22.000 --> 47:47.000
We want to show that this initiative has a huge commercial impact, mainly targeting smaller team, spin-off, start-up or SMEs.

47:48.000 --> 48:05.000
All above, open PDK, NDAs, low level of free EDA tools can help them complete design and bring a piece of silicon to the market.

48:09.000 --> 48:12.000
I think I touched the wrong connector.

48:13.000 --> 48:19.000
So this is the list of challenges.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
Yes?

48:20.000 --> 48:21.000
The recording is stopped.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Ah, I'm run.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Okay, okay.

48:25.000 --> 48:34.000
So let, I let you read and we create the base.

48:34.000 --> 48:56.000
It's initial step and there are a lot of tasks to complete to make this smooth flow from schematic entry, layouts, verification tools up to tape out and final product.

48:57.000 --> 49:05.000
We probably should take this offline and continue discussion.

49:05.000 --> 49:14.000
If there is any input critical, constructive, I would be more than happy to collect all the information.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
Closing.

49:15.000 --> 49:23.000
Yes, without IHP, all what I'm presenting would be impossible.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
Seger represent IHP.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.000
If you have any technical question, I would recommend to talk to Sergey.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
This was also recognized in Germany.

49:36.000 --> 49:43.000
So there is financial support because the bottom line is money.

49:43.000 --> 50:00.000
Software developer designers, they need a couple of euros to continue their activities and we appreciate all the financial support at the moment from the German.

50:00.000 --> 50:12.000
They have this research my electronics in Germany and federal means of higher education and research.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
They put a lot of money.

50:14.000 --> 50:29.000
Now it's question will we manage to bring this to a European level and thinking about something European level research project to continue this.

50:30.000 --> 50:38.000
Activities and financial support all in open source domain to develop design.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
Of course, in certain sense, manufacturing.

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
So with this, I will close my presentation.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
There are a couple of other events where we will be discussing presenting this.

50:51.000 --> 50:54.000
You can read and again.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
We have Thomas.

50:55.000 --> 50:59.000
He's coordinating free Silicon Conference.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
You can talk to Thomas.

51:02.000 --> 51:17.000
This will be a central event where we'll discuss open PDK, complete design flow, analog, RF digital, accessing open PDK.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
Open by IHP.

51:19.000 --> 51:30.000
Hope that other European funders will join this and in shot event we will have broader selection.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
Okay, by this, I will close.

51:32.000 --> 51:43.000
I guess I over it.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.000
If you have any question, I'm staying.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
There is Thomas and Sergey.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
We are ready to open your answer.

51:52.000 --> 51:53.000
Any question?
