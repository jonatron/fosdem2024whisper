00:00.000 --> 00:02.060
you

00:30.000 --> 00:32.060
you

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
you

01:10.000 --> 01:18.000
Hi, for those of you who are here at the last talk, you will not believe it, but exactly the same thing happened to this talk.

01:18.000 --> 01:27.000
My friend in China, he couldn't come here, so he asked me and also Dr. Zhao to co-present his interesting software.

01:27.000 --> 01:37.000
So let's start. So it is a video editing software and you know traditionally video editing is quite time consuming with all the drag and dropping going on.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
And my friend thought it would actually be more efficient if we have something that's kind of text based in the terminal.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
So let me kind of just do some quick demo. It's going to be very preliminary.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
This solution has a lot of features, but I'm just going to walk through the most basic ones.

01:54.000 --> 02:01.000
So let's say we have some videos, ignore all the temporary roughcast something files.

02:01.000 --> 02:11.000
So let's say we have take this one, open Wi-Fi 2022, which is actually Dr. Zhao's talk the year before, first time.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
And so let's assume that you have obtained some subtitles in a SRT file.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
Maybe you did this yourself. Maybe you use some like AI generators like those of those these days.

02:22.000 --> 02:31.000
And what you do is the first step would be to convert that to a TSV file, TSV being just tap separated values like CSV, but just the tabs.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
Although it's not like any TSV, it's a kind of a specific format.

02:36.000 --> 02:41.000
So for instance, and now I've skipped all the installation steps.

02:41.000 --> 02:50.000
But if you have my friend counts Vim plugin installed and you open this with Vim, you'll be greeted with this.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
And it looks like a normal editor, but there are actually like a lot of key bindings that you can do.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
So for instance, it's integrated with the MPV, which is just a media player that has like CLI options.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
And if you press like tap, it will just play this line.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
There's no like hopefully my laptop is loud enough.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
Yeah, the subtitles are not very precise.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Okay, so that's kind of just that, but that's not really editing video yet.

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
But let's do some very simple editing.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
Let's say we want to just cut these two lines out from this video.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
You just select them and just press space.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
And you have a video that has these two lines.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
And you can do more fancy stuff with it.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.000
Of course, for instance, let's say you want to just, let's say we want to pick part of this line.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Let's say we just want, we don't want good afternoon.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
We don't care about people who, for whom the time current time is afternoon.

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
So just if you just press pipe, it splits this line into two and we can skip this line.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
If you just press backspace, it skips this line.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
You will notice that what it did is actually change the first column.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.000
And then if you explore this again.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Good morning, good evening.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Right, we skipped out the part of good afternoon.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
We don't care about afternoon people anymore.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
Okay, so that's the basic stuff and I only have two minutes left.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.000
One thing, one final thing I will show is just, so we saw all those MPV windows.

04:34.000 --> 04:40.000
You can see this, the popping up and popping out, but maybe if you want to just have it open all the time,

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
you press backspace, backslash twice, it pops up and you can do things like seek to this place,

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
seek to that place or like you can seek an MPV and bring the time sign from MPV to the TSV.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
We can do fancy stuff like that.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
And also, if in any case this is not professional enough for you,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
which will be very surprising to my friend, you can explore this to Final Cut.

05:03.000 --> 05:10.000
And if you just press X instead of space, it will export to FCP XML file,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
which you can then open in Final Cut Pro.

05:13.000 --> 05:19.000
I would make my friend really sad if you have to do that.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
Okay, so that's like a very quick tour of what you can do with this wonderful VIM plugin.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000
But one thing that's what came in mind, like this talk is called with or without VIM plugin,

05:30.000 --> 05:37.000
is really just like a way of using the text or the text TSV files to video editing.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
So my friend uses VIM, so he developed a VIM plugin, but it's very easy.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
If you don't want to use VIM, you can just use CLI yourself.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
It's built using a bunch of CLI utilities.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
We can develop a plugin for a different editor, so that will make my friend count really happy.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
And there are more fancy features that I don't quite understand.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
So I would just play a quick demo video that he prepared.

06:02.000 --> 06:28.000
Hello, I'm Grover. It's called Elvish.

06:28.000 --> 06:44.000
Okay, that's all for today. I'm joking. Let's get started.

06:44.000 --> 07:02.000
Go manage it up.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
Okay, there's more information. It's all linked from the FOSTA schedule page.

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
And do we have time for Q&A?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Two minutes.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
Okay.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
I'm going to take questions.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Yeah.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Yes?

07:15.000 --> 07:31.000
Is it only Final Cut XML or can we just export to a normal XML that we can also import from

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
your profile example?

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
I've heard that the FCP XML file is supported not just in Final Cut Pro, but also in the

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
other...

07:39.000 --> 07:48.000
Oh, the question was, does the exported XML file only support Final Cut Pro?

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
My understanding is that there are multiple video editing software that supports the same

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
format.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.000
It's called FCP XML, but it's actually supported by multiple programs.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.000
Sorry.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
You're supposed to take the question.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
My answer is confirmed today.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
My answer is confirmed to be correct.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Oh, Ash.

08:12.000 --> 08:24.000
Oh, bad.
