WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Change the slides.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Magic.

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
So we have Pablo from Tenpot, talking about Tenpot 2.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
It's here.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
It's here.

00:19.000 --> 00:29.000
So excited, so excited to be the last talk of the day.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Also, there's some nice free chocolate.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Not called to action yet.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Just free chocolate there so that on your way we exit.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
But we will have a bit of a birthday party here with all of you.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Because we're turning four today.

00:45.000 --> 00:55.000
So yeah, we have some waffle here from Brussels instead of a paella from Spain probably,

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
that way we're using.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
But basically it's very important, very exciting.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
Every time we come to Fosn, I think my first Fosn was 2005, 2006.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
But it was only four years ago, 2020, that we announced this was going to happen.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
So every year we come here and say this is something new,

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
and then we have Alfa and then Beta and then 1.0 and then 2.0.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
So very exciting.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
So I'm going to take a bit more water because of the excitement.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
So we're going to discuss PEMPO 2.0 and then it's time to meet Hanson Demo.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
We'll see how it goes, the staging server, and the Wi-Fi.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
So for those of you who might not know about this PEMPO,

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
PEMPO is this open source design platform for design and collaboration, code collaboration.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
And we like to discuss, and this is very, very relevant for the open source design track,

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
design and code collaboration.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
Perfect talk by Ariel, perfect takeaway also for PEMPO 2.0.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
So we believe we bring design freedom for our product teams,

02:07.000 --> 02:12.000
and we do so in various ways.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
The fact that PEMPO is open source, definitely a key ingredient.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
It gives you privacy, security and customization.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
You can hack it, you can do it whatever you want.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.000
You can use cloud, you can self-host it.

02:24.000 --> 02:30.000
We are pro open standards, so that means everything is SVG and CSS native.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
We make sure that we're not creating yet another proprietary format.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
We want to have this sustainable design and sustainable collaboration with code.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
And we do believe that it's important that whatever tool we build

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
has to bring something that was not present in existing design and prototyping tools in the past,

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
which was this collaboration between designers and developers.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
It was felt similarly as some good tools or code tools that are not welcoming to designers.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Similarly, design tools, design prototyping tools were not welcoming developers.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
So what if we fix that?

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
That was the whole idea behind Gradient PEMPO.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
The next generation of design tools should be about collaborating design code.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
So this is like the basic intro on PEMPO.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.000
But we are here to discuss PEMPO 2.0.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
This is a major release.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
You could call it PEMPO 2.0 or PEMPO 10.0,

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
because it's just a massive change in just one year.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
So we're going to cover UI redesign.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
We're very proud of that.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.000
The new component system, wonderful new inheritance and overriding and all that stuff.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
CSS read layout and some of the stuff.

03:52.000 --> 03:58.000
So let's see how PEMPO 2.0 UI redesign looks like.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
Like this.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
No, that was 0.2.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
But that was only four years, five years ago.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It is elegant.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It is simple.

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Why frame me?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.000
Of course, the reference.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
Anyone gets the reference of the picture?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
No? Willow? Willow fans?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
No?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Ah, I said, ah, Willow fans.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah, that's my age.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
And so, no, this is PEMPO 2.0.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Look at this.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
It's very fancy, right?

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I would like to have the light steam, you know,

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
but perhaps at this time that would not be smart for me to ask.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
This is just wonderful.

04:48.000 --> 04:54.000
I mean, this is just a design that is being created with a beautiful interface.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.000
Because open source and, you know, beautiful go along.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
What was behind this, the whole UI redesign?

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
Well, this is a design tool, design prototyping tool.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
It has to be interactive, it has to be real time collaboration,

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
it has to be multiplayer, and it's a productivity tool after all.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
So we needed to reduce the cognitive load.

05:19.000 --> 05:26.000
So, it's so tempting to make many things be achieved differently.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.000
So, in terms of real estate and how you would achieve things,

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
goals, we reduce the cognitive load through heretics and through research,

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
and just intuition sometimes.

05:38.000 --> 05:44.000
By the way, the picture you are looking at is a portion of our design system,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
which is completely available.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
I will show it now in a minute.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
We also improve accessibility.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
We, strong believers in accessibility should be a de facto standard

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
for everything we do.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
It is absolutely challenging to include all accessibility in a design

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
and prototyping tool, since it is very visual and it's very a complex tool

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
and has a lot of micro interactions, and we already discussed cognitive load.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
But we try our best for the size of the team that we are,

06:13.000 --> 06:18.000
you know, just 15 people in the broad team.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
And still, we do want to pursue that.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
So, major work here was color, of course, and typography and size

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
and relative shapes and that.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
So, pretty basic, but still, I think, worthwhile.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
We will continue to do that.

06:37.000 --> 06:42.000
Of course, you should be able to use Pemport to design accessible UIs.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
But here we are discussing Pemport itself as an accessible tool.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
And I think it is beautiful.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I really honestly think it is beautiful.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
Probably one of the best, most beautiful open source tools,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
but also one of the most beautiful tools.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Okay.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
I think it's also, sometimes it's just about pride.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
And why not, right?

07:08.000 --> 07:14.000
So, here we are showing just like a crop.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
We are going to see just the theming, dark theme, light theme.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.000
As in case you are, you know, you are fans of one or the other.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
It's not important what we are showing,

07:24.000 --> 07:29.000
it's just so that you can see how different Pemport looks now

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
that we have support for both dark and light themes.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And of course, you could create your own theme,

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
whether it's corporate theme or just some other theme,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
because now we have the possibility of having n themes.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
We just created the two most common, okay?

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
Before I go into that, why did, what?

07:53.000 --> 07:58.000
Okay, that's probably, okay.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
So, is it, yeah.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
So, here, that's for later.

08:03.000 --> 08:11.000
So, you can actually enjoy our design system as a library, if you want.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
I mean, this was meant to develop our own UI,

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
but if you like it so much that you would like it to inspire your UI, why not?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
So, we have many libraries and templates available,

08:23.000 --> 08:30.000
thanks to our great community that, you know, continues to provide amazing stuff for everyone to reuse.

08:30.000 --> 08:34.000
This also will be available, and I think it's pretty cool.

08:34.000 --> 08:39.000
So, it follows the typical design system pattern, so, and all that.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
So, we use that, okay?

08:42.000 --> 08:47.000
Yeah, okay.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
New component system.

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000
This was, a ton of requests, basically, had the underlying theme of new component system.

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
For those of you who are not familiar, basically, it is now a thing in design,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
I mean, not now, but like now in the past few years,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
to make everything highly reusable.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
Similarly, as we developers have thought about how to code.

09:13.000 --> 09:24.000
And so, we actually, part of this design work has borrowed terminology and abstraction.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
Abstractions from the code and engineering world into design, because it works.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
Design is also a science, and so, it is easy to borrow those concepts.

09:34.000 --> 09:43.000
The, what we wanted was to make it easier for everyone to build, like, the main components,

09:43.000 --> 09:52.000
like the original elements that are like the ideas, like the ideas of the components,

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
and then very easily track the copies of those ideas.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Pembot 1.x did not have this metaphor.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
It was much more abstract, and you had some trouble finding where the ideal component,

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
or the master component, the parent component was.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
Now, it has a kind of physical representation, sorry, not physical, but, you know, what I mean.

10:16.000 --> 10:24.000
And it is easier to track those components, the main version, and then follow their copies.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
And that comes with all sort of very cool ideas about inheritance, overriding, overloading,

10:31.000 --> 10:36.000
and also using a copy to reset the ideal.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
If you are so happy with a copy that you think every other copy should now follow this copy.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
The way you do that is that you basically reset the main component through that copy.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
So, by the way, Riz of Hans, who here is a developer?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
Okay.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
And who here is a designer, or does the design?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Okay.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Both.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Both, both.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
The question is, not exclusively.

11:08.000 --> 11:19.000
So, then I have a call for action for you developers in the room.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.000
The proprietary design tools are coming for you.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
They're coming for you because you represent ten times, well, here, much more,

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
but you represent ten times the market size of the designer world.

11:33.000 --> 11:36.000
So, it's now obvious for the proprietary design tools,

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
design proprietary tools that you are the next in line for milking, being milked.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
I hope you have strong opinions about that.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
Also, the updating workflow is now much obvious what's going on.

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
The synchronization, and we'll show, I hope we'll be able to show that during the demo, is obvious.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
I mean, when you are synchronizing things that are there, right there, simultaneously,

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
that is very obvious, but also, and I don't think I'll have the time to show this during the demo,

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
when things are synchronized behind the scenes, okay?

12:16.000 --> 12:21.000
You get notifications, updates, you can decide to dismiss some synchronization,

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
and perhaps later on, now is the good time.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
So, that has been improved.

12:26.000 --> 12:31.000
And then we also have new capabilities, very obvious ones, very tangible ones.

12:31.000 --> 12:36.000
Annotation, which is, okay, I'm going to document this component,

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
whether it's the main component or the copy of that component,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
but also the swapping, the quick stopping.

12:41.000 --> 12:47.000
Because when you have everything as a component, you sometimes want to swap that component for another one

12:47.000 --> 12:55.000
that is also capable of taking the role of that component within that context, okay?

12:56.000 --> 13:02.000
So, here's a very simple example where you have the main component,

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
that's a very simple landing page.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
The main component is the one top left, right?

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
You know that because it has a specific legend on top, so it's very easy to spot.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.000
And then the rest are copies, and the synchronization is instantaneous.

13:19.000 --> 13:25.000
This is really like capturing what someone is doing on Pembroke campus.

13:25.000 --> 13:34.000
This is a very simple example, of course, but it's good for animator GIF on a presentation here, okay?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
So far so good, right?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah, yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.000
This is a component swap, and I was discussing a minute ago.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.000
So, here we go from image gallery to image gallery, but with title and description.

13:48.000 --> 13:54.000
So, basically, someone decided to have different components that could fit into, in this case, this is an app.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Looks like an app.

13:55.000 --> 14:00.000
But what if I try this, or perhaps in a different context, I want to show different stuff.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
For whatever reasons, you should be able to have your components easily be swapped.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
And, of course, this is easy to navigate.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.000
Here you can see, you pay close attention.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
You see there's the content.

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
The content is basically an arbitrary categorization that the designer or the user used.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.000
But you can then go back one level and find everything in your component library.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
This was just to show just a small list, okay?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Very good.

14:34.000 --> 14:44.000
And, wow, we have CSS Grid Layout, or CSS Grid CSS Layout.

14:44.000 --> 14:52.000
Not Grid Layout, because Grid Layout, of course, we had that from probably 0.2.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
Grid Layout is the print media standard of columns and rows.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
This is the CSS.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Why is this so important?

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Because this delivers on a promise.

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
We said if we really want to unite designers and developers around one language,

15:07.000 --> 15:14.000
what if we're able to bring the code language, the expressiveness of the cloud-tip programming,

15:14.000 --> 15:24.000
that is, in CSS, natively into building a design, without using the code, just using a user interface.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
Okay?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
See some people saying, aha.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
So this is a complex theme.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.000
Probably it would deserve its own, I wouldn't say, Fawcett and Track, but perhaps a talk,

15:33.000 --> 15:36.000
which is the cloud-tip programming, the cloud-tip design.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
So this is about if you want to read more on this, just stick with the cloud-tip design.

15:41.000 --> 15:47.000
And the cloud-tip versus imperative is about expressing rules to get to a point,

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
but not exactly how I get to the point.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
And CSS is perfect about that.

15:52.000 --> 15:58.000
Because the browser understands the rules, tries to get to a goal their way.

15:58.000 --> 16:05.000
So when you're designing for the real world, one could argue that imperative design is problematic.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
It's not fluid.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
It's not reactive.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
It is limited.

16:09.000 --> 16:16.000
But the cloud-tip design is able to be okay with a fluid world uncertainty.

16:16.000 --> 16:28.000
And CSS embodies that very keenly, finally, after the specs of CSS Grids or Grids CSS

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
layout came in 2019.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
So it's very recent.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
And for an open standard, that's very recent.

16:34.000 --> 16:42.000
So we started with FlexLayout, which is about alignment that was present earlier in Pempot.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
So Flex is about one-dimensional alignment.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
But Grids is about bi-dimensional.

16:48.000 --> 16:54.000
So with both, and you can combine them the way you want, you have almost total freedom.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
You can do all sorts of compositions.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.000
You know, Flex, Grids, and you can nest them the way you want.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
And Pempot was able to build that natively.

17:04.000 --> 17:10.000
For the first time ever for any design tool, we decided to trust the code standard

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
instead of creating our own interpretation of how design should be created with new vocabulary

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
and terminology.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
So this is very opinionated software building here.

17:21.000 --> 17:29.000
So here you are seeing edits in a grid, again, cropped and very simplistic for the sake of,

17:29.000 --> 17:36.000
and you can see where, if you're familiar with CSS, you're basically seeing CSS visually.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
And you can see how the code next to the UI is automatically being updated

17:42.000 --> 17:46.000
because it's synchronized by design in a way.

17:46.000 --> 17:52.000
We actually started with the code, created the user interface, and it is trivial for us to impact the code.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
This code is part of the Pempot's user interface.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
You can go to inspect code and you can see that.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.000
I just pasted there, you know, synchronously.

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
So it gives Pempot users the possibility of the CloudTip design, which is amazing.

18:07.000 --> 18:16.000
And all those YouTube tutorials about you designers you know about CSS,

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
this is the code tutorial you, it's easy for you.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
You just follow this code.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
No need for that anymore because you can just use your visual language,

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
knowing that it is expressed as code instantly.

18:29.000 --> 18:37.000
So I would rather, I mean, I would like to ask for a round of applause for the team to get us to this point.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Demo time.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
So this is, I hope you can see it, yes.

18:56.000 --> 19:00.000
So this is a very simple design.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
I'm going to just select this and make it like this.

19:04.000 --> 19:10.000
So this is a, I mean, don't pay, this is a bento design, it's trendy, that's not important.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
So this is a grid.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
I'm going to actually edit it.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
And I'm going to just go and add a column to the right.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Okay.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
So notice that we are using FR units by default.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
You could use whatever you can do.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Go out, auto, pixel, doesn't matter.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
It's fine if it's like this.

19:33.000 --> 19:42.000
And by the way, I forgot to duplicate this file, so I'm messing with someone else as by now.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
We have a limited undo.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
So, yeah.

19:49.000 --> 19:57.000
And then what I want is to pick this one, this element, and I'll just put it here.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
It automatically understands this lot.

20:00.000 --> 20:08.000
This one, I'm going to do something different because I'm going to create a component out of this, so Ctrl K.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
And I'm going to duplicate this component, so Ctrl D.

20:11.000 --> 20:14.000
Now I have a copy and I'm in Components.

20:14.000 --> 20:21.000
You can see that, sorry if you cannot see it very precisely, but there are different legends there on my console.

20:21.000 --> 20:28.000
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to just move it here.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.000
And you notice it doesn't react really to the fact that there is more space available.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
And this is a reactive design, so I want to do that.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
So that's easy.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
I just select it.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
This is a copy.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
And I can go here and just...

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
No, no, no.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
This is not going to happen to this demo.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
Okay.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
Just one, just a mouse.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.000
Just a mouse.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
And I'm using a trackball.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.000
It should be easy.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
It's great that I feel the...

20:55.000 --> 20:58.000
Everybody stop breathing.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
Okay.

21:00.000 --> 21:08.000
This is a certain level, you know, whatever, precision.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
So here I will go for just use the space you have.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
Okay.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Totally...

21:15.000 --> 21:18.000
But notice, notice, there's more, there's more.

21:18.000 --> 21:27.000
Notice that the main component did not react because I overrided, I overwrote this attribute, which is fine.

21:27.000 --> 21:37.000
But if I go to the main component and change, perhaps let's go for something silly as the fill here.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
Okay.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
And I changed that, then the main copy does react.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
This is the synchronization that I was talking about.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.000
So I'm going to use something like this, I don't know.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
That's it.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
There's more.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
Because...

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
And this is something that happens a lot.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
I go to the copy here.

21:56.000 --> 22:06.000
You can, of course, navigate all this, but if I go and select button and I change the fill, yeah, like this, let's say, something like that.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.000
And now we all praise to the demo gods, okay?

22:11.000 --> 22:17.000
I can decide, okay, I like it so much that I'm going to update the main component.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
Okay.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
And I update, and that happened.

22:20.000 --> 22:31.000
And now the main component, if had all the copies across not only this file, but elsewhere, if I use this as a library, would have the notification that that main component has changed.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
Do you want to apply those changes to your copies?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
This is very nice, right?

22:36.000 --> 22:49.000
And so to finish, because I know I'm out of time, one last thing.

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
I have here a code pen.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
I always like to end with something like this outside pen pod.

22:57.000 --> 23:01.000
So I can take this, I can go to inspect, I can go to code.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
All this is there for you to enjoy, to fund, everything.

23:04.000 --> 23:10.000
So I'm going to copy the CSS and just copy this, okay?

23:10.000 --> 23:14.000
It's going to take a while because there's a lot of images that depend on the Wi-Fi.

23:14.000 --> 23:19.000
We now have HTML on top of SVG, so you pick what you want.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
We don't care, you know.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
It's everything is, as long as it opens up, that's fine.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
We copy that.

23:25.000 --> 23:32.000
So what this is doing is, since we are, if we are telling the truth,

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
you should be seeing, the moment it downloads all those base 64 encoded pictures,

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
the design, let's see.

23:41.000 --> 23:53.000
Yeah, that's what I'm trying.

23:53.000 --> 23:59.000
I have Wi-Fi, it works.

23:59.000 --> 24:15.000
Yeah, this is, well, I'll send you a link.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
But basically, this is basically what you need.

24:19.000 --> 24:27.000
You need the HTML, the CSS, and it's built exactly to your, to the perfect standards.

24:27.000 --> 24:34.000
Because nothing I did was not possible using the CSS expressiveness.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
So there's no way you're going to mess it.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
It is one-to-one perfect match.

24:39.000 --> 24:44.000
So that lost in translation, that back and forth issues that typically designers and developers,

24:44.000 --> 24:49.000
you know, express that they're having, very frustrating, doesn't happen with Pembot.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
And of course, this is real tank collaboration.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
I'm just single player mode here.

24:53.000 --> 25:03.000
But so, so quickly to finish, we saw the UI design, new components, this is right now.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
We have some other cool stuff going on.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
And the question is, when Pablo, when do I get Pembot to buy it all?

25:11.000 --> 25:18.000
It's coming, it's coming.

25:18.000 --> 25:22.000
Wouldn't it be nice if we had it today?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.000
We have a staging server.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
If anyone interested, come to any of the Pembot team members.

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
We can give you the security URL, which is basically quite simple.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
And you can try it out.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.000
But it's in the next few weeks, basically.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
So we're aiming for February.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
So it's still forced in month.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
And so very, very soon.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
So thank you a lot, the team, the community, and everyone.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
You can find more stuff there.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
Thank you everyone for staying up to now.

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
And I hope you enjoy all the work that came from Pembot to Bueno.

25:55.000 --> 26:13.000
And now, before we leave, or where all the track ends, anyone has a lighter?

26:13.000 --> 26:20.000
I do not have a lighter.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
So.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
May I steal the light?

26:24.000 --> 26:27.000
Yes.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
You didn't sing happy birthday?

26:29.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Okay.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Hello.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
How's it going?

26:43.000 --> 26:44.000
Oh, yeah.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
All right.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
So it's so exciting.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.000
This is our event.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
It's basically how we were born.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
So it's very exciting to do this.

26:52.000 --> 26:59.000
So I wish everyone wishes something nice for their open source project for Pembot,

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
for Foslan, for the community.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
So it is like this.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Yeah!

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Take it.

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
It is chocolate.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
It is chocolate from Pembot.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Thank you very much.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Thank you.
