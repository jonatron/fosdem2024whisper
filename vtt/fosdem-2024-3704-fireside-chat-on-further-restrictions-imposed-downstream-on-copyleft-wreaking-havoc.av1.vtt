WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.160
Okay, I think we're ready to start our next talk.

00:13.160 --> 00:18.680
Let's welcome, Bradley and Khrusov.

00:18.680 --> 00:21.600
So, hello.

00:21.600 --> 00:28.880
So we wanted this to be a panel, and the problem we discovered was there are basically five

00:28.880 --> 00:35.240
people in the entire planet who have the knowledge to be on that panel, and only two of them

00:35.240 --> 00:37.080
were going to be at Fosden.

00:37.080 --> 00:42.440
So you have the two that are actually at Fosden to talk about this really important issue,

00:42.440 --> 00:45.960
and there's been a tremendous amount of things that have happened this year.

00:45.960 --> 00:51.560
But to start off, I'm going to hand it to my colleague, Christof, to talk about what

00:51.560 --> 00:57.960
this clause in GPLv3 is, and any GPLv3 as well, and what it's there for, why it's there,

00:57.960 --> 00:58.960
and what it does.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.960
Okay, thanks a lot.

01:00.960 --> 01:01.960
Hello.

01:01.960 --> 01:03.960
I'm very happy to be here.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.080
My name is Christof Chirvich.

01:05.080 --> 01:12.160
I recently started as the licensing and compliance manager at DFSF.

01:12.160 --> 01:20.120
So this is actually my first public appearance in this position, and I'm very happy to do

01:20.120 --> 01:21.840
this appearance.

01:21.840 --> 01:32.480
So as an introduction, we are going to talk about something that we at DFSF started to

01:32.480 --> 01:42.920
call, for example, confusing licensing or unauthorized alterations to the GPL, which

01:42.920 --> 01:43.920
is...

01:44.000 --> 01:52.960
Let me start by saying that the FFSF designed the GPL as the license that not just gives

01:52.960 --> 02:01.920
users their freedoms, but it also has a mechanism to guarantee this freedom, which is, well,

02:01.920 --> 02:06.680
co-pillift and some other obligations.

02:06.680 --> 02:08.920
And what we have...

02:08.920 --> 02:16.800
So what the FFSF has observed for quite a while is that people are doing different things,

02:16.800 --> 02:23.680
not just using GPL verbatim, as it was intended to be applied, but they try to add some additional

02:23.680 --> 02:28.480
requirements.

02:28.480 --> 02:33.360
And that was addressed in GPLv3.

02:33.360 --> 02:42.720
And in section 7 of the GPL, we have actually at least three different kinds of requirements

02:42.720 --> 02:44.560
that are differently treated.

02:44.560 --> 02:49.840
First of all, you have additional permissions or, let's say, exceptions that you can give,

02:49.840 --> 02:52.920
and I don't think we have to talk about them.

02:52.920 --> 03:00.280
And then there is a list of clauses that you can add that actually restrict what users

03:00.280 --> 03:08.920
can do as compared to the grant of rights that's given in the GPL, let's say the original

03:08.920 --> 03:10.800
GPL.

03:10.800 --> 03:21.760
So there is a limited list of these requirements, restrictions that you can impose.

03:21.760 --> 03:30.120
And if you do more, if you try to restrict further, these are called further restrictions,

03:30.960 --> 03:35.960
and we have the quote from the relevant part of section 7.

03:35.960 --> 03:45.080
It says that if you received the program with any of such further restrictions, you can

03:45.080 --> 03:46.200
remove that term.

03:46.200 --> 03:58.240
So basically, long story short, you do not have to abide by those restrictions.

03:58.240 --> 04:05.880
I don't want to take too much time, so that's this license mechanism that is intended to

04:05.880 --> 04:08.560
protect users in such a situation.

04:08.560 --> 04:19.800
The other protection can come from the FSF itself because we, as the authors of the GPL,

04:19.800 --> 04:26.480
we have copyright on the license terms, and we have also trademarks that are used in the

04:26.480 --> 04:27.480
license.

04:27.480 --> 04:39.840
So, after you apply the license, we want that to be done as intended, and we are not authorizing

04:39.840 --> 04:46.560
users of the GPL that alter it or twist it in the way that it doesn't give freedoms contrary

04:46.560 --> 04:52.360
to what section 7 allows.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.120
So we believe that not...

04:54.120 --> 04:56.560
So this mechanism can be used by users.

04:56.560 --> 04:59.320
There is also another mechanism that we can resort to.

04:59.320 --> 05:04.840
We could rely on our copyright or trademarks to protect the community from people imposing

05:04.840 --> 05:09.400
some further restrictions.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.560
Maybe let me stop here and we can maybe elaborate on that.

05:13.560 --> 05:18.560
Well, yeah, I think it's an excellent summary, and I think one of the points I want to add

05:18.560 --> 05:23.280
is kind of an historical thing because I worked on this years ago.

05:23.280 --> 05:29.400
This clause was invented to handle the problem of...

05:29.400 --> 05:33.720
Which was very common in the early 2000s, that someone say, this is under GPL version

05:33.720 --> 05:36.280
2, but for non-commercial use only.

05:36.280 --> 05:40.880
Well, we all know, but we had a lot of discussion earlier today, you're allowed to do things

05:40.880 --> 05:43.320
under GPL version 2 commercially.

05:44.200 --> 05:53.800
Under V2, the V2 group of licenses, this created just pure ambiguity because there was a statement

05:53.800 --> 05:57.960
that it was under GPL, but then there was a statement that prohibited commercial use

05:57.960 --> 06:00.240
or commercial redistribution.

06:00.240 --> 06:04.120
This clause was specifically designed during the GPL V3 process, and you can actually go

06:04.120 --> 06:07.640
into the drafting history of GPL V3.

06:07.640 --> 06:11.040
I wrote an expert report, which I'm going to talk about in a few minutes, where I did

06:11.080 --> 06:15.800
this in a case that's going on in the US, and find that that's exactly what we were

06:15.800 --> 06:20.280
trying in the drafting of GPL V3 to allow users to do.

06:20.280 --> 06:25.360
There's so much good about the GPL about how it empowers users, and the idea behind this

06:25.360 --> 06:28.840
was to empower the users, just throw that clause away.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.960
That clause shouldn't be there.

06:30.960 --> 06:36.560
You should be able to go back to pure GPL anytime you want, and no one can, anywhere

06:36.560 --> 06:42.480
from the supply chain, all the way from the original license or down to each redistributor

06:42.480 --> 06:48.680
can add an additional restriction on your rights under GPL.

06:48.680 --> 06:52.560
On paper, by design, this looks great.

06:52.560 --> 06:56.320
The scary thing that's happening in the US, and I'm going to briefly summarize it, and

06:56.320 --> 07:02.200
then we're just going to turn it over for questions, is that many companies, particularly

07:02.200 --> 07:08.680
these VC backed open core companies that we talked about in the earlier session, have

07:08.680 --> 07:13.160
really, I think unfairly, I'm going to say this because Crystal probably won't want to

07:13.160 --> 07:16.560
go this far, but I'll say it because I'm not affiliated with the FSAF, they've unfairly

07:16.560 --> 07:20.480
traded on the good name of the GPL, and they've said, oh, we're going to put this, we're

07:20.480 --> 07:25.800
going to say it's under GPL, but then we're going to add some weird further restriction.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.520
Their users are confused.

07:28.520 --> 07:37.040
There was a case with a company called Neo4j, which did this, and a user who was also, by

07:37.040 --> 07:43.280
the way, a contributor to Neo4j, an integrator for Neo4j, saw them do this and said, well,

07:43.280 --> 07:44.280
I found this clause.

07:44.280 --> 07:46.240
I can throw it away.

07:46.240 --> 07:47.680
That's exactly it.

07:47.680 --> 07:54.120
This fellow named John Mark Suhi did exactly what all of us in the old days intended when

07:54.120 --> 07:55.120
this clause got drafted.

07:55.120 --> 08:01.840
He removed the clause, and in response, Neo4j sued him in federal court for a variety of

08:01.840 --> 08:07.400
acclaims, including a DMCA violation and various different damages.

08:07.400 --> 08:13.640
I had the dubious privilege because it was a disturbing thing to watch to attend the

08:13.640 --> 08:23.800
trial, and it really is heart-wrenching to realize that while we had this right on paper,

08:24.480 --> 08:30.800
hit the ground, and somebody was in trouble, it was very difficult for everybody, and John

08:30.800 --> 08:34.080
Mark's lawyers tried very hard to explain to the judge, he did exactly what he was

08:34.080 --> 08:37.000
allowed to do.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.520
We're kind of in a crisis right now about this clause because while Neo4j is just one

08:42.520 --> 08:47.360
incident, the case, which hasn't been fully decided yet, although many of the key parts

08:47.360 --> 08:49.440
of it were decided in summary judgment.

08:49.440 --> 08:53.280
I can explain more if people have questions what that means.

08:53.280 --> 08:56.640
We don't know what the future of this clause is, we don't know how it's going to work out,

08:56.640 --> 09:02.520
and we've got somebody who's been really badly treated by Neo4j and frankly by the

09:02.520 --> 09:08.040
courts for just doing what all of us in the free software world and the copula world in

09:08.040 --> 09:11.240
particular thought he should be allowed to do.

09:11.240 --> 09:17.280
That's a U.S.-centric thing, but I think it has worldwide implications because other

09:17.280 --> 09:22.840
companies will be watching, and their desire to trade on the good name of GPL and say,

09:22.840 --> 09:27.800
this GPL, except we've added this Commons clause thing, except we've added no commercial

09:27.800 --> 09:29.560
use allowed or whatever it is.

09:29.560 --> 09:35.680
We really as a community need to prevent that kind of behavior, and we're in the thick

09:35.680 --> 09:41.680
of trying to make this clause work the way it's supposed to.

09:41.680 --> 09:46.200
So maybe just one or two thoughts.

09:46.200 --> 09:55.240
I think in the simplest terms what we think about it is that when you use the GPL, it

09:55.240 --> 10:00.040
is intended and I think it's usually in this sense to transmit a very strong message that

10:00.040 --> 10:05.000
you grant uses all the freedoms that are there.

10:05.000 --> 10:13.320
So it's very concerning and confusing when someone uses the GPL, someone says, well,

10:13.440 --> 10:19.760
this is under the GPL, but tries to change the result and the message.

10:19.760 --> 10:29.640
So what we really are concerned with and we want to react is to stop this confusion.

10:29.640 --> 10:35.680
And on the other hand, we are really happy and that the licenses are there for that people

10:35.680 --> 10:37.560
are using them.

10:37.560 --> 10:45.680
So it's really, and we even allow people to create new licenses using the terms of the

10:45.680 --> 10:46.680
GPL.

10:46.680 --> 10:55.680
In the FAQ we've written how it's possible, but we then make it very clear how to do it

10:55.680 --> 11:02.760
without confusing, without using the name of the GPL because people may create very different

11:02.760 --> 11:05.320
licenses when they use the term.

11:05.320 --> 11:13.400
So I think that it's a very simple issue that we are concerned with this confusion and it

11:13.400 --> 11:18.880
should be stopped if there is someone who wants to write their own license.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.320
I mean, well, I don't think it's a good idea.

11:21.320 --> 11:26.160
We already have a lot of licenses, but if you really want to please do, just stop, don't

11:26.160 --> 11:27.160
confuse users.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.240
Yeah, I agree completely.

11:29.240 --> 11:33.320
And in that same space, we saw MangaDB do this.

11:33.320 --> 11:39.000
They took almost exactly the text of the FAQ or GPL, but again, I can probably say more

11:39.000 --> 11:46.120
because I can speculate about the FSF as not being affiliated with the FSF.

11:46.120 --> 11:50.000
They didn't, it seems to me, have a trademark problem because they called it something different.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.080
They named it the server-side public license.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.720
It is a horrible license.

11:53.720 --> 11:54.880
There's no question.

11:54.880 --> 11:59.480
It cannot be complied with by anybody on the planet.

11:59.480 --> 12:05.040
Even if MangaDB themselves tried to comply with the SSPL, they could not, but they own

12:05.040 --> 12:08.200
all the copyrights so they don't have to worry about it.

12:08.200 --> 12:15.000
But the, so while it's a toxic and terrible thing that the SS public license exists, it's

12:15.000 --> 12:20.760
actually better than the Neo4j situation because in the Neo4j situation, they're using the

12:20.760 --> 12:22.160
name of a Faro GPL.

12:22.160 --> 12:26.760
They're saying the software is under a Faro GPL, but sneakily at the bottom, they've put

12:26.760 --> 12:32.440
another restriction and they're captiously going after users and saying, aha, I caught

12:32.440 --> 12:33.440
you.

12:33.440 --> 12:38.720
And I have some real scary stories to tell of stuff that came out in trial.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.680
I'll just tell one and then we'll open it to questions.

12:41.680 --> 12:48.460
So during the trial, it turned out that the reason John Mark Suhey, who was a government

12:48.460 --> 12:53.240
contractor in the United States, he was working for our Department of Treasury, he had, and

12:53.880 --> 12:59.100
this is all public because it was publicly, publicly testified at trial, he had packaged

12:59.100 --> 13:04.320
Neo4j with a bunch of other software as a, as basically a system integrator to deliver

13:04.320 --> 13:06.760
a solution to the Department of Treasury.

13:06.760 --> 13:11.600
And then Neo4j, who he'd signed an agreement with to do marketing, because he was a business

13:11.600 --> 13:16.480
person trying to make lots of business relationships, they came to him and said, you have to go

13:16.480 --> 13:21.120
and tell the IRS, the Department of Treasury in the U.S. that they're violating the

13:21.160 --> 13:22.960
affair of GPL.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.160
And he said they aren't.

13:24.160 --> 13:28.400
I wouldn't, I wouldn't deploy the solution if I thought it was in violation.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.000
And they said, no, but you have to tell them that because we want to sell them a license.

13:31.000 --> 13:36.080
But of course, this dissolved quickly the relationship between them.

13:36.080 --> 13:40.560
And it was not too long after that then Neo4j added the Commons clause on and said, well,

13:40.560 --> 13:42.680
they're definitely violating the Commons clause.

13:42.680 --> 13:46.160
And then John Mark came back and said, but I never deployed the Commons clause version

13:46.160 --> 13:48.560
at the IRS in the first place.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.680
So why is it, you know?

13:50.720 --> 13:53.000
And then eventually he just removed the Commons clause.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.400
Then I can't remember if he'd actually deployed that version or not.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.920
But as soon as he started telling the IRS that they could remove the Commons clause

14:01.920 --> 14:04.400
is when Neo4j sued him.

14:04.400 --> 14:09.120
So it's just unbelievably nasty behavior.

14:09.120 --> 14:16.120
And as I said, trading on a good name of a good license for a pure avarice.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.280
So anything else you want to add before we just turn it over to see what people want

14:19.280 --> 14:20.280
to ask?

14:20.480 --> 14:21.480
No, thanks.

14:21.480 --> 14:24.480
Maybe when you have some questions.

14:31.480 --> 14:35.800
So confusing users sounds to me like unfair competition.

14:35.800 --> 14:42.800
So have you looked into using unfair competition law to stop such confusing behavior?

14:46.240 --> 14:50.240
I admit that I had not thought about that angle.

14:51.240 --> 14:58.240
There were some arguments made by, because I've read the entire docket of the Neo4j trial.

15:04.200 --> 15:08.280
John Mark's lawyers made a few arguments of that nature.

15:08.280 --> 15:13.080
The judge was not particularly interested in them, unfortunately.

15:13.080 --> 15:19.080
So I think someone would have to bring a separate claim of some sort for it to be possible.

15:19.080 --> 15:22.680
I don't know exactly how that claim would be structured, at least in the US, but I'm

15:22.680 --> 15:23.680
not a lawyer.

15:23.680 --> 15:27.180
I think you want to address that too?

15:27.180 --> 15:33.180
So I'm not sure if you're asking about confusing in relation to what, okay.

15:33.180 --> 15:39.280
So maybe when I was talking about confusing users, I was talking about the FSF's concern

15:39.280 --> 15:46.280
that someone is using the FSF's license, not as they were intended and confusing about

15:46.280 --> 15:50.160
the scope of their rights.

15:50.160 --> 15:57.160
So as far as I know, in order to invoke unfair competition law, for that we would have to,

16:00.160 --> 16:03.920
that would be the case between FSF and that person who is using.

16:03.920 --> 16:09.920
So I'm not sure that unfair competition laws would apply here, but I also don't want to

16:09.920 --> 16:12.800
bet on that.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.320
I would have to check.

16:14.320 --> 16:21.320
But maybe another case with unfair competition would be between someone who is using licenses

16:24.520 --> 16:31.520
with all these alterations and someone else who was just trying to use the license as,

16:33.000 --> 16:40.000
for example, following section seven and relying on the license without restriction.

16:40.720 --> 16:47.720
I mean, well, no idea, but that's an interesting direction maybe to check.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.920
I have a question.

16:54.920 --> 17:01.920
In American law, is it still possible to file a friend of the court brief in the Neo4j case?

17:04.720 --> 17:07.360
So normally, my understanding, I'm not a lawyer.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.760
This is not legal advice.

17:09.760 --> 17:15.560
My understanding is that you can really only do amicus briefs on appeal.

17:15.560 --> 17:19.600
And I should mention that John Mark is planning to appeal.

17:19.600 --> 17:23.640
He's got most of the negative decisions already because they were done in summary judgment.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.840
Really the only thing left for the judge to decide, and the case just closed a couple

17:27.840 --> 17:34.600
of weeks ago, is how much John Mark has to pay to Neo4j, because Neo4j has asked for

17:34.600 --> 17:36.200
a huge amount of damages.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.240
So the judge is going to decide what that number is.

17:39.240 --> 17:43.880
John Mark is planning to do an appeal, and at that appeal stage is usually when an amicus

17:43.880 --> 17:45.240
brief can come in.

17:45.240 --> 17:50.040
Now you may have heard that there was some sort of appeal already in this case.

17:50.040 --> 17:55.640
That was really misreported, and frankly, there have been a number of people who have

17:55.640 --> 18:00.720
misreported it badly, and it's very unfortunate, because that was only an appeal of a preliminary

18:00.720 --> 18:01.720
injunction.

18:01.720 --> 18:06.240
So John Mark actually, I mean, just everything went wrong for him in the case, because the

18:06.240 --> 18:11.080
judge just really didn't understand the issues that well, in my opinion.

18:11.080 --> 18:17.760
And the judge issued a preliminary injunction saying that John Mark wasn't even allowed

18:17.760 --> 18:24.400
to say that you could remove the comments clause, like that notwithstanding this text

18:24.400 --> 18:26.160
right there in the license.

18:26.160 --> 18:32.000
And he appealed that decision, and he couldn't say that it was open source because it was

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
not.

18:33.120 --> 18:36.280
He appealed that injunction, basically a gag order.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.400
He lost that appeal.

18:37.400 --> 18:42.520
But that was only a preliminary injunction that was in place while the trial was ongoing.

18:42.520 --> 18:47.960
And so it was really a narrow appeal, and the bigger appeal is what will be coming next.

18:47.960 --> 18:53.200
And I would hope that, I mean, my boss is sitting over there.

18:53.200 --> 18:57.680
I'm hoping that my organization I work for will follow an amicus brief, and I hope we'll

18:57.680 --> 18:58.680
all do a lot more.

18:58.680 --> 19:03.400
I think you'll be hearing a lot more about John Mark's struggle after the decision comes

19:03.400 --> 19:04.400
out.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.960
And so there will be a lot settled in this appeal, and amicus briefs and everything else.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.040
I'm just going to make one quick follow up here.

19:12.040 --> 19:19.400
For context for everyone, I'm assuming, and you'll clarify this, that in this context,

19:19.400 --> 19:25.160
Neo4j has chosen the referral GPL, but it's under what you would call proprietary relicensing.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.600
In other words, they require a CLA.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.000
They're also selling a commercial license.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.680
And was that explained to the court why they did that?

19:34.680 --> 19:40.160
There were a number of conversations during the trial about, it's not a conversation

19:40.160 --> 19:41.160
at trial.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.760
There were a number of questions that flew around of that nature during the trial when

19:44.760 --> 19:47.640
I was there.

19:47.640 --> 19:51.880
The interesting thing about that, because I also filed an expert report, which the judge

19:51.960 --> 19:57.240
basically rejected, sadly, on John Mark's behalf, because you asked about amicus briefs.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.640
There's also expert reports.

19:58.640 --> 20:04.640
I was the expert witness for John Mark's side and the judge throughout my expert report.

20:04.640 --> 20:09.800
So I felt pretty bad about that, but it wasn't surprising with this judge.

20:09.800 --> 20:20.480
But to your question about the relicensing and so forth, nowhere did Neo4j ever establish

20:20.480 --> 20:22.320
that they are the sole copyright holder.

20:22.320 --> 20:26.800
In fact, I went through and looked through the Git history, and they accepted patches

20:26.800 --> 20:32.800
from third parties, and they did not have a CLA in place when they accepted those patches.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.640
Now it could be the case, we don't know.

20:34.640 --> 20:38.640
It could be the case that they carefully went around all those parties privately and collected

20:38.640 --> 20:40.440
copyright assignments.

20:40.440 --> 20:45.800
But those parties actually, in my mind, if they did not later do copyright assignments

20:45.800 --> 20:51.800
or other CLA-like instruments with Neo4j, Neo4j is infringing their copyrights because

20:51.800 --> 20:55.240
at the time, the whole thing was AGPL.

20:55.240 --> 20:59.480
And then later, Neo4j changed the license to this AGPL.

20:59.480 --> 21:02.960
And the answer to the other part of your question is, yes, absolutely.

21:02.960 --> 21:08.800
Their primary business model is selling proprietary licenses and using the license they have to

21:08.800 --> 21:10.800
scare people into buying such licenses.

21:10.800 --> 21:26.920
So I'm not exactly sure why anyone is actually really surprised about this.

21:26.920 --> 21:31.440
Because I mean, this whole license flushing has been going on for quite some time right

21:31.440 --> 21:32.440
now.

21:32.440 --> 21:36.720
I mean, we probably all remember the case of some company that distributed the kernel

21:36.720 --> 21:43.440
code and basically told its customers, if you redistribute the source for that, then

21:43.440 --> 21:45.880
we are not going to do business with you anymore.

21:45.880 --> 21:58.680
So yeah, I mean, this is kind of the logical consequence now.

21:58.680 --> 22:02.000
That was more or less my question too.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.320
I think that now restricts redistribution of the source code further and that seems

22:08.320 --> 22:11.840
to be in direct contradiction of this term.

22:11.840 --> 22:21.440
So if their distribution contains source under this license, it looks to me like it's in

22:21.440 --> 22:22.440
direct contradiction.

22:22.440 --> 22:26.960
What are your thoughts on that?

22:26.960 --> 22:30.880
We had a time-backs panel on that issue a little earlier and I don't want to turn this

22:31.000 --> 22:33.480
into another discussion of the Red Hat thing.

22:33.480 --> 22:37.640
The one thing I'll say that, I'll see if Christophe wants to add anything, but I'm

22:37.640 --> 22:45.920
not aware of Red Hat ever suing someone for, suing an individual sole proprietor for damages

22:45.920 --> 22:47.760
because of something they did with RHEL.

22:47.760 --> 22:50.080
The Neo4j's behavior is beyond the pale.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.520
I compared it to MongoDB before.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.440
I've never heard of MongoDB suing somebody in this way.

22:54.440 --> 23:00.360
So the fact that they went after just this guy who's a government contractor, he started

23:00.400 --> 23:05.480
a small business to do government contracting with open source and free software and they're

23:05.480 --> 23:09.240
coming after him in this aggressive way to get financial damages from him.

23:09.240 --> 23:14.400
It's really beyond the pale and I think there's really no comparison to what's happening in

23:14.400 --> 23:19.600
Neo4j to anything I've seen with regard to this whole area of proprietary licensing and

23:19.600 --> 23:20.600
so forth.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.600
Okay.

23:21.600 --> 23:28.400
My question was to say that it's a price in the Red Hat situation, not that they're

23:28.400 --> 23:33.400
concerned or would not dream of saving their company.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.400
Do you want to?

23:36.400 --> 23:37.400
Well, okay.

23:37.400 --> 23:44.680
Maybe I did not understand the question as well, but I just wanted to say that either,

23:44.680 --> 23:50.080
whatever way you take, either you are the user who wants to rely on Section 7 and just

23:50.080 --> 23:59.000
ignore the restrictions or if it's like the case of the FSF that we want to use our copyright

23:59.000 --> 24:04.920
and trademarks to start compliance actions with different people.

24:04.920 --> 24:14.360
And I'm not saying going to the court in the first place, but trying to talk to people

24:14.360 --> 24:22.720
and then make them realize that they're confusing users and they might breach our exclusive rights.

24:22.720 --> 24:30.280
Both of these require that actually someone gets involved and initiates this legal action

24:30.280 --> 24:31.520
or negotiation.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.840
So there are tools available.

24:33.840 --> 24:40.640
They have to be used, but that requires effort and I think that was already mentioned in

24:40.640 --> 24:49.320
the rail discussion before that requires effort and using the legal tools.

24:49.320 --> 24:52.400
And just a point of order.

24:52.400 --> 24:58.080
Obviously we could have had an entire like half day just talking about the rail thing.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.120
I really want to be respectful of how we time boxed it.

25:01.120 --> 25:05.520
We made the decision to only make that an hour because it could just go on forever.

25:05.520 --> 25:09.760
So I'd really like to not get too deep into rail while we're talking about this other

25:09.760 --> 25:11.960
issue.

25:11.960 --> 25:18.680
So zooming out a bit for the moment, if you take a broader look at the AGPL and sort of

25:18.680 --> 25:24.320
what it has become in practice, that it's become a sort of like submarine license type,

25:24.320 --> 25:26.200
like submarine patent type thing.

25:26.200 --> 25:32.040
Bradley, could you give your idea, your way forward, your roadmap, how you see the AGPL

25:32.040 --> 25:38.760
going forward because I see it mostly as something that is used to coerce companies into licensing,

25:38.760 --> 25:39.760
right?

25:39.760 --> 25:51.400
Like a slightly weaker form of the SSPL, but still used to gouge and to extort.

25:51.400 --> 25:54.480
So I'm going to put Chris off on the spot here.

25:54.480 --> 25:58.480
So we came up with a solution for this for Copy Left Next, which is called the Copy Left

25:58.480 --> 26:00.320
Equality Clause.

26:00.760 --> 26:06.040
What that does is it disarms Copy Left entirely if you try to do proprietary relicensing.

26:06.040 --> 26:12.760
So what the clause says is if a different license is ever offered for these copyrights,

26:12.760 --> 26:19.440
then the entire Copy Left evaporates and all of it turns into a super permissive MIT-style

26:19.440 --> 26:21.520
license.

26:21.520 --> 26:26.480
I would love to see a Copy Left Equality Clause in an AGPL v4.

26:26.480 --> 26:30.200
Can you give your thoughts on that?

26:30.560 --> 26:36.640
I just wanted to ask for some clarification because I don't understand why you are co-ing

26:36.640 --> 26:41.360
AGPL submarine compared to submarine patents.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.360
So how?

26:42.360 --> 26:43.360
Is it from copyrighted?

26:43.360 --> 26:44.360
Wow, okay.

26:44.360 --> 26:48.360
It's always used like in a VC context where you have this open core type stuff and then

26:48.360 --> 26:52.360
at some point they come like, well, you might not be using...

26:52.360 --> 26:59.360
Or are you publishing this part of the code or you have these extra acknowledgments from

26:59.360 --> 27:03.360
the user and you can't...

27:03.360 --> 27:08.360
For certain types of libraries you can't provide those rights of...

27:08.360 --> 27:10.360
Clearly you violate all the licenses.

27:10.360 --> 27:13.360
Maybe you should just buy like...

27:13.360 --> 27:21.480
Okay, so maybe I will just quickly say that we are looking at different ways people are

27:21.520 --> 27:30.520
trying to add something on top of the GPL and we really want to address it one way or

27:30.520 --> 27:33.400
another.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.720
So yeah.

27:36.720 --> 27:37.720
Thank you.

27:37.720 --> 27:43.880
So without speculating on the intentions of John Marksouie, do you think it is conceivable

27:43.880 --> 27:50.880
for him to initiate legal action against Neo4j for the copyright that he presumably held

27:50.880 --> 27:56.360
in earlier versions which they are still reproducing?

27:56.360 --> 28:03.360
So as it turned out in my analysis, I didn't see any work that John Mark had actually upstreamed

28:03.360 --> 28:05.640
because he was more of a system integrator.

28:05.640 --> 28:09.840
So while there's a lot of people who did contribute, John Mark wasn't one of them.

28:09.840 --> 28:12.240
So I don't know if he actually has a claim or not.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.520
I just don't know.

28:14.520 --> 28:19.920
I didn't see his name in the Git log for the period where it would have been possible

28:19.960 --> 28:21.440
to do that.

28:21.440 --> 28:25.960
But there were a lot of people, I mean like 12 to 15, I guess that's not a lot, but there

28:25.960 --> 28:32.960
were 12 to 15 people that had given a patch that was non-trivial to Neo4j during the period.

28:33.240 --> 28:36.840
And those people I think would have a claim.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.720
It was really a question of resources.

28:38.720 --> 28:42.720
I suspect of trying to get in touch with them.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.200
I emailed a few of them.

28:44.200 --> 28:45.200
They didn't answer.

28:45.200 --> 28:51.520
I wouldn't be surprised if Neo4j has already bullied them either by demanding or offering

28:51.520 --> 28:58.520
money for a copyright assignment or CLA or simply just made them afraid.

28:58.720 --> 29:03.120
Everybody in that space who's done consulting around that code base is terrified because

29:03.120 --> 29:08.480
they're watching John Mark get sued and possibly have huge damages.

29:08.480 --> 29:14.000
And certainly he's spent a tremendous amount on legal fees already just defending himself.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.080
So I think everybody who's in that community is pretty terrified.

29:18.080 --> 29:21.360
I'd like to offer a contrasting opinion on the utility of a GPL v3.

29:21.360 --> 29:26.080
In particular it's used by Signal for its open source software.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.480
And Signal of course is a non-profit.

29:28.480 --> 29:31.160
It's very lucky that it has the funding in order to be able to do that.

29:31.160 --> 29:35.040
But in particular what that requires is that for example corporations like Facebook who

29:35.040 --> 29:38.800
may want to use Signal are actually required to contribute their contributions back even

29:38.800 --> 29:42.800
if they end up using it over a server which allows them to circumvent for example the traditional

29:42.800 --> 29:43.600
GPL.

29:43.680 --> 29:46.640
So I'd like to just make sure that that's kind of in the air as well when we talk about

29:46.640 --> 29:48.080
uses of the A GPL.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.360
Although of course these sorts of restrictions can be used for positive or negative as well.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.400
I wanted to put that I think there was a useful discussion kind of going on here so I don't

29:54.400 --> 29:56.400
want to derail that.

29:56.400 --> 30:21.360
Sorry I kind of just wanted to add on to you just say that this problem that you're discussing

30:21.520 --> 30:25.120
is a very rare problem but it's important.

30:25.120 --> 30:32.200
The reason you're giving it publicity is because you want to make sure that it doesn't happen

30:32.200 --> 30:34.560
not to prevent it from spreading.

30:34.560 --> 30:39.600
It's a very rare problem that we don't want to spread further and I want to think that

30:39.600 --> 30:47.400
the same thing with the A GPL is the vast, vast majority of uses people are given their

30:47.400 --> 30:50.560
rights and freedoms and it works wonderfully.

30:50.960 --> 30:58.480
And so sometimes small problems get expanded because they're newsworthy, they're important,

30:58.480 --> 31:00.720
we don't want them to cause more problems.

31:00.720 --> 31:06.400
I don't know if you have any response to that, it's more of a comment than a question but

31:06.400 --> 31:08.400
would you agree I guess?

31:08.400 --> 31:18.760
Well yeah definitely we shouldn't forget about thousands and thousands of projects licensed

31:18.760 --> 31:20.760
under playing GPL.

31:20.760 --> 31:25.880
I agree with you Ian.

31:25.880 --> 31:30.880
If you look at just in terms of lines of code that are facing this issue, you're absolutely

31:30.880 --> 31:35.480
correct, there's not many lines of code in the world by percentage that are facing an

31:35.480 --> 31:38.680
issue of a further restriction being added that somebody is trying to remove.

31:38.680 --> 31:45.080
I think the reason I think it's more than just a publicity issue is, and it was a personal

31:45.120 --> 31:52.080
experience sitting in the courtroom and watching this testimony go by and John Mark being

31:52.080 --> 31:59.320
who did everything right, he did everything that the FSF in its documents and in the license

31:59.320 --> 32:04.920
told him to do, he did everything our community intended when we designed this clause to go

32:04.920 --> 32:10.040
and do that and then to sit there and be told like basically you're a thief, you're a DMCA

32:10.040 --> 32:18.400
violator, you ripped off Neo4j, all these sorts of things and then be facing in the next couple

32:18.400 --> 32:22.160
of weeks possibly huge damages.

32:22.160 --> 32:25.680
I'm kind of hoping like the judge will do something silly like be like well we find

32:25.680 --> 32:29.200
$100 of damages or something like that, it would be great if that happens, I'm not sure

32:29.200 --> 32:36.240
what he's going to do but they've asked for millions and so and John has already spent

32:36.320 --> 32:39.520
a tremendous amount of legal fees and he doesn't know how to, I'll be frank with you

32:39.520 --> 32:42.840
all, I've talked a lot with him, he doesn't know how to pay for the appeal at this point

32:42.840 --> 32:48.400
and so he's very worried about it because he wants to appeal and he really, I spent

32:48.400 --> 32:52.920
a lot of time with him over the last six months as I was doing the expert report and then

32:52.920 --> 32:59.920
going out for the trial and he's exactly the kind of small business person that is like

33:00.720 --> 33:03.920
the ideal in my mind of what free software consultants should be.

33:03.920 --> 33:08.120
He took a bunch of code including Neo4j, lots of free software stuff, integrated, made a

33:08.120 --> 33:13.160
great solution for the IRS which is actually a system to catch tax cheats as it turns out,

33:13.160 --> 33:18.880
it's kind of like this graph database of like all the tax returns in the US and figure out

33:18.880 --> 33:24.000
who's cheating so they know who to audit which if you don't like tax authorities maybe that

33:24.000 --> 33:31.000
doesn't sound so great but he's doing something that is a useful tool for his client and to

33:31.160 --> 33:35.480
have this come back at him. There was another point in the trial where it was so telling

33:35.480 --> 33:41.320
where, I just learned this because of the trial, apparently it's illegal in the US

33:41.320 --> 33:47.240
to volunteer for, if you're a contractor to the government to volunteer your time to the

33:47.240 --> 33:51.560
government, I guess it's considered like a weird form of bribery, like you're like, oh

33:51.560 --> 33:55.880
I'll give you services for free and so they got him cornered on the stand where they were

33:55.960 --> 34:01.400
like, did you ever receive a call from the IRS for support on Neo4j in the evening and

34:01.400 --> 34:06.200
like he's a gas and like did you give him that support? He said, well yeah my client called

34:06.200 --> 34:10.200
me and the software wasn't working so I fixed it. He's like, did you build him for that time?

34:10.200 --> 34:15.320
And he was like, I think maybe I didn't? And like, were you aware that that's illegal under

34:15.320 --> 34:20.520
government contract rules? And he's like, well yeah but he's like, did you, so you're admitting

34:20.520 --> 34:26.280
here that you committed this thing you're not supposed to do? And he's like, I guess so,

34:27.080 --> 34:31.080
I just a software consultant and when my client calls me I get it done and I figure out the

34:31.080 --> 34:38.360
billing later. But it looks so foolish that they were like just grilling him, this defense

34:38.360 --> 34:42.840
attorney or prosecuting attorney was grilling him over this question when all he was trying

34:42.840 --> 34:47.000
to do was make software work for his client. And that's what free software in my mind is

34:47.000 --> 34:50.680
totally about, like having all the source code and being able to do what you need to do

34:50.680 --> 34:54.840
to make people's problems be solved. And Neo4j's attitude is he shouldn't have been doing that.

34:54.840 --> 35:00.040
What he should have been doing is selling Neo4j proprietary license to the IRS. And he didn't

35:00.040 --> 35:06.360
do that and since he didn't do that he's a bad person. And so watching that was a very heart

35:06.360 --> 35:10.920
wrenching thing for me and that's why I just personally am so worried about how this is gone.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.400
Two quick questions and then we'll wrap up.

35:15.240 --> 35:24.040
So did he relied on third party claims? So if there were outside copyright holders he could

35:24.040 --> 35:31.640
basically use the same argument as in Versata and Simple Bear if I remind the correct president.

35:31.640 --> 35:40.360
So he could basically say I have the third party claim that I have a pure HGPL license

35:40.360 --> 35:44.680
because the Copy Left Clause in HGPLs as you have to license is under this term.

35:47.960 --> 35:53.480
Yeah, his attorneys did argue that and that was in fact a part of the summary judgment decision

35:53.480 --> 35:57.640
was that in fact this clause is not operative, is basically what the ruling holds.

36:00.280 --> 36:06.360
So two fairly quick questions. One is probably a bit speculative but do you think this is why

36:06.360 --> 36:12.920
we haven't seen any community Neo4j and MongoDB forks? Do you think forks are being bullied by

36:12.920 --> 36:17.480
the companies? Because I was wondering that like how is nobody forking that, right? And the second

36:17.480 --> 36:23.000
thing is what happened to Copy Left Next? Is that still a thing? Like I'm, is that a touchy issue

36:23.000 --> 36:25.960
due to the redhead affiliation as well? So I'm just wondering.

36:26.920 --> 36:43.000
Yeah, I probably could have. Yeah, so maybe I could have told more clearly that I don't want to

36:43.000 --> 36:49.960
comment on any particular project or company but yeah, so I won't.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.960
Yeah.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.560
On the Neo4j issue, definitely read, because there was another court case with Neo4j which was

37:01.560 --> 37:08.920
Neo4j versus Graff Foundation. And the Graff Foundation does publish a fork of Neo4j,

37:08.920 --> 37:16.920
but I urge you to read the stipulated judgment in that case because it is disturbing and heart

37:16.920 --> 37:22.120
wrenching. And I think it speaks to your question very closely. As for Copy Left Next,

37:23.240 --> 37:25.480
it's a to it problem and I'll get to it.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.400
All right, let's thank Bradley.
