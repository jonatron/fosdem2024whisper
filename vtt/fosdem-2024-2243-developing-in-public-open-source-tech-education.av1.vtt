WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.760
Hi everyone, my name is Hermann, Benji, I come from Venezuela and I'm the founder of

00:12.760 --> 00:17.360
Code Your Future.

00:17.360 --> 00:26.880
Code Your Future is a non-profit organization that trains refugees, asylum seekers, forced

00:26.880 --> 00:32.840
migrants and people of low income backgrounds in programming skills and help them start

00:32.840 --> 00:35.680
a career in tech.

00:35.680 --> 00:40.520
Today I'm going to tell you a little bit our story and what we're doing with open source

00:40.520 --> 00:48.240
and creating one of the most inclusive platforms to contribute to curriculum development.

00:48.240 --> 00:52.400
But before that I want to show you a video, but you know we're small groups so we're going

00:52.960 --> 00:55.760
to try to do this session interactive.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.880
So we're going to talk.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.400
Are you ready for that?

01:00.400 --> 01:03.080
Yeah?

01:03.080 --> 01:10.320
So I'm going to start with a video that we normally share with our COFers when they join

01:10.320 --> 01:12.160
to start the training program.

01:12.160 --> 01:19.880
It's a video that we created with the community and the voice is from our students.

01:19.880 --> 01:26.880
We don't know if the sound's going to work, but let's give it a go.

01:26.880 --> 01:34.560
Code Your Future, in this video we will learn how Code Your Future works, how it is different

01:34.560 --> 01:39.160
and how you might want to change your expectations.

01:39.160 --> 01:46.160
Code Your Future is a majority minority community of adults and together we are powerful.

01:47.160 --> 01:55.160
Everyone has some kind of struggle in our community and everyone also has help they

01:55.160 --> 01:57.160
can get to others.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.160
Everyone is wanted and needed.

02:00.160 --> 02:04.160
Together we can solve many problems.

02:04.160 --> 02:08.160
We are not a school of students and teachers.

02:08.160 --> 02:14.160
We are professionals collaborating to achieve realistic practical goals.

02:16.160 --> 02:20.160
CYF is not an accredited institution.

02:20.160 --> 02:26.160
We can't use our certificate to get a job without actually learning coding.

02:26.160 --> 02:36.160
All we can do is learn to build great software and we can do this to employ our client by

02:36.160 --> 02:42.160
actually building that great software.

02:42.160 --> 02:46.160
At CYF we don't tell you what you can do.

02:46.160 --> 02:49.160
You're not here to judge your potential.

02:49.160 --> 02:51.160
We only look at what you have done.

02:51.160 --> 02:54.160
We make decisions based on evidence.

02:54.160 --> 02:58.160
You have to rebuild things and you have to show us.

02:58.160 --> 03:04.160
Nobody will allow you to do your coursework or tell you off for not coming to class.

03:04.160 --> 03:08.160
If you don't do your work your reward will be your own failure.

03:08.160 --> 03:12.160
So you're free to make bad decisions.

03:12.160 --> 03:18.160
You are an adult in charge of it all.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.160
And so is everyone else.

03:21.160 --> 03:26.160
Everyone at CYF is a volunteer and we are all choosing to work together.

03:26.160 --> 03:29.160
Everything has been created by a volunteer.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.160
We sort of problem and try to solve it.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.160
There's nobody coming to save us.

03:34.160 --> 03:39.160
We are here and we are saving ourselves.

03:39.160 --> 03:44.160
CYF grads come from many different businesses and go to many different jobs.

03:44.160 --> 03:49.160
We are here to support you to get a job you want and a life you want.

03:49.160 --> 03:58.160
We know that with hard work, honesty, kindness and challenge you can get there.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.160
Don't sit around waiting to be taught things or complaining that you haven't been taught enough.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.160
Build your own projects.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.160
Find ideas that motivate you.

04:08.160 --> 04:11.160
Fall in groups and work together.

04:11.160 --> 04:14.160
Don't wait around. Try things.

04:14.160 --> 04:22.160
At Culture Feature the only failure is the failure to try it.

04:22.160 --> 04:31.160
You have this year to change your life with a huge hope for two forwards.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.160
Seize the opportunity.

04:34.160 --> 04:46.160
It's your life and you can change it at Culture Feature.

04:46.160 --> 04:50.160
Okay, that's it. Thank you very much.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.160
This is an intro to our organization.

04:53.160 --> 04:58.160
I get a little bit emotional when I see it because it really puts together a lot of who we are,

04:58.160 --> 05:03.160
what we do and how we do it, what we have been doing over the last seven years.

05:03.160 --> 05:08.160
I'm going to start by telling you a little bit of my background.

05:08.160 --> 05:14.160
If you're interested in knowing, is this sounds interesting like you want to keep hearing about it?

05:14.160 --> 05:16.160
Thank you.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.160
It's good to know.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.160
No, no.

05:21.160 --> 05:25.160
Okay, so as I said, I'm from Venezuela.

05:25.160 --> 05:31.160
The back story, sometimes when people hear about Culture Feature and they come to me,

05:31.160 --> 05:35.160
you know, you found the Culture Feature, tell me what is the story, how did it come, how did you do it,

05:35.160 --> 05:38.160
what was your inspiration, what is the inspiration?

05:38.160 --> 05:44.160
I think I summarized everything in these two areas, migration and on fairness.

05:44.160 --> 05:51.160
I spent pretty much more than half of my life abroad traveling in different places.

05:51.160 --> 05:57.160
And I started in the tech industry, had a great, you know, a good job,

05:57.160 --> 06:01.160
and had a wonderful experience learning and growing,

06:01.160 --> 06:07.160
but I was always a little bit touched by the on fairness, the inequality, the inequity in this world,

06:07.160 --> 06:12.160
how, why some people have access to so much opportunities and others,

06:12.160 --> 06:18.160
not just because they happen to be born in a different place and in the wrong country,

06:18.160 --> 06:25.160
by the wrong autocrats, and that was something that just kept nagging me for a very long time.

06:25.160 --> 06:33.160
And at some point it was just unbearable to kind of just keep doing the same thing.

06:33.160 --> 06:43.160
And above all is that when I was a child, you know, my country was a pretty stable, relatively safe place.

06:43.160 --> 06:49.160
This is my home country, it's in the mountains in Latin America, in the Andes,

06:49.160 --> 06:55.160
and it wasn't the richest place, but it was okay.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.160
I had a great childhood, I was playing in the streets with children,

06:59.160 --> 07:05.160
and I never thought that the country was going to change so dramatically.

07:05.160 --> 07:10.160
No one ever, when I was a child, imagined that the country was going to become this.

07:10.160 --> 07:20.160
Mass migration in Venezuela is one, had one of the biggest immigrants from any country.

07:20.160 --> 07:25.160
It's like millions of people have left the country over the last 10, 15 years.

07:25.160 --> 07:28.160
It's completely different to my childhood.

07:28.160 --> 07:35.160
These are people that a few years ago literally started walking, leaving the country,

07:35.160 --> 07:37.160
because that was the only chance.

07:37.160 --> 07:40.160
So this is the concept of a forced migrant.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.160
You don't want to leave, but you feel you have to.

07:43.160 --> 07:47.160
If you want to look for safety, if you look for other opportunities,

07:47.160 --> 07:50.160
because it's just so bad going on there.

07:50.160 --> 07:56.160
And then later on over the years, I started realizing that this story is actually overlapping

07:56.160 --> 07:59.160
with many other stories of what was happening.

07:59.160 --> 08:05.160
I'm sure all of you have heard about the war in Syria from a few years ago,

08:05.160 --> 08:09.160
and the migratory crisis that emerged from there.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.160
Well, people in Syria, they will tell you that when they were children,

08:12.160 --> 08:16.160
they also never imagined that the country was going to end up being like this.

08:16.160 --> 08:20.160
That they were going to start migrating and walking across,

08:20.160 --> 08:24.160
but they actually also hosting refugees from other places.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.160
It was a completely different story.

08:26.160 --> 08:34.160
And it's this change of reality that made me think a lot about the world.

08:34.160 --> 08:43.160
And when I decided to quit my safe job in tech and start looking for funding something else,

08:43.160 --> 08:46.160
well, at the beginning it was living on an overlap,

08:46.160 --> 08:49.160
but I entered this other world.

08:49.160 --> 08:55.160
The world of refugees and asylum seekers, the world of long-term unemployment,

08:55.160 --> 09:00.160
the world of unsafety, where you don't know where people have homes,

09:00.160 --> 09:03.160
or if you're going to keep the same place for a while.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.160
It felt that it was literally a parallel universe,

09:06.160 --> 09:11.160
that we live in certain reality and then the others are living in another one,

09:11.160 --> 09:13.160
and we rarely overlap.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.160
We rarely know what's the reality in that other place.

09:16.160 --> 09:20.160
We hear about it, we see it in the news, we see some statistics here and there,

09:20.160 --> 09:25.160
but do we really know that many people that live in those circumstances?

09:25.160 --> 09:34.160
And all of that is in contrast with this wonderful world that we live in tech,

09:34.160 --> 09:43.160
with so many advances, so many developments, so sophisticated technologies like this one.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.160
Can anyone recognize where this comes from?

09:46.160 --> 09:50.160
What device took this image?

09:50.160 --> 09:52.160
Sorry?

09:52.160 --> 09:54.160
Yes.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.160
The web space telescope, you know, a state of the art.

09:58.160 --> 10:09.160
This is capturing a constellation from one of the oldest pieces of light that exist in the universe.

10:09.160 --> 10:12.160
It's more than 13 billion years old.

10:12.160 --> 10:14.160
This is a time machine.

10:14.160 --> 10:17.160
It's looking back to the origins of the universe.

10:17.160 --> 10:22.160
It's only between 200 or 400 million years after the Big Bang.

10:22.160 --> 10:31.160
And we have this technology, and we can enjoy this beauty, this wonderful images

10:31.160 --> 10:34.160
that tell you this immensity that is out there.

10:34.160 --> 10:38.160
And we have these beautiful things happening,

10:38.160 --> 10:42.160
and I want us to just like see it for a little bit.

10:42.160 --> 10:47.160
Isn't that beautiful?

10:47.160 --> 10:52.160
They call this the nursery of stars,

10:52.160 --> 11:00.160
because it's a constellation of the formation of the stars over hundreds of millions of years.

11:00.160 --> 11:07.160
But all this beauty is contrasted with another reality.

11:07.160 --> 11:14.160
And I want someone that is brave enough or two people to start explaining what it is.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.160
What are these numbers?

11:17.160 --> 11:25.160
Anyone guesses?

11:25.160 --> 11:27.160
You can try this.

11:27.160 --> 11:29.160
No, it's okay. We can just try.

11:29.160 --> 11:34.160
A person out of 78 has to migrate from his own country.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.160
That's correct.

11:36.160 --> 11:40.160
One in 78 people in the world is a forced migrant.

11:40.160 --> 11:45.160
And that number keeps, the ratio keeps getting worse and worse.

11:45.160 --> 11:54.160
One in 78, forced migrant.

11:54.160 --> 12:02.160
10% of the worldwide wealth is detained by, no, sorry,

12:02.160 --> 12:07.160
detains 7600 of the wealth.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.160
I'm not sure if I was right.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.160
Yeah, that's correct.

12:12.160 --> 12:21.160
10% of the population in the world owns 76% of the wealth.

12:21.160 --> 12:25.160
And I checked this million times, and I just couldn't believe it.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.160
What else? Any other one?

12:28.160 --> 12:32.160
Sorry?

12:32.160 --> 12:36.160
Is it too low? Do you want it to be?

12:36.160 --> 12:38.160
Well, it's bad enough.

12:38.160 --> 12:43.160
What else?

12:43.160 --> 12:49.160
Yeah, the 10% produced nearly half of all the CO2 emissions.

12:49.160 --> 12:52.160
And then on the flip side,

12:52.160 --> 12:59.160
How are 50% keeping 2% of the income?

12:59.160 --> 13:00.160
Thank you.

13:00.160 --> 13:05.160
And are responsible for 12% of the CO2 consumption.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.160
Yeah, exactly.

13:06.160 --> 13:13.160
So these to me was the best representation of inequality in the world.

13:13.160 --> 13:18.160
When we're talking about wealth and pollution,

13:18.160 --> 13:21.160
these are the two extremes you have also, like, you know,

13:21.160 --> 13:24.160
very huge numbers when we're talking just about 1%.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.160
It's a big, big challenge.

13:26.160 --> 13:31.160
Do you think you can change something with your project?

13:31.160 --> 13:35.160
I mean, a bit of a tree bud in my opinion.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.160
Okay, tell me about it.

13:37.160 --> 13:42.160
A lot of companies already talk about inclusion,

13:42.160 --> 13:47.160
and they have like websites, and like, there's a lot of discrimination.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.160
But I'm not sure you're going to change that.

13:50.160 --> 13:53.160
How can you have impact on that?

13:53.160 --> 13:55.160
Thank you very much for the prompt.

13:55.160 --> 13:56.160
That's very good.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.160
We're going to talk about this.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.160
Yeah, we're going to talk exactly about that.

14:00.160 --> 14:09.160
So I want to know from the audience if you would be interested

14:09.160 --> 14:12.160
in helping changing people's lives.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.160
Raise your hand if you are.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.160
Great, thank you.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.160
That's great.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.160
And you don't have to say, I don't want to.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.160
The vast majority of people, they're like, you know, it's okay.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.160
My life is complicated enough, and that's okay.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.160
Come in, welcome.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.160
No, no, don't worry.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.160
Come, welcome, welcome, welcome.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.160
Welcome.

14:35.160 --> 14:39.160
The question is how, right?

14:39.160 --> 14:43.160
You were saying, is it realistic?

14:43.160 --> 14:44.160
Is it possible, right?

14:44.160 --> 14:47.160
Come in, come in.

14:47.160 --> 14:49.160
How?

14:49.160 --> 14:50.160
Come in, please.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.160
Do you want to sit?

14:51.160 --> 14:54.160
Don't worry, don't worry about it.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.160
How?

14:55.160 --> 15:00.160
So let's explore that idea, that concern a little bit.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.160
How?

15:01.160 --> 15:02.160
How could that be?

15:02.160 --> 15:03.160
What could we do?

15:03.160 --> 15:05.160
Any ideas?

15:05.160 --> 15:07.160
We want to change a little bit.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.160
We want to do something, small, tiny contribution.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.160
What can we do?

15:10.160 --> 15:17.160
Someone that hasn't said anything?

15:17.160 --> 15:21.160
No?

15:21.160 --> 15:25.160
Small steps, just teach one and one teach another, and another teach another.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.160
Like small things.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.160
Training.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.160
Yeah.

15:29.160 --> 15:30.160
Thank you.

15:30.160 --> 15:34.160
One person training another one.

15:34.160 --> 15:36.160
Information.

15:36.160 --> 15:43.160
If the media can talk about all of these problems, it would just be a huge step.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.160
Okay.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.160
Awareness.

15:45.160 --> 15:47.160
We want to keep talking about these things.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.160
Uh-huh.

15:50.160 --> 15:58.160
Maybe as a response to your comment, I don't know if it is, well, probably, well, at least

15:58.160 --> 16:03.160
if I'm considering how the world in, from my point of view has developed, I do know

16:04.160 --> 16:09.160
not believe that there will be one change, one technology, what I don't know,

16:09.160 --> 16:14.160
fusion, for instance, which solves all energy crisis problems.

16:14.160 --> 16:23.160
And this will also serve to, um, to ensure that we, that there won't be poor people

16:23.160 --> 16:28.160
anymore because we are living in a highly inequity, uh, in equal world.

16:28.160 --> 16:34.160
But, um, maybe it helps at least to, uh, like you said, with small steps in your

16:34.160 --> 16:36.160
own environment where you can make impact.

16:36.160 --> 16:41.160
So what you're saying, if I can summarize this, there's no one solution that feeds

16:41.160 --> 16:42.160
all.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.160
There's no one magic wand that is going to solve all of this.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.160
Absolutely, right?

16:46.160 --> 16:49.160
And you know, you're, you're good to say, hey, is this, is this a thing?

16:49.160 --> 16:50.160
Is this possible?

16:50.160 --> 16:57.160
Now I would like us to spend one or two more minutes doing something that is extremely

16:57.160 --> 17:02.160
unusual in these conferences, which is let's talk to each other.

17:02.160 --> 17:07.160
So let's look at your neighbors and then just talk for one to a minute.

17:07.160 --> 17:11.160
What other ideas would you have to actually bring some tangible?

17:11.160 --> 17:13.160
Are you, do you, do you feel comfortable?

17:13.160 --> 17:15.160
Is that okay?

17:15.160 --> 17:16.160
Let's explore that.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.160
Let's, let's talk, you know, we're a small audience.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.160
Let's talk and they say, how else can we do these things?

17:21.160 --> 17:22.160
What can we do?

17:27.160 --> 17:28.160
Okay.

17:28.160 --> 17:29.160
Okay.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.160
Okay.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.160
Okay.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.160
Okay.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.160
Okay.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.160
Okay.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.160
Okay.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.160
Okay.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.160
Okay.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.160
Okay.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.160
Okay.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.160
Okay.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.160
Okay.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.160
Okay.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.160
Okay.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.160
Okay.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.160
Okay.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.160
Okay.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.160
Okay.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.160
Okay.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.160
Okay.

17:49.160 --> 17:50.160
Okay.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.160
Okay.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.160
Okay.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.160
Okay.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.160
Okay.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.160
Okay.

17:55.160 --> 17:56.160
Okay.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.160
Okay.

18:17.160 --> 18:22.160
Do, do you guys want to, do you want to share?

18:26.160 --> 18:29.840
Well, just ideas, just to spark ideas.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.840
No?

18:30.840 --> 18:31.440
Just think.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.520
We're like brainstorming.

18:36.480 --> 18:36.980
OK.

18:36.980 --> 18:37.480
OK.

18:56.160 --> 19:07.360
Brilliant.

19:07.360 --> 19:08.480
Thank you very much.

19:12.480 --> 19:13.480
Thank you very much.

19:13.480 --> 19:16.920
Thank you so much for being so kind and speaking

19:16.920 --> 19:19.600
to each other and sharing.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.160
We have 10 minutes left, so let's carry on.

19:23.240 --> 19:28.040
So as you were saying, there is like,

19:28.040 --> 19:31.560
it's a complex topic, but we've been involved for seven years

19:31.560 --> 19:32.520
working in this area.

19:32.520 --> 19:37.280
So we have maybe a little contribution to make here.

19:37.280 --> 19:39.400
One thing that I just want to highlight,

19:39.400 --> 19:42.840
hell is paved with good intentions.

19:42.840 --> 19:45.720
This is something that I learned, and I saw.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.760
There's a lot of people that we want to do good,

19:49.760 --> 19:53.520
but it's really hard to actually do it,

19:53.520 --> 19:57.320
not only just to action it, but actually to have the impact

19:57.320 --> 19:58.920
that we're trying to do.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.680
A lot of the times, the good intentions

20:00.680 --> 20:03.520
can lead to really bad consequences.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.360
And that's something that is very important to analyze

20:06.360 --> 20:08.280
in every single aspect.

20:08.280 --> 20:13.160
In a decent case scenario, you actually don't manage to help.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.880
But in a really bad scenario, you actually cost more harm.

20:16.880 --> 20:21.880
One of the areas that for me has been a really good framework

20:21.880 --> 20:25.480
to understand is the mesoherarchy of needs,

20:25.480 --> 20:28.480
to understand, OK, when we're trying to make impact

20:28.480 --> 20:33.480
in a person's life, we kind of look at what it is

20:33.480 --> 20:34.880
that we're trying to do.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.880
And in the first level, we have the physiological needs.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.880
When people need food, air, water, for example,

20:40.880 --> 20:43.880
when there's like big emergencies like earthquakes,

20:43.880 --> 20:45.880
and there's this horrible words that are happening,

20:45.880 --> 20:48.880
like we know that, OK, we need to help people in these areas.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.880
It's very clear.

20:49.880 --> 20:53.880
It's very, you know, people really understand that intuitively.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.880
But then when we try to do something else,

20:56.880 --> 21:00.880
it becomes a little bit more complex, yeah, more difficult.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.880
It's like, OK, people need more than that.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.880
It's not enough to just like have the food and the air

21:06.880 --> 21:08.880
and the water, we need more.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.880
And one of those areas is we need to feel secure.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.880
We need to feel, you know, that, for example,

21:15.880 --> 21:17.880
when we have a job and we have employment,

21:17.880 --> 21:19.880
we feel like a little bit safer.

21:19.880 --> 21:23.880
We feel like, you know, and also when we start connecting

21:23.880 --> 21:26.880
with others, when we have a sense of belonging,

21:26.880 --> 21:30.880
when we also believe in ourselves and we have self-esteem,

21:30.880 --> 21:33.880
and finally, when we actually keep learning

21:33.880 --> 21:35.880
and keep growing, we actualize ourselves.

21:35.880 --> 21:39.880
All these are important, and all of these are interventions

21:39.880 --> 21:40.880
that we can do.

21:40.880 --> 21:43.880
When we think on a project, we think we're more or less

21:43.880 --> 21:46.880
in which area we're trying to make a difference.

21:46.880 --> 21:53.880
And what we decided in Code Your Future was that our goal

21:53.880 --> 21:57.880
was to launch careers, was to going to help people

21:57.880 --> 22:00.880
start a career in tech.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.880
We're not going to help anyone.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.880
We're going to help those that need it the most,

22:05.880 --> 22:08.880
those that you saw in those statistics,

22:08.880 --> 22:11.880
people that were forced migrants,

22:11.880 --> 22:13.880
that suddenly arrived in a new country

22:13.880 --> 22:16.880
and had no connections and no jobs and no way to know

22:16.880 --> 22:18.880
how it was working.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.880
And then we saw that tech was a great place to be

22:21.880 --> 22:25.880
because it's pretty democratizing.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.880
If you know the skills, if you have the skills,

22:28.880 --> 22:31.880
then you can actually get a job.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.880
And that's what we started working on.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.880
But then later we realized, well,

22:36.880 --> 22:38.880
it's actually not just about this.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.880
Because actually, yes, you can, you know,

22:40.880 --> 22:42.880
you say, I'm going to try someone get a job.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.880
But actually, in order to get a job, people have to be

22:44.880 --> 22:45.880
skilled.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.880
But in order to be skilled, people need to also feel safe

22:48.880 --> 22:50.880
and a sense of connection.

22:50.880 --> 22:55.880
So our community of professionals, the old volunteers,

22:55.880 --> 22:58.880
and they're all coming to share, give their skills,

22:58.880 --> 23:02.880
the old people like yourselves, normal people,

23:02.880 --> 23:07.880
they come and they created that sense, that community

23:07.880 --> 23:09.880
and that growth.

23:09.880 --> 23:12.880
And then it goes back to the question, does this work?

23:12.880 --> 23:14.880
Does it actually make a difference?

23:14.880 --> 23:17.880
And we did measure it because we said we're going to do

23:17.880 --> 23:19.880
a training, let's organize a training that's all very nice,

23:19.880 --> 23:20.880
very exciting.

23:20.880 --> 23:23.880
We started like doing web development,

23:23.880 --> 23:25.880
the full stack JavaScript.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.880
But then that's not enough.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.880
Like that is something interesting,

23:29.880 --> 23:31.880
but there's much more than this.

23:31.880 --> 23:36.880
The real part that mattered was getting people to get jobs.

23:36.880 --> 23:39.880
And we were lucky to see from the very first class,

23:39.880 --> 23:44.880
people getting jobs, like Centaur, refugee from Ethiopia,

23:44.880 --> 23:48.880
was unemployed long term for many, many years,

23:48.880 --> 23:51.880
went through the program, and now he's working at the

23:51.880 --> 23:53.880
Financial Times.

23:53.880 --> 23:57.880
Or Ahmed, a refugee from Syria, his dream was to go to

23:57.880 --> 24:01.880
university, but the war interrupted all of that.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.880
Come, please, come in, come in.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.880
The war interrupted it, and he was completely lost.

24:06.880 --> 24:09.880
He never went to university, but he always wanted to be

24:09.880 --> 24:10.880
a developer.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.880
He joined Code of Future, and a year later,

24:13.880 --> 24:17.880
he was having his first job as a developer.

24:17.880 --> 24:23.880
And finally, Ansi, who is from India, had given birth

24:23.880 --> 24:26.880
just four months before the program started,

24:26.880 --> 24:29.880
had a tiny, tiny baby with her.

24:29.880 --> 24:33.880
She had not done any employment for five years,

24:33.880 --> 24:37.880
was completely alone, feel disconnected, very shy,

24:37.880 --> 24:40.880
very low self-esteem, and went through the program.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.880
Please join us.

24:42.880 --> 24:48.880
And then, and she's a developer five years later.

24:48.880 --> 24:53.880
Now, is this going to change the huge numbers that we saw there?

24:53.880 --> 24:54.880
No, of course not.

24:54.880 --> 24:57.880
But it's just basically one person at the time,

24:57.880 --> 24:59.880
because every single person matters.

24:59.880 --> 25:01.880
Every single person makes a difference,

25:01.880 --> 25:04.880
and is like connecting and knowing that you see that journey

25:04.880 --> 25:06.880
of people getting into employment.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.880
It's a dream.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.880
These are some of the numbers that we have.

25:11.880 --> 25:14.880
Mass majority of people we work with are living below poverty

25:14.880 --> 25:18.880
line, mass majority are ethnic minorities.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.880
We have a huge range of ages.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.880
We have a great gender split,

25:23.880 --> 25:26.880
and above all, people are getting jobs.

25:26.880 --> 25:29.880
This is our ultimate measure of success.

25:29.880 --> 25:33.880
And over years, we have been diversifying.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.880
We have an open source curriculum development

25:36.880 --> 25:41.880
that Daniel that is here has helped organize for many years.

25:41.880 --> 25:45.880
We've been diversifying, getting into new areas of development.

25:45.880 --> 25:49.880
And we started like here, but then we just been growing.

25:49.880 --> 25:53.880
One of the last ones was an SRE program that we created together

25:53.880 --> 25:58.880
with Slack to help people pay them all the way from like no programming

25:58.880 --> 26:02.880
all the way to getting a system engineering job at Slack.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.880
We are doing this.

26:06.880 --> 26:13.880
And because we wanted to talk a little bit about our syllabus development,

26:13.880 --> 26:17.880
at the very beginning of the early years, we were very excited.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.880
We started developing our own curriculum and creating content.

26:21.880 --> 26:25.880
And we had this really long, long list of content.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.880
It was very good. We're very excited.

26:27.880 --> 26:32.880
But over the years, it became really hard to change, really hard to adapt.

26:32.880 --> 26:35.880
It was a little bit like at the beginning was, you know,

26:35.880 --> 26:38.880
we had these little blocks and they started growing.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.880
So at the beginning was like, okay, well, we have a block and we put another block.

26:41.880 --> 26:45.880
And then if we wanted to do a change, it was easier because there wasn't much content.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.880
We had to change one and then we put another one.

26:47.880 --> 26:53.880
But over time, we had like bigger, higher towers of content and information.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.880
It was really, really hard to change.

26:55.880 --> 26:58.880
And then at some point it was like this.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.880
We had this big thing.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.880
I was like, oh, Daniel would say, I think we need to change this part

27:03.880 --> 27:05.880
because it's not working.

27:05.880 --> 27:09.880
It's like, oh, well, but if we have to change this, we need to change so, so many things.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.880
So it become really, really difficult.

27:12.880 --> 27:18.880
And then we had to design a new curriculum paradigm and we just went in the open source mindset.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.880
How can we make as inclusive as possible?

27:21.880 --> 27:25.880
How can we allow as many people as possible to come and contribute?

27:25.880 --> 27:32.880
And we basically completely changed the way that we had the curriculum and we decided we're not going to have content.

27:32.880 --> 27:38.880
What we're going to do is basically point out to whatever content is out there.

27:38.880 --> 27:42.880
And then we have basically bits of information that can't live anywhere.

27:42.880 --> 27:49.880
And the content basically is just those pointers that say where those bits of information are.

27:49.880 --> 27:52.880
So if we want to change something, we just rearrange it.

27:52.880 --> 27:58.880
And if we want to move from one to the other, what we have to do is just point it out the direction.

27:58.880 --> 28:04.880
So our curriculum, instead of these pages and pages, longs of text that becomes really updated,

28:04.880 --> 28:08.880
and it looks like this, this is our curriculum.

28:08.880 --> 28:16.880
So if you're interested in knowing more, join our open source curriculum development.

28:16.880 --> 28:19.880
Thank you very much for your time. It's been a pleasure talking to you.

28:19.880 --> 28:22.880
This is Code Your Future. And we're here in the sun.

28:22.880 --> 28:25.880
Thank you. Thank you so much.
