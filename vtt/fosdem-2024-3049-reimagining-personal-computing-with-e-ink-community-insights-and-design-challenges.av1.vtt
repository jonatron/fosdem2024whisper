WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:26.360
Hi everyone. Thank you for having me. Thank you for the organizers and volunteers that

00:26.360 --> 00:31.440
have been doing this event and all the other ones as well. I appreciate it. So yeah, so

00:31.440 --> 00:37.480
my name is Alexander Soto or please just call me Alex. I'm the founder of Modus. So just

00:37.480 --> 00:44.720
a bit of a backstory. In 2021 at the height of the pandemic, my bedroom transformed into

00:44.720 --> 00:51.920
a workspace. So I was spending most of my time from the morning to the night just in

00:51.920 --> 00:59.280
front of a computer, right? So using the computer and sort of battling this distraction,

00:59.280 --> 01:05.720
refocusing and then trying to get back into my work. And you know, the same tool that I have

01:05.720 --> 01:10.120
to use for work is also the same tool that I'm using for like leisure, for entertainment,

01:10.120 --> 01:16.120
and sort of this is kind of what brought about the idea of being able to or trying to re-imagine

01:16.440 --> 01:23.280
what would it look like to have computing that is calm, inclusive and humane. So at Modus,

01:23.280 --> 01:29.520
we're kind of reimagining personal computing with focus on creating calm and inclusive

01:29.520 --> 01:35.680
and humane computing. And we're doing that by creating a high refresh rate electrophoretic

01:35.680 --> 01:42.120
display controller. In the slide that's uploaded, we have videos where you can take a look at that.

01:42.560 --> 01:47.560
I also have our prototype here. So if you see me or if you want to try it out, I'd be happy to

01:47.560 --> 01:54.560
demo it so people can check it out. And this wouldn't be possible without the team. So this is

01:54.560 --> 02:01.280
really the team that's turning this vision into a reality. Wenting or Zephyre has led the development

02:01.280 --> 02:05.960
of our electrophoretic display controller. Brody, who's done amazing work sort of like

02:05.960 --> 02:11.400
CAD and manufacturing for our paper monitor chassis. And also Michael, who have had many

02:11.440 --> 02:16.520
conversations of what the possible software architecture and sort of stuff would look like.

02:16.520 --> 02:24.000
And last but not least, I want to thank the community really. We did a community survey. We had

02:24.000 --> 02:29.920
about 3,000 people fill out the community survey. We had about 300 different contributors and people

02:29.920 --> 02:35.240
who are interested in joining our pilot program, over 5,000 people in our mailing list, and a

02:35.280 --> 02:41.920
special thanks to Nelnet. We were working on a prototype. We're getting close. But we needed

02:41.920 --> 02:47.680
some support and Nelnet really, we're a Nelnet sponsored project. So really extended thank you

02:47.680 --> 02:53.760
for your support. If you haven't, please check them out. They're amazing. And a little bit about

02:53.760 --> 03:01.320
that survey. Oh, a little jump. Sorry. A little bit about that survey. So from the survey, there

03:01.400 --> 03:07.080
were multiple responses that were allowed. We had about 3000 people who filled that out. And some

03:07.080 --> 03:13.160
of the most popular use cases of why people want to use E-ink were reading, writing, coding, and

03:13.160 --> 03:19.800
just in general, be able to do it for a focused work. Not too surprising, but from the survey,

03:19.800 --> 03:27.080
what I learned a lot were from the feedback. So I think for me, I was also, what I experienced,

03:27.160 --> 03:35.240
just being focused, being distracted, refocusing. There were other people as well that shared

03:35.240 --> 03:38.680
similar concerns just from this quote, you know, I lose hours and days and weeks of my life,

03:39.400 --> 03:42.920
getting sucked down rabbit holes. I'm not so sure who hasn't experienced that before.

03:43.880 --> 03:48.040
In this room at least. And, you know, just with entertainment and content, missing deadlines,

03:48.040 --> 03:53.320
and then other people expressed concerns about our eye strain and just accessibility.

03:53.960 --> 03:59.240
Other folks who have been using commuter, you know, since they were a young age and have tried to

03:59.240 --> 04:06.600
look at other solutions between, what are the examples that they gave? Well, using different

04:06.600 --> 04:12.680
solutions that are available and still not having really any success. So I've read each one of the

04:12.680 --> 04:18.440
comments of all the feedback that I got. And there's some overarching like patterns and themes. So

04:18.440 --> 04:22.600
there's this one, there's a desire for living a more balanced digital life. So reducing your

04:22.600 --> 04:28.120
screen time on social media, entertainment, be able to kind of like unplug and be able to be

04:28.120 --> 04:35.400
outdoors. Oh, and I connected online. Be able to connect, be outdoors and also being a more

04:35.400 --> 04:40.440
less visually stimulating environment and kind of reducing digital clutter. So that's like one

04:40.440 --> 04:46.600
particular group. The other group where I learned more about is just people experience eye fatigue

04:46.600 --> 04:52.200
and strain, but also very specific health issues, people experiencing myopia, epilepsy,

04:52.200 --> 04:58.520
some level of light sensitivity, headaches, migraine, traumatic brain injury. And I think one

04:59.800 --> 05:05.400
feedback or comment that's been engraved in my mind was an engineer who was writing or completing

05:05.400 --> 05:10.840
the survey on behalf of his wife because she had epilepsy or has epilepsy. And it's tried all the

05:10.840 --> 05:17.560
existing solutions and they weren't working. So that's like one specific comment or feedback

05:17.560 --> 05:25.480
that's engraved in my mind. So Cat Holmes is the author of a mismatch how inclusion shapes

05:25.480 --> 05:32.360
design. And this particular quote is one that kind of speaks to me. It's, you know, all of us are

05:32.360 --> 05:39.560
temporarily able bodied and at some point in our lives we'll face new kinds of exclusions. As we age,

05:40.120 --> 05:46.280
when we design for inclusion, we're designing for our future selves. So I'm getting older,

05:46.920 --> 05:51.000
I'm more divergent, I have a host of other health issues that I'm aware of and unaware of.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.800
And this quote and then kind of working with Models and the work that we've been doing,

05:56.600 --> 06:02.680
kind of spoke to that to me at least. And overall I think that there's a need for creating technology

06:02.680 --> 06:08.280
that satisfies our essential needs and while protecting our world being. How can we like

06:08.280 --> 06:13.240
redefine the role of our digital devices to foster more healthier and balanced life?

06:13.960 --> 06:18.920
And at least a vision is, you know, can we create a new class of devices that are built from scratch

06:18.920 --> 06:24.760
that sort of embody these principles of humane technology both in hardware and software design?

06:27.320 --> 06:34.840
So what about software? You know, how can we be productive in a calm world? Can the work that we

06:34.840 --> 06:39.880
do be synced on the cloud, fall into our focus? Can we collaborate without notifications?

06:40.760 --> 06:46.760
Can we scale a minimalist UI to more than just reading and writing?

06:48.120 --> 06:53.880
So if we start with the basics, the common use cases were reading and writing.

06:55.320 --> 06:58.440
We have kind of like a mockup of an example of a writing application,

06:59.080 --> 07:04.280
simple text editor that will allow you to do prose and code and also a simple reference for

07:04.280 --> 07:09.400
we can like browse the web using Gemini. You know, this is how you would sort of explore and use

07:09.400 --> 07:17.480
information. So, you know, how can we possibly scale something like this? And modellix. So modellix

07:17.480 --> 07:24.760
is a core framework that's in development that's designed to tailor applications and documents

07:24.760 --> 07:31.880
across various devices and end users' needs. So the way that I like to think about it is

07:32.840 --> 07:39.240
imagine responsive design but taking much further, not just related towards particular screen types,

07:39.240 --> 07:44.760
but a longer range of different types of devices they have and really cater to the needs of

07:44.760 --> 07:50.680
individuals. So here we have the source of the particular application, a minimalist reader,

07:50.680 --> 07:55.560
and then let's say you have a reader who has low vision or perhaps is using maybe some

07:55.560 --> 07:59.320
forfeiting device, the application itself will sort of adapt to that.

08:01.880 --> 08:07.800
So yeah, so modellix adapts to the interface to users' preferences, making adjustments

08:07.800 --> 08:13.000
depending on their need. There would be a semantic model that guides the adaptions across

08:13.000 --> 08:18.040
different modalities, screen types, operating system devices, and enabling developers and users

08:18.040 --> 08:25.080
to extend and enhance the application for each of the modalities. Some of the approaches of this

08:25.080 --> 08:30.520
is to be able to restructure the complexity of the interface and moving complexities associated

08:30.520 --> 08:38.040
with the particular modalities. I have a little bit of a mock-up here of kind of explaining how the

08:39.640 --> 08:44.360
modellix and modalities would work. We would have a modellix-aware application and then would

08:44.360 --> 08:51.000
present to the user a visual and or possibly like an audio interface. And we're also looking into,

08:51.320 --> 09:01.400
well, missed a slide there, but the complexity, some of the challenges are the complexity in the

09:01.400 --> 09:06.760
representation of user interface and also how can we be backwards compatible with existing applications.

09:08.040 --> 09:12.920
So here we're also looking into saying, also looking into possibly using like large language

09:12.920 --> 09:18.920
models for being able to support applications that are not made with modellix from the beginning.

09:19.880 --> 09:26.760
Need to expand on this a bit more, but we'll do that later. So next steps. So we've been working

09:26.760 --> 09:33.800
at this for about two years now with our display controller and our prototype. We are pretty much

09:33.800 --> 09:38.760
done and one of the things we want to do is be able to do a crowdfunding campaign later this year

09:38.760 --> 09:43.720
to be able to make the devices or the boards available to people. We're also a small team.

09:43.720 --> 09:48.200
We're about three or four people who've been working on this. So if anyone wants to get involved,

09:48.200 --> 09:54.680
anywhere between documentation, between design, we'd love to have you all. So we also have a link

09:54.680 --> 10:01.240
here if there's different ways to be involved. And I think that's mostly it that wraps up. I think,

10:01.240 --> 10:07.720
I don't know if I sped that through too fast. I have 15 minutes. Well, I have 15 minutes and

10:07.720 --> 10:12.920
have a demo and I'm happy to answer any questions. So that's it for me.

10:20.280 --> 10:25.240
Let's take some questions first and then we'll see if we've. Yeah, I could do. Yeah, I would have to

10:25.240 --> 10:27.560
disconnect it from the display, but I can't get here, but yeah.

10:32.760 --> 10:36.280
I would have to disconnect the from the here and there, but we can do it afterwards. Not a problem.

10:37.000 --> 10:44.520
Any questions? Okay, I see one down here. Please repeat the question. Yes.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.200
So the.

10:53.080 --> 10:59.560
Yeah, so I didn't. Sorry, the question was am I working with multiple different devices or displays?

10:59.560 --> 11:05.480
Is that correct? So initially, the motivation for the project was to make a laptop. We initially

11:05.480 --> 11:11.400
had an investor was interested in supporting it. Sadly, they backed off a little bit. So we

11:12.040 --> 11:17.000
continue just working being complete bootstrapped and working on the display controller. So the

11:17.000 --> 11:21.560
first device that we want to make available to people as well, one, the board itself or

11:21.560 --> 11:26.600
hardware engineers, hackers, people want to work on it, give it accessible. The second one being

11:27.160 --> 11:33.720
the monitor itself. It'll be a nicer case. So that'll be the second device and we're working

11:33.960 --> 11:37.480
right now actively and identifying like what would be the third possible device where they're

11:37.480 --> 11:43.720
being between doing a reader or maybe a dedicated like typing device for like authors and writers.

11:43.720 --> 11:47.800
This talk today was more focused on like software and like what we envisioned. What would it look

11:47.800 --> 11:53.080
like to rethink to be an inclusive technology? I have another talk tomorrow is talking more

11:53.080 --> 11:57.640
about the hardware side of things, but the long term vision is to be able to create a whole new

11:57.640 --> 12:02.840
class of devices that use our controller hardware and software stack that is optimized. So

12:03.480 --> 12:09.080
right now I'm on the next year. Hopefully we'll have maybe a reader here and Fosom 25.

12:10.440 --> 12:14.280
But yeah, so that's kind of what it is. And I think part of it is that everything's open hardware.

12:14.280 --> 12:17.480
It's on our repositories. There's a read me. So if you're a hardware hacker engineer,

12:18.120 --> 12:26.840
please feel free to get started. Hi. Have you been in contact with one of the larger

12:27.640 --> 12:32.200
districts of environments like the integrating

12:34.600 --> 12:40.120
is one of the challenges you had was not being able to easily easily tell

12:41.320 --> 12:45.480
what part of the interface needs to go where it needs to be changed in a certain way.

12:45.480 --> 12:57.400
Yeah, so the question is, have I spoken to larger projects, for example, like no more KDE

12:58.200 --> 12:59.880
and the second part of it? Just want to make sure.

13:03.400 --> 13:10.200
In regards to the changes, I haven't spoken to any of the larger projects. If anyone is in KD or

13:10.520 --> 13:18.200
I'm happy to talk. I did speak with Drew DeVault from Swarstut and kind of thinking about what

13:18.200 --> 13:24.040
would it look like to create a dedicated software stack at the higher levels. And we see promise

13:24.040 --> 13:30.040
in using Wayland particles, specifically things related to damage tracking that would enable

13:30.040 --> 13:36.440
applications to create this idea of an ink native application, for example. So if everyone's ever

13:36.440 --> 13:40.600
used like a remarkable or any other dedicated device, be able to create

13:40.600 --> 13:44.040
ink applications that are natively built and with the support of Wayland protocols. So that's

13:44.040 --> 13:49.400
the extent that I've gone, but I haven't spoken specifically to no more KDE projects, but happy

13:49.400 --> 13:56.040
to. This is what I've been thinking and working on for two, three years nonstop. So I have many ideas.

13:59.720 --> 14:00.040
Yes.

14:06.440 --> 14:12.120
Yeah, we're going to hit a 60 Hertz refresh rate. Sorry, what is the refresh rate that we are aiming

14:12.120 --> 14:17.960
or targeting with the ink displays? We're able to hit a 60 Hertz refresh rate right now with our

14:17.960 --> 14:25.560
controller. It's has good, has anything that's in the market right now. And we strongly believe we

14:25.560 --> 14:31.880
can improve upon that both in the optimizations at the hardware level. And also with the dedicated

14:31.880 --> 14:37.640
software stack and Implement and Wayland protocols, we could create a more native,

14:37.640 --> 14:41.720
create a more native like experience. So yeah, open up the hardware stack,

14:42.600 --> 14:49.160
dedicated tailored software stack. I think we can see a lot of optimizations. Yeah, back.

15:02.360 --> 15:15.080
So the question was related to the 60 Hertz. It is excellent. There is typically problems related to

15:15.080 --> 15:20.200
like ghosting or the problems and have we found a way around it to answer your question? Sorry,

15:20.200 --> 15:29.160
to answer your question, yes, we found a way around it. So there's ways where you can modify at the

15:29.160 --> 15:35.960
hardware level in order to be able to do that. But still coming back to the earlier question about

15:35.960 --> 15:40.840
the Wayland protocols and the larger projects, I think this is where we would need support

15:41.480 --> 15:49.240
to be able to create software that's tailored to that medium. But I have a general belief that the

15:49.240 --> 15:54.200
display controllers that are available in the market that a lot of existing companies and products

15:54.200 --> 16:00.760
use are not optimized so much. I think it's, if we look at E-EngleVraw, they primarily have focused

16:00.760 --> 16:07.240
on e-Veeters and digital signage, but not so much in other form factors or devices, let alone

16:07.240 --> 16:13.320
having software that's tailored to it. So I think there is a unmet need in the market, so to speak,

16:13.320 --> 16:21.320
where these controllers could be pushed further, but they haven't. So I think with the right combination

16:21.320 --> 16:26.920
of optimizing at the hardware level, the software level, probably having specific guidelines of

16:26.920 --> 16:31.480
this is how an E-Engle native application would render, this is thus the homo-dialics piece,

16:31.480 --> 16:38.360
right, that I sort of mentioned before, the tie-in, I think we could hit 60 hertz and also reduce

16:38.360 --> 16:47.160
go-sing and things related to that. Any other questions? I'm going to, do I have two more?

16:48.120 --> 16:50.520
I'm going to go with the person that will, yes.

17:06.040 --> 17:10.920
Yeah, the question, yeah, the question is what would it take to make a modalex of wear application,

17:10.920 --> 17:14.760
modalex of wear application, UI, library, or whole different design system?

17:15.720 --> 17:20.760
We're trying to figure that out, so it's in development, so I think part of it is a combination

17:20.760 --> 17:25.400
of everything you just stated, part of it would be philosophy, part of it would be also design,

17:26.440 --> 17:30.920
another part of it is figuring out the right software stack for it too. So I think we've

17:32.920 --> 17:36.760
gone under a lot of our rabbit holes trying to figure out what would be an appropriate stack,

17:36.760 --> 17:41.960
and I think the way that I look at it is we need to get it to the hands of people,

17:41.960 --> 17:45.080
we need to be able to get the board and the monitoring to the hands of people.

17:45.960 --> 17:51.160
We have some ideas and some levels of direction, but tapping into the much wider community,

17:51.720 --> 17:56.440
I think is where that lies. I'm going to, there was a question over here, yes.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.960
You're covered. Okay, awesome, thank you. There was a, think of a question, yes.

18:11.960 --> 18:17.720
I'm trying to change our user experience, our UI and so on, so what do you want to talk about?

18:17.720 --> 18:26.120
I remember hearing for more, call for the, for last 15 years, starting with one of

18:26.120 --> 18:33.000
a lot of her child and other lots of things, so on the one hand, now you might have a bit easier

18:33.000 --> 18:41.240
because there is more hardware, like the brand laptop, like the brand, so the brand is anything

18:41.720 --> 18:47.320
framework, like M and P, yes, or the other can be, there is much more fragmentation, so

18:47.880 --> 18:53.000
that's one thing you need to fight and then you need to convince people to start using this UI

18:53.000 --> 18:57.160
in your application and we just had talked from standard birth.

19:00.440 --> 19:05.080
Yes, so the question was what is our focus and then mentioning projects like the OOPC,

19:05.800 --> 19:10.920
mentioning the fact that it's been around for about 15 years and just what is our focusing

19:10.920 --> 19:16.360
hardware and software. I think overall, I see Modos and I think where we're at right now,

19:16.360 --> 19:22.120
I see myself as more of like an enabler, an enabler to be able to enable other folks to be able to

19:22.120 --> 19:27.720
take E-ing devices in whatever direction they would want. We as like Modos have this particular

19:27.720 --> 19:32.200
vision of creating this idea of a humane technology and create a hardware and software that's tailored

19:32.200 --> 19:38.840
to it. We might just disappear overnight, right, but the fact that it's open hardware,

19:38.840 --> 19:41.400
there's a repository there, you can go ahead and use it.

19:43.880 --> 19:47.960
I did track, I don't know if everyone's done track, but I think, there's like a totem pole,

19:47.960 --> 19:53.080
I think this is as far as we have a foundation where we can start if someone like Pine 64 or

19:53.080 --> 19:58.200
another one like OOPC would want to use our display controller in order to take it in a

19:58.200 --> 20:03.000
particularly different direction, it's more than welcomed. I think given our capacity where we are

20:03.000 --> 20:07.240
right now, we just want to be able to first focus on the display controller, be able to build the

20:07.240 --> 20:09.240
community and then see where the community really takes it.

20:12.280 --> 20:18.360
So, prior to my work, I worked a lot with universities and other educational

20:19.480 --> 20:23.800
institutions. One thing that's really been happening recently is especially with students with

20:24.680 --> 20:31.640
extra needs, universities have been really pushing for assistive technology a lot more

20:31.800 --> 20:35.640
than we do with this thing. I was wondering about an area that you consider looking into

20:35.640 --> 20:41.320
working with organizations like DSA in the UK or ensuring that the US and the UK are looking

20:41.320 --> 20:49.880
into other organizations. So, finding tools for students with extra needs and almost building

20:49.880 --> 20:54.120
like a foundation there for other developers to then jump into that market. It's a brand

20:54.680 --> 20:55.720
that we are looking at.

20:55.720 --> 21:02.200
Yeah, so the question was related to have it looked into like assistive technology in particular

21:02.200 --> 21:06.840
the needs of students in the education space. Does that summarize the question well?

21:07.560 --> 21:11.080
Yes, I've been looking into assistive technology.

21:14.040 --> 21:20.600
I don't know enough. I need to do more research on it. I've looked into it, at least back in Boston.

21:20.680 --> 21:29.000
There are these SBIR and SCTR grants that are available, but they're complex in the sense of

21:29.000 --> 21:37.080
being able to apply to the grant. The path to enter into a positive grant is a substantial lift.

21:37.080 --> 21:43.240
So, I have looked into assistive technology. I think that there are, it's a different market.

21:43.240 --> 21:47.240
It requires different needs. I don't know enough about it, but I've looked into it as

21:47.240 --> 21:49.640
possibly being a base to start from.

21:53.320 --> 21:56.520
I'd love to talk to you further more about it and learn this is why I'm here.

21:56.520 --> 21:59.240
We're going to take one more question and it was just back there. Sorry.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.080
Also happy to talk afterwards.

22:01.080 --> 22:07.160
Thank you. I have a question about the brief that you mentioned in the beginning of like the E being

22:07.160 --> 22:13.720
a source of less, but the I think you can help in particular high conditions. So, how do you

22:14.600 --> 22:18.920
make sure that your design process matches that needs?

22:20.600 --> 22:25.640
The question was related towards E-ink addressing issues to like eye strain and fatigue and how

22:25.640 --> 22:29.640
we can make sure that our design process is aligned with that. Is that somewhere as a question?

22:29.640 --> 22:37.800
Well, figuring it out, still working on it. The challenge when it comes to E-ink and other

22:37.800 --> 22:43.080
displays is that there's also a lot of mixed studies there. I can't conclusively say that

22:43.720 --> 22:50.520
problem is related to blue light, for example. But also our eyes and pupils are changing throughout

22:50.520 --> 22:56.840
our lifetime and everyone here has different levels. So, I don't have necessarily the funds to prove

22:56.840 --> 23:03.160
this is what it is, but I have heard a overwhelming amount of feedback of people with light sensitivity

23:03.160 --> 23:08.840
and issues. So, to your question, yeah, I think that's something that we need to take

23:08.840 --> 23:14.440
into consideration in our design and would want to get. There have been some folks who have

23:15.480 --> 23:20.280
some level of sensitivity or some problem who've expressed interest and I'd want to involve them

23:20.280 --> 23:24.840
from the very beginning as part of that design process. I think now that we have our prototype done,

23:26.120 --> 23:29.320
that will enable us to answer more questions like this and investigate further.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.240
Okay, thank you so much. Thank you.

23:33.240 --> 23:36.280
Really cool. Awesome. Thank you.
