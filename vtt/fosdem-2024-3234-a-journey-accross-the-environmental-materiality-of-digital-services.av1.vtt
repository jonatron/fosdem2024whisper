00:30.000 --> 00:42.560
Hi.

00:42.560 --> 00:48.920
So in this talk, we'd like to take you on a journey across the environmental materiality

00:48.920 --> 00:51.440
of digital services.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.600
So the speakers in front of you, here's David.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.600
My name is Benoit.

00:55.600 --> 01:02.720
We are contributors to an NGO called Boavista that we'll present briefly later.

01:02.720 --> 01:07.560
We also are colleagues in a small company called Hublot working on ICT and environmental

01:07.560 --> 01:10.560
impacts.

01:10.560 --> 01:17.000
Regarding Boavista, so the NGO we work for and this is the work of this NGO we present

01:17.000 --> 01:18.480
to you today.

01:19.480 --> 01:27.000
This is an NGO based in France that gathers more than 250 members now, private companies,

01:27.000 --> 01:32.480
public organizations, universities, researchers, freelancers and so on.

01:32.480 --> 01:40.480
And the goal of the organization is to provide public and open methods, data, tools and knowledge

01:40.480 --> 01:47.840
about environmental impacts of ICT and its assessment.

01:47.840 --> 01:55.840
And of course we try to provide a useful open source, open data and open science stuff.

01:58.840 --> 01:59.840
Thank you Benoit.

01:59.840 --> 02:08.040
So today's objective will be to see how can we get from digital service to its environmental

02:08.040 --> 02:09.040
materiality.

02:09.040 --> 02:14.840
Environmental materiality is another way of seeing its environmental impact and it includes

02:14.840 --> 02:21.840
not only its carbon emission but also all of the other pollution and its usage of renewable

02:21.840 --> 02:24.840
and non-renewable resources.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.840
To do this we need to follow a process which is called environmental accounting.

02:28.840 --> 02:33.840
And at Boavista we have chosen to do it with an open source approach.

02:33.840 --> 02:40.840
What is very difficult when you're doing accounting, environmental accounting in the context of ICT

02:40.840 --> 02:46.840
is that you must take into account all the value chain of your digital service including

02:46.840 --> 02:54.840
the end user equipment, network, data centers, so all of the infrastructure that your service is using.

02:54.840 --> 02:59.840
But you also need to take into account another dimension which is the lifecycle phases.

02:59.840 --> 03:06.840
So you don't want to only include the use phase impact of the use phase but also the

03:06.840 --> 03:11.840
impact of manufacturing the equipment that your service is running on, transporting those

03:11.840 --> 03:17.840
equipment to their place of usage using them and also the end of life of the equipment.

03:17.840 --> 03:26.840
Today we won't be able to dig in all of the dimension so you'll see on the slide what we're going to focus

03:26.840 --> 03:30.840
but Boavista is working on all of the dimension here.

03:31.840 --> 03:36.840
It's still me. So why have we decided to do open source?

03:36.840 --> 03:42.840
So we're out for them, I think everyone here is convinced that we should do all of the data and

03:42.840 --> 03:47.840
development with an open source process. But when we talk about environmental accounting,

03:47.840 --> 03:52.840
it's more specifically important to follow an open approach.

03:52.840 --> 03:56.840
First, because we believe it's a democratic necessity.

03:56.840 --> 04:02.840
Environmental figures are often used to justify political orientation.

04:02.840 --> 04:07.840
For instance, the Green New Deal is full of environmental figures and we believe that

04:07.840 --> 04:13.840
citizens should be able to criticize, audit and criticize the figures that are being used to

04:13.840 --> 04:19.840
make political orientation. Also, environmental figures and environmental accounting are used

04:19.840 --> 04:24.840
to label product and services. I think you might have seen some data centers who said that

04:24.840 --> 04:30.840
they are greener than greener. But to say this, you need to rely on figures, environmental figures

04:30.840 --> 04:39.840
and often those claims are not based on open approaches and figures, which is for us a problem

04:39.840 --> 04:43.840
since consumers cannot audit and criticize the figure.

04:43.840 --> 04:49.840
There is also a very more straightforward argument because today environmental accounting in the context

04:49.840 --> 04:57.840
of ICT is very immature. So the data that we use, the data that we report are of very bad quality.

04:57.840 --> 05:03.840
To illustrate this, we've done some work. We normalize the carbon impact of manufacturing

05:03.840 --> 05:11.840
one inch of a lead panel, so lead screen, and this is the impact for manufacturing one inch,

05:11.840 --> 05:18.840
the carbon footprint. And you see from the five data sources that you have here, we have

05:18.840 --> 05:25.840
a magnitude of 10 between the lowest impact and the highest impact. We could think that HP has a way

05:25.840 --> 05:33.840
better environmental friendly process than Dell, but this is not the case. At least we cannot,

05:33.840 --> 05:39.840
this is not the justification for this difference. This difference is, there is this difference

05:39.840 --> 05:44.840
because all of those providers are not using the same data sources, the same hypothesis,

05:44.840 --> 05:51.840
and the same method. And because all of those are not open, we are not able to explain you why there is

05:51.840 --> 05:58.840
those difference. So open source should be a way, if all of those figures were based on open source approaches,

05:58.840 --> 06:03.840
we could try to normalize those impacts, compare the provider once they get another,

06:03.840 --> 06:07.840
and explain why different providers have different impacts.

06:08.840 --> 06:17.840
So let's first focus on the energy footprint. So I guess the energy footprint is the part of the

06:17.840 --> 06:25.840
ICT footprint we mostly think about when we work in ICT. That's easier to get a grasp on it.

06:25.840 --> 06:33.840
But as David said, it's still, when we look at energy in ICT, it's still only one part of the impact.

06:33.840 --> 06:41.840
So it's really about the usage phase. It doesn't cover the rest, which is, which can be way, way greater impact

06:41.840 --> 06:47.840
than just the usage phase. That's also true for data centers. In what I will present to you today,

06:47.840 --> 06:53.840
most of the information are accurate for data centers. Some of them may be applied to end user

06:53.840 --> 07:01.840
equipment, but we didn't include specific information on network equipment. So we are going to

07:01.840 --> 07:09.840
include specific information on network equipment for technical reasons and also because it's hard to get data on that part.

07:09.840 --> 07:17.840
So first, a little bit of context regarding data centers. I don't know if you've seen the latest figures from the

07:17.840 --> 07:26.840
EA. EA is International Energy Agency, and it, let's say, it's a rather conservative organism so far

07:26.840 --> 07:35.840
regarding ICT and their own impact figures. But their latest figures is quite enlightening because we can see that in 2022

07:35.840 --> 07:44.840
we were around 400 terawatt hour of energy consumed by data centers, which is the double from what they previously said for 2020,

07:44.840 --> 07:53.840
which is a bit strange. And also that their projection for 2026 or in two years says that it will double again.

07:53.840 --> 08:02.840
So around 800 terawatt hours. Part of it is because of AI, but not only. You guessed it. So this is the context.

08:02.840 --> 08:11.840
What we can say here at least is that we are really in hyper growth trend and not the opposites. That's not what we have seen in some

08:11.840 --> 08:17.840
medias like data centers and energy consumption is flat. That's not the case.

08:18.840 --> 08:25.840
Then what's the issue here actually? What do you want to look at? It's not just about the energy consumption, of course.

08:25.840 --> 08:35.840
I think I won't teach anything to anyone in this room when I say that energy consumption means that we at some point consume

08:35.840 --> 08:44.840
oil, gas, and coal or other energy sources. This will emit greenhouse gas emissions, of course.

08:44.840 --> 08:52.840
But we will also consume water in the process. We will consume water if we take into account the cooling of the data center.

08:52.840 --> 09:00.840
And we will consume minerals and metals and other resources. Not all the resources that we can account for are listed on the draw.

09:00.840 --> 09:11.840
But there are 16 environmental criteria that we take into account in Boa Vista tools.

09:14.840 --> 09:23.840
So what do you have in your position to work on your own energy consumption of your services?

09:24.840 --> 09:31.840
So we have talked during the day in this room about paraffin power top. There are other options as well.

09:31.840 --> 09:39.840
Of course there are physical measurement devices. So smart PDUs, ID rack or ID low administration cards if you have them on your server.

09:39.840 --> 09:49.840
What matters in general? This is one way. The other way is software evaluation. So those are the options that I've listed on the top.

09:49.840 --> 09:58.840
All of them are open source solutions. If you are, let's say in a bare metal server context, you might choose power API, paraff, power top,

09:58.840 --> 10:08.840
SkaFound. If you are in, let's say more in a development phase of software, you could use power Jula. If you are in a Kubernetes context,

10:08.840 --> 10:15.840
Kepler or SkaFound may help you. And if you are in a machine learning context, code carbon could be of good help.

10:15.840 --> 10:24.840
And these are some examples. What's behind the scene is actually interfaces that have been mentioned previously in the day.

10:24.840 --> 10:35.840
So NVIDIA, SMI for getting the energy consumption of GPUs, RapeL for Intel or AMD, X86 CPUs.

10:35.840 --> 10:43.840
And the third approach is modeling. So we could classify this as measurement. This is more about modelization.

10:43.840 --> 10:52.840
And some of those tools also use modeling, then don't necessarily use only measurement with those interfaces.

10:52.840 --> 11:03.840
And the Bois API is also part of it because it does modelize energy consumption and answers about what's the carbon composition of the electricity.

11:03.840 --> 11:10.840
What, if I take the words from the previous presentation.

11:10.840 --> 11:19.840
But when we say that we have to precise something is that both hardware and software measurement tools have their limits.

11:19.840 --> 11:30.840
If you take the wider purple and pink squares, they represent what perimeter, a physical device will be able to measure.

11:30.840 --> 11:37.840
So the whole machine actually, but you won't be able to zoom on what's the footprint of a software or a given component.

11:37.840 --> 11:51.840
On the other side, if you look at the yellow and green screens, not so green, but the smaller squares here, we see this is the perimeter that RapeL is able to measure.

11:51.840 --> 12:00.840
So a CPU, if there is an integrated GPU memory can be measured for GPUs, SMIs.

12:00.840 --> 12:09.840
In some cases you may have a broader perimeter in RapeL, but this is for recent machines only.

12:09.840 --> 12:19.840
So we have an issue here because we are in a trade-off between completeness of the evaluation and precision and the ability to zoom in on the footprint of one software, for example.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.840
And so how could we fix that situation?

12:24.840 --> 12:30.840
In Bovista we are launching a project called EnerGista, which is basically a collaborative science.

12:30.840 --> 12:48.840
This is a collaborative database that we open and we propose voluntary organizations, individuals to share with an open source agent energy data and data about the hardware of the machine that has been measured.

12:48.840 --> 13:01.840
Which will help us to do statistics and then at some point produce better models that will help us improve software evaluation for power evaluation.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.840
Thank you Benoit.

13:06.840 --> 13:18.840
So from the beginning of the presentation we've told you that the use phase and the energy consumption is not the only thing that should take into account when you want to account for the materiality of your service.

13:18.840 --> 13:23.840
And this is where the life cycle approach comes in.

13:23.840 --> 13:35.840
So a life cycle approach will try to take into account all of the phase of the life cycle of your service, but also all the impacts, well, most of the impacts of your criteria.

13:35.840 --> 13:42.840
So not only carbon footprint, but depletion of minerals and usage of water, for instance.

13:42.840 --> 13:51.840
We're going to focus here on how can you identify the environmental impact of manufacturing a server.

13:51.840 --> 13:53.840
So it will be mostly in this area.

13:53.840 --> 14:03.840
But at Bovista we try to have a comprehensive approach by identifying the impact of all the phase from all the value chain.

14:05.840 --> 14:16.840
So this is a very, very partial and simplified model on how can you get the environmental materiality of a server for a specific service.

14:16.840 --> 14:28.840
So the first step that we do when we do environmental accounting is we try to identify what is the technical infrastructure that hosts the service.

14:28.840 --> 14:44.840
And this is often the most difficult part, because for instance if you take a function as a service that runs on AWS, it's very hard to know what is the specific consumption of resources and what is the technical material that your function is running on.

14:44.840 --> 14:54.840
But we need this data to know and to understand what specific component is used and what is the impact of those components that we should allocate to the service.

14:54.840 --> 15:05.840
So this is sometimes like archaeology when we need to dig and try to make some hypotheses to know how do we get from a service to its technical layer.

15:05.840 --> 15:13.840
But once we have the technical layer, we need to go to the raw material, because this is where the impact comes from.

15:13.840 --> 15:24.840
So we try to map all the processes that needs to be completed to assemble and build a manufacturer server.

15:24.840 --> 15:34.840
In a simplified way, we could say that a server is an assembly of plastic for the casing and packet and components.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.840
So CPU, RAM, Graphic Card Card and so on.

15:37.840 --> 15:44.840
And a component has many processes, but the most impactful process is the packing process.

15:44.840 --> 15:52.840
When you pack the dye, it's part of the components that is engraved where you have the semiconductors.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.840
And for this, you need to have metal.

15:55.840 --> 16:01.840
And for having the dye, you need to engrave a silicaweather.

16:01.840 --> 16:06.840
And so as you can see, the process of engraving consumes a lot of water.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.840
And also you need metals to, of course, produce a silicaweather.

16:10.840 --> 16:25.840
Across all of these processes, there is the use of energy, which also will use raw material, which will cause the pollution and resource depletions.

16:25.840 --> 16:36.840
So of course, you don't want, each time you want to assess a service, we are not going to draw this map and go until the usage of coal, oil and so on.

16:36.840 --> 16:49.840
So what we do is we factorize the processes and we make them easier to access through the different tools we are building at Boavista.

16:49.840 --> 17:01.840
One main tool that we have is Boavista API, which is an API that can make a translation between the ICT world with IT people and the environmental impact.

17:01.840 --> 17:07.840
So you give to the API a technical configuration.

17:07.840 --> 17:11.840
It can describe a digital service, an equipment, a component.

17:11.840 --> 17:18.840
And the API will give you back environmental impact, not only on global warming, so not only on the carbon footprint.

17:18.840 --> 17:37.840
But for instance, on other impacts that has primary energy that you should know if you know a little bit about energy and abiotic depletion potential, which is a criteria that assess the removal of non-renewable resources.

17:37.840 --> 17:42.840
So this includes minerals and fossil resources.

17:43.840 --> 17:53.840
Around the API, we built, so our architecture is in microservices, so the API is a central microservice.

17:53.840 --> 18:03.840
But we have other tools, such as Cloud Scanner, which will scan an AWS account and try to assess with the API the impact of the AWS account.

18:03.840 --> 18:18.840
And we have also a pedagogical front end, which is called DataVista, which is based on the API, but it's just a nice layer on top of the API for people who doesn't want to manipulate API.

18:18.840 --> 18:21.840
So for instance, here is a way to assess the impact of a server.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.840
And you see you can configure a server.

18:25.840 --> 18:34.840
For instance, let's say that I have one CPU.

18:34.840 --> 18:39.840
Demo effect, where it's just, okay, I put an L.

18:39.840 --> 18:42.840
I can also change the location where I use a server.

18:42.840 --> 18:48.840
So this will chase the carbon footprint of the electricity where the server is running.

18:48.840 --> 18:58.840
So I invite you to play with this tool and see a little bit what is the main cause of the impact, both from the manufacturer and the use face.

18:58.840 --> 19:02.840
And also the manufacturer impact, you can have it by component.

19:02.840 --> 19:06.840
So it's also interesting to see which component is most impactful.

19:06.840 --> 19:10.840
There is also other features, which are also in the API.

19:10.840 --> 19:23.840
You can assess the impact of your cloud usage, for instance, or of end user devices, but we haven't introduced those during the talk.

19:23.840 --> 19:24.840
Yeah.

19:24.840 --> 19:35.840
The API is you can scan the QR code and this will get you to the repository of the BoaVista API.

19:35.840 --> 19:37.840
We wanted to open up this talk.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.840
So we've begun by talking about energy.

19:40.840 --> 19:45.840
Then we took a broader approach with the life cycle approach, life cycle assessment approach.

19:45.840 --> 19:56.840
And we wanted to open up with an even more systemic approach, which I call systemic footprint, but it could be also called a consequential approach.

19:56.840 --> 19:57.840
Yeah.

19:57.840 --> 20:02.840
From the beginning of the presentation, we'll talk, we've talked about the direct impact of digital service.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.840
So it means the impact of the value chain of the service.

20:05.840 --> 20:21.840
But maybe sometimes the most impactful part of digital service, it's not just direct footprint, but it is the indirect externalities, environmental externalities that is brought by the fact of deploying your service.

20:21.840 --> 20:36.840
Your service, you're doing your service for some usages and you need to be careful on why your service is used and how your service is used, because this might be, this service might be used to make environmental harm.

20:36.840 --> 20:52.840
So when you want to understand what is the consequences of launching your service, you need to take another approach, which is a causal approach, and trying to map the different causes and consequences that are, that follow the introduction of your software.

20:52.840 --> 21:04.840
For instance, if you take a cloud provider, cloud are known to be often more mutualized and more optimized in time of energy, energy usage and carbon footprint.

21:04.840 --> 21:13.840
But since we have consumed, since cloud is very easily accessed, we are consuming way more compute resources than we did before.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.840
So this is what we call the rebound effect.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.840
And this is something that we can get from a basic life cycle analysis.

21:18.840 --> 21:28.840
We need to have a more systemic approach to, to understand all of those social transformation that is brought by ICT.

21:28.840 --> 21:29.840
And I think we're done in.

21:29.840 --> 21:30.840
Thank you for your attention.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.840
We have some minutes left for questions.

21:32.840 --> 21:47.840
Yes, it was very interesting.

21:47.840 --> 21:58.840
But so the problem is that everybody must know this kind of thing for in collaboration to climate, environment and so on.

21:58.840 --> 22:05.840
And because there is no studies of Greenpeace about this kind of thing, about energy provider.

22:05.840 --> 22:16.840
Yes, in Belgium, but so this kind of thing is very difficult of because so I know that the three said what is French?

22:16.840 --> 22:18.840
I don't know in English.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.840
So I'm a Amazon Web Service.

22:22.840 --> 22:34.840
Yes, so and this, this kind of thing is very, very, very important to their data centers, how it's take off energy, its, its harm effect on the river or something like that.

22:34.840 --> 22:41.840
So, so all this kind of thing for the construction of, of a computer and so on.

22:41.840 --> 22:51.840
I would like to have that is an, an, an Greenpeace barometers of this kind of thing everywhere.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.840
So because it's very important for our future.

22:54.840 --> 23:06.840
So also when dissipate energy in a river, a separation of energy and so on.

23:06.840 --> 23:10.840
So your remark is about awareness, I think.

23:10.840 --> 23:17.840
So there, there, I think there is no report from Greenpeace, but there is a report from WWF at least.

23:17.840 --> 23:31.840
And I think the, the main purpose of Boa Vista and the tools that we're building is not efficiency, but it's more making people aware of those problems and taking action because I think, and I think we can, we can talk for both of us.

23:31.840 --> 23:40.840
We think that having more IT people engage is one way to, to fight against those, this, this, the impact of IT.

23:40.840 --> 23:45.840
Hello, thank you very much for this.

23:45.840 --> 23:50.840
When you were presenting the server impact thing, I have a technical question.

23:50.840 --> 23:59.840
There was a discussion about jewels and primary energy as opposed to something that we might use like kilowatt hours, which is quite common.

23:59.840 --> 24:07.840
Could you maybe talk a little bit about why you chose that rather than a figure that we see used in lots of other places?

24:07.840 --> 24:12.840
Because that is something that I found a little bit difficult to understand when I first looked at it.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.840
So primary energy versus secondary energy.

24:15.840 --> 24:22.840
If you could explain some of that and explain the decision to choose one versus what hours, for example, instead of jewels.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.840
Yeah.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.840
You want to answer?

24:28.840 --> 24:31.840
Why do we express primary energy in jewels?

24:31.840 --> 24:47.840
Yeah, what I can say, but I don't know if it's an accurate answer, but in practical terms, jewels are very used for very precise measurement purposes.

24:47.840 --> 24:54.840
Most of the time when we talk about big figures, we are more about what hours, kilowatt hours, megawatt hours and so on.

24:54.840 --> 24:56.840
What's its power?

24:56.840 --> 25:00.840
So it's not expressed on a timeframe.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.840
That has been said in a previous talk.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.840
I don't know if it clarifies or...

25:05.840 --> 25:07.840
Yeah.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.840
Oh, okay.

25:21.840 --> 25:23.840
Actually, I understand the confusion.

25:23.840 --> 25:26.840
Primary energy is an impact criteria.

25:26.840 --> 25:28.840
Secondary energy is a flow.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.840
So it's not considered a final impact.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.840
We use...

25:32.840 --> 25:41.840
If you see here, let's say, we can model the secondary energy, the power usage here, in what?

25:41.840 --> 25:47.840
And we use it to compute the usage impacts for the difference impact criteria.

25:47.840 --> 25:53.840
Primary energy is how do you deplete earth from primary energy?

25:53.840 --> 25:55.840
Does it?

25:55.840 --> 25:57.840
Maybe you're time for one.

25:57.840 --> 25:59.840
Maybe you can do both.

26:01.840 --> 26:10.840
So the question is, because of some countries now don't want any more of the rubbish servers from our countries,

26:10.840 --> 26:18.840
did the data centers change the policy in terms of management, for example, for the storage system?

26:18.840 --> 26:26.840
At Google, they used to break the hardware into small pieces, not even recycling them at all.

26:26.840 --> 26:34.840
And where there are changes recently for the spare parts management?

26:34.840 --> 26:42.840
Because of the fact that countries don't want to make the recycling any more offshore countries.

26:42.840 --> 26:46.840
Actually, that's a very complicated talk.
