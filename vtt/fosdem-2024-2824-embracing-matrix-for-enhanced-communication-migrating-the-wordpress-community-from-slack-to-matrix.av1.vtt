00:00.000 --> 00:14.120
Hi, so this will be about migrating the WordPress community from Slack to Matrix.

00:14.120 --> 00:18.200
So first, quick about me, I'm Alex Kirk, I'm from Vienna, Austria.

00:18.200 --> 00:21.800
I'm at Automatic for since 2014 now.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.240
We run WordPress.com and others.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.240
I'm an engineer.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.880
I lead teams around localization and matrix.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.520
I'm sponsored to contribute to WordPress.org.

00:31.520 --> 00:35.520
And I've got some site projects, so if you have a WordPress blog, check out the Friends

00:35.520 --> 00:42.680
plugin for making your site your own hub for subscribing to others and enable Master on

00:42.680 --> 00:48.240
Apps plugin if you want to use Master on Apps with your site.

00:48.240 --> 00:53.080
So quick thing, probably I don't need to tell you, but just to make sure, what is WordPress?

00:53.080 --> 00:56.400
It's a popular PHP CMS.

00:56.400 --> 01:02.640
But in 2003, today it powers over 43% of the websites on the web.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.880
It has a blog editor that allows you to edit posts, but also the whole site.

01:07.880 --> 01:13.240
It's well known for its plugin ecosystem, with plugins like Yoast, Runt Custom Fields,

01:13.240 --> 01:15.040
WooCommerce and so on.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.960
And it's open source under the GPL.

01:17.960 --> 01:23.440
And just a step back, just so that you understand what our needs are as a community.

01:23.440 --> 01:25.840
So this is how we collaborate.

01:25.880 --> 01:31.760
We've got 22 make teams in different areas, so one about accessibility, core, design,

01:31.760 --> 01:36.680
polygots, meta, lots of teams, performance, sustainability.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.560
And they all work towards separate goals.

01:39.560 --> 01:45.840
But each team has a P2, a blog, where they post about new things that are happening,

01:45.840 --> 01:48.680
proposals, decisions that are being announced, lots more.

01:48.680 --> 01:53.000
This is like the asynchronous part of the communication.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.200
And then we've got sometimes weekly, sometimes bi-weekly chat meetings for sharing updates

01:58.200 --> 02:01.200
and coordinating.

02:01.200 --> 02:07.400
And these are quite important because they give people a definite time when they can

02:07.400 --> 02:09.240
reach collaborators on the project.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.400
So you don't have to enter a room and hope that the right person is there.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.920
But you know the time, at this time, people who work in accessibility, for example, are

02:17.920 --> 02:19.000
available.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.720
And we've got meetups and work camps.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.640
Meetups are local to a city.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.880
They're like the smaller ones.

02:23.880 --> 02:28.440
Work camps are the next stage where people travel there to meet.

02:28.440 --> 02:31.200
And then we've got the flagship work camps.

02:31.200 --> 02:40.200
For example, in Asia, coming up in March, EU in Milan, and US in Portland in September.

02:40.200 --> 02:46.800
And another aspect is we've got a project, an initiative called Five for the Future.

02:46.800 --> 02:53.640
So there we encourage individuals and organizations to contribute 5% of their time or resources

02:53.640 --> 02:55.160
towards the workplace project.

02:55.160 --> 03:00.200
So this means a 100-person company would have five people dedicated to the project.

03:00.200 --> 03:03.920
An individual would have like two hours out of a week.

03:03.920 --> 03:07.640
And organizations like that concept because they retain control over the person who can

03:07.640 --> 03:09.120
contribute.

03:09.120 --> 03:13.520
And thus they're confident of pledging towards that goal.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.680
And if you want to hear more about that, there's actually a talk by my colleague Jesus

03:17.560 --> 03:22.520
in this room, Shaping the Future, investing wisely in long-term open source development

03:22.520 --> 03:25.880
with Five for the Future.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.360
And this is how a release of WordPress looks like.

03:28.360 --> 03:30.840
These are the companies who contributed to a release.

03:30.840 --> 03:38.040
So 640 people from 186 identified companies.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.200
This is the make-wordpress.org site.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.920
This is where we list the teams.

03:41.920 --> 03:46.560
And as you can see at the bottom, we list the next meeting that will happen and not

03:46.600 --> 03:51.280
only in Slack but also in Matrix.

03:51.280 --> 03:54.560
And this is the meetings during a week.

03:54.560 --> 03:57.680
So every day a couple of meetings take place.

03:57.680 --> 04:02.160
And because of the distribution around the world, some meetings happen twice in a day

04:02.160 --> 04:05.440
so that everybody has a choice to attend them.

04:05.440 --> 04:07.080
All right.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.800
So our plan to migrate.

04:08.800 --> 04:13.120
So it happened or it started in January last year.

04:13.160 --> 04:18.840
We announced that we'll create a subproject to evaluate migrating to Matrix.

04:18.840 --> 04:23.520
And then we would evaluate and create the environment that we need, migrate history and

04:23.520 --> 04:31.640
integrations, and then finally launch, finalize what needs to be finalized, and turn off Slack.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.640
All right.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.640
So what could happen?

04:33.640 --> 04:36.520
What things we anticipated?

04:36.520 --> 04:38.640
First people don't like change.

04:38.640 --> 04:41.080
We've been on Slack for a while.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.600
So we figured we need to prioritize something superior.

04:43.600 --> 04:49.560
So where are the strengths of the new system so that people will want to move?

04:49.560 --> 04:51.840
There is complexity around decentralized systems.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.600
Like everybody knows centralized systems.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.800
They need to go to one address and that's the only way to get there.

04:56.800 --> 05:00.480
So people might not know what to do.

05:00.480 --> 05:01.920
And then we'd had Slack lock-in.

05:01.920 --> 05:10.360
We've got lots of migrations created over the years that make Slack nice to use for everybody.

05:10.360 --> 05:15.760
And that's why people like it, I suppose.

05:15.760 --> 05:20.800
So when you consider Slack and an open source community, there's actually a few things that

05:20.800 --> 05:22.200
are a bit tricky.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.560
So one thing is that Slack, a sign up is email-based.

05:26.560 --> 05:31.360
So when you join the WordPress Slack, you have to follow a guide.

05:31.360 --> 05:35.400
And typically we actually do this at WordCamps where we have somebody there who will help

05:35.400 --> 05:37.360
somebody to get onto Slack.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.320
It's pretty complicated.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.840
Then it's a commercial product.

05:41.840 --> 05:47.160
The free tier has a message retention limit.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.000
The data is siloed behind Slack stores.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.960
So you need API keys to access it.

05:55.960 --> 06:02.640
But many companies use Slack and it's easy to just add one more workspace to Slack.

06:02.640 --> 06:09.280
So for many people, the barrier of entry is quite low in the end.

06:09.280 --> 06:12.160
Having matrix to that.

06:12.160 --> 06:17.880
Of course, Federation means everybody could join from anywhere, from any home server.

06:17.880 --> 06:22.560
But for the WordPress community, we would want to lock them in through an existing authentication

06:22.560 --> 06:23.560
system.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.120
No retention limits, of course.

06:26.120 --> 06:32.340
And our WordPress community has multiple Slack workspaces for different countries.

06:32.340 --> 06:37.040
So this would be able to unite them in one place.

06:37.040 --> 06:42.520
And of course, an open source project should have an open source chat.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.120
All right.

06:44.120 --> 06:49.000
So we tried to make it easier to join Matrix.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.280
Number one, I already mentioned it.

06:51.280 --> 06:55.640
We created a way to use your WordPress.org account to access Matrix.

06:55.640 --> 06:59.440
And we created it in a way that anybody could install this plugin on their own server to

06:59.440 --> 07:05.960
use it to authenticate a user against, like, to join a Matrix server.

07:05.960 --> 07:12.680
And with the upcoming OpenMidiConnect being like full in for Matrix, this is a potential

07:12.680 --> 07:14.680
authentication provider.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.760
Yeah, so on WordPress.org, we've installed it.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.840
People can use the WordPress.org account.

07:20.840 --> 07:26.080
They will go through their WordPress login screen and just authorize the WordPress server

07:26.080 --> 07:29.320
to submit the information to Matrix.

07:29.320 --> 07:35.120
Number two, we created a Matrix client in a WordPress blog.

07:35.120 --> 07:39.280
So a WordPress page is made up of blocks.

07:39.280 --> 07:44.720
And those blocks, one of them can now be a Matrix chat.

07:44.720 --> 07:48.520
So we call it Chattricks.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.760
And you can configure each block individually.

07:50.760 --> 07:55.040
So one thing that you can do is you can pre-define the home server, which we'll do.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.280
But you can also restrict it to a single room.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.920
It's based on hydrogen.

07:59.920 --> 08:01.840
And we did some upstream contributions.

08:01.840 --> 08:07.440
So before we used it, hydrogen had, you could only have one hydrogen open in the whole browser

08:07.440 --> 08:09.520
between tabs even.

08:09.520 --> 08:13.600
So we contributed something so that you can use it in multiple blocks on the same page.

08:13.600 --> 08:19.520
If you have multiple posts, typically they would be like all put on one page and then

08:19.520 --> 08:21.200
that wasn't possible before.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.960
And we had a couple of bug fixes to use hydrogen with SSO.

08:23.960 --> 08:28.800
I'm not sure how many people had used it with SSO before.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.080
And this allowed us to create team chat pages.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.200
So what does this mean?

08:34.200 --> 08:40.120
We can give a contributor a URL, a WordPress.org URL, where they should go for a meeting.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.840
They don't need to know this is Matrix.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.960
They just see it's a URL on WordPress.org.

08:45.960 --> 08:51.240
So for example, for the Make WordPress Core that creates WordPress Core, the address of

08:51.240 --> 08:54.720
the Make blog is make-wordpress.org-core.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.040
So the chat page is just slash chat.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.000
Core has different chats.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.840
There's another chat.

09:01.840 --> 09:04.680
The design team has a chat and so on.

09:04.680 --> 09:08.240
So this is what such a page looks like.

09:08.240 --> 09:13.080
On the top, you have a custom, like it's a WordPress post.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.840
You can put anything there.

09:14.840 --> 09:19.680
We put there when's the next meeting, instructions on how to go there, also instructions on if

09:19.680 --> 09:22.200
you want to use your own Matrix client how to get there.

09:22.200 --> 09:29.760
And this is the chat rigs block, which shows the room at the time.

09:29.760 --> 09:36.040
For FOSDA, my colleague Ashish created a small demo, and it uses the WordPress Playground,

09:36.040 --> 09:41.520
which is an interesting concept where you can run WordPress in your browser, and you

09:41.520 --> 09:45.160
can test any plugin in a sandbox in your browser.

09:45.160 --> 09:50.040
So I've recorded a demo video, to be sure, but it's real time, so as it loads, you can

09:50.040 --> 09:51.520
see it's pretty fast.

09:52.640 --> 10:02.800
So this now loads WordPress, and we've preconfigured it with a chat rigs block, and here it joined

10:02.800 --> 10:04.120
the chat.

10:04.120 --> 10:13.680
You can go there and enter a message, and all you have to know is the URL of this page.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.320
If you want to add such a block to the page, this is how you do it.

10:16.320 --> 10:19.240
You use the Gutenberg block editor.

10:19.240 --> 10:20.240
You add the block.

10:20.280 --> 10:21.280
You configure it.

10:21.280 --> 10:24.280
You set a home server.

10:24.280 --> 10:27.640
And if you want to lock it down to a room, you don't have to, but it can be practical

10:27.640 --> 10:28.640
to do it.

10:28.640 --> 10:38.400
You just enter the room name, and then the block loses the room list and just shows the

10:38.400 --> 10:40.960
room that you attached it to.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.520
And then you can...

10:42.520 --> 10:43.520
It's a block.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.360
You can add stuff before, after, as you wish.

10:46.360 --> 10:52.240
It's a pretty neat way of giving instructions to people, or putting, I don't know, meetup

10:52.240 --> 10:53.240
agendas, whatever.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.240
It's like, it's a post.

10:57.240 --> 11:02.840
Additionally, we created our own element instance.

11:02.840 --> 11:07.000
Just you can preconfigure it with the home server so that you don't have to tell people,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.560
you have to enter this home server into the login screen.

11:10.560 --> 11:16.320
It's something where people might typically get lost already.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.280
And we also created a bridge.

11:18.280 --> 11:28.480
So since we control both the bridge and the matrix server, we were able to create all

11:28.480 --> 11:33.280
the users on the matrix server and use the Slack bridge with a slightly forked version

11:33.280 --> 11:34.800
so that we can use puppeting.

11:34.800 --> 11:39.200
So when you post something on Slack, your matrix user already will say the same thing

11:39.200 --> 11:42.880
in your name.

11:42.880 --> 11:47.240
And there's some upstream fixes, by the way, that could be merged.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.240
And...

11:48.240 --> 11:57.400
Yeah, so that makes things quite streamlined.

11:57.400 --> 12:02.680
And another thing that we wanted to do, we didn't want to lose the history of Slack.

12:02.680 --> 12:07.320
But it's been a bit tricky because if you create a bridge, the bridge needs to start at some

12:07.320 --> 12:11.340
point and you cannot really backfill messages.

12:11.340 --> 12:15.500
So what we did, we figured out this little trick of first creating a room and bridging

12:15.500 --> 12:21.700
it, then creating a second room and migrating the history of that room there.

12:21.700 --> 12:25.660
Then we would add all users to that new room.

12:25.660 --> 12:31.900
We would import the old events in sequence so that we can backdate using an app service.

12:31.900 --> 12:36.020
And if the user is no longer in the room, we have to re-invite them and so on.

12:36.020 --> 12:39.660
And when we're finished, we can then copy the events from the first room that already

12:39.660 --> 12:45.260
started to be bridged and thus close the gap in the history.

12:45.260 --> 12:51.340
So there is this period between you importing or getting the data from Slack and bridging

12:51.340 --> 12:55.940
that this gives you a way to close that gap.

12:55.940 --> 12:59.860
And then we can change the room aliases, reattach the bridge, delete the old room.

12:59.860 --> 13:04.020
We've got a room with all history.

13:04.020 --> 13:09.620
So now we have a matrix server, community, it uses Synapse with a Slack bridge.

13:09.620 --> 13:14.620
Open ID Connect configured and with the app service.

13:14.620 --> 13:22.300
And we migrated 3 million messages in 170 rooms, 45k users, 55 gigabytes of database

13:22.300 --> 13:25.180
size.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.220
And during this process, we updated the community.

13:27.220 --> 13:31.780
We had held weekly meetings as it's common in WordPress.

13:31.780 --> 13:35.500
We published meeting notes afterwards.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.260
And we've got coverage from the tavern.

13:37.260 --> 13:41.180
So it's like first in January, like we're starting this in April.

13:41.180 --> 13:42.740
This is what we're continuing.

13:42.740 --> 13:47.380
We had to figure things out about private and public messages.

13:47.380 --> 13:50.860
And then we installed the matrix bridge.

13:50.860 --> 13:53.100
So now to the migration.

13:53.100 --> 13:57.820
In November, we announced we want to migrate to matrix.

13:57.820 --> 13:58.820
And this is how we'll do it.

13:58.820 --> 14:03.020
We'll ask people to use matrix instead of Slack.

14:03.260 --> 14:07.540
Before the final migration, we'll post a message in every Slack room.

14:07.540 --> 14:09.380
Slack will be closed.

14:09.380 --> 14:12.100
This is where you need to go for instructions.

14:12.100 --> 14:15.380
And then finally, disable postings.

14:15.380 --> 14:20.180
It's actually quite interesting that it's pretty hard to just kind of disable a Slack

14:20.180 --> 14:26.380
server because in a way you want to be sure that it's still around.

14:26.380 --> 14:30.660
The only way to completely shut it down is to delete it, which is a destructive operation.

14:30.660 --> 14:34.060
So what remains is that people could still DM.

14:34.060 --> 14:37.900
Well, OK.

14:37.900 --> 14:41.940
So the feedback that we anticipated from this.

14:41.940 --> 14:43.540
People want the default.

14:43.540 --> 14:47.140
So we would figure like they would use element.

14:47.140 --> 14:50.940
We knew that the notification element is not to everybody's liking.

14:50.940 --> 14:55.540
There's no dedicated threads and mentions view as in Slack.

14:55.540 --> 14:56.540
Threads is coming.

14:56.540 --> 14:59.740
I saw it.

14:59.820 --> 15:05.860
There's a couple of things that people are used to from Slack that are a bit different.

15:05.860 --> 15:06.860
We anticipated that.

15:06.860 --> 15:09.980
So we felt like people could live without that.

15:09.980 --> 15:13.100
People in matrix have been living without it for a while.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.460
Search is a bit difficult.

15:14.460 --> 15:18.660
There's no search langes in element.

15:18.660 --> 15:23.220
And while there are many other clients, some of them miss important features like threads

15:23.220 --> 15:27.940
or have implementations that are kind of different.

15:27.940 --> 15:30.100
I mean, I've tested some of them.

15:30.100 --> 15:34.460
Nico, for example, it works, but it's different.

15:34.460 --> 15:38.340
And then when you provide a home server to community, it comes with all sorts of troubles.

15:38.340 --> 15:42.260
So you cannot limit people creating rooms on the home server.

15:42.260 --> 15:45.340
So people will create some spam rooms, whatever.

15:45.340 --> 15:48.900
So you need to be aware of that.

15:48.900 --> 15:52.500
So we started to collect issues by the community.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.820
So they said we are unable to force some things like we can on Slack.

15:55.820 --> 16:01.540
So you cannot reduce the time allowed for editing messages.

16:01.540 --> 16:04.700
You cannot enforce room membership for federated users.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.540
Well, okay.

16:06.540 --> 16:10.380
Thread messages in Slack, you can say, I want this message to also be posted to the main

16:10.380 --> 16:11.380
room.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.580
It doesn't work.

16:13.580 --> 16:16.460
Other Slack features, they're considered essential.

16:16.460 --> 16:20.820
You cannot ping a group on matrix.

16:20.820 --> 16:22.140
And you cannot ping here.

16:22.140 --> 16:27.980
As the room mentioned, but there is stuff that when you have one central server that

16:27.980 --> 16:31.820
you can enforce that you cannot enforce on a distributed environment.

16:31.820 --> 16:35.740
And scheduling of messages, reminders, not there yet.

16:35.740 --> 16:41.340
Through a bot maybe, but not in the UI well integrated as in Slack.

16:41.340 --> 16:43.100
Then accessibility problems.

16:43.100 --> 16:47.940
So there has been an initiative to improve elements accessibility, but there are still

16:47.940 --> 16:50.980
gaps like macro navigation.

16:50.980 --> 16:53.020
This over wasn't super great.

16:53.020 --> 16:59.660
Then we had bridges, glitches like out of other messages, duplicates, double, yeah.

16:59.660 --> 17:02.620
All sorts of small issues.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.140
Use experience around threads management, obviously.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.980
We anticipated that.

17:06.980 --> 17:12.260
Then some things that don't work with matrix failing to load time zone positioning, lots

17:12.260 --> 17:16.900
of user join events that can make things pretty slow.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.060
So what we did to address this.

17:19.060 --> 17:23.140
We implemented integrations and many fixes via bots.

17:23.140 --> 17:24.580
We used the mobile framework.

17:24.580 --> 17:28.460
We could use the RSS bot, GitHub bot.

17:28.460 --> 17:32.220
We tried to make it easier to migrate our own Slack integrations.

17:32.220 --> 17:36.340
So we have a post to room bot that uses the web hook to post messages to the room.

17:36.340 --> 17:41.980
The other direction, how can something on our servers react to something in a room?

17:41.980 --> 17:43.800
We implemented group mentions.

17:43.800 --> 17:44.800
Not super great.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.940
If you post a command to the bot, it will post another message mentioning everybody in

17:48.940 --> 17:50.220
the group.

17:50.220 --> 17:52.020
Which there are some very large groups.

17:52.020 --> 17:55.180
So there could be very long messages.

17:55.180 --> 18:01.100
And watchdog so that we can be alerted if some spam rooms are created by some community

18:01.100 --> 18:03.500
members.

18:03.500 --> 18:08.380
We also, because we had our own element instance, we could ship fixes there while they're waiting

18:08.380 --> 18:10.980
to be merged.

18:10.980 --> 18:14.700
We provided the channel for the community where they could get help.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.340
We created the commutation and guides.

18:17.340 --> 18:19.620
But we had to stop the migration.

18:19.620 --> 18:23.140
So Matt called off the migration at the state of the word.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.180
Then we posted about it.

18:25.180 --> 18:27.580
And in turns out the accessibility problems were too big.

18:27.580 --> 18:29.900
We weren't able to merge them in time.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.580
We submitted the patches upstream.

18:33.580 --> 18:41.260
And there was uncertainty around where, like, are UI needs, where are they on elements roadmap?

18:41.260 --> 18:46.340
What are the effects of the license changes that were announced with Synapse?

18:46.340 --> 18:50.580
And overall, like, do those changes mean that the ethos of the WordPress project are no

18:50.580 --> 18:54.460
longer aligned with the element or the matrix project?

18:54.460 --> 19:00.100
It's kind of, it creates a bit of uncertainty that was detrimental to the migration.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.060
So the current status.

19:02.060 --> 19:04.940
The WordPress community remains a Slack community.

19:04.940 --> 19:09.940
But now with the matrix bridge and all Slack history, new contributors can no longer need

19:09.940 --> 19:13.300
a Slack account to join the conversations.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.820
And turning off Slack is currently not planned.

19:15.820 --> 19:19.540
And we'll keep observing how the matrix product develops.

19:19.540 --> 19:25.060
So in summary, the WordPress community didn't fully merge and migrate in the end.

19:25.060 --> 19:29.500
But maybe the things that didn't work for us are not so important for you.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.780
We are a huge community.

19:30.780 --> 19:33.100
There's many voices.

19:33.100 --> 19:37.220
I could see in a smaller community those things not being as important.

19:37.220 --> 19:41.420
And I hope that this talk was able to help you identify which is important for us and

19:41.420 --> 19:48.300
decide if you are kind of suffering or not suffering under the same issues.

19:48.300 --> 19:51.420
Along the way, we did a lot of open source contributions.

19:51.420 --> 19:53.380
The WordPress plugins I mentioned.

19:53.380 --> 20:00.460
To matrix, open source, all our bots, the migration app service patches upstream.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.780
And that is it.

20:01.780 --> 20:02.780
Thank you.

20:02.780 --> 20:12.780
Yeah, check out the slides.

20:12.780 --> 20:14.780
There's lots of links in the slides.

20:14.780 --> 20:20.780
Yeah, so you mentioned that migration, you want to fill in your room with Slack and

20:20.780 --> 20:22.780
in for the messages there.

20:22.780 --> 20:26.780
You actually don't really have to do that because a lot of the bridges actually allow

20:26.780 --> 20:29.780
you to, the four messages that come in the history.

20:29.780 --> 20:41.780
So the question was whether we were using the functions of a bridge to get back the

20:41.780 --> 20:44.260
old messages.

20:44.260 --> 20:49.300
So in our experiences, it wasn't possible to backdate the messages.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.780
That was the main issue there.

20:51.780 --> 20:59.780
I suppose if you, it depends on the implementation on the matrix server.

20:59.780 --> 21:02.780
Maybe there's no, okay.

21:02.780 --> 21:04.780
Okay, so the question was whether we considered the

21:04.780 --> 21:09.900
relationship funnel?

21:09.900 --> 21:19.740
So that's a good question.

21:19.740 --> 21:27.900
Okay, so the question was whether we considered to use.

21:27.900 --> 21:29.820
to send another message.

21:29.820 --> 21:33.820
Okay, so the question was whether we considered to use

21:34.740 --> 21:36.800
an app service to change the push rules for a user

21:36.800 --> 21:38.820
in order to enable group mentions.

21:39.660 --> 21:40.980
No, we haven't considered that.

21:43.340 --> 21:44.940
Maybe it's a possibility.

21:44.940 --> 21:47.140
I don't know if the user would,

21:48.540 --> 21:53.540
basically you're saying that you would add a keyword

21:53.700 --> 21:55.680
to the user so that they would be mentioned

21:55.680 --> 21:57.740
and you would configure it for them.

21:57.740 --> 21:59.180
Maybe that's a possibility.

21:59.180 --> 22:03.700
Yeah, you were saying there were some accessibility

22:03.700 --> 22:05.820
problems which were kind of killed this.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.420
Could you give us a little detail of what was actually

22:07.420 --> 22:09.340
missing or what problems were that were?

22:09.340 --> 22:13.460
Sure, so the most important problems were around

22:13.460 --> 22:17.340
macro keyboard navigation, so navigating between

22:17.340 --> 22:19.460
the bigger sections of the app.

22:19.460 --> 22:22.060
So there's the sidebar of the spaces,

22:22.060 --> 22:24.900
there's the room list, there's the search menu

22:24.900 --> 22:26.180
and the messages.

22:26.180 --> 22:29.020
And for example, you couldn't get up the message list

22:29.020 --> 22:30.660
using the keyboard.

22:30.660 --> 22:34.960
And if you were able to somehow get into that area,

22:34.960 --> 22:38.340
then the voiceover read out wasn't very useful.

22:38.340 --> 22:41.740
It repeated for every message, for example, profile picture.

22:41.740 --> 22:46.740
It, so stuff like that had been annoying people.

22:48.820 --> 22:51.500
Thank you for the POS, but like the accessibility

22:51.500 --> 22:53.500
when I was outside, I think it's already reviewed.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.380
One of the other plans.

22:55.580 --> 22:58.620
Matthew said the accessibility team has reviewed

22:58.620 --> 23:00.220
the patches that were submitted.

23:01.980 --> 23:02.820
Other questions?

23:02.820 --> 23:03.660
Yeah.

23:03.660 --> 23:06.980
Did you have to disable some of those integrations

23:06.980 --> 23:08.420
or work around that you mentioned?

23:08.420 --> 23:13.420
For example, I imagine that here things

23:13.620 --> 23:16.180
wouldn't work very well on both sides

23:16.180 --> 23:17.380
in a different way.

23:17.380 --> 23:19.620
All right, the question was whether we had to disable

23:19.620 --> 23:20.780
integrations.

23:20.780 --> 23:22.260
So one interesting thing about the bridge

23:22.260 --> 23:23.820
is that it works in both ways.

23:23.820 --> 23:27.100
So migrating and integration could be done in a way

23:27.100 --> 23:30.820
that you first enable, like you create the migration

23:30.820 --> 23:32.540
on the matrix side and when it's ready,

23:32.540 --> 23:33.900
you turn it off on the slack side

23:33.900 --> 23:36.140
and enable it on the matrix side.

23:36.140 --> 23:39.820
And still both sides would be able to use the integration.

23:39.820 --> 23:43.380
So for the here one, well, it only worked on slack

23:43.380 --> 23:46.940
in the end, but I don't know, it depends on the team.

23:46.940 --> 23:49.580
Like part of the WordPress project,

23:49.580 --> 23:51.340
like there are so many teams that every team

23:51.340 --> 23:53.660
has their own ways of doing meetings.

23:53.660 --> 23:56.260
And some heavily rely on those group mentions,

23:56.260 --> 23:58.780
others don't, some need the here mention,

23:58.780 --> 24:02.420
others don't, it's like hard to make everybody happy

24:02.420 --> 24:03.260
all the time.

24:03.260 --> 24:06.820
So that's probably part of such a big migration

24:06.820 --> 24:10.900
that it's really, yeah, you get so many opinions

24:10.900 --> 24:15.100
and as with many communities, there are some

24:15.100 --> 24:16.340
louder than others.

24:17.340 --> 24:18.780
So the question from the internet,

24:18.780 --> 24:21.620
where can you find the tools you have used

24:21.620 --> 24:24.780
for the migration of the history of the room?

24:24.780 --> 24:26.820
Yeah, so the question from the internet was

24:26.820 --> 24:29.420
how we, if you can access the tools.

24:29.420 --> 24:32.260
So I recommend you to look at the slides,

24:32.260 --> 24:34.900
in the slide where I talk about the app service migration,

24:34.900 --> 24:36.260
that's where it's linked.

24:37.900 --> 24:40.700
Is there any integration with Element Call?

24:42.260 --> 24:44.180
The question was whether we did integration

24:44.180 --> 24:45.780
with Element Call, no we didn't.

24:47.180 --> 24:50.620
There is no culture of using video conferencing

24:52.180 --> 24:54.300
in the regular, some teams use it,

24:54.300 --> 24:56.820
but they tend to use Zoom at the moment I think.

24:59.300 --> 25:01.820
Yeah, it's depending on the team what they use.

25:01.820 --> 25:04.340
So for example, Slack Huddles as an alternative on Slack

25:04.340 --> 25:06.140
are not being used as far as I know.

25:08.660 --> 25:11.500
Is there a possibility for the migration?

25:11.500 --> 25:15.340
Or is it more of a licensing issue

25:15.340 --> 25:17.340
of accessibility?

25:17.340 --> 25:19.740
So the question was whether there is a possibility

25:19.740 --> 25:21.220
to complete the migration.

25:22.580 --> 25:25.540
I think it's certainly possible at the moment.

25:25.540 --> 25:28.620
I think there has been a bit of tension

25:28.620 --> 25:31.980
of implementing the migration fast

25:31.980 --> 25:34.140
so that people are not left behind.

25:34.140 --> 25:37.140
Like if you let the migration linger for a long time,

25:37.140 --> 25:40.300
then people will never migrate and then always at the end,

25:40.300 --> 25:43.060
like people get panic and then they do the migration

25:43.060 --> 25:45.140
so the whole long period is wasted kind of.

25:45.780 --> 25:50.780
So that's why the initial plan was to have it rather short.

25:51.460 --> 25:54.260
But on the other hand, I think this current hybrid state

25:54.260 --> 25:56.340
is not as bad as you would imagine

25:56.340 --> 26:00.380
because for new contributors, we've got this easy onboarding

26:00.380 --> 26:03.060
and one thing that I liked about this,

26:03.060 --> 26:06.060
the way that we implemented is that you can kind of

26:06.060 --> 26:08.340
slowly upgrade your experience.

26:08.340 --> 26:12.260
You start with the chat message, the chat URL,

26:12.260 --> 26:13.740
and then if you use it a lot,

26:13.740 --> 26:17.460
you could upgrade to elements, the one that we hosted,

26:17.460 --> 26:19.380
and then you could upgrade to another client.

26:19.380 --> 26:23.380
So I think that's an interesting way

26:24.740 --> 26:28.900
of luring people in.

26:28.900 --> 26:33.900
So maybe over time, the number of metrics users

26:35.220 --> 26:37.940
will increase so much that it becomes like a request

26:37.940 --> 26:39.380
from the community.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.180
But as of now, we're kind of waiting

26:41.180 --> 26:43.180
what the license changes do.

26:44.580 --> 26:47.940
And yeah, this hybrid state is one that I think

26:47.940 --> 26:49.340
is acceptable for the moment.

26:52.860 --> 26:54.220
Okay, no more questions?

26:55.100 --> 26:55.980
One more time.

26:55.980 --> 26:56.820
No more time.

26:56.820 --> 26:58.980
One last question.

26:58.980 --> 26:59.820
Matthew.

26:59.820 --> 27:02.220
I just want to know what it is about the license change

27:02.220 --> 27:04.100
on SNAPs that is causing it to.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.460
I invited to talk to Matt.

27:08.460 --> 27:13.460
Yeah, it's basically like WordPress is on the GPL

27:16.340 --> 27:20.260
license where you used to be able to modify software

27:20.260 --> 27:25.260
