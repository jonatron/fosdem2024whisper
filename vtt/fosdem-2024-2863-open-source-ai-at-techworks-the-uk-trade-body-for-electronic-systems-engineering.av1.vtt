00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Okay, so our final talk today is by Jeremy Bennett here.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
I have some notes.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
So you live in Southampton also, which is also in England.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
By the New Forest, which is almost a thousand years old.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
You spent some time in Paris and Nuremberg, which is great.

00:26.000 --> 00:31.000
You adore compilers from what seems like from reading this.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
And you have acted with Hugh Grant?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Wow, that's an interesting story.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
Alright, sir. Jeremy, take it away.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.000
Thank you very much.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
You can ask me later where and when I acted with Hugh Grant.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Okay, this is our last talk.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
It's only a short talk and it's a bit of a long story.

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
I want to talk to you about my work I do in my spare time

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
and William works with as well with tech works.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Anyone here heard of tech works?

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
It's the trade body for electronic systems in the UK.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
And just in case you think that's relevant,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
it's worth about 100 billion a year to the UK economy.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
It's about a million people working in that industry.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
It's 8% of the entire British economy.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
There's a reason why the minister turns up to the annual meeting.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
He listened. So it's a powerful body

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
and you will certainly know the members, IBM, ARM, Cadence,

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
Mentor, Siemens and the like.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
So it's a big body.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
It covers a lot of things.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
It was originally the National Microelectronics Institute

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
and that's the one on the top right there

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
that looks after silicon chip design.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Going round, you've got Power Electronics Group.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
You've got the UK Electronics Skills Foundation

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
which is the educational charity arm

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
that oversees students' internships

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
going into universities across the country.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
There's TechNest which is the embedded software group.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
There's eSIN, the Automotive Expert Group

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
that looks after the automotive industry.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
And lastly, there's the Internet of Things Security Foundation.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I'll come back to that.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Now, what are they doing here?

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
Because they're not an open source organization, anything but.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
But part of our role as open source engineers

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
is to educate the wider world

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
into the merits of openness.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
And I want to draw your attention

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
to the Internet of Things Security Foundation

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
and that's what it says on their front page.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Okay?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Material is published.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
It's a contribution from industry

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
and you can download the material

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
and you can download them for free.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Okay?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
They're freely available to you

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
and indeed there's an example of one

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
and when we say free,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
we mean a Creative Commons attribution license.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
And that's a perfectly valid open license

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
for what is documentation fundamentally.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
And so even though this has some of the biggest proprietary people amongst it,

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
they have chosen to do their standardization work,

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
their best practice work,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
their guides to the engineers in the industry

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
to make them fully open.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
And they were put together by an open process

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
and one of my open source engineers,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
you'll find his name in that document

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
because he wrote a big chunk of it.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
And that's where the open philosophy is something you sell to them.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
And I was one of the group that sold the idea

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
of doing this in the open

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
and I'm a founder member of the Internet of Things Security Foundation.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
So how does that apply to AI?

03:43.000 --> 03:50.000
Well, William and I have been heavily involved with AI at TechWorks.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
I have the last year or two been co-chair with Mike Bartley

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
of the AI initiative we've had going on long under the hood.

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
And most of our members are experienced professional engineers

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
and I think we heard a lot earlier from Stefania

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
about the importance of education,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
but I'm particularly interested in the education

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
of people who are already experienced.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
We've got lots of experienced engineers.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
How do you bring those people into a new industry?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
They've got their marketing guys telling them

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
our new product's got to have AI

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
and that's probably about the detail they get in their product spec.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
And they've got to implement it.

04:29.000 --> 04:33.000
So what TechWorks is trying to do is fill a gap in the market

04:33.000 --> 04:38.000
by making guidance available to those professional members it has.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
And the initial things we're going to start on is guidance on trustable AI

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
because that's seen as one of the barriers in our industry.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
And quite honestly, if you've got companies that are making jet engine controllers

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
you really want to trust any AI they put into them.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
And more generally, the professional engineer.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
So actually what William and I have been working on

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
and you can join the meetings if you want to,

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
the next thing that we've been doing is the best practices guide.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
We're not trying to tell you how to do AI.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
We're giving you the pointers so you can do it.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
We're not duplicating what other people are doing.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
We're trying to provide you the set of questions,

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
a Q and A you can go to to say,

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
should I even be using AI in this product?

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
If I should be using AI, what sort of AI?

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
What are the questions and risks I need to address?

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
And the idea is if you're an engineer, but you don't know AI,

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
it'll help you make a good job of your first project and subsequent projects.

05:41.500 --> 05:47.500
And hot news, this is I think the first public meeting this has been announced.

05:47.500 --> 05:51.500
So TechWorks announced its new AI innovation cross working group.

05:51.500 --> 05:56.000
It's a cross working group because it doesn't fit in any of one of those subsidiary organisations.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
So we'll work with Automotive, we'll work with Power Electronics,

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
we'll work with the Electronic Skills Foundation, we'll work with the In their Things Security Foundation.

06:04.000 --> 06:14.000
It was announced on Thursday, there will be a launch event in London and then there will be more public events.

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
The launch event quite honestly is to get the key influences in there to understand.

06:20.000 --> 06:27.000
So it'll be aimed at the government, both the civil service and the politicians.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
It'll be aimed at senior managers in the industry across the UK.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
And then we'll propagate it down and there'll be lots of events for the ordinary working engineer.

06:39.000 --> 06:49.000
But the good thing about that is the work we'll be doing will just like the In their Things Security Foundation be in the open.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
And there wasn't even a question about doing that this time.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
It was taken as given because it was seen what the success is.

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
So really my talk is just an appeal to you is don't just engage with the open source community, engage with the wider engineering community

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
and try and bring them online for using open source.

07:09.000 --> 07:16.000
And I'm hoping next year we'll come back and we'll be lots of feedback and this group will have fed into the other groups you've heard around here

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
and will have drawn on what they've done and will be a useful addition to what's there.

07:21.000 --> 07:27.000
I say you can get involved with the best practice group, just send William an email and he'll hear it.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
So I'm the last speaker today.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000
So I've got the, my last slide is nothing to do with tech works. It's some thank yous.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
So thank yous to those here.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
So I'd like to thank Will Jones, who's been overall charge of organizing this room.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
I'd like to thank JJ for chairing all day and JJ hasn't taken a break.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
I tried to make him take a break but he's indestructible.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
So he's gone through the whole day.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
Michelle from the Nagara, Jonathan and Stefania.

07:57.000 --> 08:04.000
I think Stefania's had to rush off for all their work from the European network on AI safety.

08:04.000 --> 08:14.000
And those four people, I should say there were four submissions to do an AI dev room and we've put all four submissions together.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
So you've got the best of four possible dev rooms you could have had all rolled into one.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
But the most important people making a success are all of you.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
We've had tremendous interaction.

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
I've not been in all the talks but when I have, it's been great to have that.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
So thank you very much and of course we'll see you all next year.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
Thank you.
