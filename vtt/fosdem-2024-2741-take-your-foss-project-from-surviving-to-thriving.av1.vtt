WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.520
Good morning everyone. We have Ryan here talking to us about open source and yeah, take it

00:12.520 --> 00:14.520
away Ryan.

00:14.520 --> 00:25.560
Thank you. One problem with having your talk first thing in the morning is there are a

00:25.560 --> 00:30.360
lot of missing seats and I'm pretty sure that's because I saw almost everyone here out last

00:30.360 --> 00:32.360
night drinking really late.

00:32.360 --> 00:45.360
Louder? Is this better? No? I'm not sure I can make it louder. Is there a set? Is there a?

00:45.360 --> 00:47.360
Okay.

00:47.360 --> 00:54.760
How about if I just talk like this for a little bit? That's going to be hard because the thing

00:54.760 --> 01:00.280
you didn't hear was I said we're missing people because I saw them all out drinking last night

01:00.280 --> 01:06.080
which included me so talking at this volume the whole time is going to leave me without

01:06.080 --> 01:09.720
the ability to do anything the rest of today.

01:09.720 --> 01:19.520
I'm Ryan Sypes. I'm the managing director of product for the Thunderbird team at Mozilla.

01:19.520 --> 01:25.920
And that's a little weird to say because Thunderbird exists in a different Mozilla than you guys

01:25.920 --> 01:32.280
all know. There's a foundation which is a non-profit. Hey, that's perfect. And there's

01:32.280 --> 01:39.120
a corporation that develops Firefox and then there's another corporation called MZLA that

01:39.120 --> 01:49.040
develops Thunderbird. And that's due to a unique history of not being sustainable, of

01:49.040 --> 01:56.360
Thunderbird not being sustainable. There's a great product, a great open source project

01:56.360 --> 02:05.240
attracted a lot of users. There are multiple counts and depending on which one you believe

02:05.240 --> 02:12.520
I happen to believe we attracted as many as 30 million users at one point and not at all

02:12.520 --> 02:20.120
monetizable. At least that's the telling that I got when I came on the project which is

02:20.120 --> 02:25.080
we haven't really found a way to make money off of this so paying developers is hard so

02:25.440 --> 02:36.680
we're giving it back to the community to Steward. And so that takes me into this talk

02:36.680 --> 02:46.720
where when I came on it was a project that was run by a very active community of volunteers

02:46.760 --> 02:59.320
and there were a couple of us, a few of us who were able to work on it for a job. I came on

02:59.320 --> 03:04.320
part-time as community manager and if I remember right there were only two other people when I

03:04.320 --> 03:13.120
came on. For a product that still had 25 million users there were a lot of days that we couldn't

03:13.200 --> 03:24.600
even build the product literally like it would be a red tree every day and we would have to work

03:24.600 --> 03:33.440
really hard just to get it into a buildable state. I'm speaking to a room of developers and so I

03:33.440 --> 03:40.240
can say that a lot of that was because we were downstream from Firefox which had a thousand

03:40.320 --> 03:48.720
people working and developing the product every day and so absorbing that, thousands of changes in

03:48.720 --> 03:58.120
a week for someone who only had one single developer working full-time and was difficult.

03:59.120 --> 04:10.600
But that's the backdrop against to kick off a story of success. Maybe one of the few stories of

04:10.600 --> 04:23.560
really incredible success around sustainability and open source. So why do I have credibility to

04:23.640 --> 04:32.760
give a talk on sustainability and success in open source? This is our revenue year over year.

04:32.760 --> 04:49.320
2017 is when I came on, 2023 obviously last year and when I came on it wasn't bad. We had $700,000

04:49.640 --> 05:00.040
in donation revenue last year. That number is $8.9 million in donation revenue.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.960
Going on to an online percentage calculator,

05:10.200 --> 05:18.920
I determined that's a 1,108% increase over the last six years.

05:27.240 --> 05:32.680
When you start to move, when the bars in that graph start to get higher and higher,

05:33.640 --> 05:35.640
people start asking you why?

05:38.360 --> 05:43.400
And it may seem like an easy answer. You're like, there has to be a why.

05:45.480 --> 05:49.560
And yes, the whole time I knew there was a why.

05:51.960 --> 05:59.320
But describing that to someone else felt like I need you to understand about 600 things

06:00.280 --> 06:07.480
and then we can talk about why. So for you guys, I did the thing of distilling

06:08.280 --> 06:13.640
600 things into three, which I'm going to try to impart on you.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.960
And why is this important?

06:18.600 --> 06:30.680
Well, I believe it's really important for every open source project

06:32.680 --> 06:37.160
to have a map to sustainability.

06:40.600 --> 06:46.920
I took a class a few years ago around product management.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.520
And one thing I was really struck by was

06:53.320 --> 07:03.240
the professor said every product before you launch it should have a business model.

07:04.920 --> 07:11.240
Even if you're not going to deploy the business model to make money, if you're a startup, let's say,

07:11.720 --> 07:23.880
your intention is just to grab users, as many users as you can, and not monetize the product.

07:25.800 --> 07:36.120
It was this person's opinion that you should know when and how you're intending to monetize

07:37.400 --> 07:38.040
the product.

07:41.960 --> 07:51.240
In open source software, I would say that that's not always the case. You know, you don't always

07:51.240 --> 07:55.880
intend to monetize your open source software and in fact, you shouldn't always.

07:57.560 --> 08:02.200
But you should always have a plan for how you're going to sustain the project.

08:04.040 --> 08:09.000
And I don't need to, you know, originally I was going to find some articles of really big

08:09.000 --> 08:17.080
open source projects that had really sad episodes or endings. But then I decided you guys know

08:18.120 --> 08:27.480
many of them, which is, the story is pretty common, right? Like you have a person or a group of people

08:28.040 --> 08:35.800
working on a piece of software. It gets really popular. And then something happens to that person

08:35.800 --> 08:43.400
or this group of people. And it doesn't even have to be a sad episode. It could be that the person

08:43.400 --> 08:53.160
developing the software has a kid and loses time to work on the software. But it could also be sad,

08:53.160 --> 08:58.760
you know, they die. Okay, now the software is going to go stale. There's no one to maintain it.

08:58.840 --> 09:11.640
And so it's my strong opinion, just like that professor who said you need a business model,

09:12.680 --> 09:20.760
that you need a sustainability plan for your software. And this will come back to Thunderbird

09:20.760 --> 09:24.840
again. So I can tell the rest of that story. I'm going to drink some water.

09:29.320 --> 09:37.880
A sustainability plan is you just forecasting into the future and saying

09:40.120 --> 09:43.640
this project, or maybe you don't have to forecast in the future. Maybe you're already

09:44.600 --> 09:49.480
running a successful open source project. But you sit down, you say,

09:51.320 --> 09:58.040
how are we going to make sure that there's always someone or a group of people developing this

09:58.040 --> 10:08.360
software? Or you can say, which I don't recommend, but you could say, no, it's just me. And when I

10:08.360 --> 10:16.840
die, it dies. And that's okay too. Now, at least you've thought it through. But let's say that you

10:16.840 --> 10:25.560
want your software to be healthy and go into the future in a way that people can count on it.

10:26.360 --> 10:36.280
As I spill my water all over myself in front of like 100 people,

10:39.800 --> 10:45.960
you need to lay out a plan. And for Thunderbird, I think that plan

10:48.120 --> 10:53.240
should have been developed from the start. So that plan would have said

10:56.280 --> 11:02.920
we're going to try to a couple of methods to monetize this.

11:05.000 --> 11:13.480
And because we know we need at least a handful of developers in order to consistently develop

11:13.480 --> 11:21.880
this software, simple, right? That's all it needs to be. You say one person is not going to maintain this.

11:22.600 --> 11:31.320
So we're going to have to figure out how to monetize this project so that we can pay people to work on

11:31.320 --> 11:46.280
it in order to sustain it. And the fact that that didn't work out is why Thunderbird entered dire

11:46.360 --> 11:54.360
straights. And what we ultimately figured out,

11:56.840 --> 12:05.640
at least for now, and plans can change, is that our sustainability plan was to

12:07.240 --> 12:15.000
tell, we know we need at least a handful of people working on Thunderbird in order for

12:15.720 --> 12:21.320
the software to work. That's just, I live through the volunteer days of it,

12:22.440 --> 12:28.120
and that's not, it was not pleasant, it was not good, it was not a way to sustain the software.

12:29.000 --> 12:39.320
And so the answer had to be, no, we have to pay people to work on this, to do the crappy stuff,

12:39.320 --> 12:46.120
to maintain it. It's not always pretty work, but it has to be done and therefore we need money,

12:46.120 --> 12:51.240
because people are not going to actually do some of the stuff that we need them to do unless we pay

12:51.240 --> 12:59.880
them, because we know that from experience. We were trying to, I was talking to a bunch of people

13:00.440 --> 13:07.720
about what Thunderbird looked like when I came on. And to drive this point home,

13:10.520 --> 13:15.320
I've now heard a bunch of different ways to describe it, but the one that I thought of last

13:15.320 --> 13:21.960
night is, you go into a house, maybe you buy a house, and you walk in and you're like, man,

13:21.960 --> 13:26.920
this is a really nice house, it's big. A lot of people, you know, really like it, they come by,

13:27.000 --> 13:32.920
they check it out. And then you're like, all I'm going to do is I'm just going to update the kitchen,

13:34.280 --> 13:43.640
because the kitchen looks a little dated. And like you start pulling out the cabinets,

13:45.000 --> 13:52.840
and there's just like termites everywhere, there's a pipe just like shooting water off in one direction,

13:52.840 --> 14:02.040
and like, it's just not pretty. And every time you go to change something in that house,

14:02.040 --> 14:06.360
it's the same thing. Like you just like open a closet, and there's like a clown in there,

14:06.360 --> 14:11.160
and you're just like, I'm just going to close the closet and not think about that for a little while.

14:13.480 --> 14:21.320
And so for us, we had to somehow, we said, okay, you can't sustain this project

14:21.880 --> 14:25.400
with just random people off the internet working on whatever they want to do,

14:26.040 --> 14:28.920
whatever they want to add. In fact, that's really bad. That's like,

14:30.040 --> 14:35.400
all this structural problems with this house, and someone's like putting a pool on the roof.

14:36.360 --> 14:44.200
And so we needed a plan, and that came in the form of trying to monetize it.

14:44.360 --> 15:00.280
So, to come to a sustainability plan, you kind of have to ask yourself some key questions.

15:01.480 --> 15:07.720
And this is probably not that crazy, but I wonder how many of you have actually

15:07.720 --> 15:11.240
asked yourself this about your open source project. If you're not working on a project

15:11.240 --> 15:15.800
that's like Red Hat, like we know how Red Hat is sustained, we know how like,

15:15.800 --> 15:19.320
you're going to make money, you know how you're going to sustain the project, I hope, I don't know.

15:20.760 --> 15:32.040
But for me, something that I took stock of over the years at Thunderbird and tried to think about is,

15:32.040 --> 15:40.840
okay, how much effort does it take to do this project? In a perfect, maybe not a perfect world,

15:41.800 --> 15:49.560
in a the minimum viable level of effort, what is the minimum viable level of effort

15:49.560 --> 15:55.160
that it takes to maintain this project? And then I thought, you know,

15:57.000 --> 16:00.680
who are the key stakeholders? Well, that one was really easy, because that was like

16:01.400 --> 16:07.160
the tens of millions of users. They were definitely like the number one stakeholder.

16:07.400 --> 16:15.320
And then the third one, which I'm not sure anyone had really spent a lot of time thinking about,

16:15.320 --> 16:21.240
is how do we communicate with those stakeholders? Which

16:24.840 --> 16:33.400
businesses creating proprietary software, right from the outset, this is a thought that they're

16:34.280 --> 16:40.760
mulling around in their head, which is, okay, someone downloads a product, there's either

16:40.760 --> 16:46.760
something within the product that we're going to use as a mechanism to have a conversation

16:47.640 --> 16:55.480
with our users. Or there are other channels by which we have these conversations with our users.

16:55.720 --> 17:04.360
And that can serve a variety of purposes, right? Like one, obviously, for commercial

17:04.360 --> 17:12.440
product is to convert people to paying users. Maybe it's a free product and then you pay for

17:12.440 --> 17:23.160
some kind of additional features or whatever. For us, we really hadn't developed these mechanisms,

17:23.400 --> 17:29.880
and the people that we had following us, we're following us in places that

17:32.600 --> 17:39.320
we're only able to speak to a fraction of those users. So whether that's an IRC channel,

17:41.000 --> 17:49.320
you know, obviously, you're not capturing all of the Thunderbird users there, or a Twitter handle,

17:50.280 --> 17:53.080
not capturing even remotely all of the users there.

17:57.400 --> 18:03.720
And then once you kind of have answered the first one,

18:05.800 --> 18:09.000
you think about this fourth one, which is

18:09.000 --> 18:18.280
that aside the effort, what else does a project need? For Thunderbird, it's infrastructure,

18:19.560 --> 18:27.160
and building and distributing Thunderbird alone is like a source of cost in and of itself.

18:28.120 --> 18:33.000
So I call that out because you have to kind of take a holistic look at like,

18:33.000 --> 18:40.280
what does it take to build and distribute and make this software available to everyone?

18:41.800 --> 18:47.720
Okay, so I've told you a lot of really basic things that you probably could think about if you

18:47.720 --> 18:53.560
spent 15 minutes thinking about projects, and why did I do that?

18:53.880 --> 19:01.480
I've been contributing to open source for

19:02.200 --> 19:15.160
probably 20 years in some capacity or another, and I'm losing a lot of people. We're losing them.

19:15.880 --> 19:19.080
Yeah, I'm gonna have to like do a cartwheel or something.

19:25.160 --> 19:34.120
I call this out because I don't think most open source projects start from a place of any plan.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.720
I don't know if you guys agree, but oftentimes it's just like,

19:40.520 --> 19:45.880
I'm gonna do this cool thing. It's gonna scratch my itch, or it's gonna scratch the itch of people I

19:45.880 --> 19:57.640
know, and what happens happens. And talking about a sustainability plan, I'm asking you, please,

19:58.520 --> 20:05.160
for the love of God, don't do that. Just take the extra whatever it is, 10 minutes,

20:05.720 --> 20:09.160
to just think through, okay, best case scenario, I create this software.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.040
How am I gonna do, or how am I gonna think about these four things?

20:18.200 --> 20:26.360
Because what we don't need in the world is more un-maintained open source software that people

20:26.440 --> 20:38.600
rely on. Because that creates a bad ecosystem and a bad reputation for open source software,

20:39.160 --> 20:49.080
and we all know that. We all know people who we've turned on to open source software

20:49.400 --> 20:59.800
who essentially just say, oh yeah, well, I'll just use Thunderbird because I don't want to trash any

20:59.800 --> 21:06.760
project. But something you could imagine hearing about Thunderbird is someone's like,

21:07.480 --> 21:12.040
this is just crappy outlook. I can't afford outlook, or I can't use outlook for some reason,

21:12.040 --> 21:22.040
so I'm using crappy outlook. I don't believe that, but that is the result you get for not having

21:22.040 --> 21:29.080
a sustainable maintained open source project. And then if you're like family members of mine,

21:29.080 --> 21:37.160
and you learn that this is an open source project, and it is crappy outlook or crappy

21:37.160 --> 21:45.720
Photoshop, or insert the software of your choice here, you associate open source software with

21:47.080 --> 21:55.480
not as good. It's just not as good. And I don't think any of us want that to be the outcome of our work.

21:56.280 --> 22:14.120
One major challenge that I had in helping get Thunderbird to a place where it was sustainable

22:15.720 --> 22:20.920
was I had a community of developers who, whether or not they'd admit to believing this,

22:20.920 --> 22:28.360
this is what they believed. Not this, this is what I believe, but they believe that money was bad.

22:29.640 --> 22:37.240
Anytime I brought up the fact that we could do this to raise donations, they're like,

22:37.800 --> 22:46.280
we don't want to annoy the user. We should just make the software, and if they manage to stumble

22:46.280 --> 22:57.720
across a donation page somehow randomly, that's okay. And the thought I kept having in these

22:57.720 --> 23:04.360
conversations, because I was saying, oh, okay, once a year, we could just put a little thing,

23:04.360 --> 23:11.160
a little pop up or something that just says, did you know Thunderbird runs on donations?

23:11.800 --> 23:17.160
That's how we pay folks, like please give. And I got so much pushback for that.

23:19.880 --> 23:32.920
And it's because when you really talk to people, they thought that asking for money

23:33.400 --> 23:48.520
in a direct way to users was somehow not a activity that an open source project should do.

23:50.120 --> 23:56.440
I don't know where that comes from, but I know it's true of a lot of open source projects,

23:57.240 --> 24:03.560
because when folks started asking us, how did you raise donations? And I told them,

24:04.440 --> 24:11.160
one mechanism is we hit all users with a full page donation appeal every year. You just saw

24:11.160 --> 24:18.440
like their faces drop, and you could just tell that they were like, I'm not going to do that.

24:18.440 --> 24:27.560
And you know, it's funny because I also felt uncomfortable with that.

24:29.640 --> 24:36.680
I thought this is going to look like spam. This is going to be annoying. Maybe users will leave

24:36.680 --> 24:43.400
because it'll be like, I just want to do my email. And this is like bothering me,

24:43.400 --> 24:46.440
and I never want to see a popup again like this.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.040
And I don't remember which piece of software it was,

24:54.440 --> 25:03.000
but a little later after that thought, I was using some, oh, it was Evernote.

25:05.160 --> 25:12.120
I opened up Evernote. I don't actually use Evernote, but I had used it in the past, and I was like,

25:12.120 --> 25:19.960
I know I put a number in here that I need to remember. So I'm going to open it up and find that number.

25:22.200 --> 25:30.520
Before I could ever look at a note, it was like three things in succession that I had to exit out of.

25:32.680 --> 25:38.520
And it was, they were all like, you should pay us. And then it's like, no. And it's like, yeah, but

25:39.240 --> 25:44.360
you should pay us. And I'm like, no. It's like, well, if you don't pay us, we're going to do X, Y,

25:44.360 --> 25:53.240
and Z. And I'm like, no, I just need my number. But after that, I was like, you know what?

25:55.160 --> 26:00.600
I bet that's happened a lot in a lot of different programs. And I don't remember it because

26:03.240 --> 26:07.400
that's not an activity. Exiting out was not an activity that I committed to memory.

26:07.400 --> 26:11.720
It's just like, oh yeah, like, of course they're going to ask me for money, like, whatever.

26:13.080 --> 26:21.320
But that, my friends, was a eureka moment of like, I don't remember any software asking me for money,

26:21.320 --> 26:23.320
but I know they do it all the time.

26:23.640 --> 26:41.720
And so that's what we did. Popped up full screen once a year.

26:44.120 --> 26:47.960
Help keep Thunderbird alive. This is like the history of Thunderbird in one page.

26:48.920 --> 26:55.560
Did you know that less than 1% of Thunderbird users fund all of our work? That was especially true

26:55.560 --> 27:01.240
when this was displayed. Not too long ago, Thunderbird was on the verge of extinction.

27:03.240 --> 27:07.880
We don't show advertisements or sell your data. We're completely funded by donations from our

27:08.840 --> 27:19.800
community. That, my friends, is a $6.8 million appeal. Well, now it's more than that because we've run it

27:19.800 --> 27:26.840
twice. So it's a $15 million appeal. That, just this.

27:27.160 --> 27:45.720
And, you know, when I ask people, our users, do you remember the bird, the end of year donation

27:45.720 --> 27:54.760
appeal? I've asked probably, I don't know, 100, 150 users at this point about this appeal.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.040
You know what most of them say?

28:01.320 --> 28:07.720
I don't know what you're talking about. The bird, the Thunderbird, I'm like, no, he's a bird holding

28:07.720 --> 28:15.560
a heart. He popped up over your whole paid, you know, he took over your whole browser like a couple

28:15.560 --> 28:24.360
weeks back. No, I don't know. I don't remember. I'm sorry. This bird sounds really important to you,

28:25.960 --> 28:27.000
but I don't remember it.

28:27.720 --> 28:44.440
And some KDE guys asked me about, you know, raising donations. And I told them exactly what you might

28:44.440 --> 28:51.800
imagine came out of this, which was like, pop something up a couple times a year full screen.

28:52.120 --> 29:01.080
And they're like, you know, we don't ask often. Give us a little money. And they're like, people will,

29:02.280 --> 29:11.160
people will revolt. They'll change to, you know, I'm like, maybe, but honestly,

29:12.200 --> 29:18.040
it'll pop up in December and you'll ask them a week later. And they'll have no idea what you're

29:18.040 --> 29:24.440
talking about. Because if they don't donate, they're just going to hit the X and just move on

29:25.560 --> 29:30.040
and not think about it. Maybe next year they're like, oh, yeah, didn't they do this last year?

29:30.040 --> 29:39.320
But probably not. Because the moment they go to Wikipedia and get that appeal from our good friend,

29:39.880 --> 29:43.480
Mr. Wales, you know, these things are all invisible.

29:46.360 --> 29:49.480
This year we tried displaying this a few times a year.

29:51.640 --> 29:59.240
Donations went up. Nobody remembered. Nobody remembers the bird. It just doesn't, that's not

29:59.240 --> 30:05.480
how human brains work. We're so inundated with incoming signals all the time.

30:05.880 --> 30:18.040
And that's the point. You're not that annoying, maybe to your friends. But these appeals are not

30:18.040 --> 30:26.360
that annoying. Because we live in an information environment where this is just something people

30:26.360 --> 30:32.040
expect and something that people have grown to not see anymore.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.760
And so

30:40.440 --> 30:45.080
that's the takeaway. But there is one other thing.

30:47.400 --> 30:53.960
And now we'll go back into Thunderbird. Because ultimately I'm up here to both tell you how to

30:53.960 --> 30:59.960
make a sustainable project and implant in your head that you're going to come out of this and

30:59.960 --> 31:10.760
you're going to install Thunderbird. So we asked our users for money. That's pretty simple.

31:11.800 --> 31:18.520
Because we knew in order to be sustainable that we really needed at least 10 engineers working on it

31:18.520 --> 31:24.680
just to make Thunderbird run, not to do a bunch of fancy stuff just to go.

31:27.880 --> 31:37.160
And once we were able to set up this model, it became a lot easier to convince the other

31:37.160 --> 31:42.360
developers on the project. Those ones who were like, money is bad. They're like, money's not that bad.

31:43.000 --> 31:54.200
And it helps us sustain the project. And users understood that too. That appeal said,

31:56.360 --> 32:06.120
essentially, you get value from this and without you, it doesn't work. And

32:06.280 --> 32:13.880
you know, I lied a little bit earlier. I did hear from users who do remember the appeal.

32:16.920 --> 32:23.160
And especially after the first one. And I'm going to look at someone in the audience because he may

32:23.160 --> 32:30.440
have seen a negative comment. But I never saw a negative comment about the full screen takeover.

32:30.440 --> 32:42.520
In fact, I saw positivity of folks saying, I just assumed that you guys ran off of like Google

32:42.520 --> 32:51.720
money. If I had known that you were reliant on donations all these years, I would have been

32:51.720 --> 32:59.320
donating the whole time. And I got that hundreds of times of just people saying, of course, I want

32:59.320 --> 33:09.080
the tool that I'm using every day to manage my email, to be sustainable, to be funded. But you

33:09.080 --> 33:20.920
never told me that you needed my help. You never told me that that was on me. And so I remember

33:20.920 --> 33:25.640
the strangest feeling of being thanked for telling people to give me their money.

33:26.360 --> 33:35.000
So there you have it. But this slide, which I haven't even talked about since I put it up,

33:37.400 --> 33:43.480
is the other piece, which is you're all maintaining different software. Or maybe you're not. I don't

33:43.480 --> 33:51.080
know what you do. But I assume most of you are engaged with some piece of software that you develop.

33:51.560 --> 33:58.360
And it's not a one size fits all. If your software isn't public facing like Thunderbird and doesn't

33:58.360 --> 34:07.640
have 20 million users, this is not irrelevant to you. You probably do have stakeholders.

34:09.160 --> 34:14.680
What is your conversation with them look like? If it's a big enterprise that's leveraging your

34:15.400 --> 34:23.240
software, are you talking to them? Have you talked to them? Have you said, hey, don't be like the

34:23.240 --> 34:30.680
mafia and be like something really bad could happen. The software, it could go away. But maybe

34:30.680 --> 34:35.400
you should at least remind them that that could happen. Something really bad could happen.

34:36.200 --> 34:42.120
Somebody could get hit by a bus. That guy is me. But

34:44.920 --> 34:54.680
if you don't make that clear to the people who rely on your software, if you're not sharing with them

34:55.640 --> 35:08.040
the need, the pieces of the story that tell them how your software is sustainable,

35:09.000 --> 35:15.720
they're not going to know. And then you're going to have these, I remember, and this is the example

35:15.720 --> 35:21.160
I'll finally use. What piece of software was it? Any of you could answer this and I'm not going to

35:21.160 --> 35:29.320
pull it out of my head. But we've seen it, right? Just go to ours, Technica. Some open source project

35:29.320 --> 35:38.200
that's used by Google has a security vulnerability in it, probably today. At some point, that's going

35:38.200 --> 35:48.120
to be exploited. And the ours, Technica story, it's the same every time. It's like major exploit

35:48.200 --> 35:57.480
found in this product. And at some product we all use. And then they figure out, oh yeah,

35:57.480 --> 36:03.960
it was because they were using this library. And the maintainer stopped maintaining it 10 years ago.

36:06.520 --> 36:12.200
Google would have much preferred that that maintainer be like

36:12.840 --> 36:20.440
whatever it is in the repo maybe, it's just a big thing at the top. It's just like,

36:21.400 --> 36:28.680
I can't afford rent. I'm going to have to go work at Starbucks unless somebody gives me some money

36:28.680 --> 36:35.640
to work on this thing. I guarantee a lot of developers downstream would be like, oh, that's

36:35.720 --> 36:42.920
really bad. We need to give this guy some money. And that's what I'm talking about. Don't be that guy.

36:45.800 --> 36:54.840
That is a dick move. You created the thing. You're not maintaining it. And that's not the dick move.

36:54.840 --> 37:01.320
The dick move is before you stop maintaining it, what did you do to let everybody know

37:02.280 --> 37:08.520
who relies on it? What was happening? Why is it going away? What can you do to prevent it from

37:08.520 --> 37:15.640
going away? And that's something we see all the time. You guys know it. I know it. So

37:18.360 --> 37:26.440
just think about it. Think about it. Today, tomorrow, how am I going to make my software

37:26.520 --> 37:33.640
sustainable for the future for the people who rely on it? And you'll think of something.

37:34.760 --> 37:41.720
Try different things. Make that part of your day. Make that part of your development process. And

37:41.720 --> 37:47.720
I know that's the most annoying thing to say. But just, you know, like I'm going to dedicate

37:47.720 --> 37:52.600
3% of my time working on the project to just figuring out how to make it sustainable.

37:52.680 --> 37:59.960
Because I think that's good not just for you, but for me, for open source, for

38:01.880 --> 38:09.560
this software movement. And yeah, that's my talk. Thank you.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.640
Thank you.

38:18.440 --> 38:24.360
And I'm happy to take some questions you can ask me about Thunderbird. You can ask me about

38:24.360 --> 38:29.640
sustainability. You can ask me whatever you want. You can ask me how I get my hair like this.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.840
But we have another five minutes with each other.

38:33.800 --> 38:43.240
Thank you for your talk this morning. Are you helping your colleagues at Firefox?

38:45.960 --> 38:54.360
I get asked a lot of questions from those teams. It's true. At first it was an anomaly.

38:55.320 --> 39:04.360
You know, people didn't really know what to think when we started on this path to sustainability.

39:04.360 --> 39:12.520
And to be honest, at first it was met with like maybe some snickers of like, oh, they're funded

39:12.520 --> 39:18.760
by donations. Well, let's see how long that lasts. Now, you know, six or seven years into it,

39:19.640 --> 39:26.120
I get a lot more serious questions of, because it's kind of changed, right? It's like, oh,

39:26.120 --> 39:32.600
wait, folks are paying you for no value exchange, no immediate value exchange? Maybe we should figure

39:32.600 --> 39:40.280
out why they're doing that and whether or not we can apply that to other things. But I will say,

39:40.280 --> 39:46.680
though, it is scary too. It's scary to run off of just pure donations.

39:52.840 --> 40:00.280
Because, and I don't think you should always choose a donation model for your open source project.

40:00.280 --> 40:09.240
If you have any other model available to you, use that because I do tell my team one of my biggest

40:10.280 --> 40:16.680
worries is that in an economic downturn, for instance, donating to the Underboard would

40:16.680 --> 40:25.160
probably be a much lower priority than buying food. And so, you know, donations is not necessarily

40:25.160 --> 40:32.200
always the best model for sustaining an open source project. And you should use, when I put,

40:32.200 --> 40:38.600
like, do it your way, like you should use whatever mechanism, whatever mechanisms you have available

40:38.600 --> 40:45.880
that are going to make a project most sustainable, in my opinion. Any other questions?

40:45.880 --> 40:48.920
Yes. What's the current size of the Thunderbird team?

40:50.600 --> 40:58.680
I'm trying to find who said that over here, down here. It's 32. We're hiring an additional 13 roles

40:58.680 --> 41:07.080
this year. So it'll be 45 by the end of the year. And we expect to continue growing minus an economic

41:07.160 --> 41:17.240
downturn. So, yeah. There's one down here.

41:23.000 --> 41:28.600
Do you get a lot of contributions from people who you have not hired, like from random people on

41:28.600 --> 41:34.040
the internet? Or is it mostly the pay developers that are developing Thunderbird?

41:37.080 --> 41:38.920
I didn't hear all of that. Can I get it one more time?

41:40.760 --> 41:47.240
I was asking if you get a lot of contributions from people on the internet, as opposed to pay developers?

41:51.160 --> 41:57.960
We used to get more, so we used to get more contributions out of necessity from

41:59.720 --> 42:06.680
our community, because they were maintaining the project. So from 2012 to 2017,

42:07.080 --> 42:13.080
maybe even 2018, I would say that we had to have a majority of contributions from the community.

42:13.080 --> 42:19.160
But as I said at the beginning, the problem was people were scratching their own itch and not

42:19.160 --> 42:28.040
addressing the actual product needs. That's right. And so that was a really weird time, because

42:29.160 --> 42:35.240
you may have a really bad, bad thing happening in the software. And we had a few.

42:36.200 --> 42:41.560
But if it was going to take two months of consistent development to fix it,

42:43.320 --> 42:51.960
volunteers, they just were like, yeah, I'm really just here to fix filters, and then I'm out. And so

42:53.480 --> 42:58.760
once again, sustainability, you have to have people around your project to work on the hard things.

42:59.560 --> 43:07.800
So you mentioned you showed the full page thingy. Did you show it to everybody the same day, or is

43:07.800 --> 43:14.120
it like staged? Because I feel like everybody the same day might end up in Twitter, like, oh, what is

43:14.120 --> 43:22.120
this thing? I'm like snowballing. Yeah. Yeah. So the answer is we have not been very sophisticated.

43:22.280 --> 43:29.080
We hit everyone. So we don't hit them on the same day, but that's not because we're clever. And we

43:29.080 --> 43:36.840
developed a system for, you know, spreading that out and a B tested that. That's because they see

43:36.840 --> 43:44.120
it when they update to the newest version. And not everyone updates the day of the release. In fact,

43:44.120 --> 43:51.160
no one like, okay, I shouldn't say that. Not just it's spread out because people update on

43:51.160 --> 43:57.720
different days. But that also gives us some data of like, hey, well, we performed better this week

43:57.720 --> 44:04.280
than we did last week, you know, but with this group. So yeah. But in the future, we'll have a

44:04.280 --> 44:10.040
more sophisticated mechanism and I'll come back and tell you tell you what worked and what didn't.

44:11.880 --> 44:17.240
Two quick questions. One, do you use a particular way of collecting the money? Like is it a PayPal

44:17.320 --> 44:21.720
driven thing? And second one is do you maintain some kind of a

44:23.320 --> 44:28.680
pad for, you know, to try and smooth out that economic curve like a year in the bank, so to speak?

44:29.560 --> 44:36.360
Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very good questions. On the first one, we used to have our homegrown

44:39.560 --> 44:45.080
donations stack from Mozilla. So it's a stack that Mozilla created for the foundation.

44:47.480 --> 44:53.240
You know, there's this thing of in any endeavor where it's like, does this make your beer taste

44:53.240 --> 44:59.640
better? And we found out the answer was no, maintaining a donation stack does not make

44:59.640 --> 45:03.640
our beer taste better. And so we've moved to a platform called fundraise up, which

45:05.160 --> 45:12.680
supported supports way more ways of giving than we ever did. And so I would recommend you like,

45:12.680 --> 45:17.800
if you don't have to create a donation stack, please don't do that. Like use some tool or

45:17.800 --> 45:26.440
platform to do that for you. And then the second question, which I'm trying to remember what it was.

45:27.800 --> 45:31.160
Oh, yes, we, yeah, we have a year in the bank and that's what that's,

45:33.160 --> 45:38.520
that's how we hedge against potential donations. So far donations have only gone up, which is good,

45:38.520 --> 45:44.680
but we're hedging against, you know, a scenario that I talked about. And I think that's

45:45.880 --> 45:50.920
wise. It definitely gives our developers who know we're donation funded, who work for us a lot of

45:51.720 --> 45:53.400
a sense of stability, which is good.

45:56.120 --> 46:05.880
Well, thanks for your talk. And I see possible applications of this method also not only for

46:05.880 --> 46:12.120
software, but also for creative commons, art projects or something like that.

46:14.200 --> 46:23.160
Yeah, just to throw it in. Yeah, I think, I mean, it's, and it's super simple, right? And my time's

46:23.160 --> 46:30.680
done. So I'll answer this and then I'll be done. The model is just this one that like, even if you're

46:30.680 --> 46:36.600
creating something that's free, you should be thinking about how it is you're going to support

46:36.600 --> 46:42.120
that work. And especially if there are people in the world who find value from what you're doing,

46:43.160 --> 46:48.440
you should be communicating with them in order to tell them to continue to receive this value.

46:49.320 --> 46:56.680
There just has to be some layer of support around it, which I think is it's straightforward,

46:56.680 --> 47:01.160
but I just don't think it's a process that a lot of folks go through when they're creating something

47:01.160 --> 47:07.240
for free. They don't think about, they're always thinking like best term, best case scenario,

47:07.240 --> 47:13.000
like I'm going to be able to dedicate this amount of time to this in perpetuity for the rest of my

47:13.000 --> 47:20.680
life. And then something happens, you know, like maybe you're like me and you have twins. And then

47:20.760 --> 47:27.320
everything that you used to do, all your open source projects, for instance, in my case,

47:28.520 --> 47:32.520
they just stopped being developed if they're only developed by me. And

47:34.920 --> 47:40.680
if I could go back to myself like six years ago, I would, you know, like smack

47:41.640 --> 47:46.440
myself and be like, you don't have time for this, like you don't have time for maintaining all these

47:46.440 --> 47:50.280
different projects. How are you going to, who else you should be pulling in other people to

47:50.280 --> 47:55.640
help maintain them, whatever it is, you know, but it was not a thought that I had. And that's what

47:55.640 --> 47:59.480
I would like everybody to think about, you know, before you start something, or if you're in the
