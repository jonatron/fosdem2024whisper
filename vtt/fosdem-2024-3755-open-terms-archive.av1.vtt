00:00.000 --> 00:10.080
So I'm here to talk to you about the digital common that I'm quite passionate about, Open

00:10.080 --> 00:14.260
Terms Archive, which is a digital public good incubated within the French Ministry for

00:14.260 --> 00:15.540
Foreign Affairs.

00:15.540 --> 00:16.860
It has been existing for three years.

00:16.860 --> 00:20.360
The code base is under an European Union public license.

00:20.360 --> 00:24.280
And its goal is to enable the democratic control of digital platform.

00:24.280 --> 00:31.280
Make sure to shift the power balance from the large digital services to the end users

00:31.280 --> 00:32.560
and regulators.

00:32.560 --> 00:39.000
How do we do this by measuring the evolution of the rules, the terms of services, which

00:39.000 --> 00:44.240
are actually the way in which the services decide that you can do things or not.

00:44.240 --> 00:47.920
And oftentimes it takes over some regulations.

00:47.920 --> 00:55.080
And we provide tools to archive and enable analyzing and influencing those rules.

00:55.080 --> 01:02.280
We are basically creating technical tools that will enable us to unite different actors

01:02.280 --> 01:08.640
who are powerful enough to influence the rules of these large actors to be more loyal, more

01:08.640 --> 01:10.560
respectful of end users.

01:10.560 --> 01:14.680
Right now this is a bit blurry, but it's going to get better now.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.880
So who do we try to unite?

01:16.880 --> 01:23.560
We just looked at who can impact, who can really change the behavior of those large

01:23.560 --> 01:28.880
actors who are not respecting your privacy, who are not respecting your rights online.

01:28.880 --> 01:37.440
Regulators, if I'm a privacy regulation authority and I can have a million euro fine on some

01:37.440 --> 01:41.120
company, it's going to change its behavior way more than if I'm just yelling at it that

01:41.120 --> 01:42.600
it's not respecting me.

01:42.600 --> 01:46.200
Legislation, it can take a long time to be enacted.

01:46.200 --> 01:52.320
I think about 10 years for GDPR, but once it's in place it does actually change things.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.320
Why?

01:53.320 --> 01:57.160
Because someone in the big companies actually fears to go to jail.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.240
And that's quite impactful as well.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.840
Takes a long time, but useful.

02:01.840 --> 02:02.840
Press and media.

02:02.840 --> 02:08.960
There are tons of articles that say that some companies are bad and evil, but sometimes

02:08.960 --> 02:12.760
there's enough coverage that it will actually threaten their business model or their user

02:12.760 --> 02:13.920
base.

02:13.920 --> 02:14.920
It happens sometimes.

02:14.920 --> 02:19.400
Think, for example, on the WhatsApp case where they had to back down because so many

02:19.400 --> 02:23.480
people were afraid of it, didn't like the change.

02:23.480 --> 02:28.440
And finally, consumer protection associations, such as some of you might have heard of the

02:28.440 --> 02:36.720
Shrems, for example, cases in the EU that prevented the bulk sending of transfer of data

02:36.720 --> 02:42.640
of EU citizens or any consumer protection association that can go on a lawsuit against

02:42.640 --> 02:43.880
the companies.

02:43.880 --> 02:49.600
So we have demonstrated this impact model by providing tools that have been taken over

02:49.600 --> 02:58.200
by the European Commission for ensuring that some regulations were actually impactful on

02:58.200 --> 02:59.520
the behavior of companies.

02:59.520 --> 03:06.120
We have been in contact with Congress people in the US and so on and so forth.

03:06.120 --> 03:10.360
So we have these examples, and I have to be fast now.

03:10.360 --> 03:15.160
This is a DPGA public good session, so I want to highlight that we've been selected for

03:15.160 --> 03:18.760
the Nobel Prize Summit thanks to the DPGA.

03:18.760 --> 03:22.520
So we're very thankful to the Digital Public Goods Alliance.

03:22.520 --> 03:26.640
And if some of you are considering applying to be a DPG, I can talk more about it, but

03:26.640 --> 03:27.640
yeah, it's cool.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.640
Okay, that was not geeky enough for FOSDEM.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.640
I know.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.760
So now how does this work and how can you participate?

03:35.760 --> 03:39.040
First of all, we just need to define which documents you want to track.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.040
That's quite simple.

03:40.040 --> 03:44.800
You just use a URL and then a set of selectors like CSS stuff, usually just CSS selectors,

03:44.800 --> 03:48.000
a bit of JS if it's necessary, but it's like 5% of the cases.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.760
So here you define your target documents that we are going to track.

03:52.760 --> 03:57.640
Then we have made the tracking part quite simple.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.680
You could think that you could put together a script in half a day to just download stuff.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.160
That's true, but there's a difference between this.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.160
Time's up.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.160
I say it's four minutes.

04:06.160 --> 04:07.160
Sorry.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.160
Okay.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.760
So, yeah, oh, good.

04:10.760 --> 04:14.360
So yeah, we do this with software.

04:14.360 --> 04:17.960
We store every version and then we make it readable.

04:17.960 --> 04:23.280
So basically we will extract just the legal text instead of having all the menu navigation

04:23.280 --> 04:24.640
stuff and all that.

04:24.640 --> 04:29.400
And we will provide a diff for all these people, regulators, legislatures, all these people

04:29.400 --> 04:34.000
who don't really get all this stuff, but now they have a way to be notified when there's

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
a change.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.600
And then we can have humans who will write down a summary of what has changed and circulate

04:39.600 --> 04:40.600
it around.

04:40.600 --> 04:46.760
And then instead of having one person there, one press person here, one regulator yelling,

04:46.760 --> 04:50.680
we have all of them together and thus we believe we can actually influence.

04:50.680 --> 04:56.080
We also provide data sets and this is a decentralized system.

04:56.080 --> 05:01.000
We would love to have more instances if you want to create a new one in your country jurisdiction.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Please do.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
It's going to be amazing.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.160
