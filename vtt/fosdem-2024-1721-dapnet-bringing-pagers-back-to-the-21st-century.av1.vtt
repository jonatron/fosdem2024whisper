00:00.000 --> 00:10.460
Thank you very much. Hello. Good afternoon. Hope you're all well. Not cooking up too much

00:10.460 --> 00:17.600
in this room. My name is Manuel, so I'm a radio amateur. I renewed Nerd if you prefer. I like

00:17.600 --> 00:23.520
experimenting with new or older equipment, see what we can do with it, or use existing

00:23.520 --> 00:29.840
software or hardware and deploy it as widespread as possible. If possible, within the amateur

00:29.840 --> 00:34.320
radio community and keeping things open source whenever I can as well. So today I'm about

00:34.320 --> 00:41.800
to talk about cutting-edge technology straight from the 1990s, pagers. So if you've seen

00:41.800 --> 00:48.240
those things, well, it might bring you back some memories because they were heavily used

00:48.240 --> 00:58.120
in the 80s and the 90s. It was used by mostly doctors, drug dealers, or businessmen, sometimes

00:58.120 --> 01:06.000
the three at the same time. So basically they were everywhere in the 90s and started to disappear

01:06.000 --> 01:13.640
later on when GSMs made their operation. But this was something really common. In those times,

01:13.640 --> 01:18.800
you can still see it in TV shows, medical TV shows, getting paged, the doctor's getting paged

01:18.800 --> 01:26.120
because there's a code blue, whatever that means in room 204. Now, I'd like to explore this thing

01:26.120 --> 01:34.000
because behind this hallmark from before, they're extremely simple communication systems. And I

01:34.000 --> 01:39.640
think it's worth exploring them a bit more and see what you can do with it today in the open

01:39.640 --> 01:45.960
source community and the amateur radio community. So today we'll be looking at what is paging in

01:45.960 --> 01:50.720
itself, what does that mean, how does it work, generally speaking. We'll go a bit into the

01:50.760 --> 01:56.680
technical part of it. So how it works, the modulation types, how you can make a pagering,

01:56.680 --> 02:02.120
and then we'll bring that into the amateur radio context. We'll talk about the DapNet project,

02:02.120 --> 02:07.240
which has been around for a few years now, what you can do with it, how you can get started,

02:07.240 --> 02:14.120
and then I'll be open for questions if you have them. So coming back into the techniques,

02:14.320 --> 02:20.360
let's talk about paging in simpler terms. Paging is basically sending a message,

02:20.360 --> 02:27.200
making a small device ring one way or another, very often to small, low-powering, compact

02:27.200 --> 02:35.640
receivers. Most of them use a standard which is called PoxSag, which was developed in the 1980s,

02:35.640 --> 02:41.640
but much older standards exist and are almost not used anymore. So PoxSag is one of them that

02:41.680 --> 02:46.240
remains. The other one being developed by Motorola and proprietary, but we don't talk about that here.

02:46.240 --> 02:53.960
The topology is always the same. You've got one big transmitter, high power, and then you've got

02:53.960 --> 03:01.840
your receivers around that receive the messages whenever there's one. So the frequencies, you

03:01.840 --> 03:07.360
have them starting in 8-chef, I should have put that. So you've got pagers on 27 MHz and then all

03:07.400 --> 03:14.600
the way up. Here in Belgium, the national services use 160 MHz. In other countries, you will see them

03:14.600 --> 03:19.600
in 460 MHz and sometimes even higher in the US, they're all up to 900 MHz, if I'm not mistaken.

03:19.600 --> 03:26.000
So you see them on a lot of different frequencies, and you also see that compared to a classic two-way

03:26.000 --> 03:31.880
radio, the antenna is built into the device, which is itself a challenge because it means that your

03:32.200 --> 03:38.360
signal needs to be higher in intensity to be received by those antennas because they perform a bit

03:38.360 --> 03:47.280
less than the standard WIP antenna. Use cases in the commercial world, you'll find them, for instance,

03:47.280 --> 03:55.000
for one single hospital to be able to call doctors or industrial scale systems or sometimes a bit

03:55.000 --> 04:01.320
bigger. National scale being one of them. Here in Belgium, we have one single frequency for a

04:01.360 --> 04:08.000
distributed system of transmitters operated by Astrid, which is used by firefighters, ambulance

04:08.000 --> 04:14.800
services and others, so it's still being used today. You will see them also in foot trucks or in order

04:14.800 --> 04:21.240
to take away food courts such as if you've been to the wolf two days ago, you'll receive a little

04:21.240 --> 04:27.280
pager that would have rang, sorry, whenever your food was ready. So this is also a pager in itself.

04:28.280 --> 04:38.280
How does that work? As I said, it's using one single frequency, a specific carrier that we modulate

04:38.280 --> 04:44.880
in FSK, so simple frequency shift keying. You send a zero by shifting one way, the other way is a zero,

04:44.880 --> 04:50.360
so just by shifting one from one to another, you send one zeroes and then format it into very

04:50.400 --> 04:58.240
simple packets. So very often, please mute your radio, just saw it. If you want to send a packet

04:58.240 --> 05:02.920
usually, you send a preamble that wakes the receiver up because those receivers usually

05:02.920 --> 05:06.920
sleep for long periods of time and wake up from time to time to see if there's not a preamble for

05:06.920 --> 05:13.600
them there. And once it wakes up, it will start decoding the signal and then it sends an address

05:13.600 --> 05:18.840
and the linked message. And if the address doesn't match the pager's address, it will just shut down,

05:18.880 --> 05:24.720
go back in sleep mode, so that makes for very power efficient receivers. So this thing can last up

05:24.720 --> 05:33.800
to one month on one single AA battery. So yeah, that's pretty much the idea. Again, if you want your

05:33.800 --> 05:40.880
pager to receive a message, you put the address into it, basically. So if you want, for instance,

05:40.880 --> 05:48.400
to program this message, which is aimed at the pager with the address 101, you put the address

05:48.440 --> 05:55.000
101 in the pager. If it receives it, it displays a message and rings. Otherwise, it will just stay

05:55.000 --> 06:00.600
asleep because this is, for instance, a message for 102, not aimed at the pager itself, it stops ringing.

06:00.600 --> 06:14.880
Now, you can also make group alerts that way. So it's quite simple. You just put the same address,

06:15.120 --> 06:20.400
recall the RIC. You put the same RIC across all pagers and if they receive it, they will just

06:20.400 --> 06:26.240
ring altogether at the same time, displaying the message. So that means that for individual or

06:26.240 --> 06:33.800
group calls, you basically address one individual ID to a single pager and then you put one common

06:33.800 --> 06:39.920
group ID across all pagers. So you can select if you want to address one person or a specific group

06:40.320 --> 06:46.240
and you can organize your system this way. So it makes for a very simple type of receiver and then

06:46.240 --> 06:50.560
you can see yourself when you're building the network how you're addressing each pager or

06:50.560 --> 07:01.600
each group of pagers. Poxa-Agonamator Radio is not new. It's been done since the 1980s. I think it

07:01.600 --> 07:06.320
appeared at the same time as paging itself, so we started filling with that a long time ago. We use

07:06.400 --> 07:14.480
the TNCs connected to old VHF systems and yeah, the thing is you had to modify the pagers themselves

07:15.200 --> 07:22.080
very often by changing quarts and retuning the receiver loops to make sure that it felt between

07:22.080 --> 07:27.600
the amateur radio frequency allocations. But very often those were individual stations

07:27.600 --> 07:32.160
used for bulletin board systems at the time, for weather alerts or that kind of messages.

07:32.240 --> 07:44.240
So it kind of disappeared when packet radio really folded after the 90s. So right now the only thing

07:44.240 --> 07:51.200
we know on packet radio is mostly APRS or the more widespread you use is IPRS. So BBS, you don't see

07:51.200 --> 08:01.120
them anymore and the technology got lost in the ages. But now we have easier ways to interconnect

08:01.120 --> 08:08.000
stations together using HandNet for instance. So you now have IP links that can be made on

08:08.000 --> 08:13.920
amateur radio frequencies quite easily with modified Wi-Fi equipment or others. And there's a team from

08:13.920 --> 08:21.040
the Akan University of German Radio Amateurs that developed a network of internet-connected

08:21.040 --> 08:26.720
Poxa-Agonamators using free and open-source software and that is the DapNet project.

08:27.680 --> 08:33.200
So DapNet stands for Decentralized Amateur Paging Network. The idea is to have

08:34.080 --> 08:38.720
various core servers that are geographically separated, interconnected via HandNet,

08:39.920 --> 08:44.960
that exchange the messages through multiple nodes. So if you have one, fails, the others will take over.

08:46.800 --> 08:54.800
Now of course if you're outside of that HandNet link, you can always get a bridge through

08:54.800 --> 08:59.040
internet and this is what I'm doing here because I don't have an HandNet link here. We still haven't

08:59.040 --> 09:06.160
brought the HandNet links from Germany up here until unto Brussels. But you can go either way.

09:07.760 --> 09:13.520
The frequency is almost universal. Depending on your regulations we try to stay on the same

09:13.520 --> 09:20.640
frequency everywhere which is 439.9875 megahertz. That's a mouthful but that's the one we try to

09:20.720 --> 09:24.800
use everywhere. The only exception right now I see is the Netherlands because they don't have the

09:24.800 --> 09:30.560
access to this frequency so they're using a frequency on 432 if I'm not mistaken. But I mean

09:30.560 --> 09:36.320
from with this pager I can use it basically in Belgium, in Germany, in Switzerland. There are

09:36.320 --> 09:43.680
some transmitters in France as well so it's growing little by little. Now for addressing transmitters

09:46.640 --> 09:50.320
they have to be synchronized one way or another otherwise you have several transmitters

09:50.320 --> 09:55.600
that start keying up at the same time and then we'd interfere with on another. So they split up in

09:55.600 --> 10:00.720
time slots so if you have two overlapping transmitters you'll put one that transmits on one time slot

10:00.720 --> 10:04.640
and the other one that will transmit on another time slot. Just make sure they don't transmit at the

10:04.640 --> 10:14.000
same time. So what happens is you send a message on the DapNet infrastructure and as I said this

10:14.000 --> 10:19.840
only records basic numbers so there's no call sign you can encode in there. So there's a database

10:19.840 --> 10:26.160
on the DapNet infrastructure that links your call sign to an identifier. Very often we put the DMR

10:26.160 --> 10:33.920
ID because this is a way to identify hands with numbers and then it matches to this specific

10:33.920 --> 10:40.160
rig, this specific address, sends it to the transmitters that are linked to the area we

10:40.160 --> 10:45.280
selected so you can key up all transmitters or regionalize your calls. So you can say that if

10:45.280 --> 10:50.640
you know that the person that you're trying to reach is in Belgium you put Oscar November dash

10:50.640 --> 10:57.120
all. If you want to reach an area in a specific province well you can narrow it down and try

10:57.120 --> 11:02.400
not to use the network as extensively and just try to reduce the load if you know where your

11:02.400 --> 11:08.480
person is. Same for Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France there's this same kind of

11:09.040 --> 11:15.120
geographical way of cutting the transmitters. You can also make group calls so there are

11:15.600 --> 11:22.160
we call them rubrics and you have some for weather alerts, DX clusters etc etc. I'll come back to this

11:22.960 --> 11:30.000
in a moment. So what can we do with that? Well pretty much whatever you want.

11:31.600 --> 11:39.200
You can send messages manually to a specific pager via the handpager.de website. There's an

11:39.200 --> 11:43.520
Android app, I think there's even an iOS app but I don't know what's the status on that.

11:44.480 --> 11:50.880
Via the DMR infrastructure from Brandmeister, from APRS, from Tetra, so basically sending a text

11:50.880 --> 11:56.000
message from your radio will make it land on the DapNet infrastructure and then it will relay it to

11:57.920 --> 12:05.200
to your person you want to call. Then there's an API you can use to send weather alerts. There are

12:05.200 --> 12:11.520
automated messages for urgent alerts which will make all the pagers ring for example.

12:12.240 --> 12:22.160
DX clusters as I said or status on space solar flux conditions etc. That is something that

12:22.160 --> 12:28.240
also is also sent every four hours on the platform. You could also build something for a repeater

12:28.240 --> 12:37.600
telemetry or any IoT advice that you want but again keep in mind this is a network aimed at

12:37.600 --> 12:45.280
amateurs, for amateurs non-commercial and please keep in mind that is maintained by volunteers

12:45.280 --> 12:50.960
that do it on the free time with servers they have access to so don't start bombarding the network

12:50.960 --> 12:56.320
with telemetry that sends every second to the status of your fridge because that would be kind of a

12:56.320 --> 13:03.040
problem. So say reasonable but this is the kind of thing you can do as long as it's non-commercial.

13:03.040 --> 13:13.680
Now how can you get started? As long as you radio amateur with a call sign you can register right

13:13.680 --> 13:20.480
now there's a website to submit the tickets and we'll create your account. So once you do that

13:20.480 --> 13:25.280
you have access to the platform you can send messages if you want to receive them you'll have

13:25.280 --> 13:34.080
to buy, modify or build your own pager for the 439 megahertz frequency. That's one thing but then

13:34.080 --> 13:39.200
you need a transmitter somewhere. If you're lucky enough to have one within your living area you're

13:39.200 --> 13:46.560
good to go, enjoy. Otherwise well you can go your own way and install a hotspot at home or you can

13:46.560 --> 13:51.680
make it a nice project for your local radio club and build a wide range transmitter for everyone

13:51.680 --> 14:03.760
to enjoy. So there are two ways you can go. Speaking of specifics, acquiring a usable pager is

14:04.720 --> 14:12.240
relatively easy today so as I said before that you had to buy second hand pagers, replace a

14:12.240 --> 14:18.720
quart, retune the receiver chain but today we have more frequency agile receivers that have

14:18.720 --> 14:25.040
PLLs instead of the quarts that can be directly retuned or directly bought to work on those frequencies.

14:25.040 --> 14:33.040
So one of them is the AlphaPok 602R which I thought I had, yeah I have it on loan but here it is.

14:35.280 --> 14:40.480
So this one costs about, I think it was 90 euros when we checked on the AlphaPok website directly

14:40.480 --> 14:47.120
from Germany. You can buy it on Aliexpress but your mileage may vary. So that's a way to get quickly

14:47.120 --> 14:52.080
into it. You could go higher range and buy those commercial ones which are a bit more expensive

14:52.080 --> 14:58.480
but work as well or you can go the DIY and free open source routes and build your own using open

14:58.480 --> 15:05.120
source software like a project I've been working on which is the ESP32 pager which Bastia also

15:05.120 --> 15:13.040
improved a bit on the UI side because that's suck at UI but basically using a ESP32 Lora

15:13.040 --> 15:18.160
deathboards you can make it a Poxhack pager and have a receiver for quite cheap. I think those

15:18.160 --> 15:24.400
deathboards are about 15 euros on Aliexpress as well right now. So it's built on on radio

15:24.400 --> 15:31.760
lib so also freely modifiable so have a look if you're interested. As for transmitters you have

15:31.760 --> 15:38.640
two options right now for hotspots you can use if you already have an MMDVM hotspot well you're

15:38.640 --> 15:45.360
all set you just need to register it on the DapNet and activate the transmitter so that's one way

15:46.320 --> 15:51.600
if you want to build a wide range transmitter things can be extremely simple because you just

15:51.600 --> 15:58.240
need a small single board computer such as a Raspberry Pi, an FM transceiver you fit it directly

15:58.240 --> 16:05.040
into the audio unfiltered path of your transmitter and then well you're good to go so basically it

16:05.120 --> 16:11.600
requires four components the transmitter the Pi a transistor and one capacitor so you can get

16:11.600 --> 16:18.160
on the air quite quickly. All our transmitters are being worked on again Bastia is working on a

16:18.160 --> 16:25.200
ESP32 transmitter to make a small hotspot even cheaper if possible so again quite easily

16:27.040 --> 16:34.560
reachable. So where does that leave us? For me it's quite an elegant solution to receive text

16:34.560 --> 16:40.400
messages on our own independent networks having fun in the way learning how to use basic systems

16:40.400 --> 16:46.240
implement them and deploy networks that everyone can enjoy and it has its uses for telemetry or others

16:48.800 --> 16:56.560
you can do weather reports emergency messages text your friends via pager send silly jokes and the

16:56.560 --> 17:02.960
challenge of having it to fit within 80 characters so there are ways to make snappy jokes and

17:02.960 --> 17:10.320
intelligence ones at that but I think that thanks to the DapNet network the arrival of audio cars

17:10.320 --> 17:16.080
that can act as TNCs instead of using an external module it really made the thing much more accessible

17:18.080 --> 17:23.920
so if I'm able to SSH into my hotspots I can make you a quick demo of how that works

17:25.680 --> 17:26.960
so give me a quick second

17:27.280 --> 17:40.720
who's got a pager here? One? Nice? Nice? Nice? Very nice that's already one

17:43.040 --> 17:47.200
depending on what you registered in it I don't know if I'll be able to make a drink but

17:48.480 --> 17:55.040
so basically here you have my personal pager this is one from a friend I just borrowed and

17:55.040 --> 18:00.880
this one which just died on me which is not a problem in itself I'll just make this presentation

18:00.880 --> 18:07.600
shorter oh no it's alive there you go so those all have their own individual addresses so this

18:07.600 --> 18:15.040
one is 2069009 206500 sorry this one I don't remember this one is address 100 so I can make

18:15.040 --> 18:19.920
this one ring specifically I just key the transceiver up say I want to make the trans the

18:19.920 --> 18:25.120
pager number 100 ring please work don't make me look silly

18:27.040 --> 18:33.600
there you go so right now you have only this one ringing so I just made an individual call to this

18:33.600 --> 18:38.480
one now let's imagine I want to send a group alert for I don't know some weather storm weather coming

18:38.480 --> 18:48.640
up or a rare DX spot happening right now on on 18 meters 18 megahertz sorry so then I can make

18:48.720 --> 18:57.200
everything ring at the same time 1040 and then everything rings and it's just a nightmare

18:58.240 --> 19:03.680
and I need to confirm that otherwise it will ring again so there you go quite simply using

19:03.680 --> 19:11.200
basic addressing basic open source software this is just the hotspots just an MMDVM here running

19:11.200 --> 19:18.000
in the background and I can directly key the transmitter up if you have access to the DapNet

19:18.560 --> 19:23.920
system right now I think at least two or three of yous have access make you can make an individual

19:23.920 --> 19:29.040
call to myself there you go he just sent me a message on my on my pager and what did he just say

19:29.600 --> 19:33.280
how does a SQL expert get it how does a SQL expert get a date

19:34.080 --> 19:47.200
okay nice very nice nice so there you have it if you have any questions oh yeah there's another

19:47.200 --> 19:52.720
open source project that is just coming up with it where is alexander hello didn't see you yet

19:53.520 --> 19:58.080
if I'm not mistaken you worked on a pox hack decoder which is getting finished up as we speak for

19:58.080 --> 20:03.040
sdr plus plus so yeah I think it's important to report that as well sorry I didn't get the time

20:03.040 --> 20:10.800
to fit it into the the slides but again if you have any questions I'm I'm just Jesus Christ

20:12.880 --> 20:15.520
thank you for your attention and yeah I'm only yours

20:15.920 --> 20:25.840
all right I hear a question do we have a microphone or

20:28.480 --> 20:32.080
I'll repeat the question so I live quite close to an old school pager site

20:32.640 --> 20:36.640
yep they transmit very high power on vhf they do

20:36.880 --> 20:44.080
what causes interference a lot of other stuff whoo okay so you know in practice how much power do

20:44.080 --> 20:50.720
the transmitters in this network need to be useful and what happens when the pager misses a message

20:50.720 --> 20:56.800
is there a transmit or do you go to get one shot um well very often in professional network I'll

20:56.800 --> 21:01.840
start from the I'll repeat the question first so you have problems there's an interfering

21:02.400 --> 21:06.880
pager transmitter next to you because it's using high power so how much power we're using and

21:07.680 --> 21:12.320
second question sorry short term memory is what happens when the pager misses a message

21:12.320 --> 21:17.920
if you what happens when you miss a miss a message so the first one being yeah for commercial

21:17.920 --> 21:23.280
systems very often they who use 200 300 watts for transmitters because it needs to reach inside of

21:23.280 --> 21:30.160
parkings and the antennas are lousy at best so you need high power to get through for amateur radio

21:30.160 --> 21:43.040
systems it's less of a god now everyone is trolling me now in um yeah for amateur radio systems very

21:43.040 --> 21:47.760
often we don't go to that imperative of being able to reach everyone to through parking lots so very

21:47.760 --> 21:53.520
often the transmitters are 25 watts to 50 watts I mean higher up would cause problems such as what

21:53.520 --> 21:58.960
you're talking about but yeah usually we keep it low and we just add more transmitters here in

21:58.960 --> 22:03.040
Belgium is a problem because every time you add a transmitter you need to pay for an extra license

22:04.160 --> 22:09.120
so I mean we're still limited a bit legally speaking but it's not a problem in Germany or

22:09.120 --> 22:15.200
other countries where they don't pay repeater licenses or they're much cheaper speaking about

22:15.200 --> 22:21.360
missed messages there are two mitigation measures well actually just one is repeating message if

22:21.360 --> 22:28.000
it's lost it's lost if you don't get it that's it because there is no way to send an ack so

22:29.840 --> 22:33.920
either you receive it or you don't and that links to the first problem that's why the commercial

22:33.920 --> 22:40.640
systems use high power so there is no store and forward system in paging so yeah that's a small

22:40.640 --> 22:52.480
small limit other questions yes you don't need a call sign to receive

22:53.120 --> 23:02.320
signals specifically on radio amateur bands so you could perfectly use an sdr or I don't know buy

23:02.320 --> 23:08.160
a pager and put some public public messages but to be able to receive individual to you

23:08.160 --> 23:13.120
or to be able to transmit or you know at least access the platform you would need an amateur radio

23:13.120 --> 23:19.760
call sign but I mean radio amateur is much more than paging and I think it's worth looking into it

23:19.760 --> 23:25.840
if you don't have a license yet I'm not going to start into my big talk about about that because

23:25.840 --> 23:32.080
I've done it for about 25 times today but yeah there's a lot to discover and that hobby and

23:32.080 --> 23:38.560
might be worth looking into it if you have the time to access that hobby other questions

23:40.000 --> 23:47.600
yes yes it does it does you can change the ringtone you make it make it go beep the blue

23:47.680 --> 23:52.720
whatever you can even compose your own ringtones on some of them yes p32 pager actually has a

23:53.360 --> 23:57.040
provision for you there are different tones and you just compose a music you want so

23:57.040 --> 24:01.200
if you wanted to make play Tetris go ahead there was one question here and then you

24:02.240 --> 24:08.800
no question here okay what's the frequency range of the receiver the receiver so the receiver itself

24:08.800 --> 24:16.240
could be tuned pretty much anywhere on the UHF band so 43440 but the problem is it's using an antenna

24:16.240 --> 24:23.360
loop so a loop antenna so it has a very high q so you need to tune it yeah it's 70 centimeters

24:24.160 --> 24:36.080
yep yep there is one there is one I would need you have internet you're connected to the

24:37.200 --> 24:43.280
custom network here yeah if you're looking to hand pager dot de you should be able to

24:43.280 --> 24:55.120
at least get the address book so yeah my time is up thank you
