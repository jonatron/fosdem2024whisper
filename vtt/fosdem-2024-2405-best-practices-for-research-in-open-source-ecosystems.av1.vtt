WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.480
Okay, we'll get started. Thank you everybody for being here today. We're so pleased and

00:12.480 --> 00:16.480
honored to join you and talk about a project that our research team that we both work together

00:16.480 --> 00:21.040
on has been thinking about for a long time, which includes questions like what information

00:21.040 --> 00:29.960
is missing when you move beyond a repository looking at open source. I will do my best.

00:29.960 --> 00:37.840
Something happened last night. I can't explain it. Yes. So in this talk we are going to explore

00:37.840 --> 00:41.840
some stories about what can go wrong and how we as researchers and practitioners in the

00:41.840 --> 00:47.840
community can work to find best practices for open source ecosystems research. As it helps

00:47.840 --> 00:53.760
you, our slides and speaker notes can be found at and I will spell it out, BIT.ly backslash

00:53.760 --> 01:01.360

01:01.360 --> 01:12.360
Hi, so I'm Julia Farioli. I work at AWS as their open source AI ML strategist, but that's

01:12.400 --> 01:19.680
not what I'm here for today. I have had one foot in research and one foot in practice for

01:19.680 --> 01:26.480
basically my entire career and I'm especially interested in what motivates people within

01:26.480 --> 01:32.400
open source as well as the potential for the understanding of motivations to increase resiliency

01:32.400 --> 01:38.680
of our digital infrastructure. And hello, I'm Amanda Kaseri. Please keep reminding me

01:38.680 --> 01:43.560
to speak up if I forget. I work in Google's open source programs office as an engineer.

01:43.560 --> 01:49.720
I also continue to work around data and AI and I'm also a researcher and I have an emphasis

01:49.720 --> 01:54.240
of working at looking at open source through an intersectional and a feminist complexity

01:54.240 --> 02:02.240
lens. And our co-author who could not be here today is Dr. Juniper Lovato. She is a multidisciplinary

02:02.240 --> 02:06.800
complex system scientist who is a research assistant professor of computer science at

02:06.800 --> 02:11.120
the University of Vermont. And her work explores the ethical and governance issues related to

02:11.120 --> 02:20.120
socio-technical systems. So through our work, we were struck repeatedly by how much of existing

02:20.280 --> 02:27.280
research around open source and digital infrastructure lacked context from those working within the

02:28.480 --> 02:34.720
ecosystems. We also saw how these research findings were making their way into open source

02:34.720 --> 02:43.800
ecosystems and infrastructure, even if it wasn't necessarily applicable to them. So these observations

02:43.800 --> 02:51.840
led us to establish at least a start of some best practices for research in open source.

02:51.840 --> 02:57.240
Combined with others that we as a community collectively develop together can help us better

02:57.280 --> 03:02.280
study open source ecosystems as the socio-technical systems that they are.

03:02.280 --> 03:10.080
So, I mean, just basic fundamental assumption here is that open source is and has always

03:10.080 --> 03:15.840
been much more than a repository. It's a complex multi-level ecosystem of human contributors

03:15.840 --> 03:22.840
who collaborate and cooperate to achieve shared creative endeavors. And we, collectively

03:22.840 --> 03:27.640
are also part of open source communities in our work and our passions. We're collectively

03:27.640 --> 03:33.960
a dynamic socio-technical system that is always in production, both people and technology,

03:33.960 --> 03:38.920
and evolving towards a distributed goal. We're also, unfortunately, and I say unfortunately

03:38.920 --> 03:43.120
just because of some problems that come from it, a very attractive research space for scientists,

03:43.120 --> 03:47.680
especially scientists of technical systems and science, because open source ecosystems

03:47.680 --> 03:52.760
are so data rich, have such a long history, and have many exciting applications for understanding

03:53.000 --> 03:58.200
society as it is, whether it's governance, cybersecurity, team dynamics. However, we

03:58.200 --> 04:03.200
frequently see science that does focus only on repository data, and that gives a limited

04:03.200 --> 04:08.880
snapshot of the wider ecosystem and explores and ignores many of the explanatory variables

04:08.880 --> 04:12.640
of social systems. And that's just one missing data point that we're concerned about and

04:12.640 --> 04:17.120
have done some work on. When we are talking here about open source ecosystems, the reason

04:17.120 --> 04:21.800
we stress on the ecosystems piece is because we're referring to the collection of repository

04:21.840 --> 04:26.720
technology, infrastructure, communities, interactions, incentives, behavioral norms,

04:26.720 --> 04:32.560
culture, and studying these as a whole requires community cooperation and participation to

04:32.560 --> 04:38.320
understand all the interacting and the interdependent parts of the system. So at the heart of all

04:38.320 --> 04:43.160
of our ecosystems are humans, it's us. And our collaborations and outputs reflect social,

04:43.160 --> 04:48.400
emotional, and technical labor of the group of individuals moving towards, again, the shared

04:48.440 --> 04:52.800
and distributed goal that we all have. One still unsolved problem, and I want to stress

04:52.800 --> 04:57.080
both of these, is when both industry researchers and academic researchers, two separate groups,

04:57.080 --> 05:01.920
different outcomes and incentives, overlook data from open source ecosystems as part of

05:01.920 --> 05:06.160
a review process. And this is because data from open source, if you're not familiar with

05:06.160 --> 05:11.320
institutional research boards or review boards, data is usually obtained through scraping

05:11.320 --> 05:15.960
or APIs, and it's considered this category of what's called secondary data. And secondary

05:16.000 --> 05:21.320
data by some rubrics is not centered on humans, it doesn't require consent from research subjects.

05:21.320 --> 05:25.480
But when you are moving data about people, that is inherently data about someone and

05:25.480 --> 05:29.600
transforms them into a research subject. But when this happens, we as a community, we as

05:29.600 --> 05:34.880
individuals, are unaware that we're being studied. And then a paper comes out talking about the

05:34.880 --> 05:37.640
open source project that you worked on, and you're like, well, I didn't, first of all,

05:37.640 --> 05:41.480
I didn't realize any of this was going on, but also do I agree with this? And you never have

05:41.520 --> 05:48.480
the opportunity to give consent as a research subject in that case. Juniper, so Juniper actually

05:48.480 --> 05:53.920
just recently finished her PhD, we're super excited and happy for her. And she has been working in

05:53.920 --> 05:58.280
the field again of like data ethics and looking at this, this intersection. And she shared with us

05:58.280 --> 06:02.640
the advice from her PhD advisor, which is just because something is permissible, does not mean

06:02.640 --> 06:08.440
it is ethical. And so for example, just because open source repositories are public, sometimes

06:08.600 --> 06:12.280
they're permissible to scrape, but it doesn't always mean they're ethically fair game for any

06:12.280 --> 06:17.080
use without the community's consent. But I would like to give a positive example of this, by the

06:17.080 --> 06:24.040
way. So there was a group of researchers in 2022 who did work with the community to learn more about

06:24.040 --> 06:28.480
what was possible with repository data. So their research questions did center around the repose

06:28.480 --> 06:33.960
themselves. This is in 2022, it's Coutilla et al. And they published an excellent paper that was

06:33.960 --> 06:38.200
looking at open source and maintainer well being. They did a mixed methods approach that they looked

06:38.520 --> 06:43.160
at quantitative signals, they did a diary study, they did interviews. And they actually determined

06:43.160 --> 06:47.960
that it was not possible to determine maintainer well being from any of the signals that they

06:47.960 --> 06:53.080
studied purely off of the quantitative work. Now this usually doesn't get published. So right

06:53.080 --> 06:56.520
normally there's a hypothesis and they find that it didn't work out and then it goes into the

06:56.520 --> 07:00.200
clock, like it goes like somewhere else. But this time they actually published that like no, these

07:00.200 --> 07:05.240
things are not correlated, you cannot find these. There's too many individual confoundings for us to

07:05.240 --> 07:09.400
be able to say these will effectively work with the community. And that's the kind of research,

07:09.400 --> 07:14.200
honestly I would love to see continue to involve and encourage and for us to participate in,

07:14.200 --> 07:19.080
because it's breaking down the mental models, not only that exists of this rich community,

07:19.080 --> 07:24.200
but also that might hinder us or be used when out of context in a way that does not serve us.

07:25.080 --> 07:29.240
And that allows us to build trust with folks who are trying to understand and for ourselves,

07:29.240 --> 07:32.680
understand ourselves better in a way, again, that is not just being observed, but that is

07:32.680 --> 07:39.000
participatory. And that's because open source data is not just code. It's the collaborative labor

07:39.000 --> 07:42.920
of a group of people. And for all of this, we just want to make sure that we are working as

07:42.920 --> 07:47.320
researchers as that best practice piece, is not to throw away the socio element, don't ignore

07:47.320 --> 07:51.640
the fact that there are humans as a part of these problems. And that also helps remember that we

07:51.640 --> 07:55.160
should be treating each other with care and respect, because when we become part of that,

07:55.160 --> 08:01.400
we are ultimately part of the same system. And now as researchers and new practitioners,

08:01.400 --> 08:04.040
we're at this really critical moment. I mean, and I'm sure everybody's been talking about

08:04.040 --> 08:08.200
critical moments all day, open sources and critical moments. Research as well is in some

08:08.200 --> 08:12.120
very interesting critical moments, especially questions around open data, how data should be

08:12.120 --> 08:17.480
open, should it be open, what are its use cases. And community members are themselves subject matter

08:17.480 --> 08:22.600
experts. We should hold a wealth of knowledge and lived experience. We know the system's best.

08:23.160 --> 08:28.360
As collaborators, we actually lend much more experience to the projects as opposed to being

08:28.360 --> 08:33.400
silently studied or alone. So involving communities through participatory methods will help researchers

08:33.400 --> 08:37.080
better understand the systems they're studying, what's missing and what is truly available for

08:37.080 --> 08:43.480
purposes of research. And so another point we'd like to give around is this concept of, I talked

08:43.480 --> 08:49.000
a little bit about context. So Dr. Helen Niesbaum puts forth the concept of contextual integrity.

08:49.560 --> 08:54.920
And that is the idea that the protection for privacy is tied to the norms of a specific context

08:54.920 --> 09:00.680
from which the information is gathered. We have a lot of, you know, there's memes around about like

09:00.680 --> 09:05.160
overheard out of context, things out of context. But it applies differently here when we're talking

09:05.160 --> 09:09.800
about research, which also now fundamentally impact things like funding, people's well-being,

09:09.800 --> 09:15.240
your jobs, your ability to advance in your career, being recognized even for having done that work,

09:15.240 --> 09:21.400
as opposed to being invisible in history. And so we want to just emphasize here Dr. Niesbaum's idea

09:21.400 --> 09:26.840
that a central tenet of contextual integrity is that there are no arenas of life that are not

09:26.840 --> 09:32.600
governed by norms of information flow. There are no information of spheres or spheres of life which

09:32.600 --> 09:39.400
anything truly goes. And so we see this breach of contextual integrity in cases where data is

09:39.400 --> 09:44.040
taken outside of its intended environment used for another purpose. The phrase that sometimes gets

09:44.040 --> 09:48.440
thrown around is, but this data is already public. It's already out there. Can I use it for anything

09:48.440 --> 09:53.240
that I want to? I mean that leaves just enough room for circumvading pretty much every ethical issue

09:53.960 --> 10:01.000
related to data that is found online. In 2016, a specific example, the open data project known as

10:01.000 --> 10:05.880
GHTorrent, which was one of few community projects which hosted a structured history of GitHub's

10:05.880 --> 10:11.080
activity information, had a lengthy discussion and an issue about sharing aggregated data using

10:11.640 --> 10:16.120
GitHub's email, user email addresses. So they collected everything together and they shared it

10:16.120 --> 10:20.680
all out. And then as part of those commit messages, as part of that metadata, was people's just

10:20.680 --> 10:26.200
regular email addresses, not hashed, not changed. And that aggregation and sharing was being used

10:26.200 --> 10:30.760
without consent from those individuals because they were finding themselves the targets of mailing

10:30.760 --> 10:35.400
lists. So people would get together the list, they'd scrape all of the emails off of it, and they might

10:35.400 --> 10:38.600
do it for something like surveys. Like even researchers asking people like, hey, we'd like you

10:38.600 --> 10:43.640
to be a part of this study. But they didn't go to GitHub, put their email out there because they

10:43.640 --> 10:47.960
wanted to be contacted for a study. So this is a very long discussion. This point here actually

10:47.960 --> 10:53.240
will take you to, thank you so much for Julia for finding this, it will take you to in the

10:53.240 --> 10:58.680
Internet Archive link because it's no longer part of that initial Git repository that issue's been

10:58.680 --> 11:04.040
taken down. And I would like to just emphasize, so the GHTorrent actually is no longer being

11:04.040 --> 11:09.000
maintained. The previous website's no longer applicable. You can still see the repo as it

11:09.000 --> 11:14.120
exists on GitHub Archive. So I'm grateful to the Internet Archive for saving that information so we

11:14.120 --> 11:19.080
can understand that more. But I just want to add the caveat because we're using this. There is a

11:19.080 --> 11:23.800
hyperlink to ghtorrent.org. Do not click on that, it will take you somewhere you do not want to go.

11:26.760 --> 11:31.080
You're all about transparency. But that issue around email addresses on a platform,

11:31.080 --> 11:37.480
mailing data lists is an excellent example of why this may be controversial to say here. Openness

11:37.480 --> 11:42.840
in and of itself is not necessarily always a good. The release of raw data is of course good in

11:42.840 --> 11:46.760
the strict sense of reproducibility and of transparency and of working collectively in a

11:46.760 --> 11:53.480
community. In other contexts, openness may harm people and public trust that people have between

11:54.040 --> 11:59.080
researchers and the community themselves. So we just always need to strive for that balance and

11:59.080 --> 12:03.400
ask questions around openness, ethics, and privacy, especially in consultation with the people who

12:03.400 --> 12:13.080
exist there. Thank you, Amanda. And I think that's a great segue into the idea that researching

12:13.080 --> 12:19.480
open source software is ultimately research about the people behind it. And yet the data about the

12:19.480 --> 12:25.880
software are far more readily available than the data about the people. And sometimes that's for

12:25.880 --> 12:33.160
very good reasons. But when doing research in and around open source ecosystems, we need to

12:33.160 --> 12:40.520
make sure that we're not exacerbating or reinforcing inequalities in the existing system by failing to

12:40.520 --> 12:49.960
question what is absent from the data. So plenty of research has already been done into who

12:49.960 --> 12:56.360
contributes to open source and why and what benefits they see from it. And these benefits are not

12:56.360 --> 13:03.080
necessarily that insignificant. A fair number of people have jobs because of their work in

13:03.080 --> 13:11.080
open source. A fair number of folks get sponsorship for their work in open source. And a lot of the

13:11.080 --> 13:20.200
ways that people decide who to sponsor or who to recruit for jobs is through what is visible in the

13:20.200 --> 13:28.760
data. So if you do work that doesn't get captured in the data, then you don't receive those same

13:28.760 --> 13:38.040
benefits. One of the things that I think a lot about is how if you are not getting paid for your

13:38.040 --> 13:47.320
work in open source, you are basically paying to do work in open source. And that isn't because

13:47.320 --> 13:53.720
you're like literally handing out money, it's because you're spending your free time. And free time is

13:53.720 --> 14:06.040
the currency. In 2017, Lawson wrote a fantastic post about time as currency saying that I've already

14:06.040 --> 14:12.120
told my partner that if and when we decide to start having kids, it will probably quit open source

14:12.120 --> 14:20.760
for good. I can't see how I'll be able to make the time for both. And in 2019, this was reflected

14:20.840 --> 14:31.560
in a paper by Miller et al. And it has a delightful title, which is why do people give up flossing?

14:33.320 --> 14:39.320
Which I just I love from a pun perspective. I think it's great. But they found that for all

14:39.320 --> 14:46.040
contributors, occupational reasons such as major life changes were the most cited for leaving

14:46.040 --> 14:53.400
open source significantly more than lacking peer support or losing interest that are more commonly

14:53.400 --> 15:07.720
discussed in the literature. When we are looking at who is present in the data and who isn't,

15:08.760 --> 15:13.320
we need to understand and make sure that we're keeping at the forefront of our mind

15:13.320 --> 15:20.200
that the economic incentives and the availability, which is also a little bit of an economic incentive,

15:20.840 --> 15:26.520
of the people who keep the lights on are not evenly distributed. One of the papers that I want to see,

15:28.040 --> 15:37.080
free dissertation idea, is why do people never start flossing? We don't have research on that.

15:37.240 --> 15:51.240
So if we think about who leaves open source and why, what are the barriers for people who never come in?

15:54.600 --> 15:59.240
I think we're at an open source conference, right? Okay, so open sources everywhere.

16:00.200 --> 16:08.200
It powers mission critical systems. We know this. It's everywhere from space exploration

16:08.840 --> 16:16.440
to social networks to insulin pumps, which still terrifies me. But every person on the planet

16:16.440 --> 16:23.880
is affected by open source software, whether they know it or not. And that's critical to keep in

16:23.880 --> 16:31.800
mind when we're thinking about research and ecosystem integrity. This example may have

16:32.440 --> 16:43.320
crossed your radar. So in 2021, there was a retracted paper where researchers submitted known flaws

16:43.960 --> 16:51.080
to the Linux kernel. They had absolutely no intention of allowing these flaws to be merged upstream.

16:54.200 --> 17:04.680
But there was a lot of pushback. And in 2021, Greg Scott was quoted as saying,

17:04.680 --> 17:09.800
these researchers crossed a line that they shouldn't have crossed. Nobody asked them to do this.

17:10.760 --> 17:15.800
A whole lot of people wasted a whole lot of time evaluating their patches.

17:16.600 --> 17:24.520
And I think this is a really interesting example, because from the perspective of the researchers,

17:26.760 --> 17:34.520
they did not see an issue with their approach because they weren't going to let anything

17:34.520 --> 17:40.840
affect the technical system. Nothing was going to be merged. No flaws were going to be

17:41.800 --> 17:47.960
incorporated into the Linux kernel. They designed it to be an encapsulated experiment.

17:48.760 --> 17:56.440
But they failed to realize and take into account that there are people in that system.

17:58.520 --> 18:06.920
And they focused on the integrity of the system without considering the people or processes involved.

18:07.240 --> 18:20.280
And so we don't know how this would have worked if they had figured out a way to get consent

18:20.280 --> 18:26.360
for this experiment. But we do know that the way that they went about it made a whole lot of people

18:26.360 --> 18:36.040
really angry. And it did get them banned. The entire university was banned from contributing

18:36.040 --> 18:43.160
to the Linux kernel. Which is, I mean, actually I would put that on my resume. That's pretty impressive.

18:44.280 --> 18:48.440
Hopefully that ban will be lifted maybe in four or five years time. But

18:53.480 --> 19:01.800
these ecosystems are always in production. It is impossible to know where your software is being

19:01.800 --> 19:13.560
used. Because as open source folks, we tend to hate telemetry. And so we just have to rely on

19:14.760 --> 19:21.160
the systems that we have established and make sure that we are treating them with respect.

19:23.640 --> 19:31.320
So running behavioral experiments, which that wound up being even if it didn't intend to be,

19:32.440 --> 19:38.920
but behavioral or technical experiments in open source ecosystems may impact the world's infrastructure

19:38.920 --> 19:49.480
in unknown and immeasurable ways. It's difficult to know the scope of your research in an open

19:49.480 --> 19:58.440
source ecosystem. Small changes to one part may be what breaks something extremely important

19:58.440 --> 20:09.000
that you just had no idea. So we do need to treat open source ecosystems as systems that are perpetually

20:09.000 --> 20:18.360
in production. So what do we do? This is like four best practices. What do we actually take

20:18.360 --> 20:25.400
away from this? Well, as researchers and practitioners, we need to work together

20:28.440 --> 20:35.240
to provide practical context for research approaches, results, and recommendations.

20:36.200 --> 20:41.320
We need to consider the ramifications of research upon the ecosystems being studied,

20:41.880 --> 20:48.920
as well as the culture and individuals. And finally, look beyond the repository for factors

20:48.920 --> 20:57.160
that may influence methodologies and findings. And we acknowledge that again, like wearing these

20:57.160 --> 21:02.280
many hats, sitting in these many seats, this is a learning process. So science is all about

21:02.280 --> 21:07.800
understanding and finding out new knowledge. But that's also science as an ecosystem that is also

21:07.800 --> 21:11.240
always in production, learning because those ramifications of what you learn can have impacts

21:11.240 --> 21:16.680
down the road. We're all trying to figure out how do we use data that is online? How do we put our

21:16.680 --> 21:21.800
own data online in a way that we opt in an opt-out of? How do we get control? And how do we be responsible

21:21.800 --> 21:26.040
about it in terms of others that we're working with, especially within a community? In these

21:26.040 --> 21:31.160
transition periods, where things seem confusing, just again, we want to encourage that that's a

21:31.160 --> 21:35.160
point of communication should increase and not decrease. The worst thing that we can do is to

21:35.160 --> 21:40.600
start to shut things down where we start to silo ourselves, as opposed to come together and working

21:40.600 --> 21:44.680
closer with each other to strengthen that humanity as a part of our shared experience.

21:45.640 --> 21:50.680
We have an amazing gap to bridge the, amazing opportunity to bridge the gap between people who

21:50.680 --> 21:55.480
want to understand what is happening in software and science and technology. And by being those

21:55.480 --> 21:59.080
ones who can participate as a part of that, and that's really cool. It can open up opportunities

21:59.080 --> 22:03.960
to welcome more people into the open source ecosystems because those are more scientists

22:03.960 --> 22:07.400
who are then contributing their own code, contributing their own data, contributing their

22:07.400 --> 22:12.680
knowledge as a part to lift us all up. And so thank you so much for having us here today.

22:12.680 --> 22:16.920
We wanted to make sure as the last slide, you get all of the references that we have talked about

22:16.920 --> 22:21.720
today. And then of course, these slides as well, in case you want to do hyperlinks clicking in there.

22:23.640 --> 22:30.120
I do want to just point out that second bullet point also is a link to the full paper that this

22:30.120 --> 22:35.960
presentation is based on. So you are more than welcome to read the additional best practices

22:35.960 --> 22:41.240
in slightly more formal language than we've used today. Thank you.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.360
Thank you.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.360
We do have questions.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.360
I've got a minute.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.360
If you want.

22:54.360 --> 22:56.360
There are a lot of them, so please, Judy, one.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.440
Judy, one.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.440
That's an excellent presentation.

23:00.440 --> 23:08.040
The data is actually talking about mixed data. Is there also an element of jurisdiction

23:08.040 --> 23:13.000
about you? Because I'm going to sort out why researchers, but exactly described as precisely

23:13.000 --> 23:17.320
one where we told them you can't do that because of wireless GDDR. So I'm wondering if there's a

23:17.320 --> 23:23.000
jurisdiction versus ethics, and was the case with the Great Souls at the US of Minnesota?

23:23.720 --> 23:25.720
Yes, that was.

23:31.320 --> 23:37.800
So the question was that are there jurisdictional implications for web scraping and the data

23:37.800 --> 23:43.880
that you obtain through web scraping? And I think this is where we both say we are not lawyers.

23:44.120 --> 23:53.480
No, no. And so this is a place where, yes, there are most likely jurisdictional

23:54.040 --> 23:58.600
considerations. What they are is where we would go talk to our lawyers.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.880
Yeah, and I also think you brought bring up an interesting point because we did try to

24:03.880 --> 24:09.000
differentiate and we acknowledge that. So there's industry research. There is academic research

24:09.000 --> 24:12.920
with institutions. There's government research that are funded by government agencies. Like

24:12.920 --> 24:19.560
research becomes a throw all. But each group does have its own ethics boards, legal processes,

24:20.200 --> 24:24.760
requirements for sharing and working with information. So yeah, that absolutely does exist.

24:24.760 --> 24:28.600
There's not one universal standard. But it's also why we're trying to talk about this in

24:28.600 --> 24:34.440
terms of practices as opposed to here is our like resolute suggestion on the commandment.

24:34.440 --> 24:38.520
Yeah, here's the rules that you should be following. Thank you for bringing that up.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.040
That's absolutely a great point.

24:43.800 --> 24:48.760
Yeah, thank you very much for the presentation. If you want to make a point and then you can

24:48.760 --> 24:53.960
comment on that, which is super important that we have all the research into open source.

24:54.520 --> 25:00.920
But speaking as a researcher, it was literally a gold rush, get up to mine, and we've got lots of

25:00.920 --> 25:06.520
silly papers. And it would be better if researchers focused on what's really important. That's not

25:06.520 --> 25:14.520
necessarily always open source. So anyone who can provide access to open source data, for example,

25:14.520 --> 25:20.520
by being a contributor who works for a company could also positively provide access to the company.

25:20.520 --> 25:25.080
We need as much research on how the company is in front of you, even if it's for prior

25:25.080 --> 25:31.640
check of work. That's my opinion equally that we need it. And because researchers for the low

25:31.640 --> 25:38.040
main groups, you don't have any of them, most of them have a developer. So I would not encourage

25:38.040 --> 25:44.760
anyone if you're willing to work with researchers to find ways to maybe also get a company

25:44.760 --> 25:51.240
interpreter that will improve the world for us. So I will briefly try to summarize the comment

25:51.240 --> 25:59.320
there, which was that research into open sources is good. There was a bit of a gold rush when we

25:59.320 --> 26:09.080
first had access to GitHub data. But we also need to do research into the proprietary side

26:09.640 --> 26:16.040
of software and software development, because that's important as well. And I would agree with

26:16.040 --> 26:24.840
that. It's speaking as somebody who has worked in big tech for quite some time now. There are some

26:24.840 --> 26:33.720
significant challenges that I personally am not sure how to overcome to doing that. But

26:35.960 --> 26:41.880
it's on the wish list, I think. Yeah, that's an excellent point around like

26:43.160 --> 26:47.480
when you need to do studies and you only have what is either conveniently available or ever

26:47.480 --> 26:51.720
available, that sometimes you're limited into what you can find. I also think it does limit

26:51.720 --> 26:58.040
the questions you can ask. So I think where I would agree that it will be interesting, hopefully,

26:58.040 --> 27:02.040
more of those collaborations between researchers and all kinds of developers, whether you're

27:02.040 --> 27:08.680
within a corporation or without. My concern becomes when, and I was a reviewer as a part of

27:08.680 --> 27:13.400
the mining software reviewer, mining software repositories conference this year. And the challenge

27:13.400 --> 27:19.800
that I saw with more papers than I'm used to was just a complete mismatch of understanding data

27:19.800 --> 27:25.240
and research questions and the hypothesis of whether or not that was something you could even ask

27:25.240 --> 27:30.680
using that data. And so that's a challenge as well, is just having people who understand what is

27:30.680 --> 27:45.080
possible of asking of a certain question. There's a connection to open source, which is really nice

27:45.800 --> 27:50.360
in company and trial development or, which is called inner source.

27:57.480 --> 27:57.560
No.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.960
Sure, yeah. I do believe we're out of time. Out of time.

28:07.960 --> 28:13.400
Yeah. But we will be outside for additional questions if you want.
