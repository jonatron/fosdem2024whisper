WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
Okay, good afternoon everyone.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.120
We are happy to introduce our project here.

00:11.120 --> 00:17.000
We are part of Galaxy Europe project and who we are.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.880
I am Polina and I am PhD student with Galaxy and my colleague Mira is US Galaxy EU administrator.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.520
And we will split our talk into parts.

00:27.520 --> 00:33.880
I will talk more focused on research and how to use Galaxy for research.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.960
And Mira then will talk more about technical details.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.360
What is Galaxy?

00:40.360 --> 00:44.280
Galaxy is a platform for data analysis.

00:44.280 --> 00:54.800
Basically it's free and open source and there are almost 10,000 tools in Galaxy toolshed for data analysis.

00:54.800 --> 01:09.280
It is cited in more than 11,900 papers and there are extensive tutorials for data analysis that you can do with Galaxy as a researcher.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.000
And this is cross-domain platform.

01:12.000 --> 01:23.040
It is usually used in bioinformatics but it can be also used and it is used already in chemistry, ecology, climate science and astrophysics and more.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.560
There are multiple interfaces that Galaxy can offer.

01:27.560 --> 01:37.600
There is intuitive graphical user interface for researchers and there is also a unified open API for more advanced users.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.960
And what is Galaxy for?

01:40.960 --> 01:49.280
So if you are a researcher then one main advantage of Galaxy is the graphical user interface.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.640
So here is the main window of Galaxy and on the left side you see the list of tools.

01:56.640 --> 02:08.880
I repeat that there are almost 10,000 tools implemented into Galaxy that you can use with this graphical user interface.

02:09.440 --> 02:18.000
And for researchers and data scientists it is always the question how to organize your data.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.960
And Galaxy provides this concept of history.

02:22.960 --> 02:34.800
History is the directory that contains all your inputs, outputs, all your tools that you use for your data analysis and its parameters and more.

02:35.760 --> 02:53.440
And you can also do as many researchers in parallel as you want because Galaxy also provides this feature of multiple histories that you can use in parallel and switch between them easily.

02:54.400 --> 03:00.960
And yeah, that's cool, that runs.

03:00.960 --> 03:07.520
There is a short presentation of how it works for bioinformatics tools.

03:07.520 --> 03:18.640
So here we make a short analysis of biological data with very basic bioinformatics tools such as FASTQC,

03:18.640 --> 03:24.240
which is actually the tool for quality control of FASTQC data.

03:24.240 --> 03:36.240
And so we can see now we use another tool for bioinformatics to adapt and you can see in the main window that we can advantage from this graphical interface.

03:36.560 --> 03:49.360
So usually these tools are command line tools and Galaxy provides you graphical interface that you can easily use if you are not familiar with command line.

03:49.360 --> 03:57.520
And yeah, finally you have your outputs on the right panel in your history.

03:57.600 --> 04:06.480
And as I already said that usually all these tools that Galaxy can provide user interface for are command line tools.

04:06.480 --> 04:18.080
And if you want to be more focused on research, you don't want to learn this command line and then Galaxy provides this.

04:18.080 --> 04:26.400
So you can, all the parameters that you need to set in command line you can set in more visual way.

04:28.240 --> 04:34.320
Another question that is important for researchers is reproduce your research.

04:34.320 --> 04:45.120
And Galaxy can also provide this. This is like the small demo of how to reproduce your analysis with clicking one button.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.880
Or you can also analyze your data in one go.

04:50.880 --> 05:04.480
So for this Galaxy provides you workflow feature that you can create your workflow which looks like the sequence of tools in a visual graphic interface.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.640
And then you can use this workflow.

05:07.280 --> 05:15.920
And here is a short video of how we use this workflow editor in Galaxy to create our own workflow.

05:15.920 --> 05:21.360
So here is on the left panel we choose the input.

05:21.360 --> 05:25.040
Then we set the name of this input.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.520
Then we choose any tools that we want to use for our analysis.

05:29.520 --> 05:35.280
And we set them in the order and we can use the output of one tool as input of another tool.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.440
And yeah, in this way we create a workflow.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.200
It can be more complicated of course.

05:42.160 --> 05:48.480
And here is another video of how exactly we can use this workflow that we just created.

05:48.480 --> 05:53.360
So first of all we need to upload data into our history.

05:53.360 --> 05:57.120
For this Galaxy have different options.

05:57.120 --> 06:05.520
So we can upload them from local computer, from cloud, from external resources or other ways.

06:06.480 --> 06:11.600
And yeah, here we found the workflow from the list of our workflows.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.920
And we ran it by clicking one button.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.080
And then in our history we have our output.

06:19.120 --> 06:25.520
And Galaxy also provides to researchers different ways to visualize your data.

06:28.480 --> 06:34.320
And also this is also very important to share in research.

06:34.320 --> 06:39.040
So Galaxy can provide you different options to share your histories, your workflows,

06:39.040 --> 06:41.280
your visualizations, your data.

06:41.280 --> 06:45.120
And you can choose to share it with specific users,

06:45.120 --> 06:50.880
with your community or make it published and available for everybody.

06:52.880 --> 06:57.040
And yeah, this is not only what I showed you.

06:57.040 --> 07:04.080
Galaxy can do, Galaxy can do many things that are supposed to be in a data lifecycle.

07:04.480 --> 07:09.680
And now I will give a word to my colleague.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.960
Hey, so you are now a bit overwhelmed.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.760
I think that's quite normal.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.280
But I have good news for you.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.440
Galaxy has its own training network.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.920
And it's made for self-study.

07:23.920 --> 07:28.400
It has step-by-step learning paths, videos, interactive tutorials,

07:28.400 --> 07:30.320
and covers topics for everyone.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.760
For students, for developers, and even for administrators.

07:34.960 --> 07:40.320
And we host worldwide training events where hundreds of instructors in all time zones

07:40.320 --> 07:42.000
are there to answer your questions.

07:43.840 --> 07:50.160
Now I will go more into technical detail, but first I show you which Galaxy servers are available.

07:51.840 --> 07:56.080
There's three large instances that provide a lot of compute power to the public.

07:56.880 --> 08:02.000
One in Australia, one in Europe, which I administrate and one in the US.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.160
But there are also many more domain-specific and national Galaxy servers,

08:06.160 --> 08:08.720
as well as hundreds of small-scale deployments.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.920
And with a few clicks, you can easily host your own Galaxy server.

08:16.080 --> 08:20.720
Now if you decided to host your own Galaxy server, where do you get the tools from?

08:20.720 --> 08:22.320
Is there kind of an app store?

08:23.040 --> 08:28.880
Yes, there's an app store, but we call it toolshed because you cannot buy anything and it's open sourced.

08:29.280 --> 08:32.480
But you can share all the tools if you like.

08:32.480 --> 08:38.560
And the toolshed currently has more than 9,700 tools of various scientific domains,

08:38.560 --> 08:42.480
mainly bioinformatics, but also other communities.

08:44.480 --> 08:51.520
And there's a curated selection and it covers also interactive research environments,

08:51.520 --> 08:53.920
such as your Jupiter notebooks.

08:54.160 --> 09:01.120
And if you wonder how these tools are shown in Galaxy, because they are usually all

09:01.120 --> 09:06.960
command-line tools, as was mentioned, there's no magic behind it.

09:06.960 --> 09:13.680
Every tool has a corresponding XML file that describes its parameters, its inputs and outputs.

09:14.480 --> 09:19.920
And there's even a tool for rapid development, which is called Planimo,

09:19.920 --> 09:22.000
and that makes it quite easy to contribute.

09:24.640 --> 09:28.800
But if you do research, you want to have every experiment reproducible,

09:28.800 --> 09:35.840
and this is why each version of a tool should have a fixed set of packages it depends on.

09:37.120 --> 09:41.040
And you already saw that there was a requirements version in the wrapper,

09:42.240 --> 09:48.480
and Galaxy can use dependence resolvers like Konda, but also can run tools in

09:49.440 --> 09:56.240
so-called multi-containers that are described by a unique hash for a set of fixed dependencies.

09:56.240 --> 10:03.360
And this way, every tool is reproducible in all Galaxy servers around the world.

10:06.400 --> 10:10.640
Okay, let's assume you found a server and you found your favorite tool,

10:10.640 --> 10:14.080
and you want to start a job. How does it actually work?

10:14.080 --> 10:18.960
So your web client is communicating to a whiskey-compatible Python web server

10:18.960 --> 10:23.040
that responds to your request and creates a job in the database,

10:23.680 --> 10:30.400
but then there are Galaxy job handlers that pick up your job and create kind of a script,

10:30.400 --> 10:36.880
like a bash script, and submit that script to a cluster and then monitor its status.

10:36.960 --> 10:43.920
And once the state changes, it will be mirrored in the database and then

10:45.040 --> 10:52.400
also sent back to your client. And which compute environments can we actually use?

10:53.200 --> 10:58.320
So we can use large HPC clusters, for example, running Kubernetes,

10:58.880 --> 11:06.160
HG Condor, SLAM, or many others, but we can also use remote compute resources

11:08.400 --> 11:15.360
with POSA, which is a small Python server application that is developed in the Galaxy

11:15.360 --> 11:21.760
project. And if you don't have such a HPC cluster, you can also run it on your laptop

11:21.760 --> 11:29.920
or even on a Raspberry Pi. But if you want to scale it to 10,000 of users,

11:29.920 --> 11:36.400
then you, of course, can have a more complex setup. This is the setup I administrated at you,

11:37.360 --> 11:44.320
and yeah, maybe you have a look, but I will not explain everything in detail.

11:45.200 --> 11:51.440
We have an OpenStack Cloud with about 8,000 cores and 42 terabyte of memory.

11:53.920 --> 11:59.520
But how can you contribute to Galaxy now? So you saw the tool wrappers. If you have a tool you

11:59.520 --> 12:04.000
want to be implemented in Galaxy, you can just write your wrapper and open a pull request.

12:05.680 --> 12:12.880
And also you can contribute to the source code, which is on GitHub. You can contribute training

12:12.880 --> 12:19.680
material, your scientific workflows, or other resources. For example, if you have an HPC cluster,

12:19.680 --> 12:26.560
you can spin up a POSA endpoint and contribute compute resources. Yeah, I want to thank you for

12:26.560 --> 12:33.360
your attention. And if you want to keep in touch, we are in Matrix, Master Done, and GitHub, and

12:33.360 --> 12:36.000
we will stay here a few more minutes to answer your questions.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.120
One question, Tassel.

12:52.560 --> 12:56.240
Do you have a success story for people using your platform?

12:57.920 --> 12:59.840
Do you have a success story?

13:00.400 --> 13:02.000
Yeah, you did your masters, right?

13:02.800 --> 13:04.000
Yeah, I did my master.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.120
Just take the question.

13:06.320 --> 13:12.160
Okay, the question is a success story of how people are using. So many researchers use Galaxy for

13:12.640 --> 13:20.720
their research and many biologists. And so I also used it for my master project. And yeah,

13:20.720 --> 13:27.120
I wrote master thesis and all made with Galaxy. So this is my own success story.

13:28.160 --> 13:28.880
Miss Bernice.

13:31.120 --> 13:35.520
All right. Sorry, folks. We do have to wrap up and move to the next speaker. Thank you, everyone.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.160
Thank you.
