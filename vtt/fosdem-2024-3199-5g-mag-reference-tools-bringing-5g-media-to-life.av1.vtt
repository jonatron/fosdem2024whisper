00:00.000 --> 00:06.200
All right, let's go.

00:06.200 --> 00:09.960
So who of you know anything about Fiji Mac?

00:09.960 --> 00:12.720
Can you raise your hand?

00:12.720 --> 00:14.920
Fiji Mac?

00:14.920 --> 00:16.520
OK, that's why we are here, right?

00:16.520 --> 00:20.640
So let's start by who we are.

00:20.640 --> 00:24.440
So Fiji Mac is an international non-for-profit cross-industry

00:24.440 --> 00:25.200
association.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.960
And what we do is basically to apply global internet

00:28.000 --> 00:32.720
Fiji-based access, global APIs, to media,

00:32.720 --> 00:36.480
to multimedia applications in the domain of, for instance,

00:36.480 --> 00:39.280
production, contribution, news gathering, et cetera,

00:39.280 --> 00:41.920
but also on streaming, also on broadcast, and also

00:41.920 --> 00:44.960
new media, like XR.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.280
Applying all these technologies means not only taking care

00:47.280 --> 00:50.520
of media, but also taking care of network capabilities,

00:50.520 --> 00:54.160
network features, transport protocols suitable for doing

00:55.160 --> 00:57.920
and then architectures for streaming, for CDNs,

00:57.920 --> 01:00.640
for broadcast, MantiCast, network assistance,

01:00.640 --> 01:04.840
satellites, like non-terrestrial networks, and so on.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.120
We decided to launch a development program not just

01:08.120 --> 01:11.920
to talk about technology, but to actually build stuff, right?

01:11.920 --> 01:15.280
And we have established a community of developers

01:15.280 --> 01:20.000
that is sponsored by Fiji Mac, but is open to anybody.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.560
And what we do together with, let's say, these companies

01:23.640 --> 01:26.560
and our Nolfe-G Mac members is to develop reference

01:26.560 --> 01:28.920
implementations of all these technologies

01:28.920 --> 01:33.120
we've been explaining for validating standards,

01:33.120 --> 01:36.480
for building demos, for testing and experimenting.

01:36.480 --> 01:39.240
And that's, obviously, for everybody, network operators,

01:39.240 --> 01:42.040
service providers, broadcasters, and so on.

01:42.040 --> 01:45.400
What we do in the reference tools development program

01:45.400 --> 01:49.080
is actually to build all these series of technologies.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.160
You can go to the website and you will have

01:51.160 --> 01:52.280
more information there.

01:52.320 --> 01:57.320
Particular, for instance, we have our own set of CDN notes.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.760
We can get metrics in terms of quality of experience,

02:02.760 --> 02:04.160
in terms of consumption, reporting,

02:04.160 --> 02:07.120
so who is consuming my player, my OTT player.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.560
For instance, that's information useful for service providers,

02:10.560 --> 02:12.680
broadcasters, and so on.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.600
We have also developed our own end-to-end system

02:15.600 --> 02:17.640
for something called Fiji Broadcast,

02:17.640 --> 02:22.000
which allows you to broadcast radio or TV

02:22.040 --> 02:25.560
to your OTT app on your phone, not based on the internet,

02:25.560 --> 02:27.880
but based on broadcasting.

02:27.880 --> 02:32.880
And we are recently onboarding a new project for AR,

02:33.720 --> 02:37.280
MR, let's say XR applications,

02:37.280 --> 02:40.920
and we have started developing all these series of tools

02:40.920 --> 02:43.160
where you can actually do this, right?

02:43.160 --> 02:47.280
So you can create content for XR devices,

02:47.280 --> 02:50.400
and you can put your, for instance, TV channel

02:50.400 --> 02:53.760
for users on this, on this display.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.680
This technology works, actually,

02:56.680 --> 02:59.480
we have been at IBC, for instance, showcasing

02:59.480 --> 03:01.760
Fiji Media Streaming, what I explained,

03:01.760 --> 03:03.840
and also Fiji Broadcast.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.800
If you wish to participate, this is fully open to everybody

03:07.800 --> 03:10.440
with an interest on all these technologies

03:10.440 --> 03:13.200
for production, contribution, and distribution.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.360
We have a GitHub repository where you can find

03:17.360 --> 03:20.280
all the projects, there's documentation,

03:20.280 --> 03:23.200
at the moment there are plus 30 repos

03:23.200 --> 03:24.920
with different technologies.

03:24.920 --> 03:28.360
We accept code under the license terms

03:28.360 --> 03:30.880
that contributors feel comfortable with,

03:30.880 --> 03:34.680
that means we have a repos on OSI,

03:36.000 --> 03:39.080
licenses, but also on other kind of licenses,

03:39.080 --> 03:43.400
please check if you would like to contribute.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.560
And you can also participate,

03:44.560 --> 03:46.120
anybody is welcome to participate,

03:46.120 --> 03:49.400
there's a Slack channel, we have public calls every Friday

03:49.440 --> 03:53.360
for developers, for academia, for the industry in general,

03:53.360 --> 03:55.960
and we have also a Google group with information

03:55.960 --> 03:59.520
on announcements, releases, release candidates,

03:59.520 --> 04:01.200
testing periods, and so on.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.280
You can find all the information

04:02.280 --> 04:04.760
at FijiMak.com slash community.

04:04.760 --> 04:07.560
So if you have an interest on Fiji Media Production,

04:07.560 --> 04:12.200
an app link video, on streaming, on Fiji Broadcast,

04:12.200 --> 04:16.240
multicast, beyond 2D volumetric video, et cetera, et cetera,

04:16.360 --> 04:20.520
next time, please have a look at FijiMak, thank you.

04:20.520 --> 04:21.360
Thank you.

04:21.360 --> 04:22.200
Thank you.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.040
Thank you.

04:23.040 --> 04:23.880
Thank you.

04:29.880 --> 04:30.880
Any questions?
