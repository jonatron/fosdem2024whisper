WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
No, it works.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Okay.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Gotta get, there we go.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
So, thank you very much and enjoy.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Yep, thank you.

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
But before I get started, is this readable in the back or do we need to blow it up?

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
A little bit bigger.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
How about this?

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Okay, good.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
All right.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
So, welcome to my talk on materials for MKDUX.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Let me quickly introduce myself and my co-speaker, author.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
So, Martin isn't here today, but...

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
So, I'm Kenneth Hosta.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
I'm an HPC system administrator at Gantt University.

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
HPC is high-performance computing, supercomputing.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Some people may not know this, but it's lots of servers, lots of noise, lots of money,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
lots of annoying users as well.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
There's a lot going on there.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm the lead developer of EasyBuild for the last decade.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
So, EasyBuild is a tool for installing scientific software on supercomputers.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
It gets a lot, it gets very fun, I can tell you.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm involved in way too many FOSS projects.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
I patch things and try to fix things left and right.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
And I've been attending FOSSDOM since 2013.

01:13.000 --> 01:18.000
If you think FOSSDOM is total chaos, you should try organizing a dev room,

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
doing a talk and planning live demos during your talk, which is what I'm going to do.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
So, I actually had to run out of the HPC dev room, which I'm co-organizing.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
I'm a big fan of Material for MKDocs since I discovered it,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
and I think more people should know about it, so that's why I'm here.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
The other person on the talk as an author is Martin.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
Martin Donut, he's the lead developer of Material for MKDocs.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
I reached out to him to ask him, please submit a talk on Material for MKDocs to FOSSDOM.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.000
He said, I can't make it this year, then I said, OK, I'll just do it myself.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
And I had a call with him to discuss what should be in the talk, so he's been involved.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
All right, so why do I want to give this talk?

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, Material for MKDocs is great.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
More people should know about it, more people should be using it.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
It's very easy to install and use.

02:03.000 --> 02:07.000
You get very good results with pretty minimal effort, and I'll actually show this hands-on.

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Tons of great features.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
It's actively developed.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
It's open source, of course.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
And there's a very interesting part of how it's funded as well,

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
and I'll cover that as well.

02:18.000 --> 02:26.000
And I was very shocked that there's never been a talk ever at FOSSDOM on MKDocs or on Material for MKDocs.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.000
That's just wrong to me, so I'm here to fix that.

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
My personal journey is, I've actually haven't been using it for very long.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
It's pretty recent, basically, since 2021.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
I had to create a tutorial website, or I wanted to create a tutorial website for EasyBuild,

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
for the tool I'm mostly working on.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
The existing EasyBuild documentation was in Sphinx.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
I wasn't terribly happy with that.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
It felt slow.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
It was using RST.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
The syntax didn't make sense to me.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
It was very difficult to work with.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
We were not getting a lot of contributions to that documentation,

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
so I was looking for other things that could be possible.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
The tutorial was a totally new project, a totally new website, and I started looking around.

03:09.000 --> 03:14.000
I found Material for MKDocs, and I was sold after like five minutes.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.000
That tutorial was built with Material for MKDocs, and shortly after we started porting EasyBuild documentation,

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
also our HPC documentation in Gantt, we also started porting that to Material for MKDocs,

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
because it just made a whole lot more sense and was a lot easier to use.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
And also new projects that I've started since then have always been using this tool

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
to create documentation and tutorials.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
So to start with, what is MKDocs?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
How many people here are familiar with MKDocs?

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Who has used MKDocs?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
About half of the room. Good.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
MKDocs is a static site generator.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
It's not a very complex tool, I think.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
It has a very strong focus on building documentation for software,

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
so technical documentation, code, all these kind of things.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
The documentation sources themselves are written in Markdown,

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
which is one of the things that sold me to MKDocs.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
Markdown is everywhere.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
If you're doing pull requests on GitHub or GitLab, issues, formatting there,

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Wikis, it's all Markdown, so the documentation that you're writing should also be Markdown,

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
just to make the jump a bit smaller.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
To configure MKDocs, so how the site should look like and all the bells and whistles it has,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
that's all done in a single YAML file.

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
Maybe you don't like YAML, but at least it's a single file that you want to look into

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
and figure out how to configure it.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
MKDocs itself is implemented in Python.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
That's other than when you install it, you don't really notice that.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
That's probably a good thing.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.000
But it is very easy to install, use, customize, and extend.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
So how do you get started with MKDocs?

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
This is a bit of a long list.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
You install it, pip install MKDocs, basically.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
You started creating a landing page, so an index.md and a docs folder.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Typically, you can change that if you want to.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
You create a minimal configuration file, and then you launch MKDocs.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
You do MKDocs build that will take the Markdown that you put in the index.md.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
It will generate an index.html from that.

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
You can open it in your browser and you're good to start with your documentation site.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.000
You can do MKDocs build strict as well.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
If you have any mistakes in your documentation, like you're linking to a page that doesn't exist,

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
for example, it will go ahead and warn you about that.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
And that's very useful in CI.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
If you're making changes to your documentation,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
you can run this in GitHub Actions, for example,

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
and it will warn you that something is wrong and you shouldn't be merging those changes.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
There's a way to live preview the documentation while you're editing it as well through MKDocs.serve.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I'll show you that as well.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
And now you can go ahead and write your documentation.

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
So showing all of that on the slide is very boring, so let's do it hands-on.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.000
And let's see how quickly this goes wrong.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.000
All right, so I'm essentially starting here from an empty folder.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
There's an empty docs directory, just so I don't forget to put stuff in there.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
The first thing we'll have to do is install MKDocs.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
It's not here.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
So this is just to pip install MKDocs.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
If you're a little bit familiar with Python, you know you have to be careful if you do pip install

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
because it may end up got those somewhere.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
So what I want to do here is create a Python virtual environment.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.000
If I remember how to do that, all right, so now I'm in the virtual environment

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
and in here I can just do pip install MKDocs.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
And if the Wi-Fi works, that should be working.

06:27.000 --> 06:33.000
So now I have MKDocs available, whatever version is there.

06:33.000 --> 06:36.000
Okay, so that's the pip install part, that's step one.

06:36.000 --> 06:42.000
Now I can create a very minimal MKDocs.yaml.

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
And all you really need to put in there as a very minimal thing is the name of the site.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
So let's just toss them here.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
And in the docs folder, we want to create an index.md in markdown.

06:53.000 --> 07:00.000
So let's say hello fosdem, this is a demo.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Okay, that's all we need.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
We do MKDocs build.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
This should be very quick.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
It generates a site directory with a whole bunch of stuff in there including index.hdml.

07:10.000 --> 07:14.000
We can open this in our browser and it looks like this.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
Hooray, it works.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
We even get a search function here.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Of course now there's not a lot to search yet.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
You can search for fosdem and it will bring me to that page.

07:24.000 --> 07:30.000
Okay, so the search functionality is already built in and ready to go.

07:30.000 --> 07:39.000
Now once you start creating a couple more pages, let's say getting started.md.

07:39.000 --> 07:43.000
Like this, if you save this, you have to do MKDocs build again.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
And you have to refresh this site.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
And then here you see there's a getting started page as well.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Now Firefox gets a bit confused because this is all static html.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
So it says what do you want to do?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
I want to open the page.

07:56.000 --> 08:01.000
What's more interesting if you do MKDocs serve.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So now you're getting a small web server here running locally.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
You can click this.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
You see the same website.

08:07.000 --> 08:16.000
But when you start changing stuff, for example, in an existing page, let's say magic happens.

08:16.000 --> 08:24.000
As soon as I've saved this and I switch back to the site, this should not refresh.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Oh right, okay.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
See demos always go wrong.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
Try again.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
You save it and if you switch back it pops up there.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
So you're automatically getting live preview while you're editing the documentation.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
To me this is absolutely brilliant.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
Okay, now what I don't like about this is this theme.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Like what the hell is going on?

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
The lines are white and getting started is here.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Where's my hello page?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
So weird stuff is going on.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
That's where I think Material frontman kdocs kicks in.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
So Material frontman kdocs is a theme for MKDocs.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
It makes things a whole lot better, nicer to look at, just straight out of the box.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Very easy to use.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
And it comes with a whole bunch of plugins and extensions.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
So extra features that MKDocs cannot do by default.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
So I see this as MKDocs with batteries included.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
So this is actually how MKDocs should be out of the box.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Again, easy to install, use and configure.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
All you need to do is in your Python virtual environment.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
So I'll have to kill the serve here.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
You do an pip install MKDocs Material.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
So you just install an additional Python package,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
which will bring in a whole bunch of extensions

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
and there's a whole lot of stuff going on here.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I'll serve this again.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Now, if I look at the website, nothing has changed yet

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
because I have to change the theme as well that's being used.

09:47.000 --> 09:53.000
So in my MKDocs, I say theme, name, Material.

09:53.000 --> 09:58.000
And as soon as I hit save on this and I switch back,

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
I think it needs a refresh.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Why is it not working?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
Oh, something went wrong.

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
Ah, demos.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Okay, let's try restarting this.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Okay, I'm not sure what went wrong with the live preview.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Usually that works.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
So this already looks a lot better.

10:18.000 --> 10:21.000
So at least now I'm seeing my pages and the search.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
The search here is amazing.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
It's blazingly fast.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
Even if you have pretty big documentation,

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
it highlights the things you can customize the search.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
You can rank pages up or down.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
If you want them to be more prominent in your search results,

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
there's a whole bunch of stuff you can do.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
All right, so they get started with Material for MKDocs.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Just with pip install MKDocs Material.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
You change your MKDocs YAML to use Material as a theme

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
and things start looking a lot better already.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
And now the fun really starts because there's a whole bunch of plugins

10:52.000 --> 10:55.000
and extensions you can start using as well.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Now, I'll do a quick cheat code here

10:57.000 --> 11:02.000
because the MKDocs YAML I'll end up with is going to be pretty big

11:02.000 --> 11:05.000
because I want to show you all the bells and whistles.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
I'm not going to type all of that,

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
so I have a hidden file here

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
that I'm just going to move into the right place.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.000
And we open this and you can see there's a whole bunch of stuff here going on now.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
I'll explain it in the slides what's going on.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
So one of the first things you can do is you can start playing with the colors.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
You can change the accent colors.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
So here I use like Fossdam purple.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
That's very easy to change.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
You just say, palette primary color should be purple.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
The accent color, so that's when you hover over stuff, should be blue.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.000
So it's very easy to play with the colors if you're interested.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
But it's also very easy to do is introduce light and dark mode in your documentation.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
So with a little bit more stuff in your MKDocs YAML,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
you can say I actually have two color schemes.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
I have a light mode and a dark mode.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
The dark mode is called Slate for whatever reason.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
The light mode is called Default.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Okay, now you know.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And what actually happens when you do that,

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
so here when I moved that big configuration file in place,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
it actually already did a re-render and now I have dark mode here as well.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
And it's actually a dark mode with tuned colors.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
So I'm getting Fossdam colors in my website now as well.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
So that's one small thing that's very easy to do.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Now let's show off some of the additional features.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
Let me start a new page here.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
Let's call it MaterialMD.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
And let's start showing ContentTabs.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
Material for MKDocs.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Save this, go back.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
It should be picking up on that straight away.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
Okay, so ContentTabs are a way of getting tabs

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
and like a subsection of your documentation page.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
And the best way to show it is to really do the demo.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
So I'll copy paste this markdown code in this one here

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
and I think it needs empty lines in between or it will not be happy.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Right, and now here I have tabs in my documentation.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.000
So that's very nice if you say I need to show different examples

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
with C++ Python different code, for example,

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
this is a very nice way of doing it

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
because people can just pick what they're interested in.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
You can also make sure that people can somehow give a preference,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
like always show me the Python stuff.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
And it will remember the first time they picked something

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
and throughout the whole page it will show always the Python example by default.

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
So it does some caching of this as well.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
To enable this you need to enable two extensions, SuperFences.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.000
So SuperFences is something where you can embed content into each other

13:34.000 --> 13:38.000
so you can start with ContentTabs that then includes other stuff

13:38.000 --> 13:43.000
and like it basically goes recursively so you want to enable that.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
And then you do Tab and UltimateStyleTrue.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
While it has to be true, I don't know, but fine, it works if you do it like this.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
CodeBlocks is a very nice thing as well, also built into Material.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
So let's show that off here.

13:58.000 --> 14:04.000
We can do Code, Block with Python code and that looks very nice.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.000
So this uses Pigments to do the syntax highlighting.

14:07.000 --> 14:12.000
You tell it that it's Python here, so it doesn't figure that out by itself.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
You have to tell it I could try rendering this as Shell

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
and it's probably going to look a bit funny.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
Okay, so it looks reasonably okay.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
So all of this works out of the box.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
They don't have to install any additional stuff to make this work.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.000
It knows about pretty much all the programming languages out there.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
If you want to try Fortran here, it will probably still work.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Another very nice feature is what's called Admonitions,

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
which is a very strange word to me.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
I'm not a native English speaker.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
I'm not familiar with this term, but it's like nodes, warning tips.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.000
So all of these kind of boxes you can include in your documentation

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
is called Admonitions in Material for MKDocs.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
So a small demo of that is here.

14:55.000 --> 15:03.000
Let's do Adma, whatever, nodes and stuff.

15:03.000 --> 15:07.000
Again, it needs an empty line in between or it will not be happy.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
And you start getting nodes.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
You can use custom titles here.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
So all the Admonitions have a particular type,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
which mostly defines the color and the icon you get here,

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
and you can change that title here.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
So you don't get the default.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
The default would just be tip, I think.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
So if I remove this, you'll see tip instead.

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
I think there's a more normal name for me.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
Sorry?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Callouts, yeah, okay.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.000
Fine.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Over naming you can always discuss.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
I didn't pick the name, so don't blame me.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
Blame Martin for that.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
No, no, it's fine.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
To me, it's a confusing name.

15:47.000 --> 15:51.000
Another thing I really like and I know very much

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
that not everybody is a big fan of that is emojis.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
You can use emojis in your documentation.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
I think this is great.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.000
It makes things a bit less serious, a bit less lighthearted.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
You can have some fun in your documentation as well,

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
because some people think it's very boring to read documentation.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
So for some people, this works.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
There's emojis, there's icons as well,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
so there's an arrow in here.

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
This arrow right is not really an emoji, it's an icon.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
So this works pretty well as well.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
Again, I want an empty line in between here.

16:23.000 --> 16:29.000
So be careful if you have too many Belgian beers.

16:29.000 --> 16:33.000
You may get sick in the morning.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.000
All right, so this really works well for me.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.000
And the documentation for Matilda from K-Docs,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
there's a search engine here, so you can look for beer,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
and it will give you all the options that you can use.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
You can look for arrow, and if you click something,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
it will copy, if you click in here,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
it will copy paste it to your clipboard,

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
so you don't even have to type it over.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
Really well done.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Over 10,000 icons, so you can probably find something

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
that you can use in there.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
All right, another very cool feature,

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
which I haven't used myself very much, is using Mermaid.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
So Mermaid is some kind of JavaScript tool to create diagrams.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.000
So with a block of code like this, a block of mermaid code,

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
you can start including graphs in your documentation like this.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
And these could be very complex.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
They render very quickly,

17:20.000 --> 17:24.000
and it not only supports diagrams like this,

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
but you can do pie charts, you can do UML diagrams,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
you can do a Git branch workflow kind of stuff,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
so this is very rich in terms of what it can do.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
Again, you have to enable the corresponding stuff

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
in your markmkdocs.yaml, so you need super fences

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
with some custom fences and yada yada,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
just copy paste this.

17:44.000 --> 17:48.000
You start playing with diagrams in your docs.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
You hit save, and if you're quick enough,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
where is this site here?

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
You start having diagrams in your documentation as well.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
So if you need this kind of stuff in there,

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
this to me beats putting pictures in there,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
because here you can copy paste stuff as well, right,

18:03.000 --> 18:06.000
from your diagrams, so this is better in many cases.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
All right, I think I'm doing quite good on time.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
The last big feature I should say that I want to highlight

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
is the block support.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
So this is quite new in material for mkdocs.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
It has been in the works for quite a while,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
but now it's finally there in the open source version.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
So this is something special,

18:27.000 --> 18:31.000
a dedicated plugin for integrating a blog in your docs.

18:31.000 --> 18:35.000
All you do is you do plugins enable blog, right,

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
and then you can start in a special structure here,

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
so you can do docs blog posts

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
and start creating markdown files in there.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Let me show you what happens if you do that.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
So we want to exit here.

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
You want to make sure that the blog part is set up.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
So this part is auto-created here by mkdocs.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
As soon as you enable the blog's plugin,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
it will create your landing page.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.000
There's no post in here, of course.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
So this is empty.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
I can create a small markdown file here.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
Let me check copy paste.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
So here you can see this has a date.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
This is basically the publication date.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
So if you put this in the future, it will not show up yet

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
until that date hits.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
I think so. I can try if that works.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
So here blog.

19:24.000 --> 19:27.000
This is our blog post that we just added,

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
and this has a dedicated page as well,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
which here it's hard to tell,

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
but in the URL field,

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
it will actually use the date that you've put in the mkdocs as well.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
So it's like everything is nicely date stamped and so on.

19:39.000 --> 19:43.000
I think if I put this to a future date, it's not going to show it.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
So let's try February 5th.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And now the post is...

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Ah, okay, it's still here.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
All right, fine.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
But there is another way you can do draft through,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
so I don't want to show this yet.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
And then, at least on the landing page,

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
it should not be there.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
So as long as it's a draft, it will not show it.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
If you flip it to draft equals false,

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
or just remove that, it will come back.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
Okay, so this is built in into material for mkdocs.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
This is quite amazing.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
All right, so lots of features.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
There's lots of stuff I haven't showed.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
It can do a whole lot more.

20:25.000 --> 20:29.000
So please take a look at the documentation of material for mkdocs itself.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
It's a very nice tool.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
Another aspect I want to talk about very briefly is the way this is funded.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
So funding is a very big issue for lots of open source projects.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.000
And Martin here has come up with a way that works amazingly well,

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
and it's actually pretty simple.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
So material for mkdocs is what's called sponsorware.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
So there's an open source version of it available to anyone.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
You just download it on GitHub.

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
You can pip install it, and you can start playing.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
But there's actually a private version as well,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
which has a couple more features already implemented,

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
but they are not available in the open source version yet.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
To get access to this private version,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
you have to become what's called an insider.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
So you become an insider to the project

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
by doing some kind of monthly donation to the project.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And I think it starts as low as $15 per month,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
so it's quite affordable.

21:17.000 --> 21:22.000
You can also do a yearly donation if you're up for that.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.000
And then what happens, you get access to all these new features

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
that are only available in the private version, in this insider version.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
But eventually these features also come back to the open source version.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
And that happens when a certain funding goal is being hit.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
So Martin sets goals.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
For example, I want to get $10,000 a month of income.

21:40.000 --> 21:43.000
And then all the features that I list here

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
will become part of the public version.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
So as soon as they hit that target, it works.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
And this is nicely covered in the documentation here.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
So on the documentation of material for MK docs,

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
you can see they're now getting over $13,000 a month,

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
which is quite a lot, right?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
So Martin is actually building a team,

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
a development team route, material for MK docs, thanks to this funding.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
So right now this is the funding level.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.000
And he says as soon as we hit $16,000,

22:11.000 --> 22:15.000
we will move all these implemented features from the insiders,

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
from the private version of the tool to the public version.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And then they stay in the public version forever.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
So as soon as they hit this target, that works.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
Now this is interesting because they've hit the $14,000 target already,

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
but then some sponsors dropped out,

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
and now they're back to a little bit below $14,000 again.

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
But that's fine.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
Once it's public, it stays public.

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
What's amazing to me here is that the private version is just a private fork on GitHub.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
So you get access to that private fork,

22:45.000 --> 22:49.000
you get added to the fork essentially as a contributor,

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
so you can access that code.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
But this model somehow works.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
So you could say, okay, if I get the private version,

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
I could just give it to anyone, right?

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
And then it stops working.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
But for some reason, that doesn't happen.

22:59.000 --> 23:02.000
So it's like this honor system, like if you sponsor the project,

23:02.000 --> 23:03.000
you get access to it.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
And literally here at the bottom of the page,

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
it says, please don't distribute the source code that you get access to,

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
and apparently that works.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
And they keep getting new sponsors over and over again.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
They're hitting these goals every couple of months.

23:16.000 --> 23:23.000
So that's maybe an idea for other open source projects as well to take a look at.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
So yeah, Martin told me that this was a bit of a jump,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
like a gamble, let's see what happens.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
And it's been working amazingly for them.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
So he's able to build a development team rather than just having to work on this himself.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
Okay, a lot of features that I didn't cover,

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
which I'm not going to get into here, check the documentation.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
One thing I do want to mention here,

23:41.000 --> 23:46.000
it also makes it very easy to publish your documentation on GitHub pages or GitLab pages.

23:46.000 --> 23:50.000
So it has an MK docs GitHub or GitHub pages something.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.000
And if you integrate that in your GitHub actions workflow,

23:53.000 --> 24:01.000
it will push it to GitHub pages and nicely integrate that in your GitHub account.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Yeah, that's all I have.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
And hopefully there's time for a couple of questions.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.000
Thanks.

24:06.000 --> 24:16.000
Let's have a couple of questions and we'll see how fast they go.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.000
First question.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.000
Very quickly.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
I have two of them.

24:20.000 --> 24:28.000
Do you know if the icons, not much the emoji, but the admonition or whatever,

24:28.000 --> 24:34.000
and also the charts, are they vectors or a roster?

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
So you're talking about these, right?

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
So the question is, are these vectors or are they bitmaps?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
I'm not sure.

24:42.000 --> 24:45.000
I think they're vectors, but I'm not entirely sure.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
You could check, I guess, if you zoom in, where do I have that website open?

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
Here.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
So if you zoom in, you can tell that these are probably vectors, right?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
Yeah, right.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
So they look pretty good.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
The question is, if there is any kind of, maybe it's a stupid question,

25:03.000 --> 25:10.000
but is there any kind of translation to this kind of documentation that I would say PDF?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
Okay.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
Is there a way to export the documentation into PDF?

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
I think there, the answer is no, but they're very much aware that this is a missing feature,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
let's say, and that's something they want to work on.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
I'm not entirely sure if that's correct, but I think that's what Martin told me.

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
Like, compared to other tools, there's like Docosaurus and there's Sphinx and there's other things.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
Some of these tools can do a little bit more.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.000
There's a plugin.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Yeah.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.000
There's a plugin for PDF export.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
Look, yeah.

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
So the plugin system in MKDocs is very nice.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Yeah.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
Yes?

25:40.000 --> 25:41.000
That's great.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Yeah.

25:42.000 --> 25:51.000
One of the nice things about Sphinx in MKDoc is that you can easily do a code documentation

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
so you just send something into the documentation and grab the link.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
You mean like generating API Docs or?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Yeah.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Yeah.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.000
There's a plugin for that for MKDocs.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
I didn't show it here.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
I actually don't have it on the slides.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Okay.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
I had it somewhere, but I think it's MKDocs.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Oh boy.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Doc strings.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Yeah.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.000
So this is MKDoc strings.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
That's the plugin you want to generate API documentation.

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
I'm using this in the Easy Build documentation, for example.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Works fine.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Yeah.

26:28.000 --> 26:35.000
So the question is, did you run into issues with complexity because it's like tool or

26:35.000 --> 26:42.000
another tool and when it talks, you know, maybe it's easy to contribute.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.000
And yes, so knowing when to look if it's issue in the material or if it's underlying MKDocs

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
and how to do it.

26:50.000 --> 26:54.000
So the question is, did you run into issues with complexity because it's a tool on top

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
of another tool and if something goes wrong, where's the problem?

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
Not really because usually if something goes wrong, you get like a Python crash and you

27:03.000 --> 27:09.000
can tell whether it's in a particular plugin or in material or in MKDocs itself.

27:09.000 --> 27:14.000
I haven't run into many issues like this, but if it happens, it's usually quite clear.

27:14.000 --> 27:18.000
And if you don't know, you just report the issue to material for MKDocs and one of the

27:18.000 --> 27:22.000
maintainers is going to tell you it's not an issue here, it's an issue there, you should

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
report it there.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
And you say one thing on top of another, that's not entirely tool, it's like plugins.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
So they do like integrate with each other and there's some complexity there, but yeah,

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
usually it's quite clear if you get like a Python crash, you can tell from where it's

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
coming from.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.000
Can I stop here?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Yeah.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.000
Thank you very much.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
Okay.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.000
Thank you.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Thank you.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Thank you.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
Thank you.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Thank you.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.000
Thank you.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.000
Thank you.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Thank you.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
Thank you.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Thank you.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Thank you.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Thank you.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.000
Thank you.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Thank you.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.000
Thank you.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.000
Thank you.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Thank you.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Thank you.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Thank you.

28:10.000 --> 28:11.000
Thank you.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Thank you.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.000
Thank you.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Thank you.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Thank you.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
Thank you.

28:16.000 --> 28:17.000
Thank you.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.000
Thank you.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Thank you.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Thank you.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
Thank you.
