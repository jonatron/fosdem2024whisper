WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm going to start with the first speaker.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
See if this works.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Oh, that works.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Yeah, that turned on.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay, so I'm going to spell my name.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm doing this old school.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
As you can see, I decided to not deck around.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
Oh, come on.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
That was supposed to get a lease of a little chuckle.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
Ah.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.000
You can find me on GitHub, Blue Sky, LinkedIn.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
That's me.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
So I thought I'd start with a little bit of an introduction

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
about who I am.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
So Addy Gerard, and I am originally from Los Angeles, California.

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
I now live in Austin, Texas, like most of Californians.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
For those of you who are familiar with that,

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
the tech community is moving that way.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
I am a humanitarian, and I have, in my spare time,

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm a hiker, and I love to read, Super Nerd About Data.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
I also, I have a Cocker Spaniel named Kai.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
He's a fluffball of super jealousy who adores my hikes.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
And yes, Kai does come from Ninjago.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
So any Ninjago fans out there?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
The Red Ninja.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Okay.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
I am a communication strategist, and I've been doing that

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
for about 15 years.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
What that means is that I spend my time talking to executives

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
in companies and conveying messages.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
So when you have two people talk, sometimes that doesn't

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
translate between them.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
And I help them communicate with people who are inside their

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
company and also people who are outside of their company.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
I position stories.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
I am a ghost writer for emails,

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
especially when there's problems between division heads.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
So I'm the person they call when things are going wrong,

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
when there's a crisis.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
I am the person who tells them, say this, don't say that.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Look this way, don't look that way.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
That's what I do.

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
I started my open source journey, actually pretty recently.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm active in the Cardano ecosystem,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
as well as the Inner Source Commons ecosystem.

02:21.000 --> 02:29.000
And I came to this because I got mentored by an incredible woman

02:29.000 --> 02:34.000
who helped me see the value of open source and its tremendous

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
impact on businesses today.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
And as a communications professional,

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
I felt that it was really important to be able to tell that

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
story and help executives understand exactly how valuable

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
open source is to them and to their business and to the

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
future world.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
With that experience, I wanted to share today a couple of tips

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
that I have learned over my career about how to position the

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
value of open source.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I'd like to start with the state of open source.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
You'll hear people say, open source is one, right?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Open source is one.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
80% of organizations have increased their open source

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
utilization in the last year.

03:15.000 --> 03:20.000
96% of code bases that have been scammed contain open source

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
code, and 76% of those code bases is open source code.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
I want to invite you to consider if you have a product and 76%

03:33.000 --> 03:37.000
of the market share is yours, you dominate.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
You won. You're there.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
It's incredible.

03:41.000 --> 03:46.000
And it's amazing to me, the principles and values that people

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
were dedicated and fought so hard to get here,

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
to get the kind of adoption and utilization that we have today.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
Let's look at the flip side.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
It doesn't have enough support.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
It doesn't have enough support.

04:05.000 --> 04:10.000
There's a tremendous need for more support in open source.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
Not just in talent, but fiscal support to the community and the

04:13.000 --> 04:19.000
people who are giving to this cause.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
I'm going to illustrate this with a couple of stories.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
I know you guys have all probably heard them.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
Start with left pad.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Prolific open source contributor.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
Company came along, wanted to go against the open source

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
principles, and what did he do?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
He deleted 11 lines of code.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Do you know what the headline said?

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
Internet goes down.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Man breaks the internet.

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
For those of you who are curious about what the monetary impact of that is,

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
and I've debated this with actually a couple of people,

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
but they say that in a minute's time,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
nearly a million dollars worth of commerce happens.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
Which means in the first hour, 54 million dollars of business

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
was lost.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
And in the two hours it took before he posted why,

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
108 million dollars of business was lost.

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
I guarantee you those executives did not expect that.

05:22.000 --> 05:27.000
108 million dollars and 11 lines of code.

05:27.000 --> 05:31.000
Let it never be said that engineers don't have power.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
Another example, again one that we're probably all familiar with,

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
is called Colors and Faker, these projects, right?

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
What happened?

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Now just to paint the picture, these had thousands of projects

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
that utilized this code, thousands, millions of downloads.

05:53.000 --> 05:59.000
This individual should have never, ever, ever, ever been concerned with money.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
What an impact he had.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
Huge.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
But what did he do?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
He uploaded a bug that took it down.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
And the reason he did that is because he needed to be paid.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
The generosity of the open source community is huge.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.000
You don't find that anywhere else, it's amazing.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
You empower the globe.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
But you can't just continue to give,

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
you have to be able to receive too, and people need to give back.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Right? And it's not just about people giving back.

06:32.000 --> 06:38.000
It's about the organizations that profit and utilize this,

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
providing support to the people who are contributing.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
We're at a crossroads.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Open source needs to evolve.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
And it is my belief that at this point in time,

06:51.000 --> 06:57.000
it is of critical import that executives who do not understand

06:57.000 --> 07:01.000
and leadership of organizations who don't understand how prolific

07:01.000 --> 07:06.000
and how important open source is to their organization,

07:06.000 --> 07:11.000
that they understand it, that that information is conveyed to them powerfully,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
and that they don't lose track of that.

07:13.000 --> 07:26.000
They understand what that means to their business, to their future, to their product.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
Let's talk about a couple of strategies that are going to help.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
Now, for those of you who are not in an organization, this might not be as relevant.

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
But for those of you who work for companies that utilize open source,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I'm speaking to you.

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
And I want you to consider these strategies and these ways

07:47.000 --> 07:52.000
that I have managed to impact and get more support for open source.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
There are three steps I'm going to go through.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
The first one is why.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
Why will they give back?

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
The second one is what do they need?

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
And how do you find out what an executive needs?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
How do you find that out?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
How do you figure that out in an organization?

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
And last thing I'm going to go through, how?

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
Okay, so why?

08:14.000 --> 08:18.000
Why will an executive listen to you?

08:18.000 --> 08:25.000
They will listen to you because it impacts their bottom line.

08:25.000 --> 08:32.000
I know this might, this is fundamentally when you look at the leadership of an organization,

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
they are responsible for the health of that organization.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
And that means money.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
That means you are either cutting costs so that you operate more effectively and more efficiently,

08:44.000 --> 08:51.000
or you have done something that contributes to the revenue driving machine of that organization.

08:51.000 --> 08:56.000
Money is how, that's the why, that's the bottom line.

08:56.000 --> 09:04.000
That's what will get you through the door.

09:04.000 --> 09:10.000
Let's talk about what, what they need and how you can find it.

09:10.000 --> 09:15.000
How many of you have been to a corporate town hall?

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
Okay, all right, decent amount, right?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
Let me go through what happens at a corporate town hall, right?

09:21.000 --> 09:24.000
You have your executives and they come out and they're sharply dressed

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
and they're all lined up and they're sitting in their chairs,

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
and they come out and they say, this is what we are moving to, right?

09:32.000 --> 09:38.000
We as an organization are going to do these five things in the next ten years, seven years, three years.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
We're going to make our mark here and here.

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
We're going to do these things, there's usually, you know, three to five things that they're going to accomplish.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
This is really important, this is, this is your roadmap.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
And let me tell you why it's your roadmap.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.000
It's your roadmap because those are the items that the executives are hanging their hat on.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
They have now made a promise and a commitment to their stakeholders,

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
and it doesn't matter whether we're talking about a public or a private organization,

10:08.000 --> 10:17.000
they have stakeholders and they are promising, we're going to make our mark here and here.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
So these items are the way for you to reach it,

10:22.000 --> 10:31.000
and what you need to do is you need to figure out where you have a common interest or a shared risk.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
Where does open source have a common interest or a shared risk on that?

10:37.000 --> 10:42.000
Let me give you some examples that you can utilize.

10:42.000 --> 10:50.000
I would care to wager that on each and every one of those things, you have one line item that talks about HR.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
We're going to enhance the culture.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
We're going to get an internal platform and it's going to talk, people are going to talk.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
We're going to have better recruiting.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.000
HR is a huge cost center for organizations, huge.

11:04.000 --> 11:14.000
Making that efficient, making that work is going to be an incredible thing and an impactful thing for your business, for the company.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
I'll give you a couple of numbers.

11:16.000 --> 11:24.000
In the United States alone, voluntary turnover costs businesses $1 trillion a year.

11:24.000 --> 11:30.000
To replace someone costs one and a half times their salary.

11:30.000 --> 11:33.000
How can open source make an impact there?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Let me give you an example.

11:35.000 --> 11:43.000
In open source, because we work in the open, you can see the caliber of somebody's contributions right now.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
You have an unbelievable community where you know who's out there and you know who's contributing.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
Do you know what kind of impact that has to recruiters?

11:53.000 --> 12:04.000
Think about how many hours they could save understanding that because of this, because our organization embraces this,

12:04.000 --> 12:17.000
we're going to be more effective because we're going to know exactly where we want to go and who we want to connect with because we can see the caliber of their work.

12:17.000 --> 12:27.000
Another thing to think about in 2030, 58% of the workforce is going to be millennials and Gen Z.

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
Do you know what one of the top qualities that millennials and Gen Z are looking for?

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
I didn't hear you.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
Free time.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
Well, yeah.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I wasn't always looking for free time.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
I like that.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
But collaboration.

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
They want to work in a place where it's collaborative.

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
Guess what open source is?

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
It's a collaborative community.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
HR is looking to hire top talent.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
They need top talent.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
They need to attract top talent.

13:03.000 --> 13:11.000
You can do that when you have the values embedded in your organization that people want to go to.

13:11.000 --> 13:19.000
That is a shared interest that open source has with HR that will impact the bottom line of an organization.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
Let's look at a risk.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.000
Let's align a risk.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
Cyber attacks.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.000
Cyber attacks target software supply chain.

13:33.000 --> 13:42.000
And the global economy lost $45.8 billion last year from that.

13:42.000 --> 13:50.000
If 76% of your code base is open source, you should probably spend some time looking at that.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
Investing back in that.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I don't need to draw the picture.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
Everybody has seen it of the stack with the one little toothpick that's holding up all the things.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
And you're one burnt out person away from watching that fall.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
How does that impact an executive?

14:09.000 --> 14:14.000
When your product goes down.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
Ooh, that hurts.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
You just lost market share.

14:19.000 --> 14:24.000
On that roadmap of the things that your organization is going to achieve.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
One of those things is going to be we want new market share.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
We have a new product or something along those lines.

14:32.000 --> 14:41.000
If that product utilizes open source, your executives have forecasted revenue that they're going to earn from said new product.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
They expect it.

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
They're planning their budgets around it.

14:47.000 --> 14:58.000
And that, if that goes down, because there wasn't adequate support, you have just now impacted the executives.

14:58.000 --> 15:02.000
You have a case to make about how impactful that is.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
I mean, there's other things you could look at.

15:04.000 --> 15:16.000
For example, there's a 22% year over year increase in malware that has been contributed in packages to open source repos.

15:16.000 --> 15:29.000
84% of repos have one known open source vulnerability right now.

15:29.000 --> 15:36.000
Open source is powerful and there are cases to be made that will make executives contribute back to the community.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
And it's not that they don't right now, right?

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
We see ausposes are on the rise.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
They're increasing.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
People are starting to have more auspose, which is great.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
It's a dedicated team trying to help get more people involved and support the community.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
But it's not enough.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
There needs to be more.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
All right, let's move on to how.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
I'm going to talk about three things and how.

16:00.000 --> 16:06.000
The first one is nobody gets there alone.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
You all know this.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
It's community effort.

16:09.000 --> 16:18.000
But I want to encourage you to find people with diverse talent who complement your strengths because each and every one of us have a strength.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
And there are people who can complement that people across your organization.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Don't stay in your department.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Build a coalition.

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
Build a coalition of individuals who understand the business value of open source and can convey that message powerfully.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
I'm going to give a couple of examples of roles that you should probably consider.

16:39.000 --> 16:44.000
One is someone in finance or an analyst.

16:44.000 --> 16:57.000
And it would help if they had a platform that they could pull data from, like detergent or something, that they could pull and they could connect the monetary value, the time to make that argument.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
They're vitally important.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
You need data.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
You need numbers.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Another thing that would be really helpful is to have someone in comms or marketing.

17:05.000 --> 17:09.000
Executives are bombarded with information all day long.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
They're not working in the business.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
They're looking at the global view and the whole and looking on the business.

17:17.000 --> 17:24.000
And they need someone who can speak at a very high, very simple, very powerful level.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
Marketing and comms people do this all day long.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
We position things all day long.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
They're very helpful.

17:30.000 --> 17:37.000
There is a study of informal networks done by a professor at Harvard and the University of London.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Her name is Karen Stevenson.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
In fact, Malcolm Goudwell in his book The Tipping Point also referenced this.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
There are three roles that you will find in the informal network within your organization.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
The first role is a connector or a hub.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
You all know these people.

17:56.000 --> 17:59.000
This is the person in your office who knows everyone.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
They're all connected.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
They know everybody around here and there.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.000
They know everyone.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
They are connected and they are talking to people.

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
These are powerful people for you to talk to and help them understand the value of open source.

18:12.000 --> 18:18.000
Because they will share your message and they will share your passion.

18:18.000 --> 18:26.000
Another person, another role that you will find is called a pulse taker.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Pulse taker I know.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.000
They also have connections, not as many as the connector.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
Here is the difference.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
The pulse taker is someone who is very strategic about their connections.

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
They are the person who can see basically around corners.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
You probably can think of a person right now who fits that bill.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
Someone who knows things two or three steps ahead.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
It's like they can see around corners.

18:49.000 --> 18:57.000
Bob over in accounting likes things this way and Sally over here likes things that way.

18:57.000 --> 19:06.000
This person is really important because they can help you convey a message powerfully and navigate the things that are unseen.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
Because they understand how the organization operates and they understand the people in it.

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
Because every organization has its own system and vibe.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
The last one is the gatekeeper.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I know we all love this person.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.000
We all love this person, the one who controls the information and keeps you away.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
Keep you away, right?

19:26.000 --> 19:31.000
They are the hardest person to break through and they can be your biggest advocate.

19:31.000 --> 19:38.000
You can be your biggest advocate once you help them understand the value of open source.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Executives don't work alone.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
They have advisors.

19:43.000 --> 19:48.000
And if you can get the ear of the advisor, you can get your way through the door.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
These are a little bit harder to find, but it's something to consider.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
Let me move on to culture.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
Number two, three.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Every organization has a culture.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
Every country has a culture. People have culture.

20:02.000 --> 20:09.000
It's an important factor and I don't have time to go through all the pieces of it, but I'm going to go through two dimensions.

20:09.000 --> 20:17.000
There are consensus-based organizations in which harmony is paramount.

20:17.000 --> 20:23.000
In an organization where consensus is important, you can upset the apple car.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
And you need all to be with you and understand it and work with you.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
Versus a top-down organization, you're looking for one.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
You have a decision-maker, you are looking for one.

20:36.000 --> 20:44.000
You can be way more strategic and have a few less people that you need to work through in order to get to that top decision-maker.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.000
Another dimension is, is your organization egalitarian or hierarchical, right?

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
Is it flat?

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
Can I go call the CEO today and be like, hey, listen, let's talk?

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
Or is it something, I'll give you a personal example.

21:01.000 --> 21:04.000
A little while ago, I read it wrong.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
I read it wrong. There was a VP a little bit away from me, not too far away, but a little bit away from me.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
And I thought, I'll just set up a meeting. We have some synergies.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
Thirty minutes should be no big deal.

21:14.000 --> 21:19.000
Two hours later, two executive assistants, a director and a VP later, I was informed.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
That was not the right path.

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
There is a path to get to that person, and I had bucked the system.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
That's a hierarchical organization.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Lessons learned, right?

21:29.000 --> 21:36.000
I don't know how many of you have been there, but I see some nodding faces, so I feel like we're getting, there's some equal stories there.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Lastly, how do you position the story?

21:40.000 --> 21:45.000
Best practices for a story contain three parts.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
The first is why?

21:49.000 --> 21:54.000
In this, you will find the characters or the people who are involved.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
You will find the description of the setting.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
And lastly, you will find the conflict.

21:58.000 --> 22:05.000
And let me just say, please, if you hear nothing else today, listen to this.

22:05.000 --> 22:14.000
The conflict in your story that will get them to listen to you is not yours.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
It isn't your conflict.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
They don't care.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
It is their conflict.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
It is their conflict.

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
It is open source's ability to solve their problems.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
And do you remember that road map I told you about?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
That's their problems.

22:35.000 --> 22:40.000
Each and every one of those represents a problem that that organization has.

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
Then you move on to what the solution is.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Here's your big idea.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
Here's your big idea.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.000
And lastly, how it solves it.

22:56.000 --> 23:01.000
We're all really aware of what's happened in the last year.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.000
Some of the license changes that have happened.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.000
Open source is at a pivotal moment.

23:09.000 --> 23:16.000
Because on this stage, the organizations of the world are watching.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.000
They're watching and they're looking and they want to see what happens next.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.000
We're going to get away with this?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
What happens now?

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
Regulations are coming fast and furious and they're not going away.

23:29.000 --> 23:32.000
It's going to change the way things are going to happen.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
The CRA is going to change the way things are going to happen.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
We're at a pivotal moment.

23:38.000 --> 23:45.000
And I think that in this moment, it is really important that everyone be equipped to make this argument.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
To take the case of open source.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
To campaign for the value of open source.

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
To explain how powerful the collaboration and innovation that it drives is.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
To showcase the value of open source.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
To showcase the value of open source.

24:02.000 --> 24:09.000
To show what a community is about and how it makes a difference.

24:12.000 --> 24:19.000
I hope that these strategies that I shared with you today really help you.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
Because everyone can do this.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
Everyone can do this.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
Anybody can make this case.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
Don't make it alone.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Solve their problem.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
We can do this.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
But now is the moment.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Now is the moment.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Thank you.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Thank you.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Are there any questions?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Thank you.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Thank you for the chat.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Really interesting.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
I'm sorry.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I'm going to be the devil's advocate.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
I'm not satisfied with this session.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
No, but I learned a lot.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
There are three points missing from my perspective.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
From my organization.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Maybe you have a solution for it.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
One, I don't see in your talk any solution for the support part.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
For us to convince our executives.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
We need to convince them that somehow, somewhere,

25:31.000 --> 25:38.000
there is a way to give the proper support to that tool or open source in general.

25:38.000 --> 25:44.000
Our executives are still very hesitant to use open source or philosophy because of that.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
Number two.

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Can I take them one at a time?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Because that would be helpful.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
That would be helpful for me just so I don't lose track.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
Because it seems like there's going to be a couple here.

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
So if your organization doesn't understand the power of open source,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
it's because a case hasn't been made that speaks to them yet.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Bottom line.

26:06.000 --> 26:13.000
And one way that I would recommend theoretically helping them understand the value of open source

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
is to demonstrate it within the organization.

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
There is a inner source model that's very powerful to explain and help them understand

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
how impactful it can be from a business perspective.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
It might be one way to look at it.

26:28.000 --> 26:34.000
I mean, they believe that there is more support in the closed source that they can rely on.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
They believe that they have more support in the closed source that they can rely on,

26:39.000 --> 26:45.000
that they can have contracts and everything in the closed source more than the open source.

26:45.000 --> 26:54.000
So that's why they don't see it practical and sustainable to have the support of the community.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
But be careful. I'm with open source to the death.

26:57.000 --> 27:01.000
But it's just a matter of I'm trying to convince my executives.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And this is a breaking point.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
This is a red flag that they always like to support.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
So just, yeah.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
Second thing is that most of these executives come from the user perspective

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
and not the developer perspective, the open source perspective.

27:15.000 --> 27:22.000
And so far, the biggest market share is Windows and Mac for the operating system.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.000
And for Office Suits, it's Microsoft Office as well.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
So they use closed source. They use proprietary.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.000
They use WhatsApp instead of Signal and Telegram.

27:32.000 --> 27:37.000
They use all of these things and they're used to them and they don't have this mentality.

27:37.000 --> 27:44.000
So from user experience, unless we get away to get more adoption rate in our society

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
where more people are using more open source, that will affect, in my humble opinion,

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
the way that the next generation executives will say,

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
ah, yeah, I totally understand the reason why you're using Signal and not WhatsApp, for example.

27:57.000 --> 28:00.000
And sorry, the last point is change management.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
Oh, yeah.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
I think that is the biggest thing that we can work on.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.000
Oh, it is. I'm a change management professional.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
And a lot of organizations make a mistake of saying,

28:08.000 --> 28:11.000
oh, we're going to get a new process in and they drop this new process in

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
and it's going to solve our problems.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.000
And you know what? Nothing happens.

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
Because unless you have adoption, you've got nothing.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
You may have spent $3 million to put this fabulous education piece in place,

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
and if people don't use it, you just flush that money.

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
There is not enough people support. I completely agree.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
I would invite and love to talk to you about inner source

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
because I think that might be a really powerful thing

28:34.000 --> 28:37.000
for them to understand the value of open source

28:37.000 --> 28:40.000
if they're so wanting to stay behind the firewall.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
Hi.

28:41.000 --> 28:45.000
Hi. And just one thing as a company that provides support in open source work,

28:45.000 --> 28:49.000
it's your job to go and tell the executives that there are plenty of companies

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
and tell them which companies they have to go to

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
or you bring them examples of how good that can work.

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
And we work exactly as a proprietary company.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
They just don't know it because proprietary company told them that we are all in a garage.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.000
I get a type of one more question.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Hi. Thank you.

29:13.000 --> 29:16.000
So you mentioned different cultures in the organization.

29:16.000 --> 29:24.000
I was wondering if you have some helpful tips and remarks about a US versus European kind of company

29:24.000 --> 29:27.000
if you think this is important or not.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
Just perspective on that. Thank you.

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
There are a lot of differences and saying Europe in general is a little problematic

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
because it depends where you are in Europe really fundamentally.

29:40.000 --> 29:44.000
I can reference a couple of books that would help and there's some studies,

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
cultural organization, if you want to meet me after I can give you those references

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
because culture is a huge part of it.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
And as the gentleman said, and thank you for pointing that out

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
because I failed to and I intended to.

29:57.000 --> 30:02.000
Change management is going to be a critical component and it supports the cultural aspect

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
because it talks to the people.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Oftentimes we forget that we're talking to people.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
It's very technical. It's very process.

30:08.000 --> 30:15.000
It's very system and behind each and every one of those things is a person who has to do it.

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
And if you aren't connected with that person, you have nothing.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.000
You have a stack of really cool stuff and nothing.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
It's the people.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.000
So change management and culture are going to play a huge part in that.
