WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.680
Good morning.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
Good morning.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.920
I'm Cecilia Mawindu.

00:22.920 --> 00:26.120
I'm a community mobilizer and assistant coordinator at

00:26.120 --> 00:29.560
internews and I'm also a journalist.

00:29.560 --> 00:34.440
So today I'm going to start with a story.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.640
People love stories.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.920
People relate to stories.

00:37.920 --> 00:43.440
So there is a small village in the heart of East Africa.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.840
Why did I choose East Africa?

00:45.840 --> 00:48.600
I'm from East Africa, so yes.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.640
And they are a group of journalists

00:50.640 --> 00:52.200
and they are dedicated journalists.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.840
And they want to do an investigative piece

00:54.840 --> 00:58.960
about a certain river where bodies are damped every day

00:58.960 --> 01:02.840
from different parts of their country.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.200
But for them to do this, it being an investigative story,

01:06.200 --> 01:08.360
they need to use safety tools.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.120
They need to use encryption tools

01:10.120 --> 01:12.560
because they are a group of 10 journalists

01:12.560 --> 01:15.080
and of course they will be communicating with each other.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.600
So they need to use safety tools like encryption tools.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.200
For example, use of Mabel or they are going to use a tool

01:21.200 --> 01:24.560
like bayonet whereby they are going to document and all that.

01:24.600 --> 01:30.040
But unfortunately for them, that those tools are in languages

01:30.040 --> 01:31.360
that they can't use.

01:31.360 --> 01:36.280
So enter the hero of our story, localization.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.960
So what is localization?

01:38.960 --> 01:40.400
But before I go to localization,

01:40.400 --> 01:42.880
let me run to the punchline.

01:42.880 --> 01:46.080
Ki Swahili is spoken by 150 million

01:46.080 --> 01:49.440
to 200 million people around the world.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.120
Basically most of the people who speak Swahili

01:52.160 --> 01:54.240
are concentrated in the African region,

01:54.240 --> 01:58.200
especially the East African region from Burundi, Congo,

01:58.200 --> 02:01.360
Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.

02:02.360 --> 02:05.240
So as I said, what is localization?

02:05.240 --> 02:08.720
Localization is adopting a tool into languages

02:08.720 --> 02:10.680
that into different languages

02:10.680 --> 02:13.320
and localization is not just about translation.

02:13.320 --> 02:16.440
It's to be able to translate that information

02:16.440 --> 02:19.320
to fit the culture and the context of the community

02:19.320 --> 02:22.680
or the language that you are translating for.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.800
So what is the importance of localization in open source tools?

02:26.800 --> 02:28.560
I go back to the story I was talking about.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.880
These journalists can't be able to use this tool.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.440
So chances are they might start doing the story

02:33.440 --> 02:36.800
and along the way the information is intercepted

02:36.800 --> 02:38.920
or they even put themselves in harm's way.

02:38.920 --> 02:40.960
So localization is very important

02:40.960 --> 02:44.680
because it makes it accessible to a wider audience.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.000
One of the things under the sustain project

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
which is being run by internet is right now

02:49.000 --> 02:51.800
and sustained stands for sustaining safety tools

02:51.800 --> 02:54.840
with analytics, networking and insight.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.880
We are talking about sustainability

02:56.880 --> 02:58.520
and one of the things that has come out

02:58.520 --> 03:00.600
among the six tools that we are dealing with,

03:00.600 --> 03:02.440
they want to expand their user base.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.840
But one of the key to expand their user base

03:04.840 --> 03:07.760
is have them in languages where people can be able

03:07.760 --> 03:08.760
to understand.

03:08.760 --> 03:10.800
So when you localize these tools,

03:10.800 --> 03:12.640
you give people an opportunity,

03:12.640 --> 03:15.120
especially marginalized community,

03:15.120 --> 03:18.000
you give them an opportunity to be able to use these tools

03:18.000 --> 03:21.560
and also it's also a way of bringing in different end users

03:21.560 --> 03:24.280
who can bring in different angles.

03:25.480 --> 03:28.080
So what are the challenges of localization funding?

03:28.080 --> 03:29.760
Of course, funding, funding, funding.

03:29.760 --> 03:30.880
You know, we keep saying funding

03:30.880 --> 03:32.600
and we sound like a broken record,

03:32.600 --> 03:36.400
but I think we can't say it in any other way, funding.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.480
So funding is an issue when it comes to localization

03:39.480 --> 03:41.440
and also lack of enough volunteers.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.520
There is an organization called Localization Lab

03:43.520 --> 03:47.080
where they localize tools in different languages.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.840
I was part of localization at some point

03:50.840 --> 03:53.240
and I saw there were so many people who would volunteer

03:53.240 --> 03:54.800
from different parts of the world.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.440
But the other day I was speaking to Irene

03:56.440 --> 03:59.680
who is in the room today and she was telling me about,

03:59.680 --> 04:02.160
also there is the privilege of being a volunteer

04:02.160 --> 04:04.360
because some people would want to volunteer,

04:04.360 --> 04:06.520
but there's no time to do that, you know.

04:06.520 --> 04:10.160
So lack of enough volunteers is also another issue.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.320
And also something that has come up in localization

04:13.320 --> 04:16.280
is there are some words which you can't translate

04:16.320 --> 04:18.000
or localize into different languages.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.560
For example, in Swahili.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.480
When we localize some tools,

04:21.480 --> 04:23.720
there are some words we just leave them like that.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.320
So you find also the people you are localizing for,

04:26.320 --> 04:28.720
that is one word, they look at the tool,

04:28.720 --> 04:29.880
yes they understand what you're saying,

04:29.880 --> 04:32.160
but there is a word that is not translated

04:32.160 --> 04:34.360
and you find people wondering what does this mean?

04:34.360 --> 04:36.520
So also that's another issue.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.960
So what are the some success stories that have been there

04:38.960 --> 04:41.120
when it comes to localization of tools in Swahili?

04:41.120 --> 04:43.160
There are so many, there are several tools

04:43.160 --> 04:44.880
that have been translated in Swahili.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.240
There is a Swahili community.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.320
Well, it's not as big as we would want it,

04:48.320 --> 04:49.400
but it is there.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.680
There is a Safe Sister Guide.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.680
A Safe Sister Guide has been created by internews

04:53.680 --> 04:55.520
and our program called Safe Sister,

04:55.520 --> 04:57.200
I'm a product of Safe Sister.

04:57.200 --> 05:00.880
Safe Sister is fellowship where they train women,

05:00.880 --> 05:03.480
especially from the Sub-Saharan region

05:03.480 --> 05:05.040
on the issue of digital safety.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.680
They train us to be training TOTs,

05:07.680 --> 05:09.560
we train people on digital safety.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.280
So Safe Sister Guide has been translated in Swahili

05:12.280 --> 05:13.960
and I can attest to it

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
because I know I've trained using Swahili.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.560
One time I was training in my village

05:19.560 --> 05:21.600
and it was such an easy thing

05:21.600 --> 05:24.720
because we speak in Swahili in my village

05:24.720 --> 05:26.640
and I could see the girls getting very excited

05:26.640 --> 05:29.480
because now they could be able to understand

05:29.480 --> 05:31.200
the thing on online safety

05:31.200 --> 05:34.000
because now there was a guide in Swahili.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.360
Then they spent America Online Harassment Manual

05:36.360 --> 05:39.760
which we translated into Swahili in 2022

05:39.800 --> 05:44.800
and I have seen, especially journalists from Zanzibar,

05:45.280 --> 05:48.000
Tanzania use this harassment manual

05:48.000 --> 05:49.360
because now it is in Swahili.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.200
They have been able to contextualize

05:51.200 --> 05:53.080
what is in the manual.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.760
So there are so many success stories

05:54.760 --> 05:56.480
but I picked these two

05:56.480 --> 05:59.040
because I have trained using both of them

05:59.040 --> 06:03.240
and I have seen how it has been able to have an impact.

06:03.240 --> 06:06.240
So how do we get involved in localization?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.200
There's so many opportunities

06:08.240 --> 06:10.160
you can involve yourself in localization.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.000
You can decide to be a volunteer.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.400
If you're too busy, you can try to recruit someone

06:14.400 --> 06:17.200
who has the time.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.800
Also you can be able to provide feedback.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.160
Feedback is like pulling teeth.

06:21.160 --> 06:23.120
Getting feedback from people is so hard.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.440
So when you can be able to get feedback from people,

06:25.440 --> 06:27.400
help to get feedback, especially on these two.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.680
For example, we have localized SafeSister Guide in Swahili.

06:30.680 --> 06:32.400
Swahili is not standard.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.800
You find the Swahili, the Tanzanian speak,

06:34.800 --> 06:37.320
is not there, there is some difference.

06:37.360 --> 06:41.480
The Swahili, the people from Congo speak is so different.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.360
So how do we able to make that tool

06:43.360 --> 06:45.400
that has been localized in Swahili

06:45.400 --> 06:48.440
be able to be used in Congo, in Tanzania?

06:48.440 --> 06:51.640
So as a person, if you're reading this document

06:51.640 --> 06:54.520
and you see maybe there is a word that can be changed,

06:54.520 --> 06:56.440
you can be able to provide feedback.

06:56.440 --> 06:58.280
And then contributing to translation.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.640
There are several translation tool.

07:00.640 --> 07:04.960
The one we used to use at localization is called Transifx.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.280
So you can also decide to be able to,

07:08.280 --> 07:11.320
for example, also provide feedback on the translation tool.

07:11.320 --> 07:15.200
And also if you can be able to connect these tools

07:15.200 --> 07:18.640
with funders who can able to fund the localization,

07:18.640 --> 07:22.040
that is one way of getting involved.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.280
And also community.

07:23.280 --> 07:25.000
So when we come in our tell,

07:25.000 --> 07:26.760
the story we're talking about,

07:26.760 --> 07:28.320
if they don't solve this problem,

07:28.320 --> 07:30.560
then what happens to that story?

07:30.560 --> 07:32.960
For example, if they're from an authoritarian regime,

07:32.960 --> 07:34.840
as I said, they could be,

07:35.840 --> 07:37.880
they could be attacked by the government

07:37.880 --> 07:40.000
or the people who are doing whatever they are doing.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.040
So how can we also rally our community

07:42.040 --> 07:44.840
when it comes to the issue of localization?

07:44.840 --> 07:47.160
Also, sometimes we localize tools

07:47.160 --> 07:48.920
and define people are not using those tools.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.440
So you will localize it in Swahili, it's not being used.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.440
So also how can you put the information out there

07:54.440 --> 07:57.360
and say, hey, this tool, Bayanat is in Swahili now.

07:57.360 --> 07:58.680
You can be able to use it.

07:58.680 --> 08:02.840
Bayanat does ABC, so community driven effort.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.400
So when I'm coming to my conclusion,

08:05.400 --> 08:07.560
so localization makes technology

08:07.560 --> 08:09.760
and digital resources available,

08:09.760 --> 08:12.400
not only in Swahili, but in different languages.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.680
It empowers individual to participate

08:14.680 --> 08:16.560
in the digital world that we are in today.

08:16.560 --> 08:19.240
If there is anything COVID-19 underscored,

08:19.240 --> 08:21.880
underscored is the importance of the digital world.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.560
And then also they're able to access digital content

08:24.560 --> 08:27.600
and we are able to bridge the digital divide.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.080
Thank you so much.

08:29.080 --> 08:35.880
I'll give this opportunity to anyone

08:35.880 --> 08:37.600
who wants to ask a question.

08:41.680 --> 08:42.680
Yes.

08:42.680 --> 08:45.680
Thanks for that.

08:45.680 --> 08:48.400
I'm new to the federal localization

08:48.400 --> 08:50.560
that I'm in use for Swahili and we just started

08:50.560 --> 08:51.560
saving dept.

08:51.560 --> 08:58.080
For example, I think the app is now at least in Swahili.

08:58.200 --> 09:03.880
But one of the things I've noticed,

09:03.880 --> 09:07.520
so I know from German where you have people speak very

09:07.520 --> 09:10.000
differently, but then there's a standard German,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
so we'll accept the standard German.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.880
But what I hear of Swahili is that there isn't,

09:18.880 --> 09:20.320
well I mean you just said it basically,

09:20.320 --> 09:22.880
but I've heard it also that there isn't just like,

09:22.880 --> 09:25.800
except then, like government approved standards.

09:25.800 --> 09:31.000
And from my experience the tools generally assume

09:31.000 --> 09:33.720
there's like a clear, like this is the language

09:33.720 --> 09:35.600
and you just follow that.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.200
I'm wondering if there's anything you think that can

09:38.200 --> 09:41.280
we represent something like Swahili better,

09:41.280 --> 09:47.160
like this one, more continuum than a clear standard?

09:47.160 --> 09:51.720
So, as I said, there's the online harassment manual

09:51.720 --> 09:55.640
that we translated in 2022.

09:56.480 --> 09:59.920
What we did, we had translators from Tanzania,

09:59.920 --> 10:02.560
we had translators from the Congo,

10:02.560 --> 10:04.400
we had translators from Kenya,

10:04.400 --> 10:06.320
we are looking at the major regions where Swahili

10:06.320 --> 10:07.160
is spoken.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.720
So what we did is making sure that the people,

10:09.720 --> 10:12.800
the localizers from Tanzania are able to localize,

10:12.800 --> 10:16.280
and I know it's a lot of work, but we also said if we

10:16.280 --> 10:18.840
don't do that, then we'll find also it's a preserve

10:18.840 --> 10:21.960
of the few, maybe the Kenyans and a bit of the Tanzania.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.200
So we got localizers from different language.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.240
I can tell you right now, if I go to the manual

10:26.240 --> 10:30.400
and I read the Congolese part, it's quite tricky

10:30.400 --> 10:31.360
because I'm from Kenya,

10:31.360 --> 10:33.760
this Swahili is quite a bit different,

10:33.760 --> 10:37.160
but we also try to make it standard whereby even if you

10:37.160 --> 10:39.680
don't understand it 100%, you can get the concept

10:39.680 --> 10:41.520
of what it's talking about.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.440
So that is one way we've tried to beat that.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.560
Yes, yes, Mark.

10:47.560 --> 10:52.040
So when you are working with different dialects like this,

10:52.080 --> 10:57.080
do you find it's more effective to have each group

10:57.640 --> 11:01.280
start from English or is it better to translate it,

11:01.280 --> 11:05.240
say you start with Congolese Swahili and then you have

11:05.240 --> 11:08.080
people from Kenya and Tanzania work off of that,

11:08.080 --> 11:10.920
or did each group start with the manual in English

11:10.920 --> 11:12.720
and independently translate it?

11:12.720 --> 11:15.160
Yes, that's what we did from English.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.480
And then now after that, you now sit down and look at it

11:18.480 --> 11:20.400
and give feedback on it.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.560
Because as I said, we didn't want it to come out

11:22.560 --> 11:25.880
like so different, so somebody will be able to be confused.

11:25.880 --> 11:26.720
Yes.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.040
Yes, Kyle.

11:32.040 --> 11:35.680
As a non-Swahili speaker and when working with

11:36.880 --> 11:40.200
these resources and being able to pinpoint

11:41.520 --> 11:46.520
what languages, different pieces of documentation

11:46.640 --> 11:48.640
need to be translated into,

11:49.520 --> 11:53.760
what is the best way to sort of support the community,

11:53.760 --> 11:58.760
whose language and context we're trying to support

11:59.440 --> 12:01.520
the translation of resources for,

12:02.640 --> 12:07.640
as someone who wouldn't be able to necessarily assist

12:08.320 --> 12:11.520
with the translation, what's the best way to support that?

12:11.520 --> 12:15.320
I think just the best, because you are an non-Swahili speaker,

12:15.320 --> 12:19.000
is getting reviews or feedback from the Swahili speakers,

12:19.000 --> 12:22.120
that is the end users, and now the information

12:22.120 --> 12:24.960
that you are able to collect depends on who you are,

12:24.960 --> 12:27.480
you are sharing the information to maybe it could be developers,

12:27.480 --> 12:30.000
maybe it could be finders.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.040
You frame it in a way that you can be able to relay

12:33.040 --> 12:35.960
the information as much as you can speak the language.

12:35.960 --> 12:36.800
Yes.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.360
So if there are no more questions, my time is up.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.200
Yes, yes.

12:45.200 --> 12:49.160
Well, I'm wondering if you consider doing separate

12:49.160 --> 12:51.520
Swahili for congruence, like Swahili,

12:51.520 --> 12:53.240
or somewhere else, or whether that,

12:54.240 --> 12:58.600
and if so, why you couldn't have chose matter?

13:01.640 --> 13:02.960
I repeat your question.

13:02.960 --> 13:04.680
Yes, a big thought where,

13:07.400 --> 13:09.400
like it's possible to say, okay,

13:09.400 --> 13:11.280
we're gonna make the translation that's,

13:11.280 --> 13:13.720
like technically possible to say,

13:13.720 --> 13:15.200
this is Swahili from Congo,

13:15.200 --> 13:17.560
this is Swahili from Kenya, this is one,

13:17.560 --> 13:20.560
and then do separate Swahili translations.

13:20.560 --> 13:24.120
So I'm wondering, is there something about the culture

13:24.120 --> 13:27.080
of Swahili that means you wouldn't want to do that?

13:27.080 --> 13:29.840
Like, if you'd rather have a kind of,

13:30.880 --> 13:32.920
it sounds like you chose to make this standard,

13:32.920 --> 13:34.640
is that the culture?

13:34.640 --> 13:38.000
Okay, one of the things is also the resources,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.240
because if we were to go like fully Congolese,

13:41.240 --> 13:43.080
it would mean like having a separate,

13:44.040 --> 13:47.320
so what we are trying to do is make it standard

13:47.320 --> 13:51.760
so that any Swahili speaker can be able to understand it,

13:51.760 --> 13:55.160
and also we don't want to be able to create too,

13:55.160 --> 13:57.200
because you see now the issue of dialects,

13:57.200 --> 13:59.560
especially in Africa, there's so many, you know,

13:59.560 --> 14:01.840
even in Congo, you find there's Swahili being spoken

14:01.840 --> 14:05.000
in Kinshasa, is different from another town.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.040
So we didn't want to bring all those things,

14:07.040 --> 14:09.280
because it would be like opening a Pandora's box.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.240
So we try to make it in, yes.

14:13.920 --> 14:15.240
So, yes.

14:16.440 --> 14:17.280
Thank you.

14:17.280 --> 14:22.280
I'm curious about how do you just collect feedback

14:25.600 --> 14:28.160
from the Swahili language users?

14:28.160 --> 14:30.480
Just what kind of mechanism or...

14:31.520 --> 14:33.880
Okay, so one of the mechanisms that we do that

14:33.880 --> 14:36.800
is also targeting people, like for example,

14:36.800 --> 14:39.560
as I said, my hometown, we speak a lot of Swahili.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.720
So targeting people directly,

14:41.920 --> 14:44.840
also as a journalist, you are able to put information

14:44.840 --> 14:47.960
out there, say I'm providing feedback for ABCD,

14:47.960 --> 14:49.720
or when you are doing a training,

14:49.720 --> 14:51.800
and you are doing a training in Swahili,

14:51.800 --> 14:53.240
after you do the training,

14:53.240 --> 14:56.040
you also get feedback from those people, yes.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.120
So being targeted, yes.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.800
So thank you so much.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.960
The floor is yours.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.040
The floor is yours.

15:09.040 --> 15:09.880
Thank you.
