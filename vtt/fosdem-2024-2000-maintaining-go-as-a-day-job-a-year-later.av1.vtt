00:00.000 --> 00:11.120
Next speaker, I'm very happy to have him because he called him only last week and asked, could

00:11.120 --> 00:12.640
you speak at the Go Devron please?

00:12.640 --> 00:17.240
Because we had a cancelled talk, apparently immigration out to the UK is a problem post

00:17.240 --> 00:18.240
Brexit.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.240
And he said yes.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.200
And why did I call him?

00:22.200 --> 00:25.280
Because last year he also had to say no to me.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.920
And he promised me to give a talk.

00:27.920 --> 00:32.240
And he's going to give the same talk he promised to me last year, which is basically I could

00:32.240 --> 00:35.280
develop a page at Google and here's why.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.720
A round of applause for Filippo.

00:37.720 --> 00:43.120
Thank you.

00:43.120 --> 00:47.160
The good news is that this is a much better talk than I would have given a year ago.

00:47.160 --> 00:51.040
Because a year ago I had no idea if this was going to work.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.600
I have good news.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.520
Anyway, first a bit about me.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.000
I'm Filippo Valzorda.

00:57.000 --> 01:02.560
I've been the maintainer of the Go Cryptography Standard Library since 2018.

01:02.560 --> 01:06.280
And that's a job I've shared over the years with Katie Hawkman, Roland Schumacher, Damien

01:06.280 --> 01:09.640
Neal, Nicola Moreno and many others, to be clear.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.840
I was doing that at Google until 2022.

01:12.840 --> 01:16.240
So I was on the Go team.

01:16.240 --> 01:21.160
The title I had was the leader of the Go security team.

01:21.160 --> 01:26.040
And that's the team that did things, including the fuzzing support that we were talking about

01:26.160 --> 01:27.160
earlier.

01:27.160 --> 01:29.720
Until 2022.

01:29.720 --> 01:38.880
Because in 2022 I left pretty much to prove a point about proving that something was possible.

01:38.880 --> 01:45.760
And the something was, actually, let me tell you a story first.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.560
Stop me if you heard it.

01:47.560 --> 01:53.320
You're maintaining an open source project and that open source project has two kinds

01:53.320 --> 01:54.320
of maintainers.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.320
Some are volunteers.

01:55.320 --> 01:59.440
So you don't really feel like you can ask any hard commitment of them.

01:59.440 --> 02:04.240
You can tell them, well, Alice, you really told me that you were going to fix CI.

02:04.240 --> 02:05.760
Why isn't it fixed?

02:05.760 --> 02:09.120
Well, Alice will respond because you don't pay me.

02:09.120 --> 02:11.360
And what do you say to that?

02:11.360 --> 02:12.360
Nothing.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.480
Yes, exactly.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.120
Thank you for your help.

02:17.120 --> 02:22.320
And the alternative is you are employed full time at a company.

02:22.320 --> 02:28.600
And that company is a reality of capitalist society, which I say with no value judgment

02:28.600 --> 02:29.600
there.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.160
And that company has an interest in making money.

02:33.160 --> 02:37.040
And has an interest in not spending money that will not make money because that's what

02:37.040 --> 02:39.200
a company is and does.

02:39.200 --> 02:46.000
And that company will maybe start a project because it has a bunch of value for recruitment

02:46.000 --> 02:48.200
and for internal infrastructure.

02:48.200 --> 02:52.120
And it will fund some maintainers because it goes like, yeah, yeah, this is a good project

02:52.120 --> 02:54.800
and we should make it into existence.

02:54.800 --> 02:55.800
And that's great.

02:55.800 --> 02:59.520
That's the company contributing something to the world and we should appreciate that.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.760
Then the project grows.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.520
Now does the value of that project to that company grow?

03:05.520 --> 03:07.960
Not really.

03:07.960 --> 03:12.680
So the number of users double and then double and then double and then double.

03:12.680 --> 03:17.520
And they start filling rooms and conferences and that's great.

03:17.520 --> 03:25.440
And do you think the number of people working on that project fully paid by a company grow?

03:25.440 --> 03:28.000
They do not.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.920
And some people get angry at the company and they think that's misplaced because why should

03:32.920 --> 03:37.320
a company say, oh yes, this is more useful to the world so we should sink a lot more

03:37.320 --> 03:38.320
money into it.

03:38.320 --> 03:42.080
I mean, hey, if it was my money, sure.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.680
But you're a manager at a company, it's not your money, it's the shareholders' money,

03:45.680 --> 03:48.840
it's not really even a thing you can do.

03:48.840 --> 03:54.600
So now you have a problem because success of the project puts the project in a difficult

03:54.600 --> 03:55.600
position.

03:55.600 --> 04:00.120
And I said, stop me if you know this one because this is not around about go.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.280
This is not about Google.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.200
This is not about any specific case.

04:04.200 --> 04:08.800
If I had seen this only once, I wouldn't have said, well, this kind of needs a fix.

04:08.800 --> 04:13.800
This is something I've heard over and over and over again, all over the industry, all

04:13.800 --> 04:18.040
over the past 10 years, all over different companies.

04:18.040 --> 04:22.840
Because this is fundamentally an issue in alignment of incentives.

04:22.840 --> 04:28.320
So the problem is that critical open source projects that we don't have a sustainable

04:28.320 --> 04:30.440
way to maintain them.

04:30.440 --> 04:34.640
And I'm not talking about contributing back, I'm not talking about integrating a new feature

04:34.640 --> 04:36.080
or anything like that.

04:36.080 --> 04:40.880
I'm talking about the grant work of going through the issue tracker every morning and

04:40.880 --> 04:44.560
say no, no, no, no, no.

04:44.560 --> 04:49.280
Which I guess is tinged by what I do, which is cryptography, which most of the times I

04:49.280 --> 04:50.600
want to tell you know about.

04:50.600 --> 04:54.760
And if I said no to anybody in this room on the issue tracker, I'm sorry, you can find

04:54.760 --> 04:59.400
me later.

04:59.400 --> 05:08.560
But the point is that that work is really hard to fund both in the volunteerism model

05:08.560 --> 05:13.040
and in the full-time employment model.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.040
So what did I do?

05:14.040 --> 05:21.640
Well, I had this hypothesis that there was a way to fund open source maintenance like

05:21.640 --> 05:23.400
a profession.

05:23.400 --> 05:29.880
And the model goes a bit like this, going to companies and offering them retainers.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.720
Making the core focus maintenance.

05:31.720 --> 05:37.080
So not going to companies and say you'll get 100 hours of support this year.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
That doesn't scale.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.320
I'm not talking about, hey, do you really want that feature?

05:41.320 --> 05:45.400
I'll implement it for XK.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.720
That's actually kind of, I'm super uncomfortable with that because that means that to make

05:49.720 --> 05:52.280
money you need to add features.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.000
If you add features, you increase maintenance burden.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.040
If you increase maintenance burden, you need more money.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.320
So what do you do?

05:59.320 --> 06:01.080
You add more features.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.360
And yeah, that's a bad spiral.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.600
You don't want to be in that spiral.

06:05.600 --> 06:10.440
And there's also applying for grants, which is a totally valid way to go about it, but

06:10.440 --> 06:13.320
then you become an expert in applying for grants.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.520
And hey, I made a lot of questionable life choices.

06:16.520 --> 06:20.440
I just didn't make that one question of life choice.

06:20.440 --> 06:25.280
So that is the part where people tell me, yeah, but companies really don't want to pay for

06:25.280 --> 06:26.280
this.

06:26.280 --> 06:29.000
So really no way to go about it.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.080
That was the part that I was convinced was not true.

06:33.080 --> 06:37.440
I was convinced that companies can get something out of this because some companies even have

06:37.440 --> 06:42.680
an internal go team whose only job is being experts in go.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.120
Now that costs so much money.

06:45.120 --> 06:52.760
A fully loaded software engineer is like a giant expense.

06:52.760 --> 06:58.240
So my theory was that I could go to these companies and say, hey, do you want a resident

06:58.240 --> 07:03.760
go expert that you can ask advice to and who can liaison your issues with the team and

07:03.760 --> 07:08.000
can help you guide through the contribution process and so on.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.360
And to be clear, this is not offering governance.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.360
This is not offering support hours.

07:11.360 --> 07:18.400
This is just, would you like expertise that you don't currently have access to?

07:18.400 --> 07:22.680
And a lot of people told me, no, that's not going to work.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.800
I was kind of convinced it would work.

07:25.800 --> 07:30.080
So I quit and tried.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.480
And here I want to make a small parenthesis.

07:32.480 --> 07:35.040
This is an incredibly privileged thing to do.

07:35.040 --> 07:40.560
I was able to do this because I had the money from having worked at Google because I live

07:40.560 --> 07:45.400
in a country with a sane healthcare system.

07:45.400 --> 07:53.200
And yes, and because of my personal position and because I knew that I could actually call

07:53.200 --> 07:56.480
up a number of people and say, hey, would you give me a half an hour of your time?

07:56.480 --> 07:58.320
I want to pitch you something.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.960
And we'll get to that.

07:59.960 --> 08:04.760
Anyway, this is almost exactly a year ago, which I did not realize until I made the slides.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.720
I'm pretty happy about that.

08:06.720 --> 08:12.000
So exactly a year ago, I announced that this is what I was going to do.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
At this time, I had one, I think one client.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.600
So it'll take until you make it.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.520
If you want to read more about the model, and this was the 10-minute version, but if

08:23.520 --> 08:30.760
you want to know more, that's an article you can find, search engines sort of still work.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.480
So I'm sure you can find it.

08:33.480 --> 08:35.080
Now a year has passed.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.320
So this is an update talk.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.840
A lot of people ask me, OK, so how is it going?

08:38.840 --> 08:42.600
And to be fair, I haven't published much because there's a lot of work involved in doing this

08:42.600 --> 08:43.600
thing.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.360
Now, first of the good news.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.560
It's working.

08:46.560 --> 08:50.360
I have a healthy portfolio of clients.

08:50.360 --> 08:56.560
So far, only one client has turned, and not because they were unhappy about the service,

08:56.560 --> 09:00.720
but for their side reasons.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.400
And I am fairly happy with this.

09:04.400 --> 09:09.240
And this is funding me at the same level as Google was funding me, which I'm not saying

09:09.240 --> 09:10.240
as a humble brat.

09:10.240 --> 09:15.360
I'm saying it because I think it's important that we offer an alternative for maintainers

09:15.360 --> 09:20.160
that is competitive with the jobs they could get on the market.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.120
Because another thing that doesn't work is saying, well, you're an open source maintainer,

09:24.120 --> 09:28.840
so you consume, what, three boxes of ramen a day?

09:28.840 --> 09:32.600
I guess you should go to the cinema a couple of times a month.

09:32.600 --> 09:36.440
So you're going to be fine with like 10K a year, right?

09:36.440 --> 09:38.840
15 maybe, and you can keep maintaining this?

09:38.840 --> 09:40.400
Great, yeah, sounds good.

09:40.400 --> 09:44.360
And then something happens in their life, and they go like, well, maybe I would like

09:44.360 --> 09:45.920
to make more money than that.

09:45.920 --> 09:50.080
And let's see how much money they offer me down the street to a person who can manage

09:50.080 --> 09:56.120
a large technical project with a number of stakeholders and who can coordinate contributors

09:56.120 --> 10:00.640
and who then qualifies as a senior software engineer.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.360
The answer is a lot more money.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.720
And so they stop maintaining the open source project.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.280
And so again, we don't have a sustainable model.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.680
So I think it's important to stress that what I'm going for is something that's competitive

10:11.680 --> 10:14.720
with senior software engineer salaries.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.000
And that's a part of that.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.920
Everybody usually would just kick me out of the room when I would get to because they

10:19.920 --> 10:21.760
would say, there's no way to make it a match.

10:21.760 --> 10:24.120
So it turns out, yeah.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.840
Now, lessons learned.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.760
What got me here?

10:30.760 --> 10:33.680
So a lot of it is sales.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.280
This is the bad news part of the talk.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.280
None of us wants to be doing sales.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.200
We want to be doing software maintenance.

10:42.200 --> 10:47.640
But what I usually tell maintainers on this is, so do you know dentists?

10:47.640 --> 10:51.320
Do you have a dentist friend, a dentist relative?

10:51.320 --> 10:57.000
Do you think they ever stopped for a moment and went like, you know, I really like teeth,

10:57.000 --> 11:04.000
but the whole invoicing people running a clinic, hiring somebody, paying taxes, marketing

11:04.000 --> 11:08.680
my services, nah, that's not my core skill.

11:08.680 --> 11:09.680
You know what?

11:09.680 --> 11:13.280
I'll just do it for free.

11:13.280 --> 11:14.280
Know anybody?

11:14.280 --> 11:15.280
Okay.

11:15.280 --> 11:20.440
And anybody who went like, yeah, so you know, really I'm probably not cut for being a dentist.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.800
I guess I'll just change careers.

11:23.800 --> 11:29.840
Probably somebody, but most of the dentists we do go to just do the parts of the job that

11:29.840 --> 11:33.080
are not core skills.

11:33.080 --> 11:40.880
We'll also get to the advantages dentists have over professional maintainers, but we'll

11:40.880 --> 11:41.880
get to that in a second.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.240
But a core point here is that there's a lot of sales.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.440
So it's enterprise sales.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.600
There are books about it.

11:50.600 --> 11:53.720
We usually like learning stuff, right, when it's technical.

11:53.720 --> 11:57.440
First off, this stuff is also extremely learnable.

11:57.440 --> 12:02.680
And what worked for me is funding champions inside companies and going to them and saying,

12:02.680 --> 12:04.520
hey, so this is the thing I'm doing.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.640
And those champions are usually engineering and they'll tell me, oh, that's great.

12:07.640 --> 12:11.360
Like I want that to work partially because I could see myself maybe at some point doing

12:11.360 --> 12:12.360
that.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.560
But to be clear, they don't let me spend money around here.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.880
And then you tell me, yeah, I know, but you know, the people who do and you can introduce

12:18.880 --> 12:19.880
me.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.600
And so if you can do that, I would appreciate it.

12:21.600 --> 12:27.080
And then when those people go to you, you go back to engineering like, hey, how's everything?

12:27.080 --> 12:30.680
And they ask, oh, so how's the conversation with John going?

12:30.680 --> 12:34.280
You know, he seems busy, but if you could just think it in turn, that would be great.

12:34.280 --> 12:37.400
And then you do this over and over and over and over and over again.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.400
And is it great?

12:38.400 --> 12:39.400
No.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.400
Does it work?

12:40.400 --> 12:41.400
Yeah.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.400
Yeah.

12:42.400 --> 12:47.120
Like every startup in the world just goes like this.

12:47.120 --> 12:51.840
The closings, however, the closings that did work did not take forever, did not take

12:51.840 --> 12:52.840
a year.

12:52.840 --> 12:57.920
They either closed in a month or two, or I am still trying to close them.

12:57.920 --> 12:58.920
Right now.

12:58.920 --> 13:04.840
I am thinking about one person in particular who is a friend and who I am still chasing.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.240
He got, anyway.

13:06.240 --> 13:19.320
The point is, the ones where it will happen soon or otherwise.

13:19.320 --> 13:22.560
What I am offering companies has refined a bit.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.200
Most companies want the whole thing.

13:24.200 --> 13:31.640
I started with tiers and you can get the advisory part and joining, I will join your

13:31.640 --> 13:36.360
Slack and nobody bought the lower ones.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.440
Which hey, okay, great, more money.

13:38.440 --> 13:42.000
At the same time, I feel like I am leaving something on the table by not knowing how

13:42.000 --> 13:44.280
to sell the lower tiers, but whatever.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.280
Fine.

13:45.280 --> 13:48.800
Maybe the answer is that the thing that does sell is that advisor part I was telling you

13:48.800 --> 13:50.280
about earlier.

13:50.280 --> 13:55.320
When you compare it to, look, you could hire an engineer and have them become an expert

13:55.320 --> 14:00.280
in this and have them get involved with the project so that you can go and ask them for

14:00.280 --> 14:07.600
support when you need to, or I cost a fraction of that because I have multiple clients.

14:07.600 --> 14:13.680
Also, there is not as much risk that I will just move on, you know, quit and you will

14:13.680 --> 14:15.840
have to retrain from scratch.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.480
I can't pre-train in the box.

14:19.480 --> 14:23.920
So that's the part that really sells.

14:23.920 --> 14:30.280
And finally, the ongoing, I was a little worried that am I over-comitting, I started slow because

14:30.280 --> 14:32.720
I didn't want to sell time I didn't have.

14:32.720 --> 14:36.520
Turns out my main problem is that some clients don't use enough of my time.

14:36.520 --> 14:42.720
So I'm worried that in a year they will be like, what do you do for us again?

14:42.720 --> 14:44.120
Which is not a great conversation to have.

14:44.120 --> 14:48.160
So I try to keep them engaged and remind them that hey, you can ask me questions.

14:48.160 --> 14:52.160
When I remind them, they come back with questions and then I answer them and they are happy

14:52.160 --> 14:56.480
and that's great but sometimes you have to remind them.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.880
On that something useful I do is that every time there is a release I will send a PDF

14:59.880 --> 15:04.040
being like, hey, this release happened, you should probably patch, here is my opinion

15:04.040 --> 15:06.320
on what you should patch.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.920
A lot of this is sending PDFs.

15:08.920 --> 15:13.680
If you are hoping for the new platform where you register and you get microtransactions

15:13.680 --> 15:18.120
directly to your wallet or something, no, I'm here to suggest getting very good at

15:18.120 --> 15:20.960
Microsoft Word.

15:20.960 --> 15:24.240
It doesn't have to be Microsoft Word.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.480
But yeah.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.800
And finally it's a multi-stakeholder job.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.800
What does that mean?

15:30.800 --> 15:34.280
Sometimes your client will be like, oh, it would be very nice if there was support for

15:34.280 --> 15:41.600
Foo and Cooks and Blacks and all of that in the standard library and I'm like, no, absolutely

15:41.600 --> 15:42.600
not.

15:42.600 --> 15:50.760
And that's a little throat because, and for that it's important to spread out enough that

15:50.760 --> 15:56.320
a single client is not so critical that your palms are sweating when you tell them no on

15:56.320 --> 15:57.320
something.

15:57.320 --> 16:01.720
And it's important to communicate with the rest of the team so that they know your concept

16:01.720 --> 16:06.240
of interest and I try to recuse myself from all of the proposals, for example, that I

16:06.240 --> 16:07.680
help the client's brain.

16:07.680 --> 16:12.080
So if a client really wants to propose something, I'll tell them, look, what I can do for you

16:12.080 --> 16:14.960
is help you present it in a way that makes your case.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.320
I'll help you craft the proposal.

16:17.320 --> 16:20.080
I'll tell you what you should fix.

16:20.080 --> 16:25.240
And then I'll just step back and let the proposal committee decide.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.240
That works.

16:27.240 --> 16:35.760
Anyway, a few words on where this is going next because this is what would work so far.

16:35.760 --> 16:40.920
But really I'm not in this to fund myself because if I wanted to do that I could have

16:40.920 --> 16:42.040
stayed at Google.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.960
They have great insurance plans.

16:44.960 --> 16:45.960
It's a job.

16:45.960 --> 16:47.080
It's fine.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.280
I could have stayed.

16:48.280 --> 16:53.960
So I left because I wanted to make this into a model that can be replicated.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.200
So there's two ways really to grow it.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.320
One is vertically.

16:57.320 --> 17:02.960
I can hire more people and then get them funded and that's a few more people that do this.

17:02.960 --> 17:04.640
And that's kind of unsatisfactory.

17:04.640 --> 17:11.280
Unsatisfactory, sure, might make me more money but it can't grow that much as just the Lippos

17:11.280 --> 17:12.280
thing.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.560
Which, by the way, this is happening.

17:13.560 --> 17:19.160
I've hired the maintainer of SFTP Go to maintain XCrypt SSH which didn't have a maintainer

17:19.160 --> 17:20.160
for years.

17:20.160 --> 17:23.800
And that's only possible because clients pay enough and they're interested in the SSH

17:23.800 --> 17:28.680
package and so I can go back to clients and say, hey, look at that package that you had

17:28.680 --> 17:29.680
the fork.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.000
You don't need a fork anymore.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.720
That's because you were paying me money.

17:32.840 --> 17:33.840
All right.

17:33.840 --> 17:37.680
Don't cancel, please.

17:37.680 --> 17:41.720
But the thing I'm really interested in is growing this horizontally.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.760
So getting other people to start it.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.400
And I'm not talking about starting a platform.

17:45.400 --> 17:50.200
No, no, no, I'm talking about getting other people to say, all right, maybe I can do that

17:50.200 --> 17:53.800
and try their own version of that.

17:53.800 --> 18:00.120
And here's where we get to the disclaimer part.

18:00.120 --> 18:03.000
This worked because I have a network.

18:03.000 --> 18:06.280
This worked because I had already a public profile.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.760
I want to fix that slowly and over time.

18:09.760 --> 18:16.200
What I want to do is to speak about this to enough people and to do this with enough companies

18:16.200 --> 18:20.360
that companies get a little more comfortable with it so that the sale is not anymore.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.240
So here's a whole new thing.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.520
Let me convince you it's not silly.

18:24.520 --> 18:27.520
And then let me convince you to pay me for it.

18:27.520 --> 18:31.080
You can skip the first part and get to a company who's like, oh, yeah, right, we do

18:31.080 --> 18:32.440
that with a couple of people.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.920
Maybe, yeah, that your project is also useful.

18:36.920 --> 18:37.920
Another disclaimer.

18:37.920 --> 18:41.200
This is for critical open source projects.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.600
I am targeting a very specific kind of open source project.

18:44.600 --> 18:50.040
So if this sounds like it wouldn't work for your project, there are two options.

18:50.040 --> 18:57.760
It either you might be surprised that it's actually easier than it looks, or you might

18:57.760 --> 19:00.200
be correct because it's not the right shape of project.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.720
The right shape of project is something that's critical to at least a few companies.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.400
And that doesn't mean something gigantic like go.

19:06.400 --> 19:12.280
Critical just means that how I pitch it is how long would it take to replace this if

19:12.280 --> 19:15.200
you had to?

19:15.200 --> 19:19.560
And then you let them think about it for a moment and they will go like, two, three

19:19.560 --> 19:23.400
engineer years and that's a lot of money.

19:23.400 --> 19:27.840
And then you go like, great, so you would like this to stay maintained.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.160
Excellent.

19:29.160 --> 19:34.920
Then that's the kind of project that I think you can pitch this model for.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.720
And so that's the lowering the bar to access.

19:38.720 --> 19:43.800
I like to think that I started because I have more of a public profile and more willingness

19:43.800 --> 19:50.760
to wear a button down shirt and talk fast, which is very useful for sales.

19:50.760 --> 19:55.600
But I would like this to become something that more and more people can do as it expands.

19:55.600 --> 20:00.600
So maybe the next cohort of people who do this already have a bit of network, but will

20:00.600 --> 20:03.800
have something to start from, et cetera, et cetera.

20:03.800 --> 20:10.960
Then I want to build together the tools to make this easier because I am sort of yoloing

20:10.960 --> 20:15.120
stuff like contracts and what works and what doesn't.

20:15.120 --> 20:22.800
I'm hoping to build training and contract closers that are easy to pass to Liga and say, yeah,

20:22.800 --> 20:29.600
so no, you can't put a complete IP assignment close in that contract because I don't work

20:29.600 --> 20:34.960
only for you, so no, I can't give you the rights to everything I write.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.640
We will have to have a conversation about that.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.200
So stuff like that.

20:38.200 --> 20:44.160
And maybe one day making a professional association around it so that we can even tackle things

20:44.160 --> 20:48.880
like how do you get healthcare in the U.S., which some freelancer unions give you access

20:48.880 --> 20:49.880
to.

20:49.880 --> 20:56.720
Anyway, this is how it started, how it's been going for the past year, and where I'm

20:56.720 --> 20:58.600
trying to take it from now.

20:58.600 --> 21:07.040
The goal is to give the option to maintainers to follow it as a profession, just like dentists

21:07.880 --> 21:14.920
starting at junior and ramping their way up using resources for learning and support

21:14.920 --> 21:16.400
from technical tools.

21:16.400 --> 21:21.200
Because that's the main thing that I think makes it easier for dentists to run clinics

21:21.200 --> 21:24.320
than open source maintainers to run businesses.

21:24.320 --> 21:27.640
It's that you can buy so much support as a dentist.

21:27.640 --> 21:33.240
You can buy books and trainings and CRM software and software to run the clinic that prints

21:33.240 --> 21:37.600
the invoice already with the little teeth drawn on them.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.440
And all of that is actually extremely useful.

21:40.440 --> 21:45.800
We are starting from scratch here because for some beautiful reason, which is why we're

21:45.800 --> 21:49.280
all here, really, open source didn't start as a profession.

21:49.280 --> 21:50.280
It started as hacking.

21:50.280 --> 21:53.080
It started as something we wanted to give to the world.

21:53.080 --> 21:57.880
But it's now critical infrastructure and we need some people to make a living and a profession

21:57.880 --> 21:58.880
out of it.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.200
To be clear, this is not the only way to do things.

22:01.200 --> 22:05.520
I'm not here to tell you every single one of you has to get a button down and a 24-hour

22:05.520 --> 22:08.560
briefcase and start going out there and closing some deals.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.560
No.

22:09.560 --> 22:15.240
But I want that to be an option for the projects that need it and for the people that want it.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.240
Questions please.

22:18.240 --> 22:21.240
Thank you.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.440
Hi, Filippo.

22:23.440 --> 22:33.160
I know you've been sharing this path for at least half a year or more.

22:33.160 --> 22:37.120
So how many people have followed your advice?

22:37.120 --> 22:43.440
Do you know about and how many of them you would say succeeded, which share of the followers

22:43.440 --> 22:46.480
have succeeded?

22:46.480 --> 22:52.880
So I've been actually extremely skittish to ask people to start trying this until very

22:52.880 --> 22:58.400
recently, partially because until I knew that it worked for me, I was very uncomfortable

22:58.400 --> 23:02.260
with telling anybody go for it because...

23:02.260 --> 23:10.800
So really, I've started trying to form a community around this in the last two, three months.

23:10.800 --> 23:17.200
And there are maybe half a dozen people who are aiming for this or angling for this.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.440
Some of them already were going for something similar.

23:19.440 --> 23:23.560
I had at least one conversation where I was like, ah, that, yes, ah-ha.

23:23.560 --> 23:28.200
We kept saying things and just matching notes and it was great.

23:28.200 --> 23:31.120
I think it's too soon to say how many of those are successful.

23:31.120 --> 23:36.400
I'm barely comfortable saying that I'm being successful because it's been a year and after

23:36.400 --> 23:39.160
a year, I'm a little more...

23:39.160 --> 23:41.560
People are not canceling after the third year.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.560
Great.

23:42.560 --> 23:45.600
But it's a little too soon to say how many are successful, I think.

23:45.600 --> 23:49.840
If anybody wants to try, now is the time to email me because I want to set up a bit of

23:49.840 --> 23:50.840
community.

23:50.840 --> 23:55.560
I don't know if it's going to be, I don't know, matrix rooms, a Slack, mailing with

23:55.560 --> 23:58.040
something to compare notes, share tools.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.040
So now's the time.

24:00.040 --> 24:03.400
Hi, thanks for the talk.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.960
How do you see this interaction?

24:04.960 --> 24:09.960
I imagine it being a little bit of a potential problem with open source projects that are

24:09.960 --> 24:14.760
grown from or that already have companies crystallized around them.

24:14.760 --> 24:20.200
So there's a bit of a tension there with this kind of freelance model that you're pitching.

24:20.200 --> 24:28.280
So governance in open source is complicated and it's a people's job and I think every

24:28.280 --> 24:36.160
maintainer is actually very expert in negotiation already because some of it is figuring out

24:36.160 --> 24:38.280
diverging incentives.

24:38.280 --> 24:44.520
I think this would probably be in contrast with open source projects that have a company

24:44.520 --> 24:47.200
built around offering support contracts.

24:47.200 --> 24:51.680
But that company probably already scales with the success of the project so it's not probably

24:51.680 --> 24:54.200
suffering the same way I was describing.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.760
If the users double, the potential support contracts double.

24:57.760 --> 25:02.280
Support contracts have their own problems which is why I'm not going for that but maybe

25:02.280 --> 25:11.320
I can start by cannibalizing a project that has already a scalable funding model.

25:12.280 --> 25:17.480
Projects that instead have mostly companies that are footing the bill but are not reselling

25:17.480 --> 25:21.800
support hours, they're not built around, we are the open source project X and you can

25:21.800 --> 25:25.040
pay us for the open source project X.

25:25.040 --> 25:27.320
I don't think this is actually in contrast.

25:27.320 --> 25:32.480
Case in point, I don't think anybody at Google resents me for doing this.

25:32.480 --> 25:37.440
Actually they are happy that now there's two maintainers on top of the headcount they

25:37.440 --> 25:43.120
have maintaining go.

25:43.120 --> 25:50.120
So far there's been no issue with that kind of company involvement.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.960
Thank you for your inspiring talk.

25:56.960 --> 26:01.400
Do you have any suggestions or advice for people who already went to the dark side and

26:01.400 --> 26:08.800
actually don't have means to get back to the Raman level of money for a couple of years

26:08.800 --> 26:14.760
to just get back to being a critical maintainer to start pitching projects?

26:14.760 --> 26:18.280
I am sorry I did not catch that part, there was some noise.

26:18.280 --> 26:24.680
Yeah, so if you are already at the dark side and you already cannot get back to the open

26:24.680 --> 26:31.200
source Raman level of income to get back into the critical maintainer path because you

26:31.880 --> 26:38.880
are not going to like it, your bank is your house and you are not going to like it.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.280
So what do we do now?

26:43.280 --> 26:47.560
We are already in a company somewhere, we are not doing the maintenance because we had

26:47.560 --> 26:53.560
to get out of this pass a long time ago and we would like to get it back now.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.360
Do we have any way to pitch it really?

26:56.360 --> 27:01.160
I was saying that okay you know what, ten years ago I was maintaining this thing and

27:01.160 --> 27:06.960
maybe you could hire me again though ten years I was not doing anything, it doesn't sound

27:06.960 --> 27:09.680
like something convincing.

27:09.680 --> 27:18.200
Okay so the question was if I understand it correctly how do you get back into the maintenance

27:18.200 --> 27:24.200
track if you are doing other ways of doing software development as a professional?

27:24.200 --> 27:25.200
Yes?

27:25.200 --> 27:35.000
Okay, so I think that gets to the general question of what is the ramp up to what I am describing

27:35.000 --> 27:36.280
because I just skipped, right?

27:36.280 --> 27:42.560
I went like well great, five thousand people of my newsletter, here is a new thing and

27:42.560 --> 27:46.480
great, that's not an on-ramp.

27:46.480 --> 27:52.400
So the on-ramps will be part of what we need to figure out as this matures because I think

27:52.760 --> 27:58.760
they can look like getting involved with a maintainer who is already doing this.

27:58.760 --> 28:05.080
For example if I am already doing this with Go and somebody is skilling Go and something

28:05.080 --> 28:11.080
that my clients specifically need I can hire them, they can start doing that through my

28:11.080 --> 28:18.000
contracts so they don't need their own cash and then they can use that to maybe spin off

28:18.040 --> 28:25.360
into their own thing which is really how firms work, how lawyers get started, how security

28:25.360 --> 28:29.680
consultancies got started in the 90s and early olds.

28:29.680 --> 28:35.600
If you look at that history you will see that they started as individual realities pretty

28:35.600 --> 28:41.480
much like mine based on the popularity of the individual then they grew and then they

28:41.480 --> 28:46.280
spun off pieces and then it became an industry and now you can just be a junior security

28:46.280 --> 28:47.280
analyst, right?

28:47.560 --> 28:54.560
I am hoping one on-ramp will be just starting as a junior maintainer on a team and then

28:55.560 --> 29:01.200
spinning off and that I think is one on-ramp we should definitely figure out different

29:01.200 --> 29:07.800
ones and ways to pre-invest so that you don't have to jump and say I will not make no money

29:07.800 --> 29:13.840
for six months and then hopefully I will start making a little money.

29:13.880 --> 29:20.040
We need to figure out ways to get investment up front for some projects and I think the

29:20.040 --> 29:23.960
more companies get comfortable with this and with the fact that they want this because

29:23.960 --> 29:24.960
they do.

29:24.960 --> 29:30.880
The real thing that surprised me is that companies are often like yeah, yeah, okay, yeah, great.

29:30.880 --> 29:36.840
We are uncomfortable about our open source supply chain so as companies get there hopefully

29:36.840 --> 29:42.240
we will get to a place where you can get a pre-commitment letter which is often how

29:42.280 --> 29:47.200
products on-ramp and then once you have three letters you go like okay I am ready to make

29:47.200 --> 29:48.200
the jump.

29:48.200 --> 29:55.200
If anyone needs a freelancer go maintainer for the deaf rooms I am available call me.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.720
Thank you, Roy Lebrouz.
