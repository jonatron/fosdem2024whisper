00:00.000 --> 00:14.400
Hello, everyone.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.520
And welcome.

00:16.520 --> 00:21.040
I want to start by expressing how amazing it feels to have the opportunity to moderate

00:21.040 --> 00:25.280
the last panel at the main stage at FOSDEM.

00:25.280 --> 00:30.320
Thank you so much to all of the volunteers and the organizers who have made this incredible

00:30.320 --> 00:32.440
weekend happen.

00:32.440 --> 00:37.200
I just want to express that I have seen so much passion, innovativeness, and creativity

00:37.200 --> 00:43.440
from the open source community that we are all a part of and really appreciate it.

00:43.440 --> 00:47.600
For those who don't know me, I'm Dan Brown from Linux Foundation Energy.

00:47.600 --> 00:51.360
I've spent the last 10 years supporting open source communities.

00:51.360 --> 00:57.800
And what keeps me going is the knowledge that open source is not just a software methodology.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.880
It's not just a community, even.

00:59.880 --> 01:05.120
It's a philosophy and one that is having a massive impact on the world for good.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.240
And that's what we're here to talk about today.

01:08.240 --> 01:14.320
I'm privileged to be on stage with some truly intelligent, passionate, generous, hardworking,

01:14.320 --> 01:15.840
creative people.

01:15.840 --> 01:21.960
And I hope that we inspire you to join us in a new initiative that we believe will help

01:21.960 --> 01:26.480
improve the lives of people all around the world.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.120
So to give a little bit of background, it might seem obvious, but without energy and

01:31.120 --> 01:34.720
electricity there wouldn't actually be any technology.

01:34.720 --> 01:41.040
So none of us would have jobs in tech and open source wouldn't exist without stable,

01:41.040 --> 01:45.320
accessible energy systems.

01:45.320 --> 01:51.040
But as much as energy has benefited the world, it's also had unintended consequences.

01:51.040 --> 01:56.600
We're all aware of the challenges and dangers posed by climate change.

01:56.600 --> 02:03.320
And if we do not change the way that we produce and use energy, then the future is bleak.

02:03.320 --> 02:09.480
So we've come here to ask you to help us prevent that worst case outcome.

02:09.480 --> 02:14.880
The panel is going to give you an overview of some of the challenges that we've identified,

02:14.880 --> 02:19.840
that we feel the open source community can help address for the benefit of people all

02:19.840 --> 02:21.800
over the world.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.520
To set the stage, the current state of power systems is not very different than it was

02:25.520 --> 02:28.040
a hundred years ago.

02:28.040 --> 02:29.040
And that's a problem.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.040
It's inefficient.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.040
It's centralized.

02:31.040 --> 02:34.540
It's top down, proprietary for the most part.

02:34.540 --> 02:40.920
These are all things that the open source community can recognize as far from ideal.

02:40.920 --> 02:47.280
So we're going to present a proposal to you that can help us change that not only for

02:47.280 --> 02:54.520
those of us in the developed world, but for individuals, millions of whom, even in 2004,

02:54.520 --> 02:57.960
don't even have access to electricity.

02:57.960 --> 03:02.360
So with that, I'm going to introduce our esteemed panel, who are going to tell you more about

03:02.360 --> 03:07.720
our idea and our proposal to expand on the work that is already being done at Linux Foundation

03:07.720 --> 03:12.920
Energy and other open source initiatives to decarbonize electric systems.

03:12.920 --> 03:16.080
We want this to be interactive, so I'm only going to ask one or two questions to each

03:16.080 --> 03:23.160
panelist and then encourage you all to jump in and ask us questions and also give us your

03:23.160 --> 03:26.960
suggestions on how we can build on this proposal.

03:26.960 --> 03:34.040
So I will start by introducing from nearest to me to furthest Chris Shee, who is head

03:34.040 --> 03:37.000
of open source strategy at FutureWay.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.600
Chris really is kind of the godfather of this initiative.

03:40.600 --> 03:46.960
It's his brainchild, and so we are very thankful to him for bringing this group together.

03:46.960 --> 03:52.560
Next is Hillary Carter, senior VP of research at the Linux Foundation, who actually did

03:52.560 --> 03:57.600
some research reports that she's going to speak about during the panel that really inspired

03:57.600 --> 04:00.600
this initiative.

04:00.600 --> 04:06.840
Next to Hillary is Vivienne Barnier, CEO of the Inaccess Foundation, which is a nonprofit

04:06.840 --> 04:12.640
dedicated to bringing electricity to parts of the world that do not currently have it.

04:12.640 --> 04:16.880
Next is Carl Yang, CEO of Degscent Energy Technology.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.520
Carl has gotten involved to bring us an open hardware perspective because a lot of our

04:21.520 --> 04:26.320
initial discussions were so software focused and we realized that there needs to be a hardware

04:26.320 --> 04:29.800
component in order to make this successful.

04:29.800 --> 04:35.080
And finally, last but not least, is Tony Shannon, the head of digital services at the office

04:35.080 --> 04:38.480
of the CIO of the government of Ireland.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.560
Tony has been instrumental in advising us on how we can better engage with the public

04:42.560 --> 04:49.600
sector and how policy can help influence these topics going forward.

04:49.600 --> 04:54.480
So with that, I'm going to turn to the panel, and we're going to start with Chris.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.320
Chris, you're the one who came up with this idea.

04:57.320 --> 05:03.760
That I just mentioned for an initiative around open renewable energy systems, or OREZ, as

05:03.760 --> 05:05.800
we're calling it for short.

05:05.800 --> 05:11.880
Can you just give us some idea of what OREZ is and how it came about?

05:11.880 --> 05:13.880
Sure.

05:13.880 --> 05:24.160
I just shared earlier today about the history and the motivation of OREZ.

05:24.160 --> 05:33.520
One year ago, exactly this month, I live in San Francisco Bay Area, California.

05:33.520 --> 05:40.200
One year ago, at this time, we had atmospheric river events.

05:40.200 --> 05:45.600
And that flooded the streets and also the cyclones.

05:45.600 --> 05:50.440
My house, the roof was reploped by the cyclones.

05:50.440 --> 05:54.960
And I was lucky enough, I only spent $1,000 to fix it.

05:54.960 --> 06:02.400
My co-worker, probably spent about $200,000 because they live in a hilly area, and they

06:02.400 --> 06:11.720
have maybe 30-meter tall trees that fall down and crush the wall of the house.

06:11.720 --> 06:19.480
And today, as we speak right now in California, there are also strong atmospheric river events

06:19.520 --> 06:21.520
right now.

06:21.520 --> 06:29.080
So at the time, I was thinking, gee, this thing is happening, and what we can do individually

06:29.080 --> 06:31.600
myself, ourselves.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.360
So I'm coming from an ICT background.

06:35.360 --> 06:40.960
So I was thinking what we can do from take the expertise and methodology and thought

06:40.960 --> 06:44.480
process from ICT perspective.

06:44.480 --> 06:49.640
And I think there is a lot of scenery in the energy sector.

06:49.640 --> 06:54.480
So take that over to energy, and I see a lot of opportunities there.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.960
There's a huge gap in terms of open source and energy.

06:57.960 --> 07:03.080
So that's why I was very excited that we joined Lennis Foundation Energy, the open source

07:03.080 --> 07:04.640
energy.

07:04.640 --> 07:11.240
And one of the things what we were thinking about was that we had to really think kind

07:11.240 --> 07:13.640
of somewhat backward.

07:13.640 --> 07:20.040
As I mentioned, right now we have a centralized electrical system, and everybody is so, is

07:20.040 --> 07:25.680
benefiting from that, which is you just plug it in to receive energy, receive electricity,

07:25.680 --> 07:29.280
and you can plug in many different kind of devices.

07:29.280 --> 07:36.600
Now we come to a time we need to rethink how we consume and how we produce electricity

07:36.600 --> 07:37.600
energy.

07:38.600 --> 07:47.200
The idea we had in mind was that why cannot we make it easier to produce energy and to

07:47.200 --> 07:52.200
become energy independence?

07:52.200 --> 08:02.880
And that's the foundation, foundational motivation of our open renewable energy system.

08:02.880 --> 08:08.880
What we're looking to do, I want to say the result, what we envision in the future will

08:08.880 --> 08:17.280
be that everyone will have the opportunity to go to Costco to buy an already compliance

08:17.280 --> 08:19.280
device.

08:19.280 --> 08:24.360
Right now you go to Costco, Walmart, you can buy a device so easy, right?

08:24.360 --> 08:29.800
You buy a laptop, you buy a microwave, you just use it.

08:29.800 --> 08:33.880
Why not the same thing for production of energy?

08:33.880 --> 08:37.880
So that is the foundation of this always project.

08:37.880 --> 08:38.880
That's the motivation.

08:38.880 --> 08:43.040
Eventually we're thinking to have that device always compliant, but you can buy easily and

08:43.040 --> 08:47.080
plug it in at your house.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.320
Then you can create your own energy.

08:49.320 --> 08:56.840
Eventually the goal is to have individual energy independence.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.840
And that's what we're doing.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.480
The way we want to do it is through open source.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.360
And we have done this thing in telecommunication space.

09:04.360 --> 09:11.240
And we will move that kind of thought process and the methodology over to the energy space.

09:11.240 --> 09:18.920
Through building an open source API and a standard that allows manufacturers to freely

09:18.920 --> 09:25.880
adopt those standards and build an equal system of manufacturers, vendors, of those always

09:25.920 --> 09:31.000
compliance devices, and to reach to the masses.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.280
So this is a grassroots effort.

09:35.280 --> 09:44.080
And we are today we're here fortunate to be here to invite everyone to join us in this

09:44.080 --> 09:47.720
new energy independence movement.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.720
Thank you.

09:48.720 --> 09:49.720
Thank you, Chris.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.240
So I'm going to turn to Hillary next.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.760
Hillary, I want you to talk a little bit about the part that research played in the development

09:56.760 --> 09:57.760
of this initiative.

09:57.760 --> 10:01.440
And I know there are two specific reports that you want to touch on.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.560
And just so you know behind you, we've got the microgrids report up.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.560
Thank you so much, Dan.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.560
Hi, everybody.

10:06.560 --> 10:14.600
It's a pleasure to be back at FOSDEN to highlight the role that research has played in the establishment

10:14.600 --> 10:20.600
of open renewable energy systems community building.

10:20.600 --> 10:25.040
It was more than a year ago, about a year and a half ago, that Chris approached Linux

10:25.040 --> 10:31.240
Foundation Research, which is one of the departments that I lead, to test the hypothesis that there

10:31.240 --> 10:39.560
was indeed a viable, valid role for open source to create better, cheaper, faster solutions

10:39.560 --> 10:48.480
in the microgrid space, a nascent space, so that we could have widespread solutions that

10:48.480 --> 10:57.240
enable both clean energy generation and increase access to energy solutions in remote areas

10:57.240 --> 11:01.640
and areas that have been impacted by natural disaster.

11:01.640 --> 11:11.440
And so what we did was create a qualitative study and interviewed 17 subject matter experts

11:11.440 --> 11:19.600
across the energy ecosystem, including people from academia and industry, to pressure test

11:19.600 --> 11:20.600
this idea.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.880
Was this a good idea?

11:21.880 --> 11:28.440
What were the opportunities for the microgrid space leveraging open source?

11:28.440 --> 11:36.440
How could we take a nascent space and make it mainstream so that energy access is truly

11:36.440 --> 11:43.560
democratized and that energy supply is readily available?

11:43.560 --> 11:50.440
And what's incredibly rewarding is that research has served to plant some of the seeds for this

11:50.440 --> 11:58.200
idea and begin to have conversations with stakeholders who then a year and a half later, at the formation

11:58.200 --> 12:03.280
of such a working group today, can become participants.

12:03.280 --> 12:11.840
As well, now that we have a deliverable that comprises the insights from these experts,

12:11.840 --> 12:17.400
we have a document that we can share to say this is the why, this is the how, and here's

12:17.400 --> 12:19.720
how you can get involved.

12:19.720 --> 12:23.160
So I encourage you all to read this report.

12:23.160 --> 12:30.080
You can visit LF Energy or Linux Foundation Research or scan the QR code, but read it,

12:30.080 --> 12:34.640
share it, and get involved.

12:34.640 --> 12:40.880
Because through greater participation and more contributions from developers, we can

12:40.880 --> 12:48.400
indeed create a necessary future to democratizing energy, clean energy generation, as well as

12:48.400 --> 12:52.000
distribution to those who need it most.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.080
Next slide, please, Stan.

12:55.080 --> 13:00.560
Another report that I'm incredibly passionate about, fairly recent, and I think you might

13:00.560 --> 13:05.760
be of interest to all of you because you've come to a discussion about the relationship

13:05.760 --> 13:13.160
between open source and microgrids and clean energy is our sustainability report.

13:13.160 --> 13:20.640
And this piece of work discusses not just open source opportunities within the energy

13:20.640 --> 13:25.120
sector, but across all open source project communities.

13:25.120 --> 13:32.560
And our ability to make the link between open source technical projects and the United Nations

13:32.560 --> 13:39.120
sustainable development goals is a game changer because it is a door opener.

13:39.120 --> 13:45.600
It is a door opener to potential collaborators who have a mandate to achieve economic growth

13:45.600 --> 13:52.480
by sustainable beings, to governments, to regulators, to enterprises, to other partners,

13:52.480 --> 13:59.920
and can inspire new contributors to open source projects that are either intentionally or

13:59.920 --> 14:10.320
through applications and use cases, doing incredible things to advance sustainable development.

14:10.320 --> 14:17.800
And these reports build bridges and they generate conversations and they are a resource for

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
the whole community.

14:18.800 --> 14:24.800
So I encourage you to explore the energy reports that we have, our sustainability report, microgrids

14:24.800 --> 14:31.160
report, and beyond, and use them to your own interests and advantage.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.400
So with that, Dan, we'll pass it back to you.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.400
Thank you.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.800
And I'm going to move over to Vivian.

14:36.800 --> 14:40.320
Can you tell us a little bit about the challenges of energy access?

14:40.320 --> 14:46.080
I have a feeling that a lot of folks don't realize what a problem it is and exactly how

14:46.080 --> 14:50.320
you envision OREDS helping address them.

14:50.320 --> 14:54.720
Thank you, Dan, and thank you, Chris and Hilary.

14:54.720 --> 15:01.480
You see behind me a picture of strictly, it's like several pictures matched together because

15:01.480 --> 15:07.960
luckily we never have this situation on earth so that everything is in the night.

15:07.960 --> 15:13.480
But it pictures pretty well the situation that without showing you, I think you see

15:13.480 --> 15:17.560
that there are areas where you possibly know there are a lot of people living but you almost

15:17.560 --> 15:20.600
see no light.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.120
This is because there is no electricity.

15:24.120 --> 15:27.520
And that's actually bringing electricity to these areas.

15:27.600 --> 15:32.520
This is like Sustainment Development Goal number seven, which was just mentioned.

15:32.520 --> 15:37.440
And that's where we and access focus on and sorry I have to correct you, Dan.

15:37.440 --> 15:43.600
As an access don't bring directly energy to people, but we want to facilitate the access

15:43.600 --> 15:46.720
to energy through leveraging open source.

15:46.720 --> 15:52.520
And thank you, Hilary, actually, to highlight and for this report because the idea of an

15:52.520 --> 16:00.520
access doing this work is like based on the individual feeling of a few practitioners

16:00.520 --> 16:03.920
of the energy access sector that open source is underexploited there.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.400
And that's where an access was founded.

16:05.400 --> 16:10.520
But we never had a proper research paper or something that supported our vision and mission

16:10.520 --> 16:13.120
and our beliefs and now we have.

16:13.120 --> 16:18.440
So that's great to see this confirmation that we are doing the right thing in the right

16:18.440 --> 16:21.760
direction.

16:21.760 --> 16:32.040
And now I would like to show on the next slide a bit what, oh, that's not the one I was expecting,

16:32.040 --> 16:35.360
but it's all good.

16:35.360 --> 16:44.360
That underlines the need for open source because you can see that there's a lot of electricity,

16:44.360 --> 16:47.680
electrification that has been ongoing about the last decade.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.440
However, now we have a reverse trend.

16:50.440 --> 16:56.800
So we have more people being unelectrified every year instead of less.

16:56.800 --> 17:02.120
And one, surely not the only one, but one of the main reasons is also there is interoperability

17:02.120 --> 17:03.120
missing.

17:03.120 --> 17:07.320
There are too much, there's a lot of stakeholders which is great and there are more stakeholders

17:07.320 --> 17:08.320
emerging.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.440
It's an eastern sector, as you said.

17:10.440 --> 17:16.360
But do stakeholders often develop their own things by their own in parallel, often with

17:16.360 --> 17:21.240
donor money from the same donor developing the same solution or pretty similar solution

17:21.240 --> 17:25.760
to then provide electricity to people instead of having a baseline infrastructure with the

17:25.760 --> 17:32.680
shared which has a common standard and common API, just as Chris said, where then the companies

17:32.680 --> 17:37.360
can build on and build their ecosystem and their business model around by doing little

17:37.360 --> 17:40.080
tweaks here and there where it's necessary.

17:40.080 --> 17:45.640
But I've seen like small utility companies, like many good companies developing smart meters,

17:45.640 --> 17:46.640
like 10 of them.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.080
You don't need to develop a smart meter.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.800
You need to sell electricity and you need somebody to provide you a smart meter.

17:52.800 --> 17:57.000
And maybe your business case is a bit different for each of you, but don't lose your time

17:57.000 --> 18:00.160
developing like another smart meter yet.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.240
So that's just one example.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.240
And this happens all the time.

18:04.240 --> 18:09.440
And that's where we believe the power of open source really needs to be leveraged more in

18:09.440 --> 18:10.680
the energy sector.

18:10.680 --> 18:17.080
And that's where we believe to bring this perspective into the always initiative.

18:17.080 --> 18:20.560
And yeah, I'm happy to pass over to Mike.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.760
All right.

18:22.760 --> 18:23.760
Thank you.

18:23.760 --> 18:24.760
An apology is about the slide.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.760
I thought we got that updated.

18:26.760 --> 18:32.760
Well, next we'll move to Carl, who as I mentioned before is bringing a bit of a hardware perspective

18:32.760 --> 18:33.760
for us.

18:33.760 --> 18:40.520
Carl, can you talk about the state of the overall residential equipment market?

18:41.040 --> 18:48.600
For energy and how you see OREZ playing a part in that?

18:48.600 --> 18:53.920
So this is our POC.

18:53.920 --> 19:02.960
This is our POC for the hardware to integrate with the architecture.

19:02.960 --> 19:15.120
For the device, we have micro-involver, BMI and also we call it AC battery and also the

19:15.120 --> 19:18.320
DC-DC converter.

19:18.320 --> 19:26.280
The goal for the POC is together with the community, with the DINIX Foundation energy

19:26.280 --> 19:28.280
projects.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.440
We provide low voltage.

19:31.440 --> 19:32.440
It's safe.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.440
Higher quality and low price.

19:36.440 --> 19:42.800
So our customer can do it yourself.

19:42.800 --> 19:59.280
For this part, mostly along with the power, energy, specification and regulation.

19:59.280 --> 20:10.000
For this part, we propose a strategy for the implementation for the POC.

20:10.000 --> 20:17.400
The most important thing for current phase is the communication.

20:17.400 --> 20:26.480
Also with the software management integration part, we focus on the energy flexibility based

20:26.480 --> 20:34.400
on the S2 standard integrated with EMS implementation.

20:34.400 --> 20:45.280
Later, we may focus on the open solution with the operation and the bigger data.

20:45.280 --> 20:55.240
Basically, the goal is we try to provide together with the open source community for the hardware

20:56.000 --> 21:08.240
to integrate with the OIS architecture design protocol and API.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.240
Thank you.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.240
Thank you, Carl.

21:12.240 --> 21:16.240
Now to Tony to give us the public sector perspective.

21:16.240 --> 21:22.240
Can you talk about why this initiative is needed from your perspective and what part

21:22.240 --> 21:25.240
of the policy play in advancing it?

21:25.240 --> 21:27.240
Sure.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.240
Thanks, Dan.

21:29.240 --> 21:34.240
I don't need to convince anybody here that whatever level you're looking at, the challenges

21:34.240 --> 21:40.240
that we face as a people, be it a community level or government level, this is decades

21:40.240 --> 21:42.240
in time that really matters.

21:42.240 --> 21:47.240
When I speak, I talk about a moment that really matters.

21:47.240 --> 21:52.240
We're all aware of the challenges that are faced around the world in terms of improving

21:52.240 --> 21:57.240
the lives of people and looking after the planet that we live on.

21:57.240 --> 22:01.240
We all have a challenge ahead of us in terms of people and planet.

22:01.240 --> 22:07.240
This decade towards 2030 is a pivotal moment in time in that sense.

22:07.240 --> 22:12.240
We know the policy frameworks out there talk about the need for digital transition and

22:12.240 --> 22:15.240
a green transition.

22:15.240 --> 22:20.240
That's again widely understood, but there's always an often a challenge in terms of a

22:20.240 --> 22:27.240
gap between a nice and an aspirational policy and its implementation.

22:27.240 --> 22:34.240
And how do you get to solve the problems of people and planet using digital and green

22:34.240 --> 22:36.240
in a scalable and sustainable way?

22:36.240 --> 22:39.240
Those are key questions.

22:39.240 --> 22:44.240
We know that for instance if you look at the energy sector, it is at least in part

22:44.240 --> 22:49.240
way down by the proprietary nature of the systems that are at play.

22:49.240 --> 22:54.240
And Dan already mentioned the top down nature of the way energy is delivered.

22:54.240 --> 23:02.240
So that doesn't really point to how to tackle the problem.

23:02.240 --> 23:09.240
What we know is, and obviously FOSDEM is a living example of that, if you want to tackle

23:09.240 --> 23:14.240
some of the most complex problems in the world, you start from the bottom up.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.240
You innovate from the bottom up.

23:16.240 --> 23:21.240
You have small working groups like you're all made up of that come up with ideas as to how to fix problems

23:21.240 --> 23:25.240
and you scale them and sustain them from the bottom up.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.240
And Dan if you could move to the next slide perhaps.

23:28.240 --> 23:31.240
I might talk to a related pattern.

23:31.240 --> 23:36.240
I talk a lot about the complexity of the challenge ahead of us, but if you're looking at complex

23:36.240 --> 23:40.240
challenges, you need to simply talk about patterns.

23:40.240 --> 23:48.240
And I think we know in the public service that actually the challenges that are required fall down

23:48.240 --> 23:52.240
in terms of patterns around people and process and technology.

23:52.240 --> 23:59.240
And there's a really interesting initiative out there called GovStack, which some of you may or may not be aware of.

23:59.240 --> 24:04.240
But it's about what are the building blocks required to deliver 21st public services

24:05.240 --> 24:10.240
and there are only about 20 that are, if you boil them all down.

24:10.240 --> 24:17.240
And if you can focus on those core building blocks, you can transform the lives of people

24:17.240 --> 24:25.240
using open source and reusable building blocks to change the way the world operates.

24:25.240 --> 24:33.240
I'm pretty sure that the same principle holds true for the power, the energy transition we need to face.

24:33.240 --> 24:38.240
The question, and I think the challenge that Ores is trying to tackle is,

24:38.240 --> 24:46.240
what are the building blocks that are required to accommodate and move on the energy transition from the bottom up?

24:46.240 --> 24:54.240
And that's why this work on micro grids and the Ores project really offered the potential

24:54.240 --> 24:59.240
for a bottom up revolution and innovation in the way energy is delivered

24:59.240 --> 25:06.240
that can be empowered really by people like yourselves to get involved in that effort.

25:06.240 --> 25:10.240
Because all we need to do is solve this at the bottom and take it up from there

25:10.240 --> 25:14.240
and that will transform the way the world operates.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.240
And I'll pause there.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.240
I think that was very well said, so thank you Tony.

25:19.240 --> 25:24.240
So I do have more questions that I can ask the panelists,

25:24.240 --> 25:28.240
but I kind of want to open it and see if there are any thoughts from the audience.

25:28.240 --> 25:34.240
I'm first going to go ahead and put this up in case anyone is interested and wants to learn more.

25:34.240 --> 25:37.240
The QR code on your left is to join our mailing list.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.240
The one on the right is a wiki.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.240
If you go to the wiki, there's not much there.

25:41.240 --> 25:46.240
So this working group is still in the formation stage.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.240
We are not even an official LF energy working group yet,

25:49.240 --> 25:54.240
but we did not want to miss the opportunity to present this idea to a FOSDEM audience

25:54.240 --> 25:57.240
because we really do think that there are a lot of folks here

25:57.240 --> 26:02.240
who would be interested and can help us progress this forward.

26:02.240 --> 26:08.240
It actually speaks to the power of FOSDEM that just since yesterday's energy dev room,

26:08.240 --> 26:13.240
the size of our potential working group has pretty much doubled already

26:13.240 --> 26:16.240
because we met so many great folks here.

26:16.240 --> 26:20.240
I see Luis coming right up here actually and he's one of them

26:20.240 --> 26:23.240
who are interested in getting involved.

26:24.240 --> 26:31.240
For the couple hours before this panel, we actually all got together in the little bar cafe area

26:31.240 --> 26:35.240
and started debating what this is going to look like.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.240
And I'll say it's a debate.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.240
We don't even agree on what this should look like.

26:39.240 --> 26:41.240
We don't agree on how the standards should be structured.

26:41.240 --> 26:44.240
We don't agree what kind of specs there should be.

26:44.240 --> 26:49.240
We don't agree on what the hardware and software components should be,

26:49.240 --> 26:51.240
but that's what working groups are for.

26:51.240 --> 26:56.240
And that's what is great about open source is it provides us the opportunity

26:56.240 --> 26:59.240
to build a community that can debate these issues.

26:59.240 --> 27:05.240
So I'm happy to open it to questions and see if there are comments

27:05.240 --> 27:08.240
and see if the audience has any thoughts.

27:08.240 --> 27:12.240
If you have ideas, if you have suggestions,

27:12.240 --> 27:17.240
or if you have questions for anyone on the panel, please feel free to come forward.

27:17.240 --> 27:20.240
And if not, I do have questions I can ask,

27:20.240 --> 27:24.240
but I want to really give you all the opportunity first.

27:32.240 --> 27:39.240
Which countries in the world do you think are the most fertile ground for these kind of changes?

27:39.240 --> 27:42.240
Or which are the worst?

27:42.240 --> 27:44.240
Which would resist the hardest?

27:48.240 --> 27:50.240
I'll take a stab at that.

27:50.240 --> 27:56.240
And my answer is rooted in one of the contributors to the research report.

27:56.240 --> 28:03.240
Some of the most advanced work in microgrids has come out of the University of Alaska in the United States.

28:03.240 --> 28:07.240
And I can bet everyone here appreciates why that is.

28:07.240 --> 28:12.240
It's a remote state, isolated from the rest of the United States geographically.

28:12.240 --> 28:21.240
And shipping power to remote parts of the world is expensive, it's wasteful, and so on and so forth.

28:21.240 --> 28:25.240
So I'm very encouraged by some of the academic research coming out of the United States

28:25.240 --> 28:27.240
to help proliferate at least the ideas.

28:27.240 --> 28:32.240
There is a lot of motivation from people in remote communities all over the world.

28:32.240 --> 28:38.240
So I think maybe it's not so much the country, but some of the attributes of the leading stakeholders

28:38.240 --> 28:42.240
are you in a remote area of the developed world.

28:42.240 --> 28:47.240
And of course some of the underdeveloped countries just have this deep need for access to power

28:47.240 --> 28:51.240
so that they can plug in and participate in online communities.

28:53.240 --> 28:56.240
And I wonder if Vivian has any thoughts there as well.

28:56.240 --> 28:59.240
I know you're coming from an energy access perspective.

28:59.240 --> 29:02.240
I'm not 100% sure if I got the question.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.240
I got the question about a country, what exactly was the question?

29:06.240 --> 29:09.240
Which country is the most...

29:09.240 --> 29:11.240
It's a fertile ground.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.240
A fertile ground, okay.

29:13.240 --> 29:19.240
Yeah, I mean as Hilary said, surely in the industrialized world, region like Alaska,

29:19.240 --> 29:21.240
or state like Alaska for sure,

29:21.240 --> 29:28.240
me looking into like an industrialized or under-industrialized regions.

29:29.240 --> 29:37.240
For example, you can look at Nigeria, which is a country which actually has a power grid or several power grids,

29:37.240 --> 29:44.240
but they are extremely unstable and there's a very huge community of companies and individuals

29:44.240 --> 29:50.240
working throughout solving it by isolated or interconnected mini grids or micro grids.

29:50.240 --> 29:55.240
So that's definitely a geography and a general setting.

29:55.240 --> 30:03.240
And also Nigeria is relatively good, let's say, excessively to tech.

30:03.240 --> 30:07.240
And so yeah, that's definitely one of the regions in the country,

30:07.240 --> 30:12.240
but I mean there are plenty other regions to just to name one.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.240
Thank you. And it looks like we have another question.

30:17.240 --> 30:19.240
Yes.

30:19.240 --> 30:24.240
Have you thought about looking into the home automation community?

30:24.240 --> 30:30.240
Because I think OpenHAB has a booth over here,

30:30.240 --> 30:36.240
and there are other home automation, open source home automation systems,

30:36.240 --> 30:44.240
which I think already have energy management on their agenda,

30:44.240 --> 30:46.240
or have some partial solutions.

30:46.240 --> 31:03.240
Yes, yeah, okay. So the question looks like there are some organizations, similar organizations,

31:03.240 --> 31:06.240
like the energy organization.

31:06.240 --> 31:15.240
And what I was thinking is that we don't segregate between organizations.

31:15.240 --> 31:19.240
Whoever who are interested, okay, who are interested in this area,

31:19.240 --> 31:25.240
please just scan the QR code, draw on the mailing list, and have that conversation.

31:25.240 --> 31:36.240
And be part of this movement to become a sustainable energy part of the future.

31:36.240 --> 31:41.240
In terms of technical details on is this an energy management system?

31:41.240 --> 31:49.240
Definitely. There are all these EMS, BMS, virtual power plant, macro grid,

31:49.240 --> 31:54.240
all of these terminology will be involved in this project.

31:54.240 --> 31:58.240
So yeah, so that's what I'm thinking.

31:58.240 --> 32:04.240
Just to add quickly on that one, and it actually came up as Dan said,

32:04.240 --> 32:07.240
our working group has like doubled since yesterday,

32:07.240 --> 32:14.240
and one of the inputs from the new members were exactly to looking into this existing home automation,

32:14.240 --> 32:19.240
open source organizations, companies that are already around.

32:19.240 --> 32:25.240
They are not yet part of it, but more than welcome to pull them in in the best way we can,

32:25.240 --> 32:31.240
and makes total sense. That's right.

32:31.240 --> 32:37.240
I see the microphone's up there, so Chris, we'll get you next.

32:37.240 --> 32:43.240
So somewhat related to that past question,

32:43.240 --> 32:52.240
some academic studies show that by far the cheapest way to make reliable grids

32:52.240 --> 32:56.240
which rely heavily on renewable energy is to incorporate a lot of,

32:56.240 --> 33:01.240
what's called demand response, so that consumers can be sent signals

33:01.240 --> 33:05.240
either with or without financial incentives to reduce their demand

33:05.240 --> 33:11.240
as an alternative to employing things like gas power plants or large battery arrays

33:11.240 --> 33:14.240
or indeed expensive transmission systems.

33:14.240 --> 33:22.240
And I think I see this as some of the most important area that it's in to get open source into

33:22.240 --> 33:30.240
because I see lots of closed silos and gatekeepers trying to set up in these areas at the moment

33:30.240 --> 33:38.240
and also huge problems with things like security and privacy on an individual basis.

33:38.240 --> 33:47.240
I mean, this is also great because you will get a lot of western hackers wanting to engage in this

33:47.240 --> 33:50.240
because it solves their own problem as well.

33:50.240 --> 33:55.240
So I mean, is there something that you're sort of paying to focus on heavily

33:55.240 --> 33:58.240
or is this a sort of peripheral goal?

34:06.240 --> 34:09.240
I'll just quickly try to handle that.

34:09.240 --> 34:14.240
I think, Dan, the demand response stuff that you're talking about is acknowledged

34:14.240 --> 34:17.240
as probably part of the overall solution here.

34:17.240 --> 34:21.240
Does related work on LF Energy, do we expect to plug into that?

34:21.240 --> 34:22.240
Is that fair?

34:22.240 --> 34:29.240
Yeah, I didn't catch all of the question, but if you're asking about a generally demand response,

34:29.240 --> 34:34.240
yes, I mean, that's something that's already big utilities are having to deal with that right now

34:34.240 --> 34:41.240
as they onboard renewables because load balancing is becoming more difficult

34:41.240 --> 34:47.240
when you have renewables versus being able to just turn up a gas turbine or not.

34:47.240 --> 34:51.240
And so a lot of that is being driven by new ML tools, AI tools.

34:51.240 --> 34:56.240
These are things that LF Energy is already doing on a utility scale.

34:56.240 --> 35:05.240
I think it probably, some of that, and I'm not the most technically minded person,

35:05.240 --> 35:10.240
so some of that may be scalable down to something like what we're talking about with OREZ,

35:10.240 --> 35:15.240
but there are also maybe new tools that we need to develop as part of this initiative

35:15.240 --> 35:22.240
to meet that sort of use case as well.

35:22.240 --> 35:26.240
Can I do another tying into the previous two?

35:26.240 --> 35:28.240
It's sort of a scoping question.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.240
It seems to me that you have two...

35:29.240 --> 35:31.240
Can you move the microphone closer to your mouth?

35:31.240 --> 35:32.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:32.240 --> 35:33.240
We can hear you up here.

35:33.240 --> 35:36.240
I'm usually so loud people are complaining in the next country.

35:36.240 --> 35:39.240
It seems to me you have a scoping issue here.

35:39.240 --> 35:42.240
There's two obvious cohorts you could apply to,

35:42.240 --> 35:45.240
either the underserved moment in the middle of Africa

35:45.240 --> 35:49.240
or it could be the balcony solar crowd.

35:49.240 --> 35:53.240
I propose something to our UK Energy Minister in 2009, which is balcony solar.

35:53.240 --> 35:57.240
Now, if you do the latter, you're not bringing electricity to new people,

35:57.240 --> 36:02.240
but you are helping people contribute to it and you'll get lots of Western hackers, etc.

36:02.240 --> 36:07.240
Do you want to rule out the balcony solar crowd or rule them into your solution?

36:07.240 --> 36:15.240
Because it seems that you've got two very separate targets there.

36:15.240 --> 36:23.240
I hear a statement as opposed to a question that we're dealing with two very different cohorts.

36:23.240 --> 36:27.240
Yep, you've got the underserved and you've got the already well-served,

36:27.240 --> 36:36.240
but balcony solar, you could do some guerrilla generation and you'll get lots of feedback.

36:36.240 --> 36:46.240
Who wants to take that?

36:46.240 --> 36:51.240
Okay, let me add something into that.

36:51.240 --> 37:00.240
I heard several things, demand response and also security from the previous lectures.

37:00.240 --> 37:04.240
These are very important aspects.

37:04.240 --> 37:13.240
First of all, this relates to the utility health and how we can help the utilities.

37:13.240 --> 37:22.240
Our project, at the beginning, we started with a residential level, small grass-root projects,

37:22.240 --> 37:31.240
but eventually we want to have industrial focus applications and maybe utility applications down the road.

37:31.240 --> 37:39.240
We're starting from our human center and then house a residential level in the first place.

37:39.240 --> 37:48.240
In terms of security, it's very important. We want to make sure other devices are secure and secure by design.

37:48.240 --> 37:58.240
What we mean by that is that, for example, we have autonomous mode, which does not connect to the network at all in the first place.

37:58.240 --> 38:06.240
And also we can have federated mode, meaning they join the federation and then they work together in collaboratively.

38:06.240 --> 38:15.240
That's a little bit more on the architecture side of this, that this working group is collectively going to define together.

38:15.240 --> 38:21.240
If you join the group, then you have more exposure and discussion and contribute your thought as well.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.240
Welcome. Thank you.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.240
Next?

38:25.240 --> 38:26.240
Chris.

38:26.240 --> 38:30.240
Hello, Chris Adams, Green Web Foundation. This sounds really cool. I really, really like it.

38:30.240 --> 38:38.240
One of the takeaways I took away was that it seems to be about decoupling future energy access from burning fossil fuels,

38:38.240 --> 38:47.240
which seems to be a really good thing, rather more so than converting existing demand to, like, that's already connected to the grid, right?

38:47.240 --> 38:53.240
You know that when we have a transition, we're switching from burning fuel to having access to finance.

38:53.240 --> 38:59.240
And one of the problems when people talk about energy access is the different ways to pay for it.

38:59.240 --> 39:03.240
Could you talk a little bit about the role of finance and how that would play a role in this?

39:03.240 --> 39:08.240
Because I kind of get how this would make it cheaper, which is good, but there's still a really, really big thing to address there.

39:08.240 --> 39:15.240
I see a Hillary nodding, so maybe if I put it to you first, perhaps?

39:15.240 --> 39:19.240
Finance. So making it affordable and cheap or inaccessible for people.

39:19.240 --> 39:36.240
I'm going to refer to a previous report that I had produced, which was focusing on decentralized energy and incentivizing the establishment of the prosumer energy movement.

39:36.240 --> 39:41.240
And if we look at Brooklyn, New York, there was a project called the Brooklyn Microgrid.

39:41.240 --> 39:45.240
There was no energy access problem in Brooklyn.

39:45.240 --> 39:59.240
There was an experiment to see if we could do better, if we could produce clean energy ourselves on our rooftops, share it, and not be in violation of any regulation.

39:59.240 --> 40:03.240
And these ideals are absolutely possible.

40:03.240 --> 40:10.240
We just have to put in the mechanisms and have favorable regulations so that people can produce their own energy.

40:10.240 --> 40:21.240
If they have an excess energy, sell it to their neighbor and do that within a regulatory framework and a payments framework that is accessible and affordable and universal.

40:21.240 --> 40:26.240
So all of these building blocks need to come together.

40:26.240 --> 40:36.240
It really requires the collaboration of governments and regulators to make microgrids possible, whether they are in Brooklyn or whether they're in Nigeria.

40:37.240 --> 40:43.240
And also giving people the incentive to charge their devices at non-peak hours.

40:43.240 --> 41:04.240
One of the experiments that we, a pilot project that took place in Canada, was with our energy distribution operator, as well as a payments network, and using blockchain technology, giving actual economic incentives to people.

41:04.240 --> 41:06.240
To make green choices.

41:06.240 --> 41:19.240
And until we commercialize green so that it is cheaper and a better, or just more accessible than fossil fuel burning choices, we're just not going to get there as quickly.

41:19.240 --> 41:24.240
We have to work with government incentives and individual incentives.

41:24.240 --> 41:30.240
Did Vivian or maybe Tony or Vivian, or Chris, please?

41:31.240 --> 41:36.240
I think the key word here is finance or affordability.

41:36.240 --> 41:42.240
And this is exactly what Orres is trying to address.

41:42.240 --> 41:44.240
Why?

41:44.240 --> 41:46.240
Look now.

41:46.240 --> 41:52.240
If you want to install your home energy system, at least mine from America, I believe in California.

41:53.240 --> 42:03.240
The company will approach me saying, okay, if you want to install a Tesla system in your house, that costs you about $40,000 to $50,000.

42:03.240 --> 42:10.240
Half of that is going to be labor cost, permitting cost, all the other installation things.

42:10.240 --> 42:13.240
The rest will be equipment.

42:13.240 --> 42:18.240
But if we do it with Orres way, that's why the thing happens.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.240
It's open.

42:19.240 --> 42:22.240
When it's open, what that means is open standard.

42:22.240 --> 42:31.240
That means it drives and tries to build and foster an equal system of vendors and suppliers, installers.

42:31.240 --> 42:42.240
Once you have mass adoption of this, then the prices will go down, both in terms of the labor cost and in terms of the equipment cost.

42:42.240 --> 42:53.240
Especially, that was the reason one of the motivations of Orres design is the plug and play that reduces the labor cost.

42:53.240 --> 42:58.240
That $25,000 right off the bat is gone.

42:58.240 --> 43:01.240
See, that's the open source way.

43:01.240 --> 43:12.240
And that will systematically and dramatically reduce the cost of renewable energy systems.

43:12.240 --> 43:17.240
That was the one, the prime motivation of Orres.

43:17.240 --> 43:21.240
Okay, so that's why. Please join us.

43:22.240 --> 43:35.240
I'm not sure if you were also asking particularly about the finance question for energy access.

43:35.240 --> 43:40.240
In particular, so is this possibly going beyond this panel?

43:40.240 --> 43:45.240
I'm pretty happy to engage with you in the discussion after work in this area quite a lot.

43:45.240 --> 43:53.240
And would say, as Chris said, we are contributing to it, but we can't solve all problems at the same time.

43:53.240 --> 43:59.240
It might drive down the costs, so make it easier, but we are not like a financing mechanism.

43:59.240 --> 44:02.240
We're not inventing a new financing mechanism to it.

44:02.240 --> 44:08.240
It's also needed, and maybe Tony has some ideas on the policy side.

44:08.240 --> 44:16.240
So, I mean, yeah, the finance aspect is reducing costs here, not inventing or developing another finance mechanism.

44:16.240 --> 44:24.240
Great if somebody has ideas and make that open source even better.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.240
Another question?

44:26.240 --> 44:35.240
On the joining part, so can you tell us about the prerequisites for someone to make a meaningful contribution or put another way?

44:35.240 --> 44:40.240
I'm just a software developer. I don't know any about energy distribution hardware stuff.

44:40.240 --> 44:46.240
What can I contribute? What can I bring to the table?

44:46.240 --> 44:50.240
I mean, I can talk a little bit about that and I'll let the panel weigh in as well.

44:50.240 --> 44:54.240
But, you know, this is true of any open source project.

44:54.240 --> 44:57.240
Like, anyone can contribute and get involved.

44:57.240 --> 45:00.240
You don't have to necessarily contribute code.

45:00.240 --> 45:04.240
You can contribute. We will need help with organization.

45:04.240 --> 45:14.240
We will need help with marketing. We will need help with probably doing events and notes keeping and maintaining websites.

45:14.240 --> 45:21.240
And if you're interested in contributing in that sort of way, please still sign up for the mailing list and let us know that.

45:21.240 --> 45:24.240
I'll happily give you tasks to do.

45:25.240 --> 45:32.240
And one thing, if you don't know anything, your question is, if you don't know anything about energy, how do I contribute?

45:32.240 --> 45:39.240
And then everybody in this room, you can help contribute.

45:39.240 --> 45:44.240
Just spread the word. Take the picture of those QR codes.

45:44.240 --> 45:48.240
Send it to your friends. Spread the word.

45:48.240 --> 45:55.240
Not only particularly in this working group, this project is an open renewable energy system.

45:55.240 --> 46:02.240
This project, per se, but spread the concept, the mission of ORES.

46:02.240 --> 46:15.240
We want to get more people involved and think about ways how we can help create renewable energy resources and to live more sustainably.

46:18.240 --> 46:27.240
Just one more addition. And pretty sure from here in a few months down the line, we will have very specific work tasks that need to be addressed

46:27.240 --> 46:31.240
and that can perfectly be addressed by somebody without any energy background.

46:31.240 --> 46:42.240
So, yeah, go on the mailing list. Stay tuned and it will get every time more concrete and also more detached from particular energy or energy access knowledge.

46:42.240 --> 46:47.240
Alright, I see we've got about three minutes left, so I think you'll be the last question.

46:47.240 --> 46:56.240
It's really interesting to hear from you guys and I thought it was also interesting how you said there are so many different ideas about the approach to the problem.

46:56.240 --> 47:03.240
So, I was wondering, like, what are the main conflicting perspectives or ideas about the implementation of this idea?

47:03.240 --> 47:08.240
Sorry, the implementation of...

47:08.240 --> 47:21.240
The conflicting ideas about the implementation of the whole system that you guys were describing.

47:21.240 --> 47:29.240
Oh, I alluded to that. There was some disagreement in our earlier working group meeting.

47:29.240 --> 47:32.240
We have more agreement than disagreement.

47:32.240 --> 47:34.240
This is true. Yes, there's more agreement than disagreement.

47:34.240 --> 47:37.240
Otherwise, we don't have that many people come here.

47:37.240 --> 47:41.240
So, your question is about more implementation. Is that right?

47:41.240 --> 47:44.240
Yeah, like, what are the disagreements, essentially?

47:44.240 --> 47:46.240
What are disagreements?

47:46.240 --> 47:47.240
Yes.

47:47.240 --> 47:51.240
Oh.

47:51.240 --> 47:56.240
I think the disagreement... You know what? I don't really think we have much disagreement.

47:56.240 --> 48:02.240
I think the reason we have a lot of discussion was because there may be some understandings.

48:02.240 --> 48:08.240
Right? It's a very loud room. Sometimes we couldn't communicate clearly.

48:08.240 --> 48:13.240
But eventually, people come together.

48:13.240 --> 48:20.240
Eventually, people come together. That demonstrates a lot of interest, a lot of consensus,

48:20.240 --> 48:23.240
and also a lot of passion.

48:23.240 --> 48:28.240
People now are joining together into this project.

48:29.240 --> 48:40.240
So, with respect to detailed implementation, then you will know that we have joined the mailing list, the working group.

48:40.240 --> 48:44.240
Then we'll have more discussion as to how we're going to do this.

48:44.240 --> 48:46.240
We've got some ideas already.

48:46.240 --> 48:51.240
And just come join us.

48:53.240 --> 48:56.240
Sorry, just a quick word on perspectives on implementation.

48:56.240 --> 49:02.240
For me, the issue is perfection is the enemy of the good, as you all know.

49:02.240 --> 49:07.240
So, I'm here because I believe this mission, but we need to see this in action.

49:07.240 --> 49:12.240
So, we're trying to find the common ground. Where do we get our first implementation?

49:12.240 --> 49:18.240
Kick it around. See how it works. See how it doesn't work. Go from there. It's as simple as that.

49:21.240 --> 49:24.240
Any final word? We've got about one minute left.

49:24.240 --> 49:30.240
I just wanted to say, I think there was more conversation around who should we invite?

49:30.240 --> 49:33.240
How do we get started? What are the priority issues?

49:33.240 --> 49:41.240
This is a big idea, and we want as many people involved as possible.

49:41.240 --> 49:49.240
So, I echo Chris, Dan, and everybody on this panel to say, spread the word, share what you've learned today,

49:49.240 --> 49:53.240
and share the reports if they help bring in new stakeholders.

49:53.240 --> 49:57.240
And we look forward to hearing from you.

49:57.240 --> 50:02.240
Alright, thank you all so much. Feel free to grab any of us afterwards if you have any other questions.

50:02.240 --> 50:05.240
Thank you so much. Is this the...

50:09.240 --> 50:14.240
I want to say one more thing. I'm not sure. Is this seem to be the last?

50:14.240 --> 50:15.240
Is it the last?

50:15.240 --> 50:16.240
No, there's one more after us.

50:16.240 --> 50:20.240
There's one more? Okay, this is the second to the last conversation here.

50:20.240 --> 50:26.240
So, if people stay here at Leislang after these two days of photo, give us a big shout.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.240
Thank you.

50:30.240 --> 50:36.240
And, join us, and we'll all be part of this movement. Thank you guys.
