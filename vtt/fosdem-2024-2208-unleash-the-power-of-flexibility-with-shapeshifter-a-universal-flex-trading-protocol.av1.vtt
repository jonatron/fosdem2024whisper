WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.200
Alright, let's start then. Me and Tom here are, well, we've come here to tell you about

00:12.200 --> 00:16.920
Shapeshifter, a project we've both been working on. For me it's been, I think the first time

00:16.920 --> 00:23.080
I got in contact with it was five years ago, I think for Tom it's one or two. Well, this

00:23.080 --> 00:29.560
is us. I work as a freelancer. I actually used to work at Alieander, where we just saw the

00:29.560 --> 00:37.200
presentation from and I'm freelancing right now. Tom, just as me, is a member of the TSC,

00:37.200 --> 00:41.080
the Technical Steering Committee of this project. We're here to tell you something about it.

00:41.080 --> 00:53.760
That's some technical issues. This is not great. Anyway, the problem we're trying to,

00:53.760 --> 00:59.000
I'm going to talk to you about the problem we're trying to solve. Yeah, what Shapeshifter is,

00:59.000 --> 01:05.240
how does it work, and also how to use it. I do hope the screen will get back to us.

01:15.240 --> 01:22.560
Right, so it's funny actually, part of the slide you saw just now. It's actually fun to see the

01:22.560 --> 01:28.200
trend here because just two years ago we had some areas where there were issues with congestion on

01:28.200 --> 01:37.080
our grid and right now it's almost impossible to get anything going. Yeah, really, to get your data

01:37.080 --> 01:45.480
sender up or get your solar panels up. It's just almost impossible. Where the previous presentation

01:45.480 --> 01:52.240
was about forecasting, we're actually on the other end of things with the trends that she talked

01:52.320 --> 01:59.560
about, well, production and consumption is getting more simultaneous, it's getting less centralized,

01:59.560 --> 02:08.520
a lot of electrification. This means we're slowly getting into issues. So how does it look like

02:08.520 --> 02:15.960
if you draw it in a graph? This used to be our case. Well, quite simple. We expected use up until

02:15.960 --> 02:22.720
the green line, capacity was black and actually the grid companies oversold their capacity a

02:22.720 --> 02:39.200
little bit because, well, it's not usually used for the whole thing. Really annoying. Sorry for this.

02:46.960 --> 02:52.120
Pull out the clicker, maybe that's the problem.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.960
Yeah, it strangely shows up on the second screen there, but apparently the beamer's not very happy

03:07.960 --> 03:19.120
with it. Alright, almost back. So it still wasn't that bad yet. I'm gonna stand on this side so I can

03:19.120 --> 03:32.400
at least click on the laptop. At some point, it got so bad, our grid capacity is reached and well,

03:32.480 --> 03:41.720
if this happens, two things might happen. Either your transformer is sort of overloaded, but it will

03:41.720 --> 03:48.000
keep working. If you do it too often, what then happens is it will blow up or it will really

03:48.000 --> 04:01.840
shorten its lifespan by a lot. So we try to prevent it from happening. As was, yeah, we can also

04:01.920 --> 04:10.560
fix this problem by making sure it doesn't go over this peak anymore. How we do this, I'm just gonna

04:10.560 --> 04:20.920
try and explain it without the screen. There's some major users on the net, let's say above 1 megawatt

04:20.920 --> 04:27.640
for their connection, that actually have some influence on when their energy is used. So if they,

04:28.640 --> 04:38.200
yeah, let's say a giant freezer or they've got a battery somewhere stored, to them it doesn't really

04:38.200 --> 04:42.200
matter in case of the freezer, for example, the temperature needs to be between minus 25 and

04:42.200 --> 04:48.080
minus 20. So this means that if you don't use power at the peak, you can make sure that it's fixed.

04:48.600 --> 05:02.760
We're gonna try a different approach for the screen. Give them two minutes maybe.

05:02.760 --> 05:17.760
So really any major company in the beginning, it used to be voluntary, but at some point,

05:17.760 --> 05:24.800
yeah, problems are getting bigger and bigger. So we're getting into a state where it's actually

05:24.800 --> 05:30.880
allowed by Dutch law to force certain companies to comply with these rules to make sure that

05:30.880 --> 05:45.760
we're not having blackouts and that the grid is saved. We've got a second screen, we're back.

05:45.760 --> 05:54.840
All right, thank you. It was kind of stressful. So actually the previous presentation, the open

05:54.840 --> 06:01.000
step, this was really about creating insight. Where's your problem? When is your problem? How

06:01.000 --> 06:08.720
big is your problem? That only, so the insight is just creating the graphs. You can identify

06:08.720 --> 06:15.320
problems by having your experts at your company determine, okay, at which points, how much load

06:15.320 --> 06:20.640
can our transformers handle? How much can our cables handle? So once you have that, you can,

06:21.080 --> 06:25.440
okay, so these are risky areas because we see in our forecasts or in our measurements that we're

06:25.440 --> 06:31.880
nearing our limits in certain cases. Third one is really an interesting one. You can choose a

06:31.880 --> 06:39.680
solution because in the grids there's, well, not hundreds, but at least tens of possibilities to

06:39.680 --> 06:46.560
alleviate the pressure on your grid. And shape shifter, which we're talking about here is one of

06:46.560 --> 06:54.960
them, which is in the market based direction of solutions. Tom will tell a bit more about

06:54.960 --> 07:00.800
the contents of shape shifter itself. Of course, you need to activate a solution once you've chosen

07:00.800 --> 07:07.880
it. And last part is actually kind of interesting too. If companies are saying they've decreased

07:07.880 --> 07:14.400
their use, how do you actually determine that that's true? Because usually power use is not

07:15.280 --> 07:18.800
stable anyway. So how do you know they've kept their promises?

07:21.800 --> 07:27.600
Well, that's where shape shifter comes in. You know, mind if I talk about this one. It was founded

07:27.600 --> 07:36.160
in 2014, well, by a couple of grid operators, but also IT companies and consultants, because it was a

07:36.160 --> 07:43.720
very common problem in Europe altogether, but it was started in the Netherlands because we've got a

07:43.720 --> 07:52.520
very, very stable power grid and we like to keep it that way. So that's where the need came from.

07:52.520 --> 08:01.600
It's actually put into practice by the Dutch DSOs. I worked on the first pilot project where we

08:01.600 --> 08:08.320
actually made sure that we didn't have to put in a temporary cable, which would have cost 2 million

08:08.320 --> 08:12.400
euros for just three years, because that was when the new transformer would have been in place.

08:13.360 --> 08:20.120
So it was a very nice project to work on. The USEV standard, that's the Universal Smart Energy

08:20.120 --> 08:26.480
Framework, has been updated a couple of times. In the meantime, it was relabeled to universal

08:26.480 --> 08:34.000
flex trading protocol, but that conflicted with UFTP. FTP, that was kind of annoying. So it was

08:34.000 --> 08:41.600
renamed to shape shifter and hopefully we'll keep it that way for a little bit. And I think now

08:41.640 --> 08:48.640
it's Tom's turn to talk about what it does, or should I still take this one? I'll go into this

08:48.640 --> 08:57.520
one again. So in the grid, there's a lot of roles defined and the Universal Smart Energy Framework

08:57.520 --> 09:04.520
actually defines all these roles. The most important ones here for a shape shifter are the DSOs,

09:04.880 --> 09:14.640
aggregators and prosumers. Aggregators are companies that usually provide some form of IT where they

09:14.640 --> 09:22.640
can trade on behalf of companies, well, prosumers or consumers or companies that actually have the

09:22.640 --> 09:30.520
physical flexibility, but the aggregator will be the party that's participating in the flex trading

09:31.000 --> 09:39.320
protocol. It's possible that those two are the same. It's not necessary that roles are separated. It

09:39.320 --> 09:44.320
might be that a prosumer actually takes on the aggregator role because they're big enough to just

09:44.320 --> 09:53.000
be a party in this flex trading protocol. The DSOs and TSOs are the parties that really send out

09:53.480 --> 10:01.800
the request, the flex request that Tom will probably talk about into the market. All the aggregators

10:01.800 --> 10:11.560
will have time to respond to the request. Okay, apparently tomorrow at 6 p.m. until 7 p.m. there's

10:13.240 --> 10:21.320
congestion on the production side. So please, if you can use extra power during that time in a

10:21.360 --> 10:29.400
certain region, we will actually pay you for it. That's an example situation that you can handle

10:29.400 --> 10:37.680
with shape shifter. So some typical flex applications. Solar parks talked about them, wind

10:37.680 --> 10:43.080
parks, freezers. I think that's a very interesting one. I'm not even sure if it has been done before

10:43.080 --> 10:49.560
to actually use a giant freezer as an energy storage for grid stabilization, so I thought it

10:49.600 --> 10:56.760
was a very cool use case. Farms with solar, close to the solar parts, of course. Steel mills as they

10:56.760 --> 11:05.480
are major energy users and not necessarily time specific in when they do so. And really, in most

11:05.480 --> 11:11.120
of our early projects, we talked with greenhouses a lot because they have both large electricity

11:11.120 --> 11:18.160
connections and gas connections. So they can switch really easily or can even provide power back to

11:18.200 --> 11:26.400
the grid if they need to. So they are very nice from a flexibility perspective. Then I'll hand it over to

11:26.400 --> 11:32.960
my colleague Tom. Yeah, so in the time remaining, the shape shifter project, it consists of a

11:32.960 --> 11:41.280
specification which is published on GitHub. So you can scan the QR if you want. The specification is

11:41.280 --> 11:47.880
the one hand of the project. The other part is the XML schemas which are defined along with it. We

11:47.920 --> 11:54.040
are organized using a technical steering committee. We are part of the committee and also a couple of

11:54.040 --> 12:00.080
members from the UK DSOs and also from the Dutch DSOs. There are also two shape shifter

12:00.080 --> 12:06.120
implementations already. There is a Java library which is in use by Alieander and also at Gopax,

12:06.120 --> 12:13.080
which is the congestion platform we are using in the Netherlands. And there is a Python implementation

12:13.120 --> 12:20.040
which is used by another DSO. Everything is published under the Apache 2 license. We are

12:20.040 --> 12:26.640
currently focusing on improving our processes, our quality control, etc., to meet the open SSF

12:26.640 --> 12:35.760
best practices. And we are part of the LF Energy initiative. I will skip this for now. So we have

12:35.760 --> 12:41.680
a couple of implementations already that are using shape shifter. There was a demonstration

12:41.720 --> 12:49.000
project in the UK called Fusion. Good result from that. As I said, Gopax in the Netherlands. There

12:49.000 --> 12:54.520
are also some congestion service providers which are also implementing shape shifter on their

12:54.520 --> 13:01.000
end. So those are the CSP aggregator type of parties. And of course the grid operators

13:01.000 --> 13:08.760
themselves are using it to facilitate trading of flexibility using shape shifter. Skip this for

13:08.800 --> 13:18.560
now. Just one simple example of what the protocol looks like. It is an XML based protocol where the

13:18.560 --> 13:29.040
DSO can indicate what flexibility is required on the prosumer side on which the prosumer can

13:29.040 --> 13:34.680
reply with one or more offers that will be able to offer some flexibility to the grid operator.

13:34.880 --> 13:41.120
And the grid operator can then in turn reply to this message and say, okay, I want to use your

13:41.120 --> 13:48.920
flexibility during these hours to solve a specific congestion problem. One minute left.

13:48.920 --> 13:56.440
Current challenges we have with the project. We are trying to get as much of the prosumers involved

13:56.440 --> 14:02.960
as we can. So one of the challenges that we have to really keep a low entry barrier for these parties

14:03.000 --> 14:07.200
to connect using shape shifter. So one of the things is security is of course a very important

14:07.200 --> 14:13.800
topic. How can we keep it secure but also keep the barrier really low for entering into this type

14:13.800 --> 14:20.520
of integrations. And the other thing is we need more contributors. So that's pretty much a story

14:20.520 --> 14:26.120
for every open source project. But yeah, there are different ways you contribute. So if you find

14:26.120 --> 14:32.320
this interesting, please take a look at our GitHub and see if you can improve one of these

14:32.640 --> 14:35.760
items for example. Yeah, that's pretty much it.

14:44.760 --> 14:50.800
Any questions? I see one in the back. Oh, there's no time. Sorry. Yeah, just come to the front

14:50.800 --> 14:52.320
and then take your question.
