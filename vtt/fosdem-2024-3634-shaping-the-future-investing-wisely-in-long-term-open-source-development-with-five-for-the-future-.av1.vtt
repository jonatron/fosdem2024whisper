WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.560
is giving us a talk about the importance of eating vegetables in our day, the famous

00:10.560 --> 00:16.880
Saturday program from the UK. And this sort of health information is very important for

00:16.880 --> 00:22.160
us. And you can see that I have not been following it since the pandemic, but I hope to learn

00:22.160 --> 00:29.000
a lot today. Thank you very much. Thank you for me here. And today I'm going to talk about

00:29.000 --> 00:37.800
a project that we're using in the world-class community to develop the open source system

00:37.800 --> 00:46.000
and increase the usage of the users. And Jesus Amelio, I work as a software engineer at Automatic,

00:46.000 --> 00:53.280
but I am working full-time in the open source project, okay, inside this FIFER Future Initiative.

00:53.280 --> 01:01.320
So I want to ask a question as a start. Would you work for free? No. Yeah, we're in open

01:01.320 --> 01:09.160
source conference, so this is a very tricky question. We work for free a lot of time.

01:09.160 --> 01:19.000
And we do free work with our family, with our community, church, and so on. Okay. And

01:19.000 --> 01:26.080
of course, in the IT world, we do a lot of free software. I like a lot this XCAD, this

01:26.080 --> 01:34.880
CD comic, because it shows all the modern digital infrastructure maintained by a random person

01:34.880 --> 01:43.280
in Nebraska has been, thanks to the maintenance, is 20,000 free, and of course, for free. And

01:43.280 --> 01:52.080
this is a joke, this is a trick, but this is the real. Do you remember the love for you

01:52.080 --> 02:05.640
problem you have in 2021? It has a, okay, it's a critical book. It causes a lot of security

02:05.640 --> 02:13.200
problems. It's rated with a 10 in a scale between 0 and 10, so it's very dangerous problem.

02:13.200 --> 02:22.960
And as you can see in Twitter, the developers were granted for work that they are not paid

02:22.960 --> 02:29.240
for for a future they are dislike yet need to keep with the back and work compatibility

02:29.240 --> 02:35.040
concerns. And they are not making money. They was not making money by this. In fact, if you

02:35.080 --> 02:43.240
take a look to the gift who have the sponsors for these users, one of the maintenance has

02:43.240 --> 02:55.560
one sponsor and the other one has 50 sponsors. Of course, they are working as a service in

02:55.680 --> 03:10.600
a full time company. So finally, we have a report, a security analysis report saying that 88%

03:10.600 --> 03:17.480
of the open source software contain components with no activity in the last two years and

03:17.480 --> 03:24.920
containing components that were not in the last version. So the question is, is this

03:24.960 --> 03:35.280
sustainable? No. Of course, it isn't. So we need to look for how to make money for these

03:35.280 --> 03:40.960
open source companies. I'm going to explain how the difference in the companies are making

03:40.960 --> 03:49.480
money in the open source software. So one of the types of this financial is the donation.

03:49.520 --> 03:56.000
For example, when you, the developer of UGS is making a full time, is making a full time

03:56.000 --> 04:07.080
developer with the gift have a sponsors. In the security, in the security, you can get

04:07.080 --> 04:13.800
rewards if you find a book for a company, but a lot of times these security searches

04:14.120 --> 04:21.720
sell in the black market through the third day fines. The core funding, for example, to

04:21.720 --> 04:28.200
develop the WP CLI, the World Press CLI, the developer create a core funding at Kickstarter

04:28.200 --> 04:35.720
before start developing the tool. Another projects are internal projects because, for

04:35.800 --> 04:46.800
example, Rust from the Mozilla Foundation, go from Google or RAT from Facebook. These

04:46.800 --> 04:53.960
were internal projects that become open source projects and now are used by a lot of different

04:53.960 --> 05:02.280
people. Some companies are making out of money. For example, RAT are making out of money with

05:02.280 --> 05:11.720
the consulting service and they are developing a lot of open source to achieve this consulting.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.840
There are a few foundations, for example, the Apache Foundation that get out of money from

05:17.840 --> 05:23.080
contributors and they pay for the first two tours for some developers and so on. Or, for

05:23.080 --> 05:29.640
example, the PHP Foundation that get money from different companies, for example, from

05:29.640 --> 05:37.560
my company, Automatic and they hire developers to work on the next versions of PHP.

05:39.880 --> 05:46.200
Some companies like Automatic are making money with a SaaS model at Wolpes.com,

05:47.080 --> 05:53.720
Nextcloud has a similar approach. They have an open source project and you can install your

05:53.800 --> 06:00.440
own service but if you don't want to do this, you can use the SaaS product. Or, for example,

06:00.440 --> 06:07.800
a large-level forge that have a very good open source PHP framework and you can use for free

06:07.800 --> 06:17.880
but if you can manage your service in an easy way, you can use this product. Some companies

06:17.880 --> 06:24.040
have dual license so if you are going to develop an open source product, you can use

06:24.760 --> 06:31.080
this library for free but if you can include in a closed source software, you need to pay

06:32.120 --> 06:39.800
not open source license. Another approach is the open core. For example, it's the approach that

06:39.880 --> 06:47.080
MySQL develops. They create an open source product and they have a proprietary product

06:47.960 --> 06:57.240
they sell. It's the same approach with GitLab. Some companies are getting external funding. For

06:57.240 --> 07:07.320
example, MariaDB has made, get 270 million in different venture capital rounds before

07:08.280 --> 07:15.960
become public, offering a sample and gains that has get 84 million dollars in different venture

07:15.960 --> 07:25.320
capital rounds. And finally, of course, there are out of different approaches but finally,

07:25.320 --> 07:32.360
to be hired by a company. An example of this is my example inside the Fight for a Future project.

07:32.440 --> 07:36.760
Okay, so let's start about the Fight for a Future initiative.

07:40.360 --> 07:45.400
And first, I'm going to start explaining economic, economic theory. It's called the

07:45.400 --> 07:53.640
tragedy of the commons. It's a very simple economical theory that we can make a similarity with

07:54.600 --> 08:04.360
the open source projects. Imagine a field, a public field where four farmers has their own

08:04.360 --> 08:14.200
cows and everything is okay. They have their cows in this field and they cancel the milk and so on.

08:14.200 --> 08:19.640
Everything is okay. But when they, one farmer said, okay, I'm making good money with one cow.

08:20.600 --> 08:27.160
Let's buy another one because with this new cow, I can get more money. Okay. And the other

08:27.880 --> 08:34.760
farmers, of course, said, okay, the other farmer is making good money with the two cows. So I'm going

08:34.760 --> 08:43.320
to buy another cow. So one day we have a lot of cows in this public field and one day the field

08:43.400 --> 08:53.240
broke. The cows died and the farmers are broke. This is very similar that we have,

08:53.800 --> 09:01.560
that happens in the open source projects because we have a lot in a lot of open source projects.

09:01.560 --> 09:08.920
We have a lot of people making a lot of money with these products but they are not giving back

09:08.920 --> 09:15.160
anything to the project. Of course, you know a lot of different things like this in the open source

09:16.280 --> 09:22.600
projects. Okay. This Five for the Future Initiative started in the work in Europe

09:23.560 --> 09:30.440
2014 in Sofia, Bulgaria. Do you know what's our work camp? It's something like a group

09:30.440 --> 09:38.120
of people in the work camp. We have three major work camps in the US, Europe, and Asia,

09:38.120 --> 09:47.560
a lot of in the small cities. Okay. And one day we have some questions

09:48.600 --> 09:53.400
answered by Matt MÃ¼llermer, the co-founder of the work project. And one of these questions,

09:54.200 --> 10:00.200
they talk about the return of the company. So they ask that you have a lot of companies that

10:00.520 --> 10:06.040
are making a lot of money with workers but they don't give back any money to the project. Okay.

10:06.600 --> 10:14.120
So two days later Matt wrote an interesting post in the blog and I'm going to read

10:14.920 --> 10:20.520
two paragraphs about this to introduce the Five for the Future project. Okay. The first one is,

10:20.520 --> 10:25.560
I think a good rule of thumb that we scale with the community as it continues to grow is that

10:25.560 --> 10:31.720
organizations that want to grow the workers by and not just in the piece of it should dedicate

10:31.720 --> 10:38.040
five percent of the people to working on something to do with coal. Be development,

10:38.040 --> 10:43.640
documentation, security support, forums, theme reviews, training, testing, translation, whatever

10:43.640 --> 10:52.760
it might be that has moved workers mission forward. And the second interesting paragraph is,

10:52.760 --> 10:58.120
it's a big commitment but I can think of a better long-term investment in the health of

10:58.120 --> 11:03.160
workers overall. I think it will look incredibly modest in high-side. The rate is probably the

11:03.160 --> 11:08.840
bare minimum for a sustainable ecosystem avoiding the tragedy of the commons. Okay. So I introduced

11:08.840 --> 11:15.320
before this problem related with this. I think the five percent rule is one of that a lot of

11:15.320 --> 11:20.360
soft projects and companies should follow at least if they want to be private at the cataphrone now.

11:20.360 --> 11:25.320
This was an idea as a goal and if you know something about the workers project,

11:25.320 --> 11:30.440
I think it was a very good initiative. Okay. So let's talk more about this.

11:32.520 --> 11:38.360
This five percent encouraged to the individual contributors and organizations to contribute

11:38.360 --> 11:43.240
five percent of their resources to the workers development. If you want to take more information,

11:43.240 --> 11:49.400
you can go to workers.org slash five but I'm going to explain a lot more about the project now.

11:50.440 --> 12:01.080
So what's a contribution? The open source worker project is split in 22 different projects. So it's

12:02.520 --> 12:06.280
very impossible that you don't can fit in one of these projects because

12:07.640 --> 12:13.160
if you are a developer, you can code in something, you can translate. If you are not an English native

12:13.160 --> 12:21.320
speaker, you can go the translation of your language. We have 2008 different languages

12:22.120 --> 12:29.880
translated. We have a variety of support forums. We have documentation. We have learning videos

12:31.400 --> 12:38.600
design community, accessibility people, marketing people, community that are going to have

12:38.600 --> 12:44.840
different meetups and work comes around the world. We have TV people that lost the videos

12:44.840 --> 12:51.800
from these events to workers.tv. We can have people contributed to hosting initiative to

12:53.560 --> 12:59.560
create documentation for this. And finally, we have the open business photos that tries to get

13:00.200 --> 13:09.720
all the open source photos in one place. So I'm sure that you can contribute at least to one of these

13:09.720 --> 13:20.040
initiatives. Okay, so once we know how we can contribute, how we can place the time, we can do

13:20.040 --> 13:27.000
this as individual contributors or sponsored by a company. In the first situation, it's very simple.

13:27.000 --> 13:34.040
You go to your workers profile and said, okay, I am a sponsor. No, so I am the video contributor.

13:34.040 --> 13:39.800
I'm going to spend five hours per week in this community core hosting team. So now this is

13:39.800 --> 13:47.480
public in your profile claiming that you are dedicating five of weekly hours to these different

13:47.480 --> 13:55.640
teams. And in your profile, in your public profile, you have an activity. For example, this is my

13:57.080 --> 14:02.840
public profile and said that I create these translations. I close a ticket in the MetaFract.

14:02.840 --> 14:08.920
I close a pull request and so on. So we have a history of your contributions. We don't have

14:08.920 --> 14:19.160
the work policy. We don't have people taking a look at what people are contributing. This is an

14:19.240 --> 14:28.040
honor code. Okay. And you can be sponsored by a company. This is my situation. For example,

14:28.040 --> 14:35.960
you can see here automatic is sponsoring 109 people full time or part time to the open source

14:35.960 --> 14:50.600
project. It's a week near 4,000 hours. A lot of hours. And we have 111 companies sponsoring

14:50.600 --> 15:01.560
people. Okay. From one hour and automatic is the company with most hours. Okay. This is from two

15:01.560 --> 15:09.400
years ago, but it's the current situation. We have automatic as the company with most contributors

15:09.400 --> 15:15.960
and we have a lot of companies like Joas, GoDaddy, HumaMaid and so on with contributions. What is

15:15.960 --> 15:24.280
the perfect situation? This will be the perfect situation with around 10 big companies contributing

15:24.280 --> 15:32.840
a lot to the open source project and small companies, small agencies contributing 5 hours,

15:32.840 --> 15:41.640
10 hours. This is 5%. Which companies are in the project? We have companies. We have companies like

15:41.640 --> 15:49.000
Google or Joas. Joas is a CEO company and we have a lot of hosting companies because the hosting

15:49.000 --> 15:55.160
companies is making a lot of money with the WordPress installations. Okay. But we have, as I said,

15:55.160 --> 16:03.000
before we have 181 companies, mainly companies focused on the WordPress ecosystem. Okay.

16:06.840 --> 16:11.400
Okay. Well, should you contribute? Let's see it.

16:11.960 --> 16:21.160
You're going to develop a lot of skills because you're going to work with a lot of talented

16:21.160 --> 16:29.080
contributors around the world. You're going to build your own portfolio, mainly at WordPress.org

16:29.080 --> 16:34.840
and at GitHub or on other platforms. This is very interesting if you are looking for a job because

16:35.480 --> 16:42.120
the quitters can see your profile and if you want to get more customers, it's a good initiative.

16:43.640 --> 16:48.440
And you're going to know a lot of people because you are going to interact with them

16:49.160 --> 16:55.960
in different ways. And this is important because probably in one year or two years you want to

16:55.960 --> 17:03.160
change your job and probably you made a contact in this networking

17:04.680 --> 17:12.840
in a polygons community, in our forums and so on. This is a typical path for a contributor and

17:12.840 --> 17:20.680
this was my path. You start as a regular user for the CMS, then you become a casual contributor,

17:21.320 --> 17:26.520
then you become a pleasure contributor and finally you become a leader on a

17:26.520 --> 17:32.520
aspect. Of course, you can stop in one of these steps. For example, in my situation,

17:32.520 --> 17:40.840
I started, I started using in 2006, installing a WordPress for my own blog. I come from to

17:41.160 --> 17:50.520
to WordPress. Then in 2014, eight years later, I started translating in Spanish.

17:52.120 --> 17:58.600
Later, I started translating to another language. It's called Galician. It's in the northwest of

17:58.600 --> 18:06.600
Spain and I continue translating a lot. So I became a casual contributor to a press contributor

18:06.600 --> 18:12.040
because I do a lot of translations and I become a validator for this language. I get

18:12.840 --> 18:19.160
very involved in the world project and one guy from automatic ping me, send me.

18:20.280 --> 18:27.880
Look at this. These are very interesting work that I think it fits with your profile. And now I'm here.

18:28.600 --> 18:41.560
Okay, so this is another way of becoming a start as a regular user and now I am one of the experts

18:41.560 --> 18:51.720
in the Polyglots team. Okay, why should a company contribute because you can pay to people to

18:51.720 --> 18:57.000
contribute to the open source project? Because you can grow your talent pool into ways.

18:58.440 --> 19:03.000
You can identify and recruit new talent. Of course, if you are involved in the project,

19:03.000 --> 19:06.520
you are going to make networking with a lot of people and these people

19:07.960 --> 19:15.320
in the future could be your employees. And of course, you can upskill your organization talent.

19:16.200 --> 19:21.640
Some people from your company are involved in the open source company. They are going to improve

19:21.640 --> 19:29.400
the knowledge. They are going to keep a date with the project's direction. Of course, if you are

19:29.400 --> 19:40.440
involved in some projects of the open source project, you are going to get information about the way

19:40.440 --> 19:46.440
of the project. You can take decisions aligned with your needs or your client's needs.

19:47.320 --> 19:54.440
And finally, you can gain credibility. Of course, if you can set to one of your customers that you

19:54.440 --> 20:01.320
are one of the main contributors to the open source project, so you can get clients with this

20:01.320 --> 20:09.080
approach. Finally, I'm going to give a few tips for individual contributors and for companies.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.680
I'm going to start with the individual contributors.

20:17.480 --> 20:25.320
First of all, find your team. Maybe you are from Italy, so you can start translating to Italy.

20:27.480 --> 20:36.680
You are a developer. You can start solving some PRs. You have a lot of knowledge about the

20:36.760 --> 20:43.640
plugins. You can reply questions in the forums. There are a lot of things, and I'm sure you can

20:43.640 --> 20:51.880
fit in one or more of these teams. Then read the docs. Nobody reads the docs, but we have very

20:51.880 --> 21:00.440
good docs. We have a contributor handbook. We have a few video courses about contributing in the

21:00.920 --> 21:07.720
WordPress, and each team has a handbook. In this handbook, you have all the information you need to

21:07.720 --> 21:11.800
contribute from the beginner to the expert user.

21:16.680 --> 21:19.560
It's very important to connect with the committee because we are working

21:20.840 --> 21:26.040
usually from our houses or offices in our remote approach. So we have

21:26.360 --> 21:32.360
weekly meetings through Slack, and we have Slack channels to coordinate all the works

21:33.240 --> 21:40.600
between the teams. It's very, very important to get this communication, this connection with

21:40.600 --> 21:47.800
the old people from the community. It's important to create a contributor habit because if you

21:47.800 --> 21:55.240
don't set this hour, this half hour to contribute, you are not going to have time in your day to

21:55.800 --> 22:05.640
day to contribute. It's very important to start slow with a very long-term commitment. This is a

22:05.640 --> 22:13.560
marathon, not 100 meters long. You know that people when they start to go to the game, they start

22:15.160 --> 22:19.240
training two hours a day, they stop doing this in two weeks.

22:19.800 --> 22:26.760
Okay, and tips for the company contributions. Set the strategy for the future. This is very

22:26.760 --> 22:32.280
important because you should have a strategy aligned with your market.

22:33.640 --> 22:39.480
Identify your goals, much than with your employer skills because if you don't have

22:40.680 --> 22:47.320
employees with these skills, it's impossible to align this with your goals, of course.

22:47.400 --> 22:53.160
And it's very interesting to work on having path contributions.

22:55.080 --> 23:03.720
Allocate weekly time. This is very important because we always have a project that we

23:04.360 --> 23:09.160
need to release tomorrow, and if we don't allocate this time, we're not going to

23:10.120 --> 23:16.760
work on this future project. Any of the company's could be interesting to think about

23:16.760 --> 23:25.080
building a contribution team. I'm not talking about full-time workers, but you can have

23:25.960 --> 23:34.520
five people working two or one or two hours a week in different teams. It could be very

23:34.520 --> 23:41.480
interesting to get more visibility in the different teams, the different 22 teams.

23:42.440 --> 23:48.920
Maybe it's interesting to hire full-time contributors, but of course you need to be a big company to do this.

23:51.880 --> 24:01.880
And finally, this 5% is aspirational. It's okay to work 1%, 2%, but the focus of the

24:02.680 --> 24:09.480
FIFO Reputure Initiative is to contribute back to the project. This is the key point.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.960
And now I am going to read your questions.

24:21.240 --> 24:29.320
How do you manage the specification of what should be done because there is a huge list of

24:29.320 --> 24:35.960
things waiting to be fixed, and how do you manage the priorities and the specification?

24:36.680 --> 24:45.400
Okay. He asked me how we manage the priorities of the work we do. Of course, if we have a book in

24:45.400 --> 24:51.560
production of things like this, this is the priority of the work, but then we have weekly

24:51.560 --> 25:02.600
meetings to focus on the work for this week. And we have a three-year plan to work on the...

25:03.720 --> 25:10.520
I'm talking about my team, the Polygos team. We have a three-year plan to work on this.

25:11.880 --> 25:19.640
Okay. And of course, we share all this work with the community using a post. For example, when we

25:19.640 --> 25:28.840
want to work on new initiative, we talk about this internally. And then we write a post to

25:28.840 --> 25:35.800
share this with the community, get feedback, and develop it or don't develop it. For example,

25:36.920 --> 25:44.120
a few months ago, we realized that we have a very high queue of translations. And when I said a very

25:44.440 --> 25:51.400
high queue, we have some language with half a million of strings to review. Okay. So it's

25:51.400 --> 26:01.000
impossible to review by hand. So we talk internally that it will be interesting to use the AI to review

26:01.000 --> 26:10.360
these queues. We write a P2, it's a post to share this information with the community,

26:10.360 --> 26:16.520
and get feedback. And the community said, no, we don't want... we don't need this AI review. So

26:16.520 --> 26:19.080
we stop this development. Okay.

26:19.080 --> 26:19.800
Okay.

26:20.200 --> 26:20.520
Okay.

26:20.520 --> 26:31.240
Who can you manage that the specification are made at first in a way that could be useful to other

26:31.240 --> 26:41.560
people? And of course, people may have an additional liar to pick local question, dedicated

26:41.640 --> 26:50.440
to local question. So how to manage that generic aspect of usability by others?

26:50.440 --> 26:58.440
Okay. He asked me how we manage these specifications from our customers. I work in the

26:58.440 --> 27:06.200
Polyglos team. Our customers are the open source contributors that made the translations. Okay.

27:06.200 --> 27:14.360
This is very important to know. So we try to do all our work in public, in GitHub

27:14.360 --> 27:28.360
use issues, in GitHub docs, and so on, and in post. So we try to discuss all this in public

27:28.360 --> 27:37.560
and get the feedback from them with the 10,000 feet level of specifications. Okay. So we want

27:37.560 --> 27:46.120
this, we don't want this, and when we are working on the developing, we share with them some

27:46.120 --> 27:51.240
skin shows and things like this to get feedback from them. But it's important to know that our

27:51.560 --> 27:59.480
customers, our hints are the open source contributors. People that are using their free

27:59.480 --> 28:07.800
time trying to translate work to their own language. Okay. This is my current situation

28:07.800 --> 28:09.880
that I'm working on this particular team. Yeah.

28:09.880 --> 28:18.360
So it's really intriguing to see. So a lot of open source projects track after the fact

28:18.440 --> 28:23.960
how people contributed. But I think the specialty about the fight for the future is that people

28:23.960 --> 28:32.120
pledge and they set up an entirely different psychological motivation. Did you do any tracking

28:32.120 --> 28:38.040
of whether that, how that changed contribution metrics or not the trajectory or anything?

28:39.720 --> 28:46.600
He asked me if we have any metrics around the change between the, when we activate the pledge

28:46.680 --> 28:53.960
for the hours each contributor is working on. We don't have this data. In fact, it's an honor code

28:53.960 --> 29:00.200
contribution. So you can pledge for 40 hours each week. And if you don't do anything work,

29:00.200 --> 29:05.480
you don't have the police say, hey, you pledge 40 hours and you do any work.

29:06.040 --> 29:11.320
I don't mean that that per person tracking, but I mean that before the fight for the future program

29:12.200 --> 29:20.760
for the future program in general, and before and after how it changed that contribution dynamic.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.640
No, we don't have any data.

29:27.320 --> 29:32.440
Somebody started to work on this. So we've got somebody who's actually currently trying to prove

29:32.440 --> 29:39.160
that fact that they're working. So there will be more exploring. I can connect with a person

29:39.640 --> 29:45.640
I can definitely see that it probably proved. Yeah, it probably like it's two times or three times.

29:45.640 --> 29:50.120
You probably have an impressive number of the end because it probably helped.

29:55.080 --> 30:01.160
I'm sure we have increased the number or in that we don't have this. We don't have these numbers.

30:01.880 --> 30:11.960
Yeah. So in the spirit of the joined open source forces here for others

30:16.760 --> 30:17.080
Sorry.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.920
In the spirit of the joined open source

30:23.400 --> 30:29.080
open website alliance here for other CMS communities who are looking to improve their

30:29.080 --> 30:35.000
contributions from individual developers or from corporations. Yeah. Do you have since you've

30:35.000 --> 30:39.880
been doing this for 10 years with the fight for the future, do you have any things that you would

30:39.880 --> 30:45.000
do differently if you were to start to deliver it fresh? Wow.

30:47.560 --> 30:53.960
This is a very good question. She asked me if we start now from scratch if we change anything.

30:54.200 --> 30:58.600
I'm not sure because I'm not working this

30:59.320 --> 31:05.560
542 future program, but I'm not involved in the people in the team that

31:08.040 --> 31:18.040
work to manage all this project. Mainly, I will start getting data from the first day.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.280
This I think this is a very key point because now for example we have

31:26.280 --> 31:33.880
data like the number of transitions you did, the PRs you add, you comment, you close, things like

31:33.880 --> 31:38.520
this, but we don't for example if you are a designer it's hard to track your work.

31:39.640 --> 31:43.960
So I think we can have a lot of work to improve this.

31:44.920 --> 31:45.480
Thank you.

31:47.160 --> 31:51.480
The concept of peer pressure is something that could be more incorporated or

31:52.840 --> 31:58.680
made a bit easier. Who's like free loader and have like not just one company that's pointed

31:58.680 --> 32:04.680
out but like kind of make it a yeah you're not very nice to the community.

32:04.920 --> 32:16.280
I'll step close to the microphone because I'm allowed, but I would contend that negative peer

32:16.280 --> 32:23.400
pressure, it feels really dangerous and in the spirit of being constructive, the Drupal communities

32:23.400 --> 32:29.800
tried several versions of rewarding contribution and contribution credits through pushing people's

32:30.680 --> 32:37.080
appearances, list positions in searches and so on which has also resulted in a lot of gaming

32:37.080 --> 32:43.320
contributions into how many poll requests can I break something into. So humans are humans,

32:44.840 --> 32:48.520
but I think given everything else going on in the world we should encourage

32:49.240 --> 32:51.800
positive encouragements rather than you know.

32:52.760 --> 32:57.400
What I mean is mostly like fake pledges for somebody wants to go to the top by pledging a lot

32:57.400 --> 33:03.720
and then that other people can assure that the pledging conforms to what they actually do.

33:03.720 --> 33:10.360
For sure, for sure that I mean and as a marketer I'll admit it you know numbers are way better than

33:11.160 --> 33:15.560
like we have to know what the effect is right because at some point we have to know

33:15.880 --> 33:21.800
if what we are spending money on is producing anything like the result that we want.

33:25.800 --> 33:33.320
The gamification approach is very tricky because currently we are creating a new feature to be

33:33.320 --> 33:45.800
able to create transition events and when we are trying to create the functionalities we

33:45.800 --> 33:51.480
get a lot of gamification that the end user can do this to be in the top of the list. So

33:51.480 --> 33:56.680
this is very, very tricky and we know that we have some users, very active users that are going to

33:56.680 --> 34:00.600
try to gamify the solution. Yeah.

34:04.760 --> 34:05.640
Right.
