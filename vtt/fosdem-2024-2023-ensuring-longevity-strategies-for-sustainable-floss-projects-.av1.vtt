00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Good afternoon.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.000
As you've been introduced to, I'm Cecilia Maundo.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
I'm a community mobilizer and sustainability coordinator with

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
inter-news. And we are talking about longevity

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
strategies for sustainable flows project. And I'm going to give this

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
moment to Skylar to talk a little bit about the sustain project that we are working on

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
with inter-news.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.000
Hi everyone, my name is Skylar and I'm part of the sustain team at

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
inter-news. Inter-news is an international NGO based in the US that

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
focuses primarily on independent media support.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.000
And we believe that information saves lives and through that

00:47.000 --> 00:52.000
it's important to have a free and open internet and a resilient internet.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
And so we're on the internet freedom and resilience team.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
And sustain is a two-year project that focuses on the sustainability

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
of free and open source tools and sustainability through a holistic

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
approach. So looking at community building and financial sustainability

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
and marketing and visibility and not just technical sustainability.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
And I think that's really important.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
And yes, Cecilia here is going to talk a bunch about the work that we're doing

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
and the cohort that we support as well.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
So Cecilia.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
Thank you so much. We are supporting a cohort of six teams.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.000
Some of them are the audience. The six teams are Teller,

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
Bayonet, there is OpenWisp, there is Save by Open

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Archive, there is Onion Share. So we are talking about sustainability.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.000
First of all, let's talk about the importance of open source tools.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.000
There are so many things when you talk about open source tools,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
but one thing that comes into mind is the issue of transparency and security.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
We are living in a world of authoritarian regime.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
We are living in a world where journalists are not safe doing their work.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
We are living in a world where human rights activists are not safe.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
And one of the things that open source tool does, it gives them the liberty

02:12.000 --> 02:18.000
and the opportunity to be able to keep their information safe

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
and be able to do their job. So one of the most important things about open source tools

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
is transparency and security.

02:25.000 --> 02:30.000
So when we talk about sustainability, the first thing that comes into mind is funding.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
Most of the open source tools are run by volunteers and we know that

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
not everyone also has the opportunity to volunteer and also volunteership will not pay the bills.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
So how can we be able, how can we come up with a plan that can be able to sustain them,

02:46.000 --> 02:52.000
a plan that they can be able to make money and be able to run these tools for years to come.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
So one of the ways is funding and there are so many ways when it comes to funding.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
We know funding is a very thorny issue.

02:59.000 --> 03:04.000
So one of the things we talk about is crowdsourcing, we talk about donation.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Sustained project is funded by DRL, which is the State Department

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
and it's a collaboration of Code for Science and Society

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
and Guardian Project who are here in the audience.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
So we also talk about community engagement.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
If there's anything that keeps open source tools going is community.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Community is the backbone of open source tools.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
We know there's a lot of the issue of volunteership.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
So how do we make the community more interested in open source tools?

03:37.000 --> 03:43.000
How do we make the community know that they can be able to take part in maintaining of open source tools?

03:43.000 --> 03:49.000
And one way is active communication channels, getting in new contributors.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
And when you get in new contributors also there is the issue of, is there interest in this tool?

03:54.000 --> 03:59.000
For example, there is the issue of, let's say, let me give an example of TELA,

03:59.000 --> 04:04.000
which is a tool whereby you can document your information in a safe way.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
So when you talk about that as a journalist myself,

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
I can take part in being part of the community of TELA because I know it is helping my fellow journalist and myself.

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
So how do we create a thriving community when it comes to open source tools?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I'm just looking at this buzzer.

04:18.000 --> 04:24.000
So the issue of also governance, we need to establish a clear governance when it comes to the structure

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
because most of the open source tools, as I said, is just a group of people who come up with an idea

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
and now they want to make the idea work.

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
So also out of that idea, for that idea to work, they must be very, very clear structure.

04:36.000 --> 04:43.000
And that is one of those also a very thorny issue because you've come together, there is no money, and you also need a structure.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
So we ensure that decision making processes are transparent and fair.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
And then also regular maintenance, regular maintenance of the open source tool.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
When you look at end users, their needs change with each coming day.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
You know, our needs are not what we had last year or two years ago.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
We looked, for example, when you look at the pandemic, things took a different time.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
So there is also the need of regular maintenance when it comes to these open source tools.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
And I know what comes into your mind. There is also money that is needed. Yes.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
And that's why we talked about funding, also expanding our funding pool.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
One of the advice that one of the tools was given is you can be able to offer consultancy service

05:25.000 --> 05:31.000
and that can be a way of also making money coming in and also assigning roles for maintenance and task

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
and addressing the most needy issue at that time.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
So as I come to the end of this lightning talk, which I'm very excited because I'm a bit nervous as you can tell.

05:43.000 --> 05:50.000
So for us to ensure that there is a longevity of open source tools, it requires a multifaceted approach.

05:50.000 --> 05:57.000
It requires a holistic approach just as as Kala said, we are doing in sustain.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Everyone needs to come on board to be able to know how we can be able to maintain open source tools

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
and also addressing the issue of funding because that is the word we've been hearing since we started the project.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.000
Funding, funding, funding, funding. And also when we talk about funding, yes, you can get funding for one year,

06:13.000 --> 06:17.000
but how can we be able to get funding that is long term for about five years

06:17.000 --> 06:25.000
because when you get funding for about five years, then you know you have the luxury of being able to put everything in place

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
by the time the five year end and also we talked about the issue of governance.

06:29.000 --> 06:34.000
How can you be able to put structures in place that can flow down and make this to work?

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
We also talked about maintenance.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
Yes, any question? I only have an opportunity for one question.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Yeah, because I'm looking at this clock.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
Well, well, well. So I'm assuming there's no question.

06:53.000 --> 07:05.000
Please, we will upload the presentation on this platform and also you will be able to get our emails

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
in case you want to know more about the sustained project.

07:08.000 --> 07:13.000
Sustaining is sustaining safety tools with analytics, insights and networking.

07:13.000 --> 07:20.000
You can be able to contact us as we said is a project by internews and we are working with six tool teams

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
to be able to create a sustainability action plan whereby these tools can be able to maintain

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
their self even after the project that is done.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
So thank you so much.

07:38.000 --> 07:46.000
We also included our guide for sustainability tools or sustainability for open source tools

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
and little leaflets on the side of the stage and up here as well.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
If you're interested in learning more about the strategies that Cecilia talked about. Thank you.
