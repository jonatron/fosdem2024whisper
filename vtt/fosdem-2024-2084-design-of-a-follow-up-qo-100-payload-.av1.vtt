00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Good morning, all. My name is Frank. I'm working at the satellite communications group of

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
ESA, the European Space Agency, in the technical centre. And we have a presentation here. It's

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
not extremely technical. It's only, it would like to explain a few initiatives we are

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
embarking on. And that is in the area of maybe future amateur satellite payloads which are

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
hosted on satellites for experiments. It's maybe not so known, but let's say we work quite a lot

00:39.000 --> 00:46.000
in commercial communications, satellite communications with companies in Europe. And we finance and

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
co-finance various projects. But it should not be forgotten, we think, that many of the innovations

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
that came to the world of satellite communications are actually coming very often from the amateur

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
satellite communication world. A lot of work has been done and that has now spined off in commercial

01:03.000 --> 01:10.000
applications. And we gave here a few examples of things that where the satellite communication was

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
always first. They have been flying the CMOS chips, for example, the first time in the world on their

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
satellites. They're the ones who made maybe the first inter-satellite links. And there have been also

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
companies, for example, SSTL, that started with building a few CubeSubs in Surrey University and

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
slowly became basically a larger satellite company. So that is all heritage from the amateur

01:36.000 --> 01:42.000
satellite world. Also what is quite interesting is that the amateur satellite world flew the first

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
GPS receiver at very high altitudes, even up to high elliptical orbit. So these are all, I think, quite nice

01:50.000 --> 01:59.000
achievements of the amateur world. At the ISA site, we would like to maybe support initiative that at least

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
thinks of future amateur satellite payloads on future satellites. And we explain a few things on that.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
And that is specifically also related to the payload which is currently on a geostationary

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
satellite. It's called Q100. Maybe not everybody is familiar with that, but it's a very nice payload which

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
for the first time is hosted on a geostationary satellite. So it's always above you. You can find

02:25.000 --> 02:33.000
there excellent videos explaining how to handle that satellite and to how to build up with low cost

02:33.000 --> 02:42.000
such communication over those satellites. Let me explain just to get a quick idea. This is the footprint of that

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
payload which is on a geostationary satellite. So it travels with the same speed at the Earth, so let's say

02:49.000 --> 02:58.000
virtually it's always above you. And this is a very large commercial satellite, hundreds of millions, but on that

02:58.000 --> 03:08.000
there is a small payload with hand-handle amateur communication in S-band and the lower KU band. And the beauty, I think,

03:08.000 --> 03:17.000
of this is also that this is enabled because it is the basically reuse of existing costs. Let's see, existing 2.4

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
gigahertz amplifiers, the modification of low noise blocks that you use for normal television for, let's say,

03:24.000 --> 03:31.000
maybe 10 and even less zero, and you modify them and then you can use this satellite. So with relatively low cost

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
you can communicate with the satellite. And this satellite payload, and there is a lot of actually, in particular,

03:37.000 --> 03:44.000
German amateur radio and also UK amateur enthusiasts who have been instrumental in getting, let's say,

03:44.000 --> 03:53.000
community working over this payload on the ASEALSAT 2, which is the name of the commercial satellite.

03:53.000 --> 04:00.000
This was the first time that radio amateur satellites were also able to have a, let's say, more continuous communication

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
between each other. And you can see here the footprint. Let's take the green and the red line there, that is linked to

04:07.000 --> 04:15.000
how, what kind of elevation you need for the antenna. But this goes from Brazil to Indonesia. So you can have, say,

04:15.000 --> 04:24.000
in a single hop, basically, a user from Brazil could communicate with a user in Indonesia. So there is enormous potential

04:24.000 --> 04:33.000
there too for all kind of experiments. And this has also led to more broadcasting using standards like DVPS2, which is

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
very active at the moment in Q100, where, let's say, new technologies went into the amateur domain and the amateur

04:40.000 --> 04:49.000
domain is now making very nice open source implementations of mini tuner and all various DVPS2 equipment. That is something

04:49.000 --> 04:57.000
we would like to support. But how do we support that? Now, a longer time ago, these processes do not go that fast,

04:57.000 --> 05:05.000
unfortunately. We wrote a letter to IARU, the International Amateur Radio Union, from where, I think, Sylvain is one of the

05:05.000 --> 05:14.000
bosses, I would say, divided in various regions of the world. We wrote there, or we say, stimulated the letter, say,

05:14.000 --> 05:23.000
an IARU basically asked, Isa, could you not help? We need to think at least maybe of a follow-up of Q100. We asked that,

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
as you probably know, we are publicly funded, so the various countries want to have their say. Everybody did their

05:30.000 --> 05:39.000
say, say, that's okay. Here, you have some funding. So we have funding to start that process, and that funding is meant to

05:39.000 --> 05:47.000
collect requirements and also make a few prototypes, maybe. Basically, it will not be enough basically to host a

05:47.000 --> 05:54.000
satellite or a payload on a satellite. That will be not possible. We have to look for other funding mechanisms for that later,

05:54.000 --> 06:02.000
but we'll come to that later. So what we will be doing is to identify requirements of all the people in Europe and Canada.

06:02.000 --> 06:12.000
Canada is one of our member states to identify what would be good requirements to fulfill for a next geostationary payload.

06:12.000 --> 06:21.000
And back to the orbit, geostationary or other orbits, we have been heard that some people would be quite interested also to explore

06:21.000 --> 06:33.000
maybe payload in medium-Earth orbit. You can imagine that also then you have a longer contact time, and it still has a bit like a global attractiveness.

06:33.000 --> 06:42.000
We are considering that because there might be various institutional initiatives starting soon where there could be hosting opportunities for small

06:42.000 --> 06:52.000
payloads on medium-Earth orbit. So we will be looking at various further and amateur community that process will start very soon.

06:52.000 --> 07:01.000
We already requested a few inputs, and we still have to process all that, and we will then talk to the various satellite operators to see how we

07:01.000 --> 07:10.000
could accommodate then a payload and how soon to get the funding for that. So the first idea we heard already that is a few people will be

07:10.000 --> 07:20.000
very interested in, let's say, keep it simple. Actually the payload which is currently on as-heel-sub is, it is fantastic that it's there, but functionally you could say it's rather simple.

07:20.000 --> 07:30.000
It's an analog transponder, what you go up in whatever modulation you use, that comes down. And many people like that also because that means a lot of

07:30.000 --> 07:41.000
experience maybe at the modulation level, more deep down RF level. There is also a whole community that comes more from the, yeah, that has been raised with SDRs,

07:41.000 --> 07:50.000
let's say, starting more at that level. There is a whole community that is more working at the, let's say, the IP level and even higher in the amateur world.

07:50.000 --> 08:03.000
And we have to find a bit the balance from maybe simple payload designs to maybe something which is really more complicated. And you can imagine also in the amateur world there are

08:03.000 --> 08:15.000
communities that are going up and up and up in the frequency range. And in the amateur community we have 24 gigahertz, we have up to 77 gigahertz, which we all could use for

08:15.000 --> 08:29.000
satellite. But you could imagine that going higher up in frequency also means that possibly have narrower beams. And for the other hand you would also like maybe that the satellite community is served by,

08:30.000 --> 08:44.000
let's say, more in a larger scale. If we have one very nice spot beam in e-band, let's say in 76, 77 gigahertz, yeah, that will serve probably one country that is not so, I think, inclusive, I would say.

08:44.000 --> 08:54.000
So there's a few balances there to be made. But it would be quite nice in some way to come to a combination that already some people have suggested where we have an analog transponder.

08:54.000 --> 09:07.000
And actually what you would like maybe is to have in geo-arbit the basically the ultimate Linux brick with everything around it. And then everything can do, everybody can do what he wants.

09:07.000 --> 09:22.000
The only also here the disadvantage is again that if we put something like this on board, then we get a certain degree of centralizing things. You need a cis-atmine for this satellite basically.

09:22.000 --> 09:34.000
And that is not always to the likening also of the amateur community. One likes sometimes a certain degree of chaos, let's say, and anarchism and so on. That it should not be too regulated.

09:34.000 --> 09:49.000
So also that is a bit of a balance to be made. But we have various IDs to put it also a bit more in the 5G area where maybe CUDU, certain splits in the whole 5G architectures could be partly put on board.

09:49.000 --> 10:04.000
Because many, many people, even in the amateur world, start to look also at various communications based on 5G, non-NTN, non-trivial network. So very straight-offs to be made.

10:05.000 --> 10:19.000
We listed here a few of those and we will now start a larger consultation on all those topics. Back again to let's pick a few, let's say the attractiveness of future user terminals.

10:19.000 --> 10:39.000
Like the example here, previously of the ground-based SAAG, 6,000 euros, in this case the opportunity of some taxpayers' money. What is acceptable later on for radio amateur? If we go to the 77 GHz, maybe we can use automotive radar hacks and so on.

10:40.000 --> 10:52.000
That needs all to come together. So we would like to request later on in a more structured way input from the amateur community, but also taking into account all these factors.

10:52.000 --> 11:06.000
Because it's no sense proposing something where not a lot of amateurs can benefit from. So that we are currently starting and we will show you a little bit what we will be doing in the next month.

11:06.000 --> 11:21.000
I will not go into detail of the planning, but what we now are going to do, we are talking already a very small group to get a bit of a sense what we should do and also in particular what ESA should not do.

11:22.000 --> 11:36.000
Because some things are far better left to the amateur community. We prepare a bit like a consultation, we talk to the amateur community and we also talk to a number of, let's say, people who would likely build such a payload.

11:36.000 --> 11:54.000
It is however fun that would be, it is not so likely that the amateur community would build such a payload themselves. A geostationary operator with a 300 million satellite would like to know what he hosts as the few kilos extra.

11:54.000 --> 12:05.000
And that is not so likely that he will accept that that is built by amateurs. How good they are also with all respect, he will not accept it and his insurance company will not accept it.

12:05.000 --> 12:23.000
And what we would organize in May is a day in Aztec also with support from our technical people to discuss a few options. Start prototyping, we have the funding for that to prototype a bit what some people call like a flat shot.

12:24.000 --> 12:40.000
So it's the model of the satellite but you basically put it on a table. And we would like actually to have a few IDs ready in September. September there is always a very large satellite conference where all the satellite operators are and we are making there the appointments.

12:40.000 --> 12:58.000
And we will also pitch this to satellite operators as a bit like, let's say as a good thing. Many people complain in the satellite world about the lack of people that understand RF. That is a real lack.

12:59.000 --> 13:17.000
A lot of people, there's a lot of programmatic but there's not so many people that can really understand RF. And also I think satellite operators could take a bit of responsibility to and also the industry maybe to stimulate that the young people start to understand satellite communications.

13:17.000 --> 13:23.000
That is at least also one of our objectives to get more people enthusiastic about satellite communications.

13:24.000 --> 13:41.000
So we hope in May we will advertise that lately. May or June we will see a little bit on availability to organize a day to go through a number of payload designs.

13:41.000 --> 13:56.000
And we're also trying to get some travel reimbursements and so on in place so that people could come to us. And hopefully in September we discuss a few things with satellite operators and even better.

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
We hope that maybe the outcome of such a discussion could be discussed at a next, force them hopefully next year.

14:04.000 --> 14:12.000
I think that's it from our side. You'll hear more from us. And as said, it's not such a technical talk. It's a process we're starting.

14:13.000 --> 14:24.000
All your technical inputs from the AMSATS, the amateur satellite organizations in the various countries which we are approaching already but also individually would be highly appreciated.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
That's it. Thank you very much.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Thank you Frank. I have one or two questions.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Please.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.000
Is there any for phase airing or beef steering or is it way too expensive for such channels?

14:47.000 --> 14:54.000
Yeah, that would be indeed very nice. Of course, if we look at the, let's take first phase array on board.

14:54.000 --> 15:07.000
Yeah, of course that will then be highly dependent on frequency range. Let us assume it would be an event, you know, 77 gigahertz amateur phase array.

15:08.000 --> 15:18.000
Yeah, that would be a fairly expensive thing. But I think we are also there to see where maybe certain developments could spin off further in industrial developments.

15:18.000 --> 15:27.000
So this would be a good, I only see of course again, but also a phase array. It needs a type of management then of that beam.

15:28.000 --> 15:35.000
That comes with that. And of course, it's still a challenge in development, of course, on the ground.

15:36.000 --> 15:47.000
Maybe if we take now the scenario of a medium Earth orbit where you would need pointing, then I can see there that also from the amateur community,

15:48.000 --> 15:55.000
the various YouTube videos that appear with the educational Pluto beam steering and things like that.

15:56.000 --> 16:08.000
There I see a lot of opportunities to do beam forming, to educate people on the essentials of beam farming with maybe an existing beacon that comes from the MEO.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
I think that would be excellent to do that. Yeah.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
Oh, please.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
Supporting Canada.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Sorry, X support what?

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Support Canada and obviously those elements in there.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
Yeah. Okay. The question was about the geographical thing.

16:32.000 --> 16:39.000
Canada is in. It's also part of our, let's say, ISA member status.

16:40.000 --> 16:44.000
It's called ISA funds, ISA, ISA of Canada funds, ISA.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
So we are interested to include the Canadian footprint.

16:50.000 --> 16:59.000
We have already received a bit of input on that, but we have to see because you can imagine that the orbital location of such a due station is not always.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
Yeah, we are not the one picking the orbital location.

17:03.000 --> 17:12.000
Therefore, in that respect, a medium Earth orbit hosting would of course be preferential, but again, a trade off.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
We are not. Yeah, we can't decide ourselves.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
Sorry.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Exactly. Yeah.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
We are having in ISA, there are a number of geostationary projects ongoing.

17:26.000 --> 17:33.000
We are, let's say, trying to see whether we could with some leverage, maybe to host something in the future there.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
Please.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
So one would be if you're talking about payload providers that are not amateur radio.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.000
Are you talking about the universities or only commercial partners?

17:49.000 --> 18:10.000
And then is there like a project in that is not like an ML class, ISA mission also like CubeSats that you would consider for such a like CubeSats, not from the amateur radio site, but let's say I think more commercially from a university where you could also see the situation.

18:11.000 --> 18:17.000
Yeah, on the payload provider, the question is whether the payload provider could maybe also be from university.

18:17.000 --> 18:26.000
Yeah, now I must say we have seen universities providing payloads to various mission, not always to commercial missions.

18:27.000 --> 18:36.000
And that is, I think, where the the satellite operate will always have, let's say, the last word, the last say, because that links them to the insurance and things like that.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
So unclear at the moment, I would say.

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
Then secondly, whether a payload could also be hosted on more educational missions and so on.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
I think that that is an option.

18:47.000 --> 18:57.000
The only thing is that I think there's quite a lot of amateur payloads hosted in various Oscars and so there's nothing new on low Earth orbit satellites and CubeSats and so on.

18:57.000 --> 19:10.000
That the essence would be to either to do something new in medium Earth orbit, but also advancing a bit the payload technology and what you can do with it.

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
And there there is a bit that would be the idea.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Perfect. Perfect.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
The proba missions will be also interesting for this kind of applications.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
The proba platform itself, indeed.

19:35.000 --> 19:49.000
Yeah, I do not know whether the current proba, one of the, let's say, satellite that is used in these several various scientific missions also, whether some of the orbits are always, let's say, appropriate.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
That is, of course, to be seen from a platform point of view.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
I need to see no problem.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Why not?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Why not use that?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Yeah.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
If there are normal questions.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Thanks again.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Thank you.
