WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.080
Okay, yeah, perfect. Thank you very much for the time and for the insights here.

00:19.080 --> 00:24.400
So yeah, I mean, I guess some of you were already familiar with the strategy and so on.

00:24.400 --> 00:28.960
But now that we know what it has been done, then I guess you guys have some questions,

00:28.960 --> 00:37.720
comments, and just to keep it like a custom practice now, I would like to kick it off

00:37.720 --> 00:44.800
with a question, actually. And I mean, since I read the strategy, I was kind of like struggling

00:44.800 --> 00:53.160
with this whole thing of inner-source. So I really wonder if you, now that the strategy

00:53.160 --> 00:58.200
is almost over and then you're kind of like renew it. If you think this is the direction

00:58.200 --> 01:03.600
to go, or like, you know, first of all, what do you guys mean with inner-source to put everybody

01:03.600 --> 01:08.640
on the same page? And also if this is actually the direction that the commission should be

01:08.640 --> 01:11.440
going or if you're thinking about something else.

01:11.440 --> 01:21.200
Sorry, forget the very important microphone. Inner-source is really maybe not the best label

01:21.200 --> 01:27.640
for this thing. But the goal was to make our software development, the commission has like

01:27.640 --> 01:32.680
6,000 software developers working for it at any given time, doing all kinds of projects.

01:32.680 --> 01:39.320
And some of them were in the room. And what we wanted to achieve is that on the road to

01:39.320 --> 01:44.120
making the whole thing as open-source as possible, we needed the first step. We needed to have

01:44.120 --> 01:49.480
the existing projects of which there are many realized that they needed to get ready for

01:49.480 --> 01:55.680
reuse. And you can't go to a project that's been running for 15 years or for five years

01:55.680 --> 02:00.320
and say, oh yeah, by the way, we're going to make your stuff available next year. Because

02:00.320 --> 02:04.320
these guys are like, whoa, but it's full of passwords. It's full of internal references

02:04.320 --> 02:12.000
to machines and stuff. So the code has to be matured. And so we've gone through bug bounties

02:12.000 --> 02:18.320
and hackathons internally to make sure that projects were ready to move from being, you

02:18.320 --> 02:21.800
know, in the basement with just these five people that have been working on this for

02:21.800 --> 02:27.080
10 years to being shared with the other colleagues, with the other professionals whom we can rely

02:27.080 --> 02:32.400
on not to abuse the information that is often in these systems. And the other thing that

02:32.400 --> 02:38.400
we're doing is that we're only, we're making it easy for projects to go open source as easy

02:38.400 --> 02:44.680
as we can. But we're not forcing them. If there are reasons within the team, within the DG,

02:44.680 --> 02:51.040
within the service to say, this is so niche, why should it be open source? Or this is so

02:51.040 --> 02:58.040
secretive, why should it go open source? We're not going to force them. But we already see

02:58.040 --> 03:01.400
a lot of projects going open source because most of the developers, this is where they

03:01.400 --> 03:06.560
want them to go. And they'll talk to their project managers to say, we should go from

03:06.560 --> 03:12.440
inside, we should go to Code.org Europa. So the numbers that were on the slides are very

03:12.440 --> 03:19.440
good and give us another decade. Maybe that's too slow. It might go faster.

03:19.440 --> 03:24.440
All right. Yeah. No.

03:24.440 --> 03:39.760
Hi there. My name is Romer Adams. I'm working at Red Hat. Building actually a solution for

03:39.760 --> 03:46.640
the public sector. Two quick comments. First of all, great that you discovered that there's

03:46.640 --> 03:54.520
our responsibilities with CRD, SCRA and PLD from a code perspective. So it's good. The

03:54.520 --> 03:59.200
second part is that in a source for taking this into consideration is one of the best

03:59.200 --> 04:04.920
thing you can do when you are in a very disconnected environment and you cannot share anything

04:04.920 --> 04:10.560
with outside from a security perspective because you can apply all the construct of open source

04:10.560 --> 04:15.240
to build software. And at some point when you clean everything up, you can share that

04:15.240 --> 04:22.240
with the other member states. The last part is more a question there. When we're thinking

04:22.240 --> 04:30.880
about the open source catalog that you have built, I guess we're speaking also about blueprints.

04:30.880 --> 04:38.120
Will there be any incentive for member states to get to those blueprints as a first class

04:38.120 --> 04:45.120
citizen in tenders versus trying to build something from scratch?

04:45.120 --> 04:51.960
Hot potato.

04:51.960 --> 04:52.960
Thank you.

04:53.840 --> 05:06.340
Good question. So I think the idea of reuse is warmly welcomed by almost everyone. Why

05:06.340 --> 05:13.720
would you build something twice if it's already working in municipality A? Unless it's not

05:13.720 --> 05:18.080
good enough. You could amend it, you could improve it and that's the idea of an open

05:18.080 --> 05:29.080
source solution. Alluding to your question about making it mandatory or incentivizing,

05:29.080 --> 05:35.160
it's not for the commission to do that. I think open source is by its very nature a

05:35.160 --> 05:44.400
very cooperative, open culture. So we are hoping that procurement will come on board

05:44.400 --> 05:50.960
and say, why do you want to build this? Show me that this doesn't already exist in the

05:50.960 --> 05:56.880
European catalog. So I think it'll happen eventually because it just makes financial

05:56.880 --> 06:05.880
sense. So I think that's where the solutions will become blueprints.

06:05.880 --> 06:19.360
Hi, my name is Dali Boran. I work for the commission services. So I'm a user, but I

06:19.360 --> 06:24.320
didn't work there for all my life. So I also worked as a developer in the industry in the

06:24.320 --> 06:30.280
education and coming back after several years, I saw a great progress in open source software

06:30.280 --> 06:36.200
on my computer. So thank you for that. On the other hand, as a practical user, I have

06:36.200 --> 06:41.480
problems with it because I've seen things moving in another direction. We are forced

06:41.480 --> 06:50.640
now to use the Office 365, as you know, then TMS teams for also internal and external communication,

06:50.640 --> 06:58.960
not to speak about the applications for some jobs which you can fill in the form only using

06:58.960 --> 07:04.040
Microsoft Windows or some testing for in Epsoc, which can also be done on Microsoft Windows

07:04.040 --> 07:10.440
computers. So I cannot do anything about it. I mean, I've been trying using the available

07:10.440 --> 07:17.440
open source software as much as possible, a LibreOffice, and even some other solutions.

07:17.440 --> 07:24.080
But I think you might. So I urge you, at least if not to look for some long term or radical

07:24.080 --> 07:29.600
solutions, which I would, at least not to allow this regression of the current situation,

07:29.600 --> 07:36.560
which I see coming in six months to one year. Well, depends. I mean, internally, what do

07:36.560 --> 07:40.840
you use for your team communication? Please answer that question.

07:40.840 --> 07:46.440
You need the microphone as well.

07:46.440 --> 07:57.960
We use everything, including the tools that come with the machine and when we switch it

07:57.960 --> 08:05.640
on. But we also use all the alternatives. And if you were a software developer for the

08:05.640 --> 08:12.000
commission, well, if you were, then the good news is you can have a Linux laptop at your

08:12.000 --> 08:21.080
disposal and running Ubuntu mostly. And this, yeah, we're, you know, we see that pain point,

08:21.080 --> 08:25.920
but I can already tell you that the OSPO is not there to make that switch. What we can

08:25.920 --> 08:32.400
do is translate the demand from our users, which includes you to say, look, there is

08:32.400 --> 08:36.920
a need for an alternative. And there's many teams that interact with the outside world

08:36.920 --> 08:42.960
that cannot use MS teams. There are many teams and projects of people working on legislation,

08:42.960 --> 08:49.800
in fact, they're asking us, do you have anything because I cannot use Office 3, whatever? It

08:49.800 --> 08:54.760
won't work. And so with them, we're trying to figure out what's the next thing we put

08:54.760 --> 08:59.400
in our lab and how can we make it accessible to legislators in the member states so that

08:59.400 --> 09:06.200
they can work on the next generation of laws. So we're trying to find ways to do this.

09:06.960 --> 09:14.400
I wish we could show a lot of progress. I think it'll take a bit of time because, yeah, it's

09:14.400 --> 09:16.280
in place.

09:16.280 --> 09:23.320
Yeah. So I think the first thing to say is that we absolutely acknowledge what you're

09:23.320 --> 09:30.560
saying. That's the truth. Right? Now, the question is how do we solve it? It's a collective

09:30.640 --> 09:39.800
we as crisis outlined as the Ospo we are doing things like using some of the labs and some

09:39.800 --> 09:45.800
of the other mechanisms, right? We're pushing open source. So there's another movement,

09:45.800 --> 09:52.800
right? Open source is expanding throughout the commission and its awareness is benefits.

09:52.880 --> 10:00.880
And yet there is an entrenched Microsoft culture. So I think we it'll just it's a question

10:00.880 --> 10:07.880
of time and it's a question of continuing to pass on the messages that you're mentioning.

10:08.560 --> 10:14.480
And we do that as the Ospo. So I think that's the answer. Sorry.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.640
It has to change. I agree. The best moment to start that change is now and we're trying

10:18.640 --> 10:20.040
to bring those experiments.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.040
Exactly. We're doing something what we can.

10:23.040 --> 10:30.040
I'm sorry. I would say let's go for a question and then maybe you can.

10:32.280 --> 10:37.680
So well, thank you. But unfortunately, regression is going the other direction. And unfortunately,

10:37.680 --> 10:44.680
it consumes more work time. It consumes more money, bandwidth, energy, so it's not compatible

10:45.680 --> 10:50.680
with Green Deal. And also, please think about this. If we would have, you know, an open source

10:50.680 --> 10:56.680
working environment for all the administration in Europe and for the politicians, maybe they

10:56.680 --> 11:01.680
would think differently and then support the open source more.

11:01.680 --> 11:05.680
Okay. I agree. And then I take command from that again.

11:05.680 --> 11:08.680
No, no. I always say it's a question here.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.680
Okay.

11:19.680 --> 11:26.680
Yeah. My name's Ingen and I'm just a citizen. I was trying. I'm trying to put this question

11:26.680 --> 11:33.680
somewhere. I'm not sure whether it fits. But why we were busy with CRA, another regulation

11:33.680 --> 11:40.680
sailed by which has implemented, which implicates maybe problem for open source, which is the

11:41.680 --> 11:54.680
European ID. So A does. And how can we assure that this European ID will work on open source systems

11:55.680 --> 12:02.680
of all kinds? So on free smart, free androids on Sailfish, on Linux smartphones, on Linux

12:02.680 --> 12:11.680
desktops and everywhere. And how can we ensure that the ID application itself is open source,

12:11.680 --> 12:17.680
which I think is mandatory for a fundamental thing like this?

12:17.680 --> 12:20.680
That's not about.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.680
You want to leave the room now? No.

12:23.680 --> 12:29.680
I can get part of the answer. And I'm going to look in a few other things, if you don't mind.

12:29.680 --> 12:34.680
Because there's so much going on. And as I was trying to say, there are good developments

12:34.680 --> 12:39.680
happening in Europe. And I want to first acknowledge there's a circle on this diagram, and I put it

12:39.680 --> 12:47.680
back online. These are the OSPOs in the member states. And four of them are in the room. Five of them

12:48.680 --> 12:56.680
a few minutes ago. And we're working with these peers to figure out, A, the citizen interaction.

12:56.680 --> 13:01.680
I think that's a, it's clear that we need to, this is a goal for us, a task for us that we didn't

13:01.680 --> 13:10.680
identify three, five years ago. And about the commission is doing a lot of open source reference

13:10.680 --> 13:17.680
implementations. So when we, when there is a big regulation like this, like A does, for example, there is an

13:17.680 --> 13:23.680
open source reference implementation. I do not know if that one would immediately run on your mobile phone,

13:23.680 --> 13:30.680
but it will run on a Linux machine. That's what it was made on. It was made for it. And this is also

13:30.680 --> 13:35.680
how we help the member states test their implementations because they can either use the reference

13:35.680 --> 13:40.680
implementation and install that, or they can test theirs against our reference implementation. And we do this

13:40.680 --> 13:49.680
with many other tools. So you'd be surprised to find commission, commissioned, sorry for the strange

13:49.680 --> 13:54.680
formulation there, but software built for the commission, either by software developers working directly

13:54.680 --> 14:00.680
for the commission or through companies that are in industry everywhere. If you do an import, export

14:00.680 --> 14:06.680
decoration these days, you're touching software that is made available as open source and built through the

14:06.680 --> 14:13.680
European commission. If you're in the steel industry, you're most likely doing things that is done with

14:13.680 --> 14:20.680
open source commissioned by the commission. If you're doing e signatures, it's most likely using open source

14:20.680 --> 14:27.680
libraries that were developed as open source through the commission. So this is one of the good things that is

14:27.680 --> 14:33.680
happening. And then I would just like to point out that the OSPOS are doing good stuff in the member states too,

14:33.680 --> 14:37.680
and we're trying to build a network that reinforces itself.

14:39.680 --> 14:43.680
So let's take two more questions because we're running out of time.

14:44.680 --> 14:48.680
Can we get the OSPOS to stand up just so we know who they are?

15:02.680 --> 15:09.680
Thank you for the great talk. And we spoke a lot about infrastructure and tools, which are very important.

15:10.680 --> 15:19.680
But is there a European wide plan to somehow replace Mastercard and Visa? These are essentially payment clearing systems,

15:19.680 --> 15:27.680
and these are leaking hundreds of billions of euros worth of economic value out of the thing. If there could be an open

15:27.680 --> 15:35.680
source trustworthy solution built into it, which every bank issues to retail people, that would be great.

15:40.680 --> 15:41.680
Wonderful.

15:58.680 --> 16:05.680
I think that's the answer. We're not the right people. And these are very large initiatives. There are many, many

16:05.680 --> 16:12.680
large things that could be done. We are working at the grassroots level in terms of open source, propagation of open

16:12.680 --> 16:19.680
source internally and connecting with OSPOS externally, and doing projects like FOSCEPS.

16:19.680 --> 16:25.680
And check out the NGI funding framework because there are super interesting projects on this topic too.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.680
Okay, so one last question.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.680
Thank you.

16:39.680 --> 16:48.680
Hi, Paolo Vecchi, board member of the Document Foundation. Well, I would like to say thank you guys,

16:48.680 --> 16:55.680
or the OSPOS team, or the European Commission, which is now 150 people. I think most of it is in this room.

16:56.680 --> 17:10.680
And, well, a handful of it, because I actually seen the progression of what has been going on in, well, lately, and you did a very good job.

17:10.680 --> 17:22.680
In a way, you said that, I think you commented that probably is not your job yet, maybe, also to promote some open source platform within,

17:22.680 --> 17:28.680
maybe the European Commission, or just part of the way the users will see mostly.

17:28.680 --> 17:35.680
So we have an example of LibreOffice, or maybe also Linus Texop, or something like that.

17:35.680 --> 17:43.680
I suppose that that probably is going to become one of your tasks later on, maybe when you're going to be more structured.

17:43.680 --> 17:51.680
But in a way, I hope that we're going to get to a point where the European Commission actually is going to be the example for the rest of Europe,

17:51.680 --> 18:02.680
where an organization that manages enough people to fill a small town will show how to do things, how to implement open source,

18:02.680 --> 18:08.680
so that for a small town to nations, actually going to be able to do it quite easily.

18:08.680 --> 18:17.680
And another thing regarding, well, something that I'm very biased about, LibreOffice, there's been a bit of an effort,

18:17.680 --> 18:25.680
a lot of effort in trying to get LibreOffice updated in the Catalog application, the European Commission.

18:25.680 --> 18:29.680
It is there, at least, so in theory, it should be able to install that quite easily.

18:29.680 --> 18:36.680
And it would be nice to have more feedback and see how many other open source applications you would like to see on your desktop,

18:36.680 --> 18:42.680
so that the rest of the community can say, there guys at the European Commission, can you please add this one,

18:42.680 --> 18:46.680
because it actually makes sense and we help other people switch into open source.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.680
That is a collective effort. Thanks.

18:52.680 --> 18:57.680
Okay, perfect. So any comments on there? Should we wrap up?

18:57.680 --> 18:58.680
Yeah, we can wrap up.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.680
Okay.

18:59.680 --> 19:03.680
I'd just like to tell you that LibreOffice is on the Commission's laptop, so...

19:03.680 --> 19:11.680
Yeah, I think the general answer is the small army that can fill a town is already using open source, right?

19:11.680 --> 19:18.680
That's why open source is on our list of software to use, officially.

19:18.680 --> 19:24.680
So it's a lot more usage than we... that might be visible, right?

19:24.680 --> 19:29.680
But sometimes the external tools like teams and things and word...

19:29.680 --> 19:34.680
We have to connect with everybody in the Commission, right? So it's increasing. Thank you.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.680
Okay, perfect. I'm sorry, we need the microphone.

19:38.680 --> 19:44.680
Okay, so now we're going to have a wrap up from the repertoire on the inside's inputs that we got.

19:44.680 --> 19:48.680
Thank you very much, everybody. But let's take around five minutes.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.680
Only five minutes and then you can go.
