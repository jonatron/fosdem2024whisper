So we're doing gathering in Funky Monkey under this address.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.560
So if you know 3MDep and what kind of part

00:11.560 --> 00:14.040
is we doing for 12 hours on V-PAPS,

00:14.040 --> 00:16.160
then you know what we can do.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.960
And if you are willing to bear with us

00:18.960 --> 00:20.200
talking about the firmware,

00:20.200 --> 00:22.400
talking about trustworthiness,

00:22.400 --> 00:24.720
talking about TPM, secure boot,

00:24.720 --> 00:27.400
whatever was part of this dev room,

00:27.400 --> 00:29.800
you are invited, feel free to join.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.720
And I guess that's it from me.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.800
And thank you very much for surviving to the end.

00:34.800 --> 00:35.800
Thank you.
