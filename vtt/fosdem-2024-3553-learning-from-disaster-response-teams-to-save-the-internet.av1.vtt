00:00.000 --> 00:11.800
Hi, everyone. It is great to be here. Thank you for coming to this talk. If you're here

00:11.800 --> 00:17.700
for the magic show, I'm afraid you have 30 minutes to wait. I'm here to guide us in an

00:17.700 --> 00:23.360
exploration of what we as a community, as open source practitioners, can learn from some

00:23.360 --> 00:29.680
of the most finely tuned and highly performant teams in the world. First responders. Through

00:29.680 --> 00:36.040
the interdisciplinary lens of social network science. So perhaps there is some magic in

00:36.040 --> 00:43.720
this talk. The magic of people working together. My name is Hannah Aubrey. I lead fast forward

00:43.720 --> 00:51.400
at Fastly. Let's save the Internet. In a past life, I was lucky to serve as a study coordinator

00:51.400 --> 00:58.400
of Sonic. No, not the one with the roller skates and the hamburgers. Dang, I knew that

00:58.400 --> 01:04.520
joke wouldn't play in the EU. The science of networks and communities research group. Sonic

01:04.520 --> 01:09.400
advances social network theories, methods and tools to better understand and meet the needs of

01:09.400 --> 01:14.680
diverse communities. They develop cutting edge techniques to study and improve social and

01:14.680 --> 01:20.560
knowledge networks and distributed working groups, online communities, virtual teams, and other

01:20.560 --> 01:27.240
large communities like the one we're all in. I am thrilled and a little bit washing to share that

01:27.280 --> 01:33.480
with the director of Sonic. Professor Nasheer Contractor is here in the audience today. Thank

01:33.480 --> 01:38.920
you for coming, Nash. And my dear friends, if you have any tough questions, please direct them at him.

01:38.920 --> 01:47.600
Let's start with a history reminder. Our earliest ancestors not only had to contend with the same

01:47.600 --> 01:54.840
natural disasters we experienced today, they also had to adapt and survive to nature itself. First,

01:54.920 --> 02:01.040
we became bipedal, freeing our hands to reach and to grasp and also to communicate simply with

02:01.040 --> 02:08.040
each other. Next, we developed complex brains with prefrontal cortexes, our personality centers,

02:08.040 --> 02:13.560
which enabled us to make snap second decisions based not only on external stimuli, but also our

02:13.560 --> 02:19.440
past experiences. Then we developed symbolic language to communicate complex ideas and then

02:19.480 --> 02:26.160
finally tools to take control of and shape our surroundings. So you see what makes us uniquely

02:26.160 --> 02:32.400
human. Actually, what has brought us here together today, the abilities to ponder, convene, reflect,

02:32.400 --> 02:39.800
build, collaborate, and coordinate are not only what make us so special, but also so successful.

02:39.800 --> 02:46.200
So then our tools got a lot better. The first fire pump was invented in Alexandria in the

02:46.240 --> 02:53.760
third century BCE. Unfortunately, it could not save the library, but I digress. As societies and

02:53.760 --> 02:59.640
civilizations began to form, the blast radius of disasters grew. We settled into towns that could

02:59.640 --> 03:05.440
burn down and buildings that earthquakes could topple. And so those smart brains of ours formed

03:05.440 --> 03:12.600
teams whose sole purpose was to patrol and respond to natural and made manmade disasters in the form

03:12.680 --> 03:19.720
of firefighters and police forces. Then societies became more complex. And with that came more

03:19.720 --> 03:26.080
complex disasters, not only fire and flood, but we created monetary systems, banks that could

03:26.080 --> 03:32.560
collapse and food systems that were prone to mass famine, not always for lack of food, but

03:32.560 --> 03:39.200
sometimes for lack of transportation or poor planning. Our close proximity to each other in

03:39.240 --> 03:45.880
cities and long distance cultural exchange made possible by ships brought diseases, colonization,

03:45.880 --> 03:54.080
and war, which ravaged human populations. We think of these ages as dark or undeveloped, but

03:54.080 --> 04:00.240
their responses to such crises were surprisingly neither. In fact, we begin to see thoughtful and

04:00.240 --> 04:06.920
multifaceted disaster response, not only search and rescue or medical aid, but tax relief,

04:07.160 --> 04:13.280
temporary infrastructure, even what we now call refugee camps, providing long term food and shelter

04:13.280 --> 04:19.880
for displaced peoples. In 1493, the Knights Hospitalers shipped doctors and surgeons to the

04:19.880 --> 04:25.520
Greek island of Kos after an earthquake. And so we see some of the first evidence of multiple

04:25.520 --> 04:31.800
different groups or organizations coordinating across disciplines and borders to respond to a

04:31.800 --> 04:40.440
disaster. In the intervening years, we've continued to hone our disaster response strategies.

04:40.440 --> 04:48.880
Humanities impact on this planet has required us to do so. And besides, those prefrontal

04:48.880 --> 04:54.840
cortexes of ours have a lot more data to lean on than our friends the ancient Alexandrians had.

04:55.840 --> 05:00.520
If they knew then what we knew now, maybe they could have saved that library.

05:00.520 --> 05:08.240
You should pull it together. Anyway, today we have entire organizations, governmental bodies,

05:08.240 --> 05:14.680
NGOs, and community groups dedicated to such activities. We have laws by country and internationally

05:14.680 --> 05:22.280
to enshrine basic human rights and ideal responses in crises. And now we're building a new frontier,

05:23.080 --> 05:30.520
a new form of transit. We're creating massive new civilizations, hosted on smallish, inscrutable,

05:30.520 --> 05:37.240
blinky boxes. In this new world, we can't even really see the threats, the crises. We're throwing

05:37.240 --> 05:42.840
people together in a way that's affecting global social structures and people's everyday lives.

05:44.440 --> 05:49.320
Like every form of infrastructure, like most every place where humans gather to live, to work,

05:49.320 --> 05:57.480
to learn, to play. The internet has grown up in an unplanned way. And we're still scrambling to

05:57.480 --> 06:02.840
understand it, to learn from our mistakes, to apply those lessons, to build the best internet,

06:04.040 --> 06:09.000
to build systems that protect people and systems that react when people are harmed.

06:09.960 --> 06:16.920
But don't worry too much. We'll survive these dark ages. Our species has survived every

06:16.920 --> 06:23.800
disaster it's encountered, at least so far. A common organizational structure found in groups

06:23.800 --> 06:29.400
undertaking large-scale operations to solve big, big problems is called a multi-team system.

06:30.360 --> 06:35.800
A system comprised of multiple teams working towards a shared goal. These structures can

06:35.800 --> 06:40.840
be found throughout all sorts of industries, working on all sorts of problems, disaster

06:40.920 --> 06:47.640
response, space exploration, governing humans, building stuff. If you're part of a business

06:47.640 --> 06:53.480
with multiple departments, you're in one. If you attend or work in a university, you're in one.

06:54.920 --> 07:01.240
And if you maintain or contribute to a support or, excuse me, contribute to or support or care

07:01.240 --> 07:07.880
about an open-source project, you're also in such a system. Because no matter what corner of the

07:07.880 --> 07:14.760
internet you occupy or to which technology you contribute, you're working in service of our

07:14.760 --> 07:24.120
shared mission to keep the internet open and free. So what makes up a multi-team system? Within the

07:24.120 --> 07:29.880
subordinate, the superordinate team, the entire system, we have local teams working on local or

07:29.880 --> 07:36.520
proximal goals, which may even be split further into component teams. And directing the subordinate

07:36.520 --> 07:41.800
teams is the leader or perhaps the team of leaders, which shares a global or system goal.

07:42.840 --> 07:47.960
And when you examine these teams using social network analysis, you find common patterns

07:47.960 --> 07:55.240
between successful MTSs. There are many more patterns we could discuss, but let's focus on three.

07:56.120 --> 08:02.680
A plan for coordination paired with frequent, clear communication, highly-performant and resilient

08:02.760 --> 08:09.880
local teams, and finally, empowered and effective leaders who are willing to sacrifice their local

08:09.880 --> 08:16.840
goal in service of the global goal. So before we explore each of these patterns, I want to share

08:16.840 --> 08:22.520
this diagram with you to underscore the importance of these patterns in disaster response. Because

08:22.520 --> 08:28.280
that term disaster response makes such activity sound reactive, doesn't it? But in reality,

08:28.280 --> 08:33.720
the most effective disaster responses begin long before the disaster happens or second best

08:33.720 --> 08:39.240
right after a disaster occurs. So I ask you to bear that in mind through the rest of this talk.

08:39.880 --> 08:45.160
After all, the best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, and the second best time is today.

08:46.360 --> 08:51.880
First, let's talk about planning, coordination and communication. I don't think I need to talk

08:51.880 --> 08:57.960
about docs too much here. I think the OSS communities know this one quite well. And engineers know

08:57.960 --> 09:03.000
all about retrospectives. Like I mentioned, disaster response begins well before the disaster

09:03.000 --> 09:09.800
occurs. So in terms of coordination and communication, knowing where to turn for help or resources before

09:09.800 --> 09:17.240
a disaster occurs spares valuable time, energy and mental load during a crisis. Effective

09:17.240 --> 09:22.840
communication prevents errors in the field, helps the even distribution of resources and helps us

09:22.840 --> 09:29.240
learn from the mistakes we've made last time so we don't make them again next time. During disasters,

09:29.240 --> 09:35.640
response teams crucially over communicate. They share reports on the situation as it evolves.

09:36.200 --> 09:42.360
They communicate with stakeholders on the ground. And they report changes or progress to make the

09:42.360 --> 09:49.080
best decisions. Leadership and subordinate teams must have the most accurate and up to date information.

09:50.040 --> 09:55.400
Because knowledge sharing fosters a coordinated and collaborative environment.

09:56.440 --> 10:01.560
It reinforces the multi-team system as a single unit, not a set of separate teams.

10:03.000 --> 10:08.520
And because knowledge sharing makes it easier to be flexible and adaptable in rapidly changing

10:08.520 --> 10:15.240
environments. Interestingly, research has found that inter communication, communication between

10:15.240 --> 10:23.480
local teams is more important than intra communication. Communication within the local team to the

10:23.480 --> 10:30.040
success of the whole system. So in fact, there's actually a Goldilocks zone of inter to intra

10:30.040 --> 10:36.520
communication. Local teams should communicate half as much between teams as they communicate

10:36.520 --> 10:42.760
within their own team. Any more inter communication than that and performance declines any less than

10:42.760 --> 10:48.920
that and it declines too. When we talk about the viability of a team, we mean the success of the

10:48.920 --> 10:55.800
team. In moments of disaster or crises, the stakes are life and death. And at the end of the day,

10:55.800 --> 11:04.120
disaster response teams and open source maintainers too, they're people. They have feelings. So viable

11:04.120 --> 11:09.400
teams or successful teams support each other. They lend a hand. They take emotions into account

11:09.400 --> 11:16.760
when making decisions. Viable teams engage in what is called disruption, buffering behaviors,

11:16.760 --> 11:23.640
which is to say change management. They try to anticipate changes that may occur, plan ahead

11:23.640 --> 11:29.480
and invent that some change or disruption occurs. And again, they support each other through those

11:29.480 --> 11:37.080
changes. Viable teams also try to balance performance and resilience because when you work with people

11:37.640 --> 11:43.000
and you're so hell bent on performance, then the team's physical or mental health is at stake.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.560
And the team becomes brittle and the team does not perform well.

11:50.040 --> 11:55.880
So when we see teams that are so, because people do not want to be a part of such a team, right?

11:56.680 --> 12:00.760
So I'll say that again. There's a difference between successful teams and teams that people want

12:00.760 --> 12:06.440
to be a part of. And in the long term, teams that strike the right balance are the ones that are

12:06.520 --> 12:14.360
the most successful. Finally, the most important, the most performant teams strike the right balance

12:14.360 --> 12:21.800
between reinforcing the team's boundaries, which is to say reinforcing the identity or team spirit

12:21.800 --> 12:28.280
of the local team and boundary diminishing behaviors, which reinforce the local team as part of

12:28.280 --> 12:35.880
something larger than the team as part of the whole system. So a little bit of silo is actually good

12:37.000 --> 12:41.080
but not to the extent that teams develop an us versus them mentality,

12:43.640 --> 12:48.200
which brings us to our last assertion today. Empowered and effective leaders.

12:48.200 --> 12:54.760
Strong leaders serve as an ambassador to the team and for the team. Internally, they help teams

12:54.760 --> 13:00.920
understand why the team has a certain goal or is performing some task. Within the system, they

13:00.920 --> 13:07.240
advocate for the team's priorities and points of view. Those are called boundary spanning behaviors.

13:07.240 --> 13:13.480
They make sure that the team has the information it needs, not only the what, but the why of a task

13:13.480 --> 13:20.840
or priority that they understand their own team's priorities. In a disaster response scenario,

13:20.840 --> 13:27.240
times of the essence. Rapid decision making allows teams to quickly assess the situation,

13:27.240 --> 13:32.360
evaluate available options and act promptly to address emerging challenges.

13:34.520 --> 13:39.320
Delays in decision making can lead to missed opportunities, increased risks, and further

13:39.320 --> 13:46.440
escalation of the situation. And as much as we're proud to be a part of our own team, we must recognize

13:47.160 --> 13:52.840
and understand other teams' respect and contribute to their priorities and not be too selfish in

13:52.840 --> 13:59.240
our own focus. That's why a crucial feature of successful multi-team systems, of disaster

13:59.240 --> 14:04.600
response effectiveness, is that local leaders and teams are willing to sacrifice their local goal,

14:05.560 --> 14:12.600
if it means more for the common good. So now that we've immersed ourselves in the theory of

14:12.600 --> 14:17.560
effective multi-team system performance, let's illustrate it with a real-world example.

14:17.960 --> 14:22.280
I recently discovered this amazing YouTube channel. It's called Brick of Mortar. It's all about

14:22.280 --> 14:29.240
infrastructure disasters, ship sinkings, critical failures. It's fascinating. If you're into this

14:29.240 --> 14:33.480
kind of stuff, check it out. You'll never look at bridges or tall buildings the same again.

14:35.880 --> 14:42.040
The sinking of the MV Ferry Wall on April 16, 2014, off the southwestern coast of South Korea,

14:42.040 --> 14:52.040
was a disaster, not only in and of itself, but also of multi-team system performance.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.520
Over 300 people paid the price for these failures with their lives.

14:57.800 --> 15:03.000
On what seemed to be a trip like any other, the ferry suddenly made a series of sharp turns. But

15:03.000 --> 15:09.400
as we know, a disaster such as this starts long before the immediate catalyst. Over the years,

15:09.400 --> 15:14.440
this ferry had been repurposed many times and additions had been made that affected its balance

15:14.440 --> 15:21.400
point. For this trip in particular, the ship had taken on excessive cargo, which compromised the

15:21.400 --> 15:29.640
vessel's stability and made it more susceptible to capsizing. What's more, the ship's crew had

15:29.640 --> 15:34.520
drained the ballast that's water that's kept in a ship to make sure it doesn't sink, to make sure

15:34.520 --> 15:40.200
it's properly balanced. They didn't want it to sit too low in the water, they wanted to be able

15:40.200 --> 15:43.960
to pass inspection knowing they'd taken on way more weight than they were supposed to.

15:44.840 --> 15:49.880
So the communication breakdowns. First, when the ship began to list, the captain refused a

15:49.880 --> 15:55.800
sendage of stress call during the crucial first moments, delaying rescue efforts as the ship began

15:55.800 --> 16:03.720
to sink. He told passengers to go to lower levels of the ship after refusing to tell them anything

16:03.720 --> 16:07.800
about the impending disaster. For crucial moments when they should have been getting on to the deck,

16:08.520 --> 16:15.800
getting ready to be rescued. When he finally sent the distress call and rescue ships came,

16:16.360 --> 16:21.560
they quickly learned that the actual communication infrastructure, the radios that the ship needed

16:21.560 --> 16:28.520
to call the disaster teams were either malfunctioning or were broken. Something had gone wrong with

16:28.520 --> 16:33.320
them. So despite the rescue teams trying to raise the ship's crew on the radio, vital communications

16:33.320 --> 16:39.080
failed during those crucial first moments. So you can see the ferry seawall had no plan for

16:39.080 --> 16:45.240
intra communication in the event of a disaster. They coordinated poorly, not only within their

16:45.240 --> 16:50.680
local team but also with the rescuers. So they failed to inter-communicate with local teams. So

16:51.240 --> 16:58.360
the system, the global team failed. So for the sake of this section, let's quickly divide

16:58.360 --> 17:03.800
the various local teams. The crew is a team, the rescuers are a team, the passengers are a team,

17:03.800 --> 17:10.440
and the South Korean government is a team. What were each of those teams' goals? Passengers

17:10.440 --> 17:16.680
wanted a safe trip. The crew should have wanted to get them there safely but they just wanted to

17:16.680 --> 17:22.760
maximize profit. The rescuers wanted to make it to the site quickly and save as many passengers as

17:22.760 --> 17:27.720
possible. You would think the South Korean government would want to save their people

17:27.720 --> 17:33.400
and prevent such a disaster from happening again, but unfortunately that was not the case.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.840
Their true goal was to save face on the international stage.

17:41.800 --> 17:45.800
We'll talk more about that in a second. Now each of these teams had goals that were in opposition

17:45.800 --> 17:54.360
to another team's goals. And as the circumstances evolved, there was no ability of any of these

17:54.360 --> 18:01.080
teams to shift their priorities or manage this change to negotiate the priorities and evolve.

18:02.360 --> 18:08.040
And each team in the system saw the other team as a detriment to achieving their own goals rather

18:08.040 --> 18:15.880
than as a part of a system, as allies, as individuals worthy of consideration. In fact,

18:16.520 --> 18:21.480
the crew had never received proper safety training. So even if their goals had been aligned, they were

18:21.480 --> 18:28.520
not properly equipped to perform. Now the next example from this horrible tragedy is an example

18:28.520 --> 18:36.520
of leadership, failure, and boundary reinforcing. When rescuers arrived on site, the assembled

18:36.520 --> 18:42.120
parties included Japanese Coast Guard and the US Navy. When a ship sinks, often there will exist

18:42.120 --> 18:48.600
air pockets within the ship. If passengers can find them, they can survive for seven days as long

18:48.600 --> 18:54.200
as they have food. The US Navy or water, pardon me, the US Navy and Japanese Coast Guard and

18:54.200 --> 18:59.480
private citizens too all had the equipment necessary and were on site, the equipment necessary to

18:59.480 --> 19:05.240
conduct such a rescue. But due to South Korea's rigid hierarchical culture and their government's

19:05.240 --> 19:11.400
desire to save face, the teams that had the equipment necessary were not allowed to perform the rescue.

19:12.520 --> 19:18.360
It's an example of unwillingness to sacrifice the local goal and a lack of emotional and really

19:18.360 --> 19:25.000
life support to the passengers who just wanted to survive. In fact, throughout the crucial hours

19:25.000 --> 19:29.400
then days when those high school children that were trapped in that ship could have been saved,

19:29.400 --> 19:34.040
the South Korean government lied to the parents who had assembled to wait for news about their

19:34.040 --> 19:39.640
kids. They said that all the kids had been saved despite that being quite far from the truth.

19:40.120 --> 19:46.920
So what do I hope the open source community will take from this line of scientific inquiry,

19:46.920 --> 19:54.440
from the lessons of the MVC wall? Because folks, this ship is sinking. Our planet's ecosystem is

19:54.440 --> 20:01.880
failing. The climate is changing. I hope when projects, especially leaders, see someone building

20:01.880 --> 20:07.880
something similar to what they're doing, they start to think that other project is an ally.

20:07.960 --> 20:14.520
That other project is an ally, not a competitor. They think, how can we help each other? Not,

20:14.520 --> 20:22.920
how can I win? Or worse yet, how can I sabotage them? I hope maintainers who make the commitment

20:22.920 --> 20:27.960
to serve their community understand the commitment they're making and live up to that responsibility.

20:27.960 --> 20:32.760
Because remember, it's not a commitment you have to make. You can make something, you can choose not

20:32.840 --> 20:38.760
to maintain it, you can choose not to accept issues, change anything about it. But if you make that

20:38.760 --> 20:44.040
choice, I hope you live up to it. And I hope you respect your community and listen to what they need.

20:46.440 --> 20:53.160
I hope BDFLs, benevolent dictators for life, focus more on the benevolent part and less on

20:53.160 --> 20:58.680
the dictator part. I hope we can take better care of each other. So many maintainers and

20:58.680 --> 21:05.080
contributors out there in this room are carrying so much weight and holding so much space for all

21:05.080 --> 21:10.360
of us. I hope we can do more to help them or at the very least, I hope we can spare them kind words.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.400
I'm not under illusions here. I don't expect what I've said here today to do all that much.

21:18.280 --> 21:24.360
People have said a lot of what I said here many times before, but maybe, just maybe, I've touched

21:24.440 --> 21:29.560
one heart or one mind and maybe that heart or mind will go out there and they'll make a different

21:29.560 --> 21:36.120
choice because of what I said here today. Or maybe they'll speak up and share what was touched

21:36.120 --> 21:43.160
today with the next person when they see something wrong. Maybe, like our very first ancestor who

21:43.160 --> 21:49.080
looked up and reached, maybe we can make a little difference now that will make a really big difference

21:49.080 --> 21:55.960
for the people who come after us. Because the last 10 years, the platformification of the web,

21:55.960 --> 22:01.800
the inshidification of those platforms, that was not a new normal. That was a glance at a future

22:01.800 --> 22:07.640
that doesn't have to be. Our power out as a community is in our principles and it's in our

22:07.640 --> 22:13.800
numbers. If we can convene, if we can coordinate, if we can collaborate, if we can take good care

22:13.800 --> 22:19.400
of each other and choose kindness every day, if our leaders stay humble and choose the greater

22:19.400 --> 22:28.200
good over their own enrichment ego or fame, we can change the course of this information age.

22:28.200 --> 22:34.280
We can change the course of history. But it will take all of us working together and it will be

22:34.280 --> 22:40.680
damn hard work. The wonderful organizers of FOSSTEM have given me this stage, so to close this talk,

22:40.680 --> 22:46.680
I will now issue a challenge as if all of that wasn't already a challenge. From my perspective,

22:46.680 --> 22:52.280
and I'm speaking especially to our leaders, we must focus our collaborative energy and kindness

22:52.280 --> 23:00.520
on the following three areas. We must make the internet more efficient. We must make our code

23:00.520 --> 23:07.800
bases smaller. We need to reduce storage usage, duplicated requests, and reduce the distance

23:07.880 --> 23:13.800
data needs to travel. We are in the midst of an energy and an environmental crisis.

23:14.680 --> 23:22.440
Half our world is drowning and the other half is on fire. And as the diaspora of people across

23:22.440 --> 23:28.680
digital social spaces continues, we must collaborate across the internet community to protect

23:28.680 --> 23:36.360
disadvantaged, disenfranchised, and marginalized people. When diversity and inclusion suffers,

23:36.360 --> 23:44.440
we all suffer. Our pursuit of knowledge, societal progress, and the advancement of humanity only

23:44.440 --> 23:50.680
succeeds when we are inclusive of all walks of life, of all creeds, of all religions, of all races,

23:50.680 --> 23:57.800
of all colors, of all communities. Barring those who promote violence or enable hate.

23:58.760 --> 24:06.760
And we must protect science and knowledge. We must stand for the truth, not only from a geopolitical

24:06.760 --> 24:12.920
and societal perspective, but also on an individual level. We need to protect people and the systems

24:12.920 --> 24:19.400
through which we organize into collectives. We have to make the truth resilient. Whether you

24:19.400 --> 24:26.520
recognize it or choose to identify as part of it, you are part of a movement. Whether you're doing

24:26.520 --> 24:31.720
this in your spare time as a passion or as a hobby, or if you're one of the lucky people who

24:31.720 --> 24:38.760
has found a company to pay you to do this. You are part of a movement. You have experience and

24:38.760 --> 24:47.960
passion and you're smart as heck we need you. And I believe in us. Thank you.
