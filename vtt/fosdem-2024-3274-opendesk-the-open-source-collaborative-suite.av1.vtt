WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.560
Okay, so welcome to the talk about OpenDesk, the open source collaborative suite presented

00:15.560 --> 00:20.640
by Klemah Obang from Exviki and Vila Lydantal from Open Projects.

00:20.640 --> 00:21.640
Enjoy.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.640
Hello.

00:22.640 --> 00:23.640
Hello, everybody.

00:23.640 --> 00:24.640
Thanks for coming.

00:24.640 --> 00:30.760
The funny thing is we are not OpenDesk.

00:30.760 --> 00:31.760
We're just vendors.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.520
We're just contributing to OpenDesk, but we come to this later.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.640
Yeah, OpenDesk, what is that?

00:36.640 --> 00:44.880
That is an idea of building an alternative to Microsoft Office 365 or to Google Apps

00:44.880 --> 00:46.760
that come to the public sectors.

00:46.760 --> 00:51.280
They are used everywhere, and public sector wants to have an alternative to that.

00:51.280 --> 00:57.720
So if you really want to go after the big elephant that is not in the room, we're trying

00:57.720 --> 01:01.080
to create an alternative to that.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.280
So probably it's the biggest opportunity for open source software right now.

01:04.280 --> 01:11.200
Let's say at least in the realm of collaboration and working together.

01:11.200 --> 01:16.720
So OpenDesk is a powerful initiative of the German government with a goal to provide a

01:16.720 --> 01:20.320
serious alternative to the proprietary Big Tech establishment.

01:20.320 --> 01:26.160
It unites independent open source software vendors to create a sovereign workplace tailored

01:26.160 --> 01:31.720
for the public sector.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.360
We too here, we are just nerds.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.320
We're just software developers.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.320
I'm from outside.

01:38.320 --> 01:42.280
I work for and co-founded Open Project.

01:42.280 --> 01:47.360
So that is one of the parts of the solutions here that we will talk about.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.160
But I'm software engineer.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.920
I'm not OpenDesk.

01:51.920 --> 01:52.920
And this is Clément.

01:52.920 --> 01:53.920
Hello.

01:53.920 --> 01:58.640
So, well, you maybe have seen me during the room this morning.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.640
So my name is Clément Aubert.

01:59.640 --> 02:04.640
I'm an XQQ committer and I also work at XQQ SAS to do sales mainly.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.400
Okay.

02:06.400 --> 02:11.160
So well, let's start by discussing a little bit about the story of OpenDesk and how we

02:11.160 --> 02:12.720
got there essentially.

02:12.720 --> 02:20.720
So the issue with essentially collaborative suites goes a long way, right?

02:20.720 --> 02:26.600
Since 2015, especially in Western EU, so when I'm talking about Western EU, it's mainly

02:26.600 --> 02:30.320
French and German government because from more point of view, that's where we have the

02:30.320 --> 02:34.000
most information, let's say.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.440
Since 2015, what we see is that there are growing concerns when it comes to the US-based

02:40.440 --> 02:44.160
cloud offering that exists in order to create collaborative suites.

02:44.160 --> 02:48.520
And these concerns are mainly regarding the fact that you don't necessarily have control

02:48.520 --> 02:49.520
on your data.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.840
You don't know exactly where it is being stored, how it is being processed.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.680
There are especially privacy risks.

02:54.680 --> 03:00.440
If you are putting sensitive data, maybe they could be accessed in different ways.

03:00.440 --> 03:06.120
In particular, since 2018, there is an extra territorial law that exists in the US that

03:06.120 --> 03:11.560
allows the government to ask a company to access customer data, even though the data

03:11.560 --> 03:14.680
of the customer may not be from a US citizen.

03:14.680 --> 03:22.680
Just for, let's say, well, usually to get more information about that customer.

03:22.680 --> 03:28.480
And then there is the big question of locking, essentially, when you migrate your data.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.720
How easy it is to make it back?

03:30.720 --> 03:37.400
Are there any open standards that exist in order to do it the other way around?

03:37.400 --> 03:38.520
These concerns exist.

03:38.520 --> 03:49.800
And so actually, since late, well, the end of 2010 and beginning of 2020, French and

03:49.800 --> 03:55.920
Germany have started to create some rules when it comes to the handling of critical data

03:55.920 --> 03:58.360
in their government.

03:58.520 --> 04:03.720
In France in particular, there is an initiative which is called Cloud Nubu and Cloud Pi, which

04:03.720 --> 04:11.600
is essentially two cloud specifications that are used for public administrations.

04:11.600 --> 04:18.200
One is for, let's say, conventional data and another one is for more sensitive data.

04:18.200 --> 04:27.960
Germany also started another initiative, which is the Deutsche Verwaltungs-Cloud strategy,

04:27.960 --> 04:29.920
which is, let's say, kind of the same.

04:29.920 --> 04:35.640
It creates kind of a standard in order to protect the data that is used by public administration

04:35.640 --> 04:39.400
from the external actors.

04:39.400 --> 04:45.200
So this is essentially, to be clear, this is essentially infrastructures or definition

04:45.200 --> 04:49.600
of infrastructure that should be implemented by the state so that on the long run, states

04:49.600 --> 04:55.360
have the capability to host some data securely for them.

04:55.360 --> 04:59.680
In the meantime, there is the question of having security certifications, basically

04:59.680 --> 05:04.760
making sure that the different vendors that will provide a specific service for you, they

05:04.760 --> 05:10.960
have the necessary amount of security to provide that service.

05:10.960 --> 05:18.440
And so in the same idea, there are two standards that were created over the past years.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.760
In France, we have SecNumCloud.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.840
SecNumCloud has been created by the ANC.

05:22.840 --> 05:28.560
It's basically derived from another security standard, which is called ISO 27001.

05:28.560 --> 05:33.160
If you are doing security, you may know about it because it's well known.

05:33.160 --> 05:38.320
And what SecNumCloud does is that basically it takes most of the rules from ISO 27001,

05:38.320 --> 05:45.600
but it adds also controls when it comes to the nationality of the people and the location

05:45.600 --> 05:48.000
of the people that are allowed to process the data.

05:48.760 --> 05:52.800
The whole goal of SecNumCloud is to protect from extraterritorialities, in particular

05:52.800 --> 05:55.880
the US Cloud Act that I mentioned.

05:55.880 --> 06:01.600
In Germany, there is also another certification, which is called BSI C5, and we will talk about

06:01.600 --> 06:04.120
it afterwards because it's quite important.

06:04.120 --> 06:10.240
The goal is to basically be able to qualify a specific application that you want to deploy

06:10.240 --> 06:16.560
on a cloud offering that you want to deploy to be used by public institutions.

06:17.280 --> 06:23.120
So C5 certification is a little bit different in the sense that it's not about extraterritoriality

06:23.120 --> 06:24.320
at this point.

06:24.320 --> 06:33.400
It is more about basically making sure that the application is correctly developed.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.640
There is a good standard of quality when it comes to the change that you are applying

06:36.640 --> 06:38.360
to your application.

06:38.360 --> 06:41.800
You validate its compliance, etc.

06:41.800 --> 06:47.480
On the long term, so if you are residing in Europe, in the EU, there is a vision to create

06:47.480 --> 06:52.600
one unified standard, which is mainly based out of SecNumCloud and C5, which could be

06:52.600 --> 06:59.720
called the ES Cloud that would encapsulate and basically allow any vendor to qualify

06:59.720 --> 07:06.960
to this standard in order to be deployed in the different governmental public administrations

07:06.960 --> 07:08.160
in the EU.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.480
So that's very nice.

07:12.160 --> 07:17.760
We are actually introducing new laws that allow us to control what can be put and what

07:17.760 --> 07:21.520
can be used by public administration, but in the meantime, we may not be creating solutions

07:21.520 --> 07:22.520
here.

07:22.520 --> 07:33.120
So that's another issue that has been tackled by France and Germany over the past few years.

07:33.120 --> 07:43.160
In France, over the past like in 2021-222, there is a project that was started that was

07:43.160 --> 07:47.200
pushed by the DGE, which is the Extranger Neral des entreprises.

07:47.200 --> 07:51.200
It's a branch of the finance ministry.

07:51.200 --> 07:57.480
The goal was to create different consortium that would lead the creation of an alternative

07:57.480 --> 08:01.720
suite to things such as Office 365 or Google Workplace.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.680
The ones that Wilhelm talked about.

08:04.680 --> 08:08.080
So it's a project that has been started in 2023.

08:08.080 --> 08:16.160
The total of the project is around 23 million that has been invested by the state for the

08:16.160 --> 08:18.360
three consortiums.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.040
The idea is to have results by 226.

08:21.040 --> 08:26.320
Now we will not talk about them that much because it's actually not based on fully open

08:26.320 --> 08:29.880
source software, so it's not really the scope of this talk.

08:29.880 --> 08:35.880
The one we are interested in here is the project from Germany, which is OpenDesk.

08:35.880 --> 08:42.200
And the idea of OpenDesk is essentially, so it's a really different approach.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.800
In Germany, there is the Ministry of Interior.

08:44.800 --> 08:49.080
I will not say the name in German because it's going to be a nightmare.

08:49.080 --> 08:55.840
The Ministry of Interior decided in 2022 to create a consortium made of different actors,

08:55.840 --> 08:57.360
so we'll see them afterwards.

08:57.360 --> 09:01.960
But essentially, Dataport, which is a big service provider for public administration

09:01.960 --> 09:07.840
in Germany, as well as a couple of vendors, software vendors, are providing open source

09:07.840 --> 09:08.840
software.

09:08.840 --> 09:14.560
And the Ministry decided to group them together in order to create a platform which is coherent,

09:14.560 --> 09:21.120
fully open source, and can basically last longer and be maintained over time.

09:21.120 --> 09:26.560
So to give you an idea, in France, the financing for the three consortium I mentioned is like

09:26.560 --> 09:30.920
around 23 million, knowing that there is a little bit of a loan there, so you have to

09:30.920 --> 09:32.200
reimburse it.

09:32.200 --> 09:39.040
And then in Germany, it's basically orders, so it's not a loan, and the budget into 23

09:39.040 --> 09:44.480
was 23 million, so a little bit more budget.

09:44.480 --> 09:50.720
So if we go into the details of OpenDesk, so the project was initially started by the

09:50.800 --> 09:52.840
German Ministry of Interior.

09:52.840 --> 09:57.680
Today it's being handled over to Zendes, which is also a public organization that has been

09:57.680 --> 10:04.880
created in order to handle, let's say, open source projects that have been created by the

10:04.880 --> 10:09.800
federal state.

10:09.800 --> 10:14.840
And so, as I mentioned, the project is currently co-managed with multiple actors, so there

10:14.880 --> 10:23.880
is the Bundesministerium, the Ministry of Interior, the BMI, PWC, which is helping on trying to

10:24.200 --> 10:29.480
have, find use cases, basically, find the correct user stories, the issues that we are

10:29.480 --> 10:33.720
trying to solve with our collaborative workplace.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.920
Data Port, which I mentioned, which is providing, basically, hosting for the project, and is

10:37.920 --> 10:42.360
also doing a lot of work in order to organize the different vendors all working together

10:42.440 --> 10:46.400
to create a unified workplace and create a product that works.

10:46.400 --> 10:53.400
And then we also have Bechle, which is present for helping on the financing of the project.

10:56.680 --> 11:01.320
So we talked about the vendors today in this project, in the OpenDesk project we have around

11:01.320 --> 11:07.040
a little bit more than 500 people that are working from both the different vendors, PWC,

11:07.040 --> 11:09.840
BMI, and Data Port and Bechle.

11:09.920 --> 11:14.200
So that's quite a large project in the end.

11:14.200 --> 11:19.440
I will get to the name of the vendors afterwards, but this is just kind of a quick view of what

11:19.440 --> 11:21.440
we're trying to achieve, right?

11:21.440 --> 11:26.840
Basically we're trying to achieve one solution, one workplace that fills in different needs.

11:26.840 --> 11:30.840
We want to have email management, of course, you need to have emails, you also want to

11:30.840 --> 11:36.160
create events, so you will have calendar modules, contacts, task management, we want to also

11:36.160 --> 11:42.600
have the file management parts where we can create new files, collaborate on them, and

11:42.600 --> 11:46.400
then you also may want to continue working on your projects, so develop projects within

11:46.400 --> 11:52.120
your organization, for that we have a project management tool, a knowledge base tool, and

11:52.120 --> 11:57.880
you also want to communicate with your co-workers, so there is modules about chats and video

11:57.880 --> 11:59.240
conferencing.

11:59.240 --> 12:04.240
So all these projects, the idea of OpenDesk is essentially that these modules should be

12:04.240 --> 12:07.240
made of solutions that can be switched easily.

12:07.240 --> 12:12.880
The ideal vision of OpenDesk would be that basically you have a software which is providing

12:12.880 --> 12:15.960
the email functionality, but let's say that tomorrow you want to switch it, you don't

12:15.960 --> 12:20.480
want to use the default version, the default software that is provided, then you should

12:20.480 --> 12:24.720
be able to do the switch fairly easily.

12:24.720 --> 12:28.280
So in practice today we are providing some sort of a default implementation, meaning

12:28.280 --> 12:33.320
that we have a couple of software that correspond to each of these features, and we don't really

12:33.320 --> 12:35.920
have two options for file management.

12:35.920 --> 12:40.800
Yes, that's a very important part because the German state don't want to get back into

12:40.800 --> 12:46.280
the vendor lock, so that's the reason why it's talking about mail and not about a certain

12:46.280 --> 12:47.280
vendor.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.040
Exactly.

12:50.040 --> 12:55.240
So if we look a little bit more in the details, so when it comes to everything which is related

12:55.240 --> 13:04.280
to email, agenda, contact management, calendar, and task, OpenExchange is handling today that

13:04.280 --> 13:07.040
big part of the project.

13:07.040 --> 13:15.280
When it comes to file management, it's mainly in NextCloud, and in NextCloud when you want

13:15.280 --> 13:20.560
to collaborate on different files, we have two external tools that have been integrated,

13:20.560 --> 13:26.080
so Collabra for which we had a talk a couple of minutes ago, and also CripPad, which we

13:26.080 --> 13:31.640
had a talk this morning, so they are used in order to edit basically office files, and

13:31.640 --> 13:36.040
for CripPad it's for editing diagrams today.

13:36.040 --> 13:42.280
When it comes to the communication, so we have Element which is handling, so Element

13:42.280 --> 13:48.320
based on Matrix, which is handling everything which is related to chats between teams, and

13:48.320 --> 13:55.320
there is a clever integration between Element and GC, the integration is provided by Nordic

13:55.320 --> 14:00.640
to basically allow to have video conferencing and basically rooms within Element where you

14:00.640 --> 14:05.880
can start calls and make calls and chats on a specific subject.

14:05.880 --> 14:13.120
Then on the project management capabilities, there are us, so OpenProject as part of the

14:13.440 --> 14:17.960
project management tool, and NextWiki for knowledge management.

14:17.960 --> 14:24.000
I would say that we are rather the, OpenProject and NextWiki are kind of the latest projects

14:24.000 --> 14:25.200
in the project, right?

14:25.200 --> 14:30.360
We arrived at least in NextWiki, we arrived at the end of 222, so not that far away, and

14:30.360 --> 14:32.360
not that long ago.

14:32.360 --> 14:39.360
Finally, so this whole portal that you see here, it's managed by Univention, which is

14:40.360 --> 14:47.360
another solution that allows to create user portals and it's also handling access management,

14:47.360 --> 14:49.760
authentication, user list, et cetera, et cetera.

14:49.760 --> 14:50.760
Single sign on.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.800
Yeah, single sign on also.

14:53.800 --> 14:59.640
So today the development of the project is managed by the hosting of everything which

14:59.640 --> 15:06.240
is related to the development of the project is managed by Dataport, so thanks to them.

15:06.240 --> 15:13.240
So we'll get to, at some point we'll try to do a demo if we have internet, but let's

15:13.240 --> 15:15.920
go a little bit more in the technical details.

15:15.920 --> 15:22.920
So today the architecture of OpenDesk is mainly based on Kubernetes, mainly because we are

15:22.920 --> 15:30.920
integrating a lot of different components, and at some point it was decided to use Kubernetes

15:30.920 --> 15:36.280
because it was the easiest basically to integrate all this complexity into one big package.

15:36.280 --> 15:43.280
So we are using Helm charts and GitLab CI to deploy Kubernetes cluster, and then basically

15:45.280 --> 15:52.280
each component of this cluster is one application managed by one vendor.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.080
Each vendor can provide either a generic Docker image that needs a little bit of configuration

15:57.080 --> 16:02.320
in order to work within the context of OpenDesk, or sometimes some vendors will provide really

16:02.320 --> 16:09.320
a tailored application with, so a tailored custom Docker image that meets some specific

16:09.320 --> 16:16.320
requirements, and well, so sometimes there are also other ways to deliver basically the

16:16.640 --> 16:18.600
applications.

16:18.600 --> 16:24.480
Yeah, a quick look at the features I may not have completely talked about.

16:24.480 --> 16:30.760
So of course it comes with a user directory managed by Inevention. All the applications

16:30.760 --> 16:35.880
are connected between each other through OpenID Connect, so that's very easy in some way

16:35.880 --> 16:41.880
and very standard, and we also have unified navigation across the different applications,

16:41.880 --> 16:45.480
that's something I want to show you in the demo.

16:45.480 --> 16:49.520
And finally, the goal of the project is really to make sure that all these components that

16:49.600 --> 16:54.080
we are integrating, they are connected together like fully.

16:54.080 --> 16:59.520
And so that's going to be very important. I would say it's a work in progress, but we'll

16:59.520 --> 17:05.000
see in the later part of the talk that we have, for example, examples of integrations

17:05.000 --> 17:11.000
between OpenProject and NextCloud, which are very exciting to see.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.320
Yeah, a little bit of a note. Also, when it comes to the distribution of OpenDesk, of

17:16.360 --> 17:21.320
course, it's made of OpenSource software, but the whole build itself, the whole project

17:21.320 --> 17:28.160
itself is OpenSource. And actually, you can access it on OpenCode, which is a GitLab instance

17:28.160 --> 17:33.240
that is used by the German state to publish its OpenSource projects.

17:33.240 --> 17:38.280
So there you should find basically a mirror of all the source code used by all the components

17:38.280 --> 17:43.680
of OpenDesk. But we will also find dedicated repositories with all the handcharts that are

17:43.680 --> 17:46.200
needed in order to deploy the platform.

17:47.200 --> 17:54.200
Another thing in order to be secure, to provide some security and compliance, so every release

17:58.160 --> 18:03.240
is signed. We create software builds of materials. We audit also the licenses of the different

18:03.240 --> 18:08.440
components that are being integrated within the workplace in order to make sure that we

18:08.440 --> 18:13.800
are really completely free OpenSource. The idea is essentially to have something that

18:13.840 --> 18:18.280
will work for the German administration and working for the German administration means

18:18.280 --> 18:24.240
being BSI C5 compliant. So as part of the project, we also have a little bit of work

18:24.240 --> 18:29.800
in order to help each component be, well, match the certification in terms of quality

18:29.800 --> 18:36.800
of development, for example. Finally, and maybe we'll talk a little bit about it later

18:37.160 --> 18:44.160
on, there is a big concern on accessibility. It's one of the things that we see that I'm

18:44.520 --> 18:50.880
the most talked about about OpenSource software. It's nice. It has a lot of features, but maybe

18:50.880 --> 18:54.800
sometimes it's not fully accessible. Well, as part of this project, we have to match

18:54.800 --> 18:58.920
also some accessibility guidelines in order to be used for the public sector. So this

18:58.920 --> 19:03.920
is also part of the final thing that we get from the project along with security.

19:07.520 --> 19:14.520
On the offering side, so the goal, the long-term goal for the project is essentially to have,

19:19.560 --> 19:26.560
today there are plans to create offers for the public administration in Germany, mainly

19:26.560 --> 19:33.560
through two entities. One is Zendes that we talked about, which is currently, let's say,

19:34.440 --> 19:40.000
coordinating the project at a very high level from the federal government perspective.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.680
And also DataPort, which is participating to the project as part of the project management,

19:45.680 --> 19:51.400
but DataPort has its own also suite, which is basically a fork of OpenDesk with some

19:51.400 --> 19:57.160
extra components that are not necessarily OpenSource that have been added or modified

19:57.160 --> 20:04.160
in order to answer some specific needs. So, yeah, today mainly offering for the German

20:04.480 --> 20:09.600
markets, but not really for the rest of Europe. So that's going to be a challenge for later.

20:09.600 --> 20:14.160
But there's interest from all over Europe in the product, so the French government

20:14.160 --> 20:16.400
also is interested. Yeah, Austria, I think.

20:16.400 --> 20:22.520
Australia, Sweden. So it's a big thing in Europe, and people are looking from all sides

20:22.520 --> 20:24.720
on that project.

20:25.720 --> 20:31.720
Okay, so let's try to do a quick demo. Let me see. Okay, so let's do it very quickly.

20:31.720 --> 20:38.720
Whoops. So this is, okay, this is an OpenDesk instance that we are using for review. So

20:40.160 --> 20:43.320
I just want to show you very quickly the different applications that are available.

20:43.320 --> 20:50.320
So let's say that I want to go to my emails. We are fully dependent on FOSDM network,

20:51.080 --> 20:58.080
so I hope it's going to load. Okay, great. So email, we are running on OpenExchange.

21:00.600 --> 21:04.720
So if you know OpenExchange, you probably already recognize this interface. What you

21:04.720 --> 21:11.720
see is that it's, so all the applications have been customized so that they have a color

21:12.280 --> 21:18.280
theme that matches, that is unified in order to have like a nice user experience. I can

21:19.200 --> 21:26.200
use a user directory which is based on the user that are registered in my OpenDesk instance.

21:28.200 --> 21:35.200
I can potentially add, in my email, I can add files, and when I'm selecting files,

21:36.000 --> 21:41.480
I have the choice of uploading a file from my computer, but I can also link a file from

21:41.480 --> 21:46.000
my next cloud account. And so if I do that, it will create a share automatically and make

21:46.040 --> 21:53.040
sure that whoever is receiving the email has the necessary access to see the file. This

21:55.800 --> 22:02.600
one, no. Okay, this one, thank you. Okay, so apart from that, in the email application,

22:02.600 --> 22:06.920
you will see that we have this little button here, and that's the transversal menu. It

22:06.920 --> 22:10.680
allows us to switch from one application to another, and it will change depending on

22:10.680 --> 22:16.760
your access rights. So we can look at, for example, next cloud, so integrated for the

22:16.760 --> 22:22.480
file management. Here I can, so I can create my file, I can create spreadsheets, and in

22:22.480 --> 22:29.480
that case, it will create a document that will be open within Collaborah. So I can edit

22:31.040 --> 22:38.040
it. We also have files that can be diagrams that we can edit directly with CripPad, so

22:38.120 --> 22:44.760
for that we integrated CripPad within OpenDesk for one specific functionality, and here we

22:44.760 --> 22:51.760
are using draw.io actually within CripPad. We can also look at maybe chats, in which

22:52.880 --> 22:58.880
case it's going to be a managed instance of matrix and element of the frontend, where

22:58.880 --> 23:04.200
I can have discussions with the other member of my OpenDesk instance or potentially other

23:04.240 --> 23:11.240
member of the Matrix Federation. And here what you see is that I'm actually part of

23:11.960 --> 23:18.720
a room which is used for a specific meeting within Matrix. And so these rooms, they can

23:18.720 --> 23:24.200
be created automatically when I'm in the agenda of OpenExchange. I create a new event and I

23:24.200 --> 23:28.880
say that I want to have a conference in Matrix, and it will create me a link that will help

23:28.880 --> 23:35.240
me to this room, that same format, where I have video conferencing here. I know that

23:35.240 --> 23:42.240
was a bad idea. Let's leave. And I have a whiteboard and I can also chat. Finally, we

23:46.360 --> 23:53.360
also have project management with OpenProject and knowledge management with Xwiki. So here

23:54.360 --> 23:59.680
I can create my new project, I can create my work packages, create some milestones and

23:59.680 --> 24:03.360
link them together. I won't go too much into the details because I don't want to spoil

24:03.360 --> 24:10.360
you. And here we also have a customized Xwiki instance. Today we are synchronizing users

24:10.600 --> 24:17.600
and writes. We don't have particular integrations with third parties with the other applications.

24:17.600 --> 24:24.600
So that's a very quick demo.

24:29.600 --> 24:34.600
And by the way, that is released. So you can download and try it and play around with

24:34.600 --> 24:36.200
that. So it's an open code.

24:36.200 --> 24:42.120
It's open source. So about the roadmap of OpenDesk, essentially the goal is to have

24:42.120 --> 24:49.120
a stable version like this month. As you said, it's already released. The main issue, I would

24:49.760 --> 24:53.880
say when it comes to the deployment, if you want to try it out, is that today there is

24:53.880 --> 24:58.640
still a good part of the documentation which is only in German. And sometimes if you're

24:58.640 --> 25:05.640
not speaking German, it can be a little bit difficult. On the longer run in 224.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.840
We are trying very hard.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.560
Yeah, yeah.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.560
It's just a few contributions for translation. I'm welcome, I guess.

25:13.560 --> 25:20.560
Exactly. You can do a full request. And so the idea in 224 is to have like more improvements

25:21.080 --> 25:25.120
in order to improve the BSIC5 compliance. Remember, the goal is to deploy that within

25:25.120 --> 25:31.360
the German federal administration and also within some German lenders. So compliance

25:31.360 --> 25:36.080
to any standard that exists for the public sector is really important for the project.

25:36.120 --> 25:39.880
And it's good because it allows to also improve the open source projects that are behind, that

25:39.880 --> 25:41.880
are being bundled in the platform.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.880
Yeah.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.880
Yeah.

25:45.880 --> 25:52.880
Yeah. So, I mean, we are super vendors like OpenProject or XWiki. For us, the perspective

25:53.400 --> 26:00.400
is a little bit different on that whole project of the whole OpenDesk because we already have

26:00.640 --> 26:06.240
a product. We already have clients. We already have a roadmap. And then suddenly someone

26:06.240 --> 26:11.640
says, hey, we want to integrate you, but you should have the same look and feel. We want

26:11.640 --> 26:18.640
to have the single sign on. We want you to finally come together and create deep integrations.

26:18.800 --> 26:25.800
So that is challenging for us because usually we tend to stay in our own soup because it's

26:26.200 --> 26:31.200
easier to build stuff in our own software. And integrations are complex. You need to

26:31.200 --> 26:36.200
organize. You need to find collaboration, like meetings with others, line roadmaps and

26:36.200 --> 26:41.200
important priorities. That's difficult. And now suddenly someone from the outside comes

26:41.200 --> 26:44.200
like, no, we want you guys to work together.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.200
And we will pay you, actually.

26:46.200 --> 26:53.200
Yes. So by integrating two very, very multiple different types of applications, we are going

26:55.800 --> 27:01.160
to build very deeply specialized applications. By integrating them, we create a multiple

27:01.160 --> 27:07.000
value. We multiply the value instead of everyone brewing their own soup. So also for us, it's

27:07.000 --> 27:14.000
a huge chance because if, let's say, XWiki is integrating with us, then maybe their clients,

27:15.800 --> 27:20.400
which are also likely to use OpenProject, would also book OpenProject, like the professional

27:20.400 --> 27:27.400
services. So for us, it's a huge, huge opportunity. And with OpenDesk, it comes like, okay, the

27:29.600 --> 27:34.600
German government also wants that it's easy to procure so that not every little city needs

27:34.600 --> 27:37.600
to go through a tender.

27:37.600 --> 27:38.600
Tender processes.

27:38.600 --> 27:45.600
Tender processes. So it will be much easier for a small city to book services from us.

27:46.600 --> 27:51.600
Right? So, and with that, we can build better software and we can better integrate.

27:51.600 --> 27:58.600
So maybe some challenges before we dive into more, like how we create integrations, basically.

28:00.600 --> 28:05.600
So some challenges that we see today is integration between the UI and the UX, so the products,

28:05.600 --> 28:11.600
of course, it's difficult to, well, basically not all software are created equals when it

28:11.600 --> 28:17.600
comes to the capacity to customize them because sometimes it has not been thought out from

28:17.600 --> 28:18.600
the beginning.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.600
Yeah.

28:19.600 --> 28:20.600
Oh, sorry.

28:20.600 --> 28:27.600
So there is a big challenge on UI and UX. There is also a question of overlapping features.

28:28.600 --> 28:34.600
Sometimes us as vendors, we create features like, we create, I don't know, like a task

28:34.600 --> 28:39.600
management feature in XWiki, which collides with OpenProject or a Wiki in OpenProject

28:39.600 --> 28:40.600
that collides with XWiki.

28:40.600 --> 28:47.600
Well, we have to find solutions for that, but usually we are like civilized, so it's okay.

28:48.600 --> 28:53.600
One issue is also like maintaining all these customizations that we are creating outside

28:53.600 --> 28:55.600
of the core of our products.

28:55.600 --> 29:00.600
So basically, we create an overlay that makes our application compatible with OpenDesk,

29:00.600 --> 29:03.600
but then like, how do we get the financing for that?

29:03.600 --> 29:05.600
Like, how do we maintain it?

29:05.600 --> 29:09.600
And if it's really difficult to maintain it across new versions, like, how do we do it?

29:09.600 --> 29:12.600
And so far, we need to find solutions on the long term for this.

29:13.600 --> 29:18.600
Talking about integrations, like, of course, these two systems, they don't exist only in

29:18.600 --> 29:19.600
OpenDesk.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.600
We exist outside OpenDesk as well.

29:21.600 --> 29:23.600
And then integration also makes sense.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.600
And those people might not have the whole OpenDesk infrastructure.

29:26.600 --> 29:30.600
So we always, when we build integrations, we want to build it in a way that is also suitable

29:30.600 --> 29:34.600
for other environments where the software could run separately.

29:34.600 --> 29:35.600
Exactly.

29:35.600 --> 29:36.600
Exactly.

29:36.600 --> 29:39.600
And so last thing is a creation of offerings.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.600
We mentioned the fact that other EU countries are interested.

29:42.600 --> 29:48.600
So apart from Germany, so that's going to be a challenge on the long term to find ways

29:48.600 --> 29:55.600
to provide OpenDesk in the public sector, maybe for other actors or even for the private sector.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.600
Yep.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.600
So.

29:57.600 --> 29:58.600
Yeah.

29:58.600 --> 30:05.600
To also go a little bit into an example for, I always like to talk about integrations because

30:05.600 --> 30:10.600
I think this is where the power lies in collaboration.

30:10.600 --> 30:14.600
I want to go into one example that I was working on with my team.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.600
That's the NextCloud and OpenProject integration.

30:17.600 --> 30:25.600
I somewhat sub-staffed this already presented last year here, but I want to have a different

30:25.600 --> 30:27.600
point of view on that.

30:27.600 --> 30:28.600
So quickly, okay.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.600
So NextCloud is mainly for us here today.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.600
It's a file storage platform.

30:33.600 --> 30:37.600
And OpenProject is something like, let's say, Jira or something like that.

30:37.600 --> 30:43.600
So you create and organize your work in work packages, issues, whatever you call them.

30:43.600 --> 30:50.600
And you can have them organized in gun charts or boards or whatever you need.

30:50.600 --> 30:51.600
So, okay.

30:51.600 --> 30:56.600
So we have a file management environment and we have a project management environment.

30:56.600 --> 31:01.600
And the outside perspective, let's say the public sector, they have a different perspective

31:01.600 --> 31:02.600
on that.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.600
They are saying like, where are the files for my task?

31:04.600 --> 31:07.600
Two things in one sentence, right?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.600
Does everyone in my team have access?

31:09.600 --> 31:12.600
Oh, so we are in project management system.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.600
We're organizing our work.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.600
The files are in a different system.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.600
Access management, okay.

31:18.600 --> 31:23.600
The third problem is I want to do the same thing over and over again, like doing the same processes,

31:23.600 --> 31:28.600
having the same steps organized in projects, task by task by task by task.

31:28.600 --> 31:35.600
And also I want to have the same template files and the same folder structure, having this all again and again.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.600
And they both need to go together.

31:37.600 --> 31:45.600
So what they don't want is that we, as OpenProject, that we build our own file management system

31:45.600 --> 31:47.600
because NextCloud is pretty good at that.

31:47.600 --> 31:50.600
And it's also integrated in the desktop and so on.

31:50.600 --> 31:54.600
Like people want to work on files like in the NextCloud experience.

31:54.600 --> 32:01.600
But also NextCloud might not be the best choice for organizing complex projects.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.600
Okay, it has the deck, right?

32:03.600 --> 32:09.600
But if you really want to go a bit more professional, probably OpenProject is a good idea.

32:09.600 --> 32:13.600
So from the public sector, they don't want these tiny solutions.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.600
They want the integrated solutions, right?

32:15.600 --> 32:22.600
And also it's not only OpenDesk, like other clients like the City of Cologne

32:22.600 --> 32:27.600
or the University of Duisburg, Essen or the Deutsche Bahn.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.600
They want the integration. They don't want the separate solutions.

32:30.600 --> 32:37.600
For us, it's easier to focus, if we integrate, it's much easier to focus on project management.

32:37.600 --> 32:43.600
Why, for example, NextCloud could benefit from focus on file management and so on.

32:43.600 --> 32:48.600
So this integration creates a great value in the combination.

32:48.600 --> 32:55.600
And also it's interesting, like once already mentioned, if we work together,

32:55.600 --> 32:58.600
and it's like NextLogest and Example, but if we all work together,

32:58.600 --> 33:03.600
then the sales also becomes easier because we all have clients that the others don't have yet.

33:03.600 --> 33:09.600
And with that joining together, joining forces in the integration of sales,

33:09.600 --> 33:17.600
we together then can capture a bigger market, get more money to build more open source software.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.600
Okay, little examples for how this looks like.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.600
So this is OpenProject. You have a work package.

33:22.600 --> 33:28.600
And on the right-hand side, you see files that are related to that task, which is baking pizza.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.600
I love baking pizza.

33:30.600 --> 33:38.600
And the interesting thing is you can see the files that are necessary for this baking of pizza on the right-hand side.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.600
But the files are not an OpenProject. They are NextCloud.

33:40.600 --> 33:44.600
And in NextLog, when they change their name, this name will change here as well.

33:44.600 --> 33:48.600
If they change their location, these links will still work.

33:48.600 --> 33:55.600
So this deeply integrated reference integrity, that is what you need in order to get away from chaos.

33:55.600 --> 34:00.600
This is what actually organizations want. They want to get rid of chaos.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.600
They want to have control over this stuff.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.600
Access control.

34:04.600 --> 34:09.600
So for projects in OpenProject, you can have something that's called a project folder.

34:09.600 --> 34:16.600
So we, OpenProject, we create folders in NextCloud for which we manage the access.

34:16.600 --> 34:22.600
So members of a project, this is the scope of a team, right?

34:22.600 --> 34:25.600
They need to have the access to the stuff that they want to have access to.

34:25.600 --> 34:32.600
So we say, okay, here in NextCloud, these people have access to it, fully automatically managed.

34:32.600 --> 34:37.600
That helps people to keep the data where it belongs to, the files where they belong to.

34:37.600 --> 34:42.600
So we are working on this project. Here are the files. Put them there in that folder.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.600
Okay, don't put them anywhere else.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.600
And if you leave the company, they're still there, right?

34:46.600 --> 34:49.600
If you're in the organization, they're still there.

34:49.600 --> 35:00.600
And then on the NextCloud side, also deeply integrated, we can show you which task of work packages are actually relevant for that file

35:00.600 --> 35:02.600
or where this file is used in.

35:02.600 --> 35:08.600
Let's say you have a template file for an employment contract, right?

35:08.600 --> 35:13.600
So where is this used and in which contracts is that file used?

35:13.600 --> 35:20.600
So you can find them on the right-hand side, directly jump into the work package of OpenProject and find the processes there.

35:21.600 --> 35:33.600
So the bottom line is like integrated. We are much, much stronger.

35:33.600 --> 35:35.600
Exactly.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.600
Exactly. Okay.

35:37.600 --> 35:44.600
Thank you.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.600
Thank you. I think we have some time for questions.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.600
So...

35:48.600 --> 35:50.600
Yes, I'll do it.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.600
Are we going to have to figure out the way to answer that?

35:53.600 --> 35:55.600
Yeah.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.600
Oh, you're going to give him a question.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.600
Thanks for the talk.

35:59.600 --> 36:04.600
Are there any license requirements in order to integrate into the OpenDesk infrastructure?

36:04.600 --> 36:15.600
And second question is, which vendor, so to speak, is kind of the product owner of the dashboard and the top bar we saw,

36:15.600 --> 36:20.600
and what are the requirements for them, which all apps share?

36:20.600 --> 36:23.600
So the first question, okay.

36:23.600 --> 36:28.600
So for the first question on the license requirements, there are some requirements.

36:28.600 --> 36:39.600
So basically anything that you have to commit on OpenCode needs to match within the list of authorized license by the German administration,

36:39.600 --> 36:42.600
by the admins of OpenCode.

36:42.600 --> 36:48.600
The list is not fully compatible with the one that is provided by the OpenSource initiative.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.600
So it's a little bit shorter.

36:51.600 --> 37:00.600
Basically we found that the hard way, essentially when, for example, if you have a software, you package it as a Docker image,

37:00.600 --> 37:07.600
and then when you have to upload the Docker image on OpenCode, you have to provide an SBOM for it with the license,

37:07.600 --> 37:14.600
and then you found out that in the base Docker image that you are depending, there is a Pearl library with a weird license header,

37:14.600 --> 37:21.600
and so it creates an exception, and you have like three months of review to make sure that it's okay to have that in OpenDesk.

37:21.600 --> 37:22.600
So it's a little bit of a mess.

37:22.600 --> 37:26.600
There is a list available on OpenCode for the license.

37:26.600 --> 37:30.600
When it comes to product ownership, I'm not 100% sure.

37:30.600 --> 37:36.600
I believe that it's, so the design of the navigation bar,

37:36.600 --> 37:45.600
it's managed by the, I think it's managed by either Zendes, which is like handling the project at a high level,

37:45.600 --> 37:53.600
and Zendes has been helped by consulting, by PWC, which is doing consulting and usability tests on top of OpenDesk.

37:53.600 --> 37:56.600
And the same goes for the portal, I believe.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.600
Thank you. Any other questions?

37:58.600 --> 38:05.600
And technically the widget port that you saw, the answer is the Univention.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.600
Yeah, thank you again for the talk.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.600
I have two questions.

38:10.600 --> 38:11.600
One is very specific.

38:11.600 --> 38:15.600
I'm from Lassen, Germany, and I've heard of Project Phoenix.

38:15.600 --> 38:19.600
You wrote Project, or D-Project Phoenix.

38:19.600 --> 38:22.600
Is there some difference, or is it just that Project Phoenix?

38:22.600 --> 38:25.600
And the second question is, is there...

38:25.600 --> 38:27.600
Is there a data port over there?

38:27.600 --> 38:29.600
Okay, can I just phrase the second question?

38:29.600 --> 38:37.600
The second question is, if you're in the context of a company which does not have an own IT and stuff like that,

38:37.600 --> 38:40.600
but likes to keep to an open source software where you can switch vendors,

38:40.600 --> 38:46.600
are there vendors just providing this setup where you can get an account and use it for your company?

38:46.600 --> 38:52.600
There's the idea of the job of data port, for being one of the potential hosts of that D-Pheonics suite.

38:52.600 --> 38:59.600
So then you could get that product from there just by renting it.

38:59.600 --> 39:03.600
But I think they just offer the services to public administration.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.600
I'll try to answer it.

39:05.600 --> 39:11.600
I'm a part of the Project Phoenix and also have a little insight of OpenDesk.

39:11.600 --> 39:19.600
The thing is Phoenix is a branch of this OpenDesk, and what was your question exactly?

39:19.600 --> 39:21.600
They just wrote D-Projects.

39:21.600 --> 39:28.600
Yeah, it's the same. There was some name changes on the way to the product.

39:28.600 --> 39:34.600
D means data port, they dropped it, and now it's Phoenix, so it's basically the same product.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.600
Is that like the second generation?

39:36.600 --> 39:39.600
No, no, no, it's just renaming, you know?

39:39.600 --> 39:45.600
And is there a possibility just to rent this somewhere for small companies who don't run an own IT?

39:45.600 --> 39:51.600
Not to my knowledge, but if there is a high demand on that, that will be possible.

39:51.600 --> 40:01.600
They already do it for some customers, so maybe it's a question of strategy and how much this is asked.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.600
It's Helm charts, right?

40:04.600 --> 40:09.600
So the idea is that it's easy for any host to host it.

40:09.600 --> 40:13.600
And then just to protect... Ah, there's Markus.

40:13.600 --> 40:15.600
You have a mind set?

40:15.600 --> 40:21.600
I'm going to take the questions in order.

40:21.600 --> 40:25.600
But the idea is that it's easy to host it, right?

40:25.600 --> 40:31.600
It shall be easy for any organization in the public sector to simply say,

40:31.600 --> 40:39.600
I have a data center, I just rented somewhere, and I just pull up the hand charts and off we go.

40:39.600 --> 40:46.600
Okay, you mentioned that this German strategy was to put this 23 million in year 2023.

40:46.600 --> 40:52.600
So my question is how does it go forwards on the funding side?

40:52.600 --> 40:54.600
It depends on the German farmers.

40:54.600 --> 41:03.600
Is there kind of a guaranteed maintenance for this code, or like who is taking care of the boring stuff, the security patches and all?

41:03.600 --> 41:05.600
I don't know.

41:05.600 --> 41:07.600
I don't know.

41:07.600 --> 41:15.600
So the budget allocated to the project depends on what's being voted in the parliament.

41:15.600 --> 41:19.600
There are budget cuts nowadays.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.600
I think so.

41:21.600 --> 41:26.600
I'm not 100% sure, but globally there is still budget on the project.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.600
It's about half of what we had last year.

41:30.600 --> 41:34.600
The budget repetition is another issue, right?

41:34.600 --> 41:40.600
It's basically like around 30 million dedicated to open projects in 2024 to be validated.

41:40.600 --> 41:42.600
Open desks, sorry.

41:45.600 --> 41:48.600
And sorry, what was the second question again?

41:48.600 --> 41:52.600
Who's handling the long-term maintenance of the security patches?

41:52.600 --> 41:58.600
So the goal on the long term is essentially to find a business model so that whenever you are deploying an open desk,

41:59.600 --> 42:06.600
there is a team that is managing basically the packaging of open desks, making sure that the Helm chart are up to date, et cetera.

42:06.600 --> 42:13.600
So this team needs to find some funding, and the idea would be to have, like, if you are taking professional support, basically the team would get a part of the funding.

42:13.600 --> 42:18.600
And then the idea is also to redistribute this funding to the vendors themselves in some way.

42:18.600 --> 42:23.600
The specifics of this distribution here, they are not fully defined, basically,

42:23.600 --> 42:30.600
because we are really right at the point where we have this default implementation of open desk that is just going out.

42:30.600 --> 42:36.600
And now there is a second step of finding the first clients and making sure that it deploys properly, basically.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.600
Okay, any other questions?

42:43.600 --> 42:47.600
I'm going to take some people that haven't spoken just for, like, distribution.

42:48.600 --> 42:49.600
Thank you.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.600
First of all, thanks for the talk.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.600
That's a really interesting project.

42:54.600 --> 43:11.600
And I just wanted to ask if there is an interest of at some point adding any repository tools or, for instance, I don't know, pipelining CI CD tools to the platform?

43:11.600 --> 43:14.600
I will repeat the question so that it's registered.

43:14.600 --> 43:15.600
I'm so sorry.

43:15.600 --> 43:17.600
So that it's registered.

43:17.600 --> 43:21.600
Whether there's any integration of repository or pipelining?

43:21.600 --> 43:23.600
Right now, yeah.

43:23.600 --> 43:24.600
Right now not.

43:24.600 --> 43:26.600
I personally think it makes perfect sense.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.600
I would very much welcome that.

43:29.600 --> 43:34.600
And I guess it's just like knocking at the door at vendors and saying, hey, we want to have this.

43:34.600 --> 43:35.600
Hello.

43:35.600 --> 43:36.600
Hello.

43:36.600 --> 43:37.600
Okay.

43:37.600 --> 43:38.600
Yeah.

43:38.600 --> 43:46.600
So you said there is unified procurement so you can buy license for all the different softwares if you want, like professional support and stuff.

43:46.600 --> 43:49.600
Is there also like a single point of contact for support?

43:49.600 --> 43:57.600
If I want to self-host this and have some issues with any of the softwares in the suite, who do I ask if I have problems?

43:57.600 --> 44:01.600
And is there someone who can help me and do I have to know which software has the problem?

44:01.600 --> 44:03.600
And also second question, what's your favorite pizza?

44:03.600 --> 44:04.600
Thank you.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.600
Okay.

44:06.600 --> 44:07.600
Good question.

44:07.600 --> 44:11.600
So the question is like, is there central support for the whole product?

44:11.600 --> 44:16.600
And actually, I don't know that much.

44:16.600 --> 44:18.600
I think it's not different yet.

44:18.600 --> 44:19.600
Yeah.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.600
Something that needs to be developed.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.600
It's part of what you said about the whole package.

44:23.600 --> 44:26.600
It's part of the discussion on the business model, basically.

44:26.600 --> 44:33.600
But I think it's more important to be first built the software now integrated and make it open source and available for everyone for free.

44:33.600 --> 44:36.600
And second question, the favorite pizza.

44:36.600 --> 44:37.600
Oh yeah.

44:37.600 --> 44:38.600
There are many.

44:38.600 --> 44:39.600
Okay.

44:39.600 --> 44:40.600
How are you?

44:40.600 --> 44:42.600
No, how are you?

44:42.600 --> 44:43.600
Okay.

44:43.600 --> 44:50.600
Maybe one last question because it's about like, it's about 40 seconds left and then we have to go to the next question.

44:50.600 --> 44:55.600
Let me go back there.

44:55.600 --> 44:59.600
Not just not a question, but a remark.

44:59.600 --> 45:00.600
Hi, I'm Renee.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.600
I'm with Zenders for two days now.

45:02.600 --> 45:07.600
And I'll be happy to take any questions or feedback on Open Desk with me.

45:07.600 --> 45:08.600
I'll be out to talk.

45:08.600 --> 45:09.600
Thank you.

45:09.600 --> 45:10.600
Okay.

45:10.600 --> 45:11.600
Okay.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.600
Really cool.

45:12.600 --> 45:13.600
Sure.

45:13.600 --> 45:20.600
So my question is there are huge parts of software stack that are still, I think, vendor tied outside of, for example, just office software, I guess.

45:20.600 --> 45:25.600
So is there a way to get the software stack to be open source?

45:25.600 --> 45:26.600
Yeah.

45:26.600 --> 45:32.600
So I think it's a good idea to have a lot of people who are interested in the software stack.

45:32.600 --> 45:38.600
So I think it's a good idea to have a lot of people who are interested in the software stack.

45:38.600 --> 45:39.600
Yeah.

45:39.600 --> 45:47.600
So I think it's a good idea to have a lot of people who are interested in the software stack.

45:47.600 --> 45:50.600
For example, like GitHub is one of the biggest ones.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.600
There is an alternative in GitLab.

45:53.600 --> 45:58.600
And operating systems, BIOS, hardware.

45:58.600 --> 46:03.600
I mean, I physically have problems to understand the question.

46:03.600 --> 46:04.600
So what's the question?

46:04.600 --> 46:07.600
Like if there are other software going to be integrated or?

46:07.600 --> 46:16.600
There is a huge part of the computer science ecosystem such as going down from hardware all the way up to operating systems.

46:16.600 --> 46:17.600
So the different layers.

46:17.600 --> 46:18.600
Different layers.

46:18.600 --> 46:21.600
Is there, you know, movements to free those?

46:21.600 --> 46:22.600
Yeah.

46:22.600 --> 46:27.600
So OpenDesk focuses on the desk, the working desk.

46:27.600 --> 46:32.600
So the tools that you need on your machine in order to work together.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.600
That's the current scope.

46:34.600 --> 46:39.600
There's not the scope of controlling the hardware or the operating system.

46:39.600 --> 46:42.600
That's a different story.

46:42.600 --> 46:43.600
Thank you.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.600
Thank you very much.

46:45.600 --> 46:47.600
Thank you.
