00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
So everyone, welcome back to the Open Web Alliance Dev Room.

00:11.000 --> 00:20.000
Oh man. Cut that bit. Cut that bit. Welcome back to the Open Web site Alliance.

00:20.000 --> 00:29.000
Open Web site Alliance launched today. So I'm allowed to practice it saying it three more times before it has to be free of mistakes.

00:29.000 --> 00:46.000
So in this Open Web site Alliance Dev Room, we're now going to proceed with two friends from the Type 3 community and from the Mitwald hosting company talking about accessibility and content management systems.

00:46.000 --> 00:55.000
And they are going to be so kind and work their way in over the next 40 seconds to get started talking. Please Martin and Lucas.

00:55.000 --> 01:05.000
Alright, thank you so much. Thanks for the intro. Good morning. Can we still say good morning? It's before 12. Yeah, we... Alright.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
Alright, good morning everyone. We're going to be talking about accessibility and content management systems. We're going to get back to that bit in a second.

01:13.000 --> 01:25.000
I'm Martin. I work at Mitwald, responsible for developer relations over there. In case you don't know Mitwald, we're a hosting company from Germany.

01:25.000 --> 01:38.000
We specialize on providing the support for agencies, mostly in the open source CMS space. I also do some lecturing on computer science.

01:39.000 --> 01:52.000
And just a little disclaimer. I only have started learning about web accessibility recently, most of which I know I actually have learned from Lucas who's standing right next to me.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.000
Yeah, I'm Lucas and accessibility is quite a personal topic for me as you might have noticed already.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
So I have personal experience with a lot of issues you run into if you have some accessibility needs.

02:09.000 --> 02:24.000
And I'm a project developer at Mitwald, I think four years I started at Mitwald. And about ten years I'm a freelance web-based developer and developed themes, plugins, custom solutions and stuff like this.

02:24.000 --> 02:41.000
Yes, and I have advocated for this topic in our company for a long time now and now it's starting to get some action. And so we are here and talking about accessibility today.

02:42.000 --> 02:58.000
So I think or I might speculate that one reason this topic has been gaining traction in the past few months, years is that there's new legislation coming up.

02:58.000 --> 03:17.000
Like for example the European Accessibility Act comes into effect I think next year. There are also other laws that pertain to the same direction like in the US there's the Americans with Disabilities Act which has been around for a while, I think since the 90s actually.

03:18.000 --> 03:43.000
So I think this might be a reason that some people start seeing this now. But in the next 30 minutes we actually plan to convince you that fear of legislation should not be the actual reason to consider accessibility as something that's a good idea.

03:43.000 --> 03:58.000
Because in actuality it's about enabling access for everyone and not getting sued should not be your primary motivation for this. Like in a perfect world we shouldn't actually need to have these laws.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
So it should just make natural sense to be as accessible and inclusive to everyone.

04:06.000 --> 04:11.000
Sorry, I'm getting confused.

04:12.000 --> 04:28.000
To understand what we are talking about today we first need to define some things and mostly there are different kinds of barriers you can get to if you have some accessibility needs.

04:29.000 --> 04:34.000
And we've listed some here on the slide in a second.

04:35.000 --> 04:48.000
First of all there are perceptual difficulties you can get. For example if you have some vision and disabilities, a lot of you wearing glasses, discounts as well.

04:48.000 --> 04:58.000
And all of you have heard about color blindness by now, contrast issues and stuff like this. These are the most obvious things a lot of people think about.

04:59.000 --> 05:13.000
But there are motoric issues as you can see. I mainly use my right hand so it's difficult for me to do stuff like a lot of keyboard shortcuts are quite difficult.

05:13.000 --> 05:25.000
And stuff like this or maybe you have Parkinson disorder and you can't do small movements or keep your hands still. This is another problem.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
Mental and cognitive issues I think all of you have heard about ADHD.

05:32.000 --> 05:40.000
It's difficult to concentrate for people with ADHD if something is moving on your website or even on slides.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
Yesterday as well as the slide where an animated GIF was running all the time it was really hard to concentrate even for me.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
And someone with ADHD would have really, really much trouble concentrating on such stuff.

05:54.000 --> 06:01.000
And videos or animations on websites, it's the same issue. So think about this when doing such stuff.

06:02.000 --> 06:08.000
Remembering stuff especially in our short time memory might be quite difficult for some.

06:09.000 --> 06:18.000
In marketing there's the rule to just put at most eight items in your menu. This is one of the points so think about this as well.

06:19.000 --> 06:29.000
And then there are two more topics we want to talk about because there are also technical and economical aspects to accessibility.

06:29.000 --> 06:39.000
Maybe not all of the people want or can buy new devices, a new smartphone every year or because of environmental reasons they just don't want to.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
So technical accessibility is a problem as well.

06:48.000 --> 06:57.000
And maybe your TV we have some TVs in our company which has very low contrast ratios.

06:57.000 --> 07:08.000
We're actually in secret hoping to have one of these fitting university beamers just to bring across the point better but actually turn out to be alright.

07:09.000 --> 07:18.000
But you can see it in the top right corner. The Mid-World logo is quite difficult to see because it's white text on white background, not a good example.

07:18.000 --> 07:28.000
And maybe you have one of the famous low internet connections in the famous Deutsche Bahn.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
Then you will run into trouble as well.

07:32.000 --> 07:57.000
Yeah and of course low-end and all the devices I just talked about and you have to keep in mind that sometimes financial problems correlate to physical disabilities because people already have to spend much money on accessibility devices like wheelchairs and stuff like this and don't have that much money to put into technical devices.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
I think disability also correlates with unemployment a little bit.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
And if it's not a disability as mine you might also have a disability sometime.

08:11.000 --> 08:23.000
Maybe later your eyes get worse or you have a temporal disability, a colleague of mine tore his Achilles heel last year I guess and suddenly he noticed how hard it is to get up the stairs at the office.

08:24.000 --> 08:39.000
So everyone could be affected sometime or even if you just hold your coffee cup in the kitchen suddenly you only have one hand to use your smartphone and such stuff.

08:40.000 --> 08:48.000
And a lot of you might be the kind of keyboard nerd who likes to use the terminal for all his stuff and such.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
And such people will be happy to use your website only by keyboard as well.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
So accessibility needs can always be a personal preference.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.000
Yeah so with JusticeCast there are a lot of aspects you have to think about.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
Some of you might think this is really expensive, this must be really hard work.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
But in fact it's not that difficult.

09:19.000 --> 09:30.000
So I think about many people think about like adding accessibility after the fact which I can imagine does get painful because there is a development effort in that.

09:31.000 --> 09:40.000
So obviously the most obvious recommendation would be to just consider accessibility from the start if you're starting on a green field.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
Then it's actually not that difficult if you think about it from the get go and just think about it as a quality measure.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Like you would also think about code quality.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
I'm guessing who's a developer actually.

09:57.000 --> 10:04.000
So most people, I would guess most of you wouldn't also think about skipping testing.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
That would be insane.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
And really irresponsible wouldn't it?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
I see some people struggling.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Like who would do that?

10:15.000 --> 10:25.000
And even if you're arguing about money, if you're building an inaccessible product you're actively excluding users from your product.

10:26.000 --> 10:35.000
And I think there's estimations it's potentially about 15 to 27th percent of users that you're excluding.

10:36.000 --> 10:42.000
So if you're taking measures to include these users that's going to pay for itself in profit.

10:43.000 --> 10:50.000
And even if you're not starting on a green field there are also synergy effects with other quality goals.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
For example we've talked about sensory issues.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
For example if you have a limited vision or limited hearing and you provide audio content like podcasts or video streams.

11:04.000 --> 11:10.000
And one measure that you could take is to provide a transcript for that, for your audio content.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
Now if you have a transcript that's text and a search engine can crawl it.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Boom! Instant SEO.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
We've also talked about accessibility issues on lower end devices.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
Because not everyone wants to buy a new iPhone 15 for 1500 bucks every year.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
I don't want to.

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
So if you're targeting lower end devices you need to start thinking about limiting resource consumption.

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Being more efficiently you need to start thinking about performance optimizations.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.000
Which in itself is also an important quality goal.

11:53.000 --> 11:58.000
Which I'm just thinking about now is that this also has a sustainability impact.

11:59.000 --> 12:08.000
Because you're enabling users to keep older devices longer before they need to be replaced before they become obsolete.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
You also minimize resource consumption.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
You also minimize battery drainage on mobile devices for example.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
So that's also an important synergy.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
There are some quality goals where it gets a little bit more complicated.

12:24.000 --> 12:31.000
So for example when we talk about security there might be some trade-offs that you need to make concerning accessibility.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
I think a general rule of thumb might be the higher your security requirements are,

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
you need to start thinking about accessibility to not become a problem.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
For example if you're enforcing multi-factor authentication you need to think about a way to make that accessible.

12:51.000 --> 13:00.000
If you're in even higher security areas like if you want users to use TLS client certificates or some things like that.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
That's a very high cognitive load that you're placing on users.

13:06.000 --> 13:11.000
Last week I used my German EID card for the first time to log into a service.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
That's not for everyone.

13:16.000 --> 13:20.000
I honestly have no idea if there's an accessible way to actually do that.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.000
This is not an impossible problem.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
There are guidelines for this and I'm just skipping a little bit ahead to the actual solutions.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
There are guidelines on that and there are guidelines on accessible authorization.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
Most of these boil down to reducing cognitive load on authentication.

13:42.000 --> 13:48.000
The recommendation is that your authentication process should not be dependent on a cognitive function test.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Who remembers those?

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
This is...

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
Can anyone of you solve this? I can't.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
This is just ridiculous.

14:07.000 --> 14:16.000
Luckily these have gotten a little bit out of fashion lately because probably at the moment AIs can solve these better than we can.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
There are ways around that.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.000
It starts with simple things like if you have a username password.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
Remembering a password is also a cognitive function test but you can use a password manager.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
You can copy paste the password into a password input field.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.000
Don't prevent that.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
You remember those password forms where you can copy paste into...

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Yeah, that sucks.

14:44.000 --> 14:51.000
If you're requiring multi-factor authentication, I think there are new standards coming up that we can use to make it more accessible like web authentication, like pass keys.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
All of those reduce cognitive load on the authentication process.

14:57.000 --> 15:01.000
So that are things we need to start thinking about and need to start thinking about implementing them.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
And users without disabilities also benefit from pass keys, for example, because it's just a matter of comfort for those.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
Absolutely.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
Now let's talk a bit about cognitive management systems because this is why we are here.

15:21.000 --> 15:26.000
And in cognitive management systems you have two sides of the same kind, I think.

15:27.000 --> 15:34.000
On the one side you want to provide accessible content to the end user, so to speak.

15:35.000 --> 15:48.000
So one important part is that our editors have the option, the possibility to create awesome and accessible content at first.

15:49.000 --> 15:54.000
And of course the editing experience itself, so the backend should be accessible as well.

15:54.000 --> 16:00.000
So that the editors itself with accessibility needs can edit the content.

16:01.000 --> 16:12.000
And think of a blind user who is trying to create his or her own block and share their experiences to the world.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
They need to use a cognitive management system.

16:16.000 --> 16:24.000
Yes, for the front and sides, so to speak, there's the web content accessibility guidelines.

16:25.000 --> 16:30.000
This is the most basic stuff I hope most of you might have heard this by now.

16:31.000 --> 16:40.000
It's things like alt text for images, using anchor tags for links, using semantic HTML, I will run about this in a second.

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
And then there's the editing side, there's the authoring tool accessibility guidelines.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
This is especially important for CMS systems.

16:58.000 --> 17:06.000
We won't go into detail on this because everything you need to know about this, you will read in the documentation.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
But we want to highlight some of the most important things.

17:11.000 --> 17:16.000
One of the most important things is using semantic HTML.

17:17.000 --> 17:26.000
And I would hope this wouldn't be necessary to say these days, but a lot of people get this wrong still today.

17:27.000 --> 17:35.000
Use a semantic HTML on the screen, you can see the header and the nuths who have replaced this in HTML5.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
But it starts with the basics.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.000
Use list tags in your HTML if you mean this is a list.

17:44.000 --> 17:49.000
You see in the wild you still see a lot of paragraphs all starting with a dash.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
This is garbage for screen reader users. They can't use this.

17:54.000 --> 18:05.000
So please use semantic HTML and most importantly make it easy for the users of the cognitive management system to use this semantic HTML.

18:06.000 --> 18:16.000
Maybe provide some automatic functions like if a paragraph starts with a dash automatically converted to an unordered list, you can skip to the next.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
And provide such automatic features.

18:24.000 --> 18:29.000
A lot of you might use some messages who do this by now.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
And our CMS should do this as well.

18:34.000 --> 18:43.000
I think a good example for how this really works out is this is a screenshot from the word for spec end.

18:44.000 --> 18:51.000
Where you have this semantic outline view where you can actually see the hierarchy of your headings.

18:52.000 --> 18:59.000
And the system also points out where you did something where you built it inconsistently.

18:59.000 --> 19:07.000
And this is really important to enable editors to build consistent content structures.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Because screen readers actually built on those.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I think Jaws is one of the most prominent screen readers.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
It actually offers navigation options based on the hierarchy of headings.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
So if you mess that up you're also going to mess up the screen reader.

19:23.000 --> 19:33.000
So I think what CMS in general should do is to discourage users from just placing certain kind of headings for aesthetic reasons.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Because people do that.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.000
I see and through the yes, the nodding.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Yeah.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
So there should be ways to discourage that even if it's just pointing out where things went wrong.

19:47.000 --> 19:55.000
And we also need options to be able to configure the CMS to prevent users from doing that.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Like this is a screenshot from the type of three backend.

19:59.000 --> 20:06.000
In which as an integrator you really need to know how to configure the system to prevent users for example from.

20:07.000 --> 20:16.000
Above there is the content element heading which is I think in the default distribution it's rendered as an H2.

20:17.000 --> 20:26.000
But nothing prevents an editor from inserting their own H1 into the body of the content element itself which will mess up the hierarchy of headings.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
You can disable that as an integrator and you should but you need to think about it and you need to remember it.

20:31.000 --> 20:39.000
For example the Gutenberg editor in Watpers and they also have the option to set as custom H1 heading.

20:40.000 --> 20:52.000
And for the websites I develop I mostly disable this option deliberately so the users who edit the pages cannot make this one by accident.

20:52.000 --> 21:03.000
I think in general there are some parallels to search engine optimization aren't there?

21:04.000 --> 21:12.000
Because if it's a screen reader or a search engine you need to be able to build your site in a way that a machine can make sense of it.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
And that's why it's so important to adhere to.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
Basically it all boils down to adhere to the standard.

21:21.000 --> 21:29.000
Another thing that we'd like to point out is users are going to have certain expectations around how a system works.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
I read a case study a while ago on the type of 3 block.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I think CPS did it.

21:35.000 --> 21:41.000
They tested the type of 3 back end with 2 or 3 blind users.

21:41.000 --> 21:52.000
And I think the gist of it was that you already can use the type of 3 back end right now with a screen reader if you have received appropriate training in doing so.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
So if you're in that situation you're going to have...

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
You're relying on the system working in the way you were trained and you're expecting it to do.

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
So the most important thing is to not break the expectations that users place upon the system.

22:13.000 --> 22:17.000
This goes in very, very, very many different ways.

22:18.000 --> 22:22.000
One example are conventions around the menu structure.

22:23.000 --> 22:30.000
Each and every CMS back end has some kind of menu structure and there are conventions and there are expectations around where things are placed in that menu.

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
This especially gets important when we're talking about plugins or extensions or modules or whatever.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
Many names, same thing.

22:42.000 --> 22:52.000
Because we're not only talking about the CMS course, we're also talking about the ecosystems around the CMS, the third party extensions that extend those systems.

22:53.000 --> 23:08.000
So what we thought of as important is that extension authors should be encouraged to adhere to the conventions that are applied to the navigation structure in the CMS back end, for example.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
Another thing are UI components, for example.

23:13.000 --> 23:24.000
I think there are some WordPress plugins that completely roll their own UI library that behaves entirely different than the rest of the CMS.

23:26.000 --> 23:36.000
If you're relying on having your expectations around how the system works being met, then this would really confuse you.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
One other thing is clutter.

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
I think this is a screenshot from a fairly representative WordPress back end.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
This is the plugin list.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Let's have a look at this.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
That's a feedback prompt.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
That's another feedback prompt.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
That's an add.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
That's another add.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
That's a maintenance message.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
We talked about ADHD, didn't we?

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
I also don't know what would happen if you would pipe that through a screen reader.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.000
I honestly don't know.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
Nothing good, probably.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
This is another screenshot.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
This is the WordPress...

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Was it the same site?

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
Yes, it was the same site.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
The dashboard itself, same site.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
The same feedback prompt.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Another feedback prompt.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.000
Another maintenance.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
That's an add.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
That's completely useless.

24:40.000 --> 24:47.000
I want to point out this new section is from the podcast plugin in this installation.

24:48.000 --> 24:53.000
The news in this widget are about digital cameras, YouTube videos.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.000
It's nothing about podcasts.

24:57.000 --> 25:01.000
You can disable all those as a user,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.000
but you're still being confronted with the cognitive load of...

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
You need to make sense of it at least once.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
You can disable.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
This is the perfect handover to my next talking point.

25:17.000 --> 25:22.000
It's about giving the user the choice and respect choices the user has already made.

25:23.000 --> 25:31.000
As you just saw in the WordPress dashboard, users can disable the widgets in the dashboard,

25:32.000 --> 25:39.000
but there are a lot of more choices the user has already made when using your system.

25:40.000 --> 25:45.000
All of the operating systems nowadays provide some kind of dark mode, for example.

25:45.000 --> 25:52.000
It's really easy to use the dark mode setting in the CSS you can click, I think.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
We messed up the order in this list.

26:01.000 --> 26:05.000
Another point is opening links in new tabs.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
I often see that suddenly a new tab opens.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.000
For me, this is quite normal because I know the tab system.

26:15.000 --> 26:21.000
I'm used to this, but when giving courses to my clients, I can see that they get often confused.

26:22.000 --> 26:31.000
Once it was some worker in a school, I think, she tried to do something in the WordPress backend.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
A new tab opened. For me, this was obvious.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
She tried to use the back button of her browser, and she didn't get back where she was before.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.000
Her solution was closing the browser window completely and starting from scratch.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
This was pain in the ass, not good use.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
I think my mom would do that too.

26:50.000 --> 26:57.000
Of course, a lot of people do this because they don't use the PC or the browser that often as we do.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Think about these users.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
Give the user the option to open links in new tabs.

27:03.000 --> 27:10.000
All of us could just hold the control or command key, and other users might use a wide click open in new tab.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Give the user this choice.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
He or she knows when he or she wants it.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
Now I have two clicks, so I can see my next point.

27:21.000 --> 27:27.000
The user can select a font size, a minimal font size, and the browser settings.

27:27.000 --> 27:33.000
This is very important for people wearing glasses, or maybe later if your version gets worse.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
We have a colleague whose IDE is set to 48 points. It's really, really large.

27:39.000 --> 27:45.000
You might imagine, but for him, it's the best way to code.

27:46.000 --> 27:53.000
The IDE respects this choice, and so should you on your website.

27:54.000 --> 28:00.000
Just the other evening we were reminiscing about building websites in the old days.

28:01.000 --> 28:10.000
Do you remember when websites had their own buttons to adjust the font size on the site?

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
You remember that?

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Something to do.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.000
That's completely attributable because the browser does it for you.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.000
You don't work against the browser.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
I'm the next talking point I already talked about before.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.000
It's a reduced motion and video auto play. Just don't.

28:32.000 --> 28:38.000
I think every one of us is annoyed by auto playing videos on news pages.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
It's the worst stuff.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
A reduced motion is a CSS property.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
Maybe you can click through so we can see the CSS snippets.

28:48.000 --> 29:01.000
The browser these days implement the choices you can easily opt in and reduce smooth scrolling or animations if the user has chosen to do.

29:02.000 --> 29:07.000
This is minimal effort, but a lot of users will benefit from this.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Increased contrast and color version.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
I've already talked about this.

29:12.000 --> 29:17.000
Just think about that some colors might have the same gray value, so to speak.

29:18.000 --> 29:32.000
Once during my college lessons we had another student who asked my professor what this large circle on the slide is about.

29:33.000 --> 29:39.000
It was a pie chart, but all of the slices of this pie chart had different colors.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
It was obvious for us, but for him it was just a gray large circle.

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
Because yes, he can only see gray scale. No colors at all.

29:49.000 --> 29:53.000
We didn't know this till this moment, but for him it was really difficult.

29:54.000 --> 30:03.000
One thing I always went about when trying to play some games with my friends is I'm casting keyboard bindings.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Some games allow you to change keyboard bindings.

30:06.000 --> 30:14.000
Some games don't and some of these games I just cannot play because I can only use one hand when gaming.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
You still beat me every time in each of these games.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Yeah, sorry.

30:20.000 --> 30:26.000
Maybe give the user the option to set some keyboard bindings even in your CMS.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
This could be customizable.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Think about such stuff.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
It really, really helps some people.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.000
Yeah.

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
This is an argument I also hear quite often.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.000
Thank you.

31:36.000 --> 31:50.000
Image with text in it is not readable by the search functionality of your wiki.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
Much into the technical details of accessibility.

32:11.000 --> 32:18.000
Our goal was to basically make you think about why accessibility is important and what it's actually supposed to solve.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
I'm seeing the animation order on the next slide is going to be messed up. Apologies for that.

32:23.000 --> 32:44.000
I would encourage you to think about accessibility not just as a feature that your PO can throw into your backlog and you can tell yourself that you're going to build it when you have the time, even although you already know that you're not.

32:45.000 --> 32:54.000
Please also don't think about accessibility just as risk avoidance so that we don't get sued.

32:55.000 --> 33:03.000
So if you want to think about accessibility as anything, just think about it as a human right that everyone should have and enjoy.

33:04.000 --> 33:10.000
It's just about making your product as accessible and as inclusive as you can for everyone.

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
And there's the last animation step I said the order is messed up.

33:19.000 --> 33:23.000
All the technical stuff, all the accessibility guidelines, you can test this.

33:23.000 --> 33:29.000
There are automated test rates, you can pipe it through light holes and light holes, gives you a green check mark for example.

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
But don't add accessibility just to have that green check mark, you need to understand what you're actually doing it for.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Thank you.

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
I didn't drop it.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
Wonderful. Congratulations. Thank you very much.

33:45.000 --> 33:56.000
In my experience, thinking about accessibility, two things really surprised me in my path.

33:56.000 --> 34:02.000
And the first was the realization that there are temporal moments where we're all less abled.

34:02.000 --> 34:09.000
Like walk out into the bright Brussels sunshine and look at your phone screen or carry anything or have a child or you know.

34:09.000 --> 34:15.000
So I found the idea that we're all in that category on a sliding scale all the time, really interesting.

34:15.000 --> 34:22.000
And then as a marketer actually, accessibility, if your motives are not pure,

34:22.000 --> 34:31.000
and not moral, and not ethical for a second, your total addressable market for any given thing goes up by including more people, right?

34:31.000 --> 34:38.000
And if you, and the more semantic data, the more machine readable data you have is the more

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
accessible, is better for SEO, is better for making sales, right?

34:42.000 --> 34:48.000
So there's no cogent business argument in my mind to not making accessibility, right?

34:48.000 --> 34:53.000
Yeah. So any questions for the, from the room before we break for lunch?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000
I'm sorry.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
I'm sorry.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
I'm sorry.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
I'm sorry.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.000
I'm sorry.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.000
I'm sorry.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
I'm sorry.

35:01.000 --> 35:02.000
I'm sorry.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.000
I'm sorry.

35:03.000 --> 35:04.000
I'm sorry.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.000
I'm sorry.

35:05.000 --> 35:09.000
Any questions for the, from the room before we break for lunch?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Yes, please.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
You should never mention lunch.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.000
Unless your question is what is for lunch, because I don't know.

35:17.000 --> 35:45.000
So the question in, and the question was if it's a bad thing to, to provide dark mode

35:45.000 --> 35:52.000
for the user, and the user is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to use

35:52.000 --> 36:01.000
it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and

36:01.000 --> 36:10.000
the user is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and the user

36:10.000 --> 36:17.000
is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed

36:17.000 --> 36:26.000
to use it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to use

36:26.000 --> 36:34.000
it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and

36:34.000 --> 36:41.000
the user is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and the user

36:41.000 --> 36:47.000
is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and the user is not

36:47.000 --> 36:53.000
allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to

36:53.000 --> 37:00.000
use it, and the user is not allowed to use it, and the user is not allowed to use it,

37:00.000 --> 37:05.000
and it is a struggle for dark mode, for example, but the default option should be to option

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
the user as chosen.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
Yes.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
All right, so, thank you very much.

37:15.000 --> 37:21.000
Thank you.
