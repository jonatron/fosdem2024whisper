WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.000
Welcome.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Okay, so hello everyone.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
Just a very quick introduction.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
My name is Lina Cevajos.

00:29.000 --> 00:34.000
I work with Policy at the Free Software Foundation Europe.

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
And yeah, I just want to make a little bit introduction about this session.

00:38.000 --> 00:45.000
If you have been here before, you have seen that we're trying to try different formats, doing workshops, fish bowls.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
And this format, we kind of like imagine it more as a discussion, kind of like what we have had.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
So you don't need to move, you just need to raise your hand.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
I will bring the microphone to you.

00:55.000 --> 01:06.000
And I also wanted this to be, you know, not like a technically like a Q&A, but more like less chat and let's try to find common ground.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
Yeah, so about the topic.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
So this is a, the session is on digital public services and interoperability.

01:15.000 --> 01:24.000
There will be a session more focused on, like that is not the digital public services later on.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.000
And because we're talking about this, we're going to have two parts.

01:30.000 --> 01:40.000
One is a focus on the Interoperable Europe Act to serve as an example of what's happening at this moment when it comes to digital public services.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
And this is an act that, you know, happened last year.

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
And I personally have to say that I had the feeling that it was a little bit under looped.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
So not so many people pay attention to this.

01:54.000 --> 02:03.000
And I think it is a very crucial piece of regulation because we're talking about interoperability in digital public services.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
So to start the discussion or to start this, let's talk about what is interoperability.

02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
So like the definition, you know, is like the ability of information systems to speak with one another.

02:14.000 --> 02:23.000
And now we want to make use of this feature to deliver public services or to make public administrations to deliver public services.

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
And this can have so many examples in practice.

02:28.000 --> 02:40.000
One that I can always like to give is that imagine you're going on a road trip from here to Paris and then you go with your car and then you want to park on the street and then you get to this machine

02:40.000 --> 02:50.000
and then you want to put the car plate off your car and then it turns out it doesn't recognize your plate because it's from Belgium and then you just end up having a park in another country that you cannot park.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
So is this, you know, like we're talking about things that affect us all in the EU.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
I mean, it has to do with freedom of movement, but also with education, with health.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
There are so many aspects that are so important when we're talking about interoperability and digital public services.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
And of course, for these to work, we're talking about critical infrastructure.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
And this is where free software plays a huge role.

03:12.000 --> 03:26.000
And that is the reason why we were trying to be active last year and still trying to be active to make decision makers understand the role that these, the free software and open standards come or have in this regulation.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
I also have to say that, I mean, the commission proposal already acknowledged this.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
The commission proposal already came with some of these wording.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
And there were different things that we were trying to get active.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
So I guess we're going to learn more from this, from Issa, from Calvin, from the commission.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
But there is like a very interesting inclusion of a governance structure.

03:51.000 --> 03:59.000
So we will learn more about it and we were trying to push to be there because that's where, you know, the decisions are going to be made.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
And so on.

04:00.000 --> 04:07.000
And of course, I don't even know what I had this slide, but anyway.

04:07.000 --> 04:17.000
And then the second part, then we're going to focus on the European Commission efforts that are happening when it comes to the direction of free software.

04:17.000 --> 04:27.000
And for this, then we're going to have a decision with Hays and with his colleague also from the OSPO, from the European Commission OSPO.

04:28.000 --> 04:37.000
We're going to discuss all these efforts because there have been some of this coming from like years back, but just bring an example.

04:37.000 --> 04:44.000
The open source strategy after that decision that came with it, the code repository that another European Commission is having.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
So we're going to learn what has been done.

04:46.000 --> 04:56.000
But what I want us to keep in mind, and I think along the day I've been seeing and I think it has been a very fruitful discussion on how we can get engaged.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
And how we can interact with decision makers.

05:00.000 --> 05:11.000
But it is also important that we keep an eye on implementation because of course it is important to advocate for free software when it is possible with decision makers.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.000
But once the text is done, such as the interoperable Europe Act, we had the opportunity, we did what we could.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
We would discuss this during the session.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
Now we have this piece of regulation that we need to make sure that it is implemented.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
And let's make use of these words that we struggle and we fight so much to put in there.

05:30.000 --> 05:34.000
And let's help them as well to figure out how to implement this.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
So let's look at the future.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Let's look at examples.

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
Let's see what has worked well, what hasn't worked well.

05:41.000 --> 05:51.000
And let's try to find ways where we can all collaborate and we can make use of all these efforts that are happening at the moment.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
So, yeah, and I also want, yeah, again, like the structure.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.000
So we're going to have this presentation and of course we're going to open the floor for questions, comments and so on.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Remember that you have to wait for the microphone for the live stream.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
And it would be also nice for you if you could introduce yourself, your affiliation and so on.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.000
So decision makers also know who you're talking to.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Who they're talking to.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Yeah, and I think that's all from my side.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
I really hope we can learn a lot on this conversation.

06:22.000 --> 06:30.000
And again, let's try to keep an eye on the future and how we can monitor implementation of all these amazing regulations happening.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.000
And yeah, without any further ado, then I'll hand over the floor to Issa from...

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
I'll bring this. Oh, cool. You got it.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.000
Okay.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
I'll do it. No worries.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Yeah, from Edgy.

06:46.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah, thank you very much, Lina.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Okay, here.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
And thank you very much.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Thanks for the slides.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Issa is with us on behalf of...

07:00.000 --> 07:06.000
She's one of my colleagues in the Commission, Digit B2, our recent new unit.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
And Issa is also very much informed on open source.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm happy that she's here. Thanks.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.000
And me too. I'm very happy and thankful to be here because I think it's a great opportunity.

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
I'm also very thankful for Lina introducing the act as something that is important and should get more attention.

07:22.000 --> 07:27.000
Because I'm completely unbiased after working four years on this.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
But of course, I also believe that this is an important piece.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
But for now, it's a piece of paper.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
And it will only get to live when...

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
And it will also be on you to make this... fill this with life.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And I think there are some opportunities in there.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
And this is what I'm going to focus on today.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
And then I'm looking forward to the discussion and to your ideas.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
And yeah. So let's get started.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
What's this act about?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
And I mean, the first very maybe disappointing news for you.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
It's not an open source law.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
And it's not nothing that... now we can say, yeah, it's clear that it's not an open source law.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
But it's something that has actually been discussed.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
And has actually been discussed from the very early start when we did the impact assessment.

08:12.000 --> 08:17.000
Should we have a law that is on GovTech, open GovTech.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
But then we saw that there was no majority for this path.

08:22.000 --> 08:28.000
So now the interoperability policy evolved into the Interoperability Europe Act.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
And maybe I just quickly why no majority.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
This actually came from both sides.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
So from those who are very much fan of open source but said,

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
but if we want to do an open source law, it should be made in a different way

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
and shouldn't build now on this interoperability.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Then it's too linked. It's too much in one direction.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
We should do it properly.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.000
Let's not make it from the back door in open source law.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.000
That was the fans of open source who were against making this an open source law.

08:56.000 --> 09:01.000
And then there were the ones that said, yeah, but we are not there in the public sector.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
This might hinder the digitalization of the public sector.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.000
So this is what we found.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.000
We put something in the middle.

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
That's the compromise that we found. This is what I'm going to present now.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
And what was the main objective of the act?

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
It was to help EU and member states administration to deliver connected digital services

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
to citizens and businesses across Europe.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
And I think I don't need to tell you that open source can contribute to this.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I just strongly believe it.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
And I also don't need to talk to you about how interoperability is linked

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
with this objective and with open source.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
What is maybe interesting is that the European interoperability policy

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
has always focused not only on technical interoperability,

09:43.000 --> 09:49.000
but has these four dimensions of also legal, semantic and organizational.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.000
And that was very much in the negotiations that we've talked a lot about.

09:53.000 --> 10:01.000
How can we actually make stronger mechanisms to help also legal and organizational interoperability?

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
And this you might also find back when I now go into the components of the act.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
Because we say the act is structured around these four components.

10:10.000 --> 10:15.000
So a structured and co-owned EU cooperation governance,

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
mandatory interoperability assessments,

10:18.000 --> 10:23.000
recognized in your reusable interoperability solutions,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.000
and strengthened interoperability support.

10:26.000 --> 10:32.000
And now I'm going to tell you more about what this keywords, what we mean with this.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.000
So I start with the solutions.

10:36.000 --> 10:43.000
One of the mechanisms that will be established is that the EU public administrations in Europe,

10:43.000 --> 10:49.000
and they are the ones that are actually the act is addressed to EU administrations from EU level

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
until a member states local level.

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
And all the binding requirements that are in the act go towards these public administrations.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
They don't go towards private parties.

11:02.000 --> 11:10.000
And those ones will decide together on certain solutions, and solutions are in a very broad term.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
So solutions can even be a framework, can be an architecture, can be guidelines, can also be a solution,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
can of course be software.

11:20.000 --> 11:24.000
Like the definition that is in the act is quite broad,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
but the public sector will agree in this interoperability governance

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
that there are interoperability solutions that will become interoperable Europe solutions,

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
so that everybody will not be, they don't have to reuse it,

11:36.000 --> 11:40.000
but they will at least need to look into the reuse of such solutions.

11:40.000 --> 11:46.000
And this I think is an opportunity for the open source community that wants to know

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
where is the EU public sector moving, looking into the interoperability Europe solutions,

11:51.000 --> 11:55.000
might help them to see, okay, if this is here in the catalogue,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
then it's not a software that fits with those interoperability Europe solutions,

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
it might be easier for public administrations to reuse it.

12:01.000 --> 12:11.000
And then another thing around the solutions that what we've managed to get into the law is that sharing is a default.

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
And for now, between public administration, sharing is not a default,

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
and proper territory solutions are a default.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
And if you want to share among the solutions, then the IT people go to the lawyers of this world,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
and I'm going to talk about one of them so I can talk better about them,

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
and they will ask those people, can we share, there's somebody else who wants to reuse it,

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
and then the lawyers come and say, yeah, but this is problematic, and there might be this and this problem.

12:36.000 --> 12:43.000
So because, and we hope that by just putting in a law that normally if somebody asks you, you have to share,

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
then the lawyers already need to argue why can't I share.

12:46.000 --> 12:54.000
So we hope that this changing the default might already be a push in the right direction to make public administrations that are,

12:54.000 --> 13:04.000
and they also have to be risk, very risk adverse, to be more friendly towards taking this risk and being brave.

13:04.000 --> 13:11.000
And what come in the negotiations, also, and that's what Lena also talked about,

13:11.000 --> 13:18.000
is that there is also a small thing about priority to open source solutions when you are doing interoperability solutions,

13:18.000 --> 13:25.000
and this is something that is now very new in the text, and that public administration will need guidance on how to implement this,

13:25.000 --> 13:35.000
and will need help on, and this also I think where the community has an opportunity to help them, guide them on how can we really make this work and put this into practice.

13:36.000 --> 13:44.000
As a second component, there is this governance, and there is, the governance is composed, as Alina already said,

13:44.000 --> 13:53.000
around the board and the community, and in the community is, we were thinking about you also as part of the community,

13:53.000 --> 13:58.000
of course also the community of local public administrations in the board, actually it's only the member states represented,

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
but IT is very, sometimes very federal and some scattered around all public administrations levels,

14:05.000 --> 14:11.000
so the community is really about putting many different actors in the field together,

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
and then giving structured input, channeling this input also maybe with digital platforms, digital tools towards the board,

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
to take the decision to have always a sounding mechanism towards the board.

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
Another thing that I haven't seen when we were drafting the law, but when I talked with open source people who said that was interesting for them,

14:29.000 --> 14:42.000
was the clear points of contact that with this law, we are having now responsibles on member states level and in EU institutions who will need to implement the law,

14:42.000 --> 14:51.000
so when you have anything that is linkable to the law, you know who to reach out to, and that this is something that is actually important for the community.

14:52.000 --> 15:04.000
The third component, the mandatory interoperability assessments, I think this links back to the discussion I heard here before on the fishbowl where you said,

15:04.000 --> 15:14.000
but it needs the right processes and how do we get into the policy making, and it's very hard to bring the two worlds together actually,

15:14.000 --> 15:25.000
the interoperability assessments will be something that when public, in the public sector, is setting any binding requirements for their digital public services in the future,

15:25.000 --> 15:32.000
before taking a decision on these binding requirements, they would need to do and publish a mandatory interoperability assessment,

15:32.000 --> 15:42.000
and I think this interoperability assessment report will for the community create a lot of transparency and help them actually then also engage in policy discussions afterwards,

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
because the policy text is already translated into concrete requirements, maybe it might not always be technical requirements,

15:50.000 --> 15:57.000
because if you look at the law, it might be requirements on business level, and now we are looking into how to really make this work in practice,

15:57.000 --> 16:03.000
but I think it's a very interesting tool that can actually help bring, and that's why we put it in the law,

16:03.000 --> 16:11.000
because it's about illegal interoperability bringing IT and policy together and helping to have this conversation early in the process,

16:11.000 --> 16:22.000
and not when the law is already written and then you sit there with the law with requirements that are actually not implemented in a user-friendly, citizen-friendly, engaging way.

16:22.000 --> 16:30.000
So that's definitely something we need to talk about in the community and to develop in the coming months.

16:31.000 --> 16:41.000
The fourth component is what is also in the law, it's around GovTech cooperation, there is innovation projects,

16:41.000 --> 16:47.000
and it's the first time that there's a definition around GovTech also in the law,

16:47.000 --> 16:56.000
so it's just that the recognition that this is important, even if there is no strong legal requirements around it,

16:56.000 --> 17:05.000
I think this is an important step because it helps to argue that this is important, if you say,

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
but because it's an allowance, it's important.

17:07.000 --> 17:16.000
Then we have a spot on regulatory sandboxes, and here also for me, they are an enabler for legal interoperability,

17:16.000 --> 17:26.000
and they have to involve also the GovTech, but create a way when you do innovative stuff to have the York legal questions channeled towards the EU level

17:26.000 --> 17:37.000
and have the EU regulators already pre-discuss on how can we tackle this, how can we have this innovation also rolled out in a legally safe environment.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
Last point is upskilling of the public sector, and this might also sound a bit vague and lame that is in the act,

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
because it's nothing, it's not something you go and the police can come and say, you have to upskill,

17:53.000 --> 18:04.000
but I think if there is, it's mentioned in the act that the public administrations have to skill their stuff on interoperability,

18:04.000 --> 18:10.000
and I think you can't skill them on interoperability without talking about openness, without talking about open code.

18:10.000 --> 18:16.000
So I think a lot of these trainings will be created in the next coming years,

18:16.000 --> 18:23.000
so together then look into what can we push, what messages, and then you can talk in the public sector to people who know about open source

18:23.000 --> 18:28.000
and are not afraid of open source. So this is an opportunity for me.

18:28.000 --> 18:37.000
And one opportunity that I don't have on the slide is that this is going to be evaluated, so everything that is not in today,

18:37.000 --> 18:49.000
now if we talk, get the right questions in this evaluation, then it might be that in the next version this can also get into the text,

18:49.000 --> 18:56.000
so this is the entry model and we will see where this takes us, but this also needs early involvement,

18:56.000 --> 19:03.000
this needs, actually, that the community reaches out as soon as possible and say, this is our ideas for where it should go,

19:03.000 --> 19:11.000
and this is the question we should ask. So I'm very, as I say, now maybe you understand why I think it's very relevant that we are here

19:11.000 --> 19:16.000
and that we start this conversation and looking forward to the discussion. Thank you.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
