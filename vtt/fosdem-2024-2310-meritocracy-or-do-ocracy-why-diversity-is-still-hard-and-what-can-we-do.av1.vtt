WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Thank you so much.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
Thank you for having me.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
I think that we can keep in touch.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.000
Today's topic is about something I really care about so much about the community.

00:56.000 --> 01:06.000
I will try to tell it as my personal perspective, the story and tell it to your very personal friends.

01:06.000 --> 01:16.000
There are some terms that you can use to talk about it.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
The role involved in an open source project.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
The role is also working in community with some community work.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Contributors, maintainers, any kind of thing.

01:34.000 --> 01:44.000
Some people are doing more coding and some are working in other roles.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
It's also very important to support the community.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
Other non-coasters are also very important.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
I also love open source.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.000
As you can see, I get involved in the open source project.

01:58.000 --> 02:06.000
I also get involved in the foundation that is supporting Python, the language itself and the community.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
I love the community so much.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.000
I work in the open as a community manager.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
We have a birth and we are in K-level too.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
We are also there tomorrow.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Come talk to us.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
We have other projects.

02:23.000 --> 02:32.000
I will skip this because you can talk to me at the first.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
Why open source is different?

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
I know that a lot of us are open source but I don't know who is here.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Maybe it's a bit like don't need me to explain it to you.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Just for the record, for a first one, I may get a little bit new to open source.

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
Why open source is so different from maybe in your previous job,

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
maybe you work in a closed source project, why is governance so different?

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Maybe you have already get a sense of it but let me explain.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.000
I made a comparison here because I really like comparing things.

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
I was data scientist and I like analyzing things.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Let's do a comparison of open source and Python software.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
How is the governance different?

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
Open source, sometimes we don't have a clear owner.

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
A lot of projects start out with one person.

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
That person will probably think they are the owner but what if they are like,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I want to retire, I don't want to do this open source project anymore.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
I'm a bit tired, so I give it to someone else.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Who actually owns the project?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Sometimes people are not clear.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
For example, if you have windows on your operation system,

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
we know that the windows are developed by open source.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
We know that Microsoft owns windows, so that's more clear about who owns the project.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Also, open source, there's a lot of volunteers involved.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
What you do is very different from working with staff and engineers, your colleagues.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.000
Staff and colleagues, they have to have responsibility.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
They do that, they have to do their job, right?

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
But volunteers, volunteers, volunteer in their time,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
you can't really tell them that much tomorrow.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
You don't want to be pushing the volunteer like that.

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
Another thing, if you work in a company that's very clear,

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
you will probably have a manager or a manager who has another manager.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.000
There's a corporate hierarchy there, so maybe the CCO is the problem.

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
For the manager, you have a team, and then you have a lead,

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
you have more senior role, junior role, it's very clear in your hierarchy.

04:43.000 --> 04:49.000
But for open source, sometimes you get a sense of someone a more senior.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
They have not really your boss, right?

04:52.000 --> 04:55.000
They made someone who has contributed maybe a year or two years before you.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
So they know a little better about the project,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
so it doesn't feel like you're involving someone.

05:03.000 --> 05:08.000
They may be someone who is a maintainer, they may have more access to the project

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
than you, but still, it's not a very clear hierarchy.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Nobody is any of these folks.

05:13.000 --> 05:20.000
On the last thing, it says, open source, they are contributors.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
If they don't have lots of them, they don't have a lot of convenience.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
They don't sign an employment contract.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
They have to work five days a week and then eight hours a day.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
They don't sign an employment contract.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
They don't have to, you know, if they have something, you know, they've got busy with their work,

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
you know, having some personal thing, they may actually contribute the best when they're done.

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
You can't expect them to contribute in a constant kind of pace that, you know,

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
always the same contribution all the time.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
But if you work in a company, of course, like, you know, someone has already signed an employment contract,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
they have committed their time, that's the responsibility.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
If they want to take time off, they have to apply,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
and then they have to pay an HR, they have to know who is having a holiday.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
So that is very different working in open source,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
especially open source that is like involving volunteer work.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
It's very different when you have a company and have staff working in it.

06:11.000 --> 06:19.000
So the last thing I would say that makes it super different is that, you know,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
proprietary software, it's owned by a company,

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
product is supposed to make money for a company,

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
because that's how a company provides, that's why they make this product,

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
because, you know, they have to, as a company, they have to make profit, they have to thrive.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
But for open source projects, sometimes, you know, someone started a project,

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
they just won't want people to use it, that's all they want, they don't even like,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.000
they're not selling it, they're not even making money, you know,

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
they just someone started a project and then it becomes big,

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
and it becomes something that everyone uses.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
That we would say is a successful project,

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
but there's no like, monetary gain for one of the people who started it.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
So, now that we know that we are thinking about open source,

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
we think about like, we put that like, kind of company,

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
hierarchy, you know, corporate, and target,

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
I would think about it within the community.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
So who's going to be in charge, right?

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Who's going to get the top?

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
So there's something that we call, um, bureaucracy.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
So what is that?

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
I'm not very good, English is not my first language, so I look it up.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
So you can't say, oh, whoever, it's basically what it means,

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
whoever it has, it's the most knowledgeable, whoever do it, do it,

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
they have a say.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.000
So, um, for example, if someone like, oh, I've done it for like 10 years,

07:34.000 --> 07:38.000
I know how it works, so that's why I'm able to have them listen,

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
because like, you know, they are the most knowledgeable person in the group.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
But they've got to have this, every time they listen,

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
they actually trust that person, so that's why they become the leader.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
We get out, who knows what a get out is.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
So we get out, but they're not going to take that alive.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
Listen, when a person knows about that character, it's oxymoron.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Right?

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
So they're not going to take that.

08:14.000 --> 08:19.000
So, there's only a small number of people, they are qualified CDFLs,

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
well, there's actually no qualification of people,

08:23.000 --> 08:28.000
kind of, give them title, there's an honorable title that people give up to them.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
So, any of them?

08:30.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, I mean, not passionately, but I do, you can think of some, some of them.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
What?

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
You know, I know that you have high-level people.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
I thought that you were...

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Linus?

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Yes, oh, wow!

08:48.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, hey!

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah, it's not benevolent, yeah.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
We have already, like, you know, we agree on some people, right,

09:03.000 --> 09:07.000
they have, you know, there's no, like, a good tip,

09:07.000 --> 09:12.000
you know, people really appreciate the contribution of the sauce.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
Oh, yeah.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Just a little?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
Oh, no.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.000
Oh, no.

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
Okay, you know that for a while, the show must go on, so...

09:23.000 --> 09:28.000
So, you know, I still see a lot of people, like, in the community,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
having a community, they're like,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
oh, I'm a little bit of a friend, boy or friend, girl,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
you know, they're like, you know, they're like, you know...

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
Inspired by the BDF arrows, because, you know,

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
they have made really good contributions to the community

09:43.000 --> 09:47.000
and their contribution is fundamental, that's why.

09:47.000 --> 09:52.000
But, now I give you a challenge, like, you know, million-dollar question.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.000
Can you name some of the BDF arrows that are, you know, maybe they're women

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
or they are people of color?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.000
Any?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
BDF arrows?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Ten million dollars.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
I don't know, ten million dollars.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Yeah, it's hard, right?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
There isn't many of them.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
The BDF arrows that I asked you before, that you can think of,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
most of them are white-nosed.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
So, it's not very diverse in that sense.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
So, that's a good thing about Marapposite,

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
that, you know, we trust these people because, you know, they're good at it, right?

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
So, we trust them, we trust that they can, you know,

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
they can bring the community together to, you know,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
to lead the community, they have the knowledge.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
And it seems like everybody can be BDF arrows, right?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Technically.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.000
So, if you're good enough, you will be BDF arrows.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
So, anybody can be BDF arrows.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
That's good.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
But, there's a catch, because,

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
do everybody get the same chance to get the knowledge?

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
Because, if you compare, right, if you compare someone,

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
maybe they, you know, they were encouraged to learn programming language when they were young.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.000
And now these kids start programming very, very young.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
So, they are like, you know, compared to me, who is like,

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
maybe I start programming, you know,

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
who knows what they're over there.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
So, maybe when you do this, you know,

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
but now it's like kids are already making games,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
and they're like, that was like, what?

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
So, not everybody is given the same resources.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
So, everybody are like, you know,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
have the same opportunity to start this journey early,

11:30.000 --> 11:35.000
or maybe they have distracted in their life to do other things,

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
so they don't pursue to be like a very good software engineer.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
So, it's very hard for someone who is, you know,

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
who is like that to achieve the same high level.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
So, let's make a very good example here.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
This is my friend, Malin.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
So, maybe if you're Python people, you also know Malin.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
She's very famous in the Python community.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
She is from Zimbabwe.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.000
She's previous as a director and vice chair of the PSF.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
And she founded a symbol pie,

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
she's the nonprofit for Zimbabwe women in Texas.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Yay, she's a profit diversity in Zimbabwe.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
That's amazing, right?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I really adore her.

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
So, when she gave a keynote in Hyde of Italy in 2003,

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
so it was an amazing keynote.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
I think that is really pulling the handle, but what brought me to this story

12:29.000 --> 12:33.000
is that when she did the keynote A, there was someone,

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
actually I think from the accent, I just guessed,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
I'm making an assumption here,

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
there are like a ton of developers and he asked,

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
I don't see why we are different.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
You know what I mean?

12:45.000 --> 12:49.000
Like him and Malin, like he said that you will see a difference.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
You know, why do we need to make effort in diversity and inclusion?

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
So, Malin gave a very, very good answer.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
She kind of, tell her story,

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
she didn't start co-coming very young.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
She was doing some science subject until in her twenties

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
that she started co-coming because of the field,

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
the major science degree.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
So compared to someone who maybe, you know,

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
imagine you are a kind of a male,

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
a female developer in Europe, maybe around our age,

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
maybe you start playing video games when you are very young

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
and you start learning that, oh, actually you can't buy some code,

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
you can do some fun stuff, so you are not,

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
not everybody is given the same resources.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
Not everybody's journey is the same, so that's the difference.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.000
Especially now, if you look at the research still, you know,

13:37.000 --> 13:43.000
those are like women, they can't really spend the same time

13:43.000 --> 13:47.000
in the talk, you know, in clothing as many

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
because they are soon to have more responsibility

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
to interfere with kids and console shots.

13:54.000 --> 14:00.000
So, yeah, that's what I discovered after, you know,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
I'm seeing all these stories that we are not

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
on the same level playing field.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.000
It's not everyone's ability, sometimes, you know,

14:08.000 --> 14:12.000
if you like, let's say imagine there's a girl in some update,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
you've heard of Trinity to learn coding,

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
maybe she was also, she was also a bridge,

14:18.000 --> 14:22.000
maybe she would be from the PDFL, but it's about, you know,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
the environment, maybe someone who doesn't know

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
if they can compute at home, it's more hard for them to be,

14:27.000 --> 14:31.000
you know, passionate and maybe to cope at a young age.

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
Also, social expectations, like I said, still,

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
women and now, still, lots of cultures expect them to be,

14:38.000 --> 14:42.000
like, maybe like care giver for family members, for kids,

14:42.000 --> 14:45.000
but then it would be like less time to develop,

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
like, especially in open source, a lot of times you will,

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
you know, work on open source in your spare time,

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
so if you have to take care of your family, it's very hard.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
Also, access to resources, you know,

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
I give an example now, these kids have more, you know,

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
their internet is easier for them to get resources,

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
but imagine if like, you talk about someone who maybe

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
grew up in like the 80s, right, not everybody can do that,

15:10.000 --> 15:14.000
home for the 80s, so people, you know,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
so if they grow up in that time, they don't have access

15:17.000 --> 15:20.000
so maybe for them, you know, computer and programming is a new thing,

15:20.000 --> 15:23.000
so not everybody is safe.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
So, I'm making money off of time, I'm full of rush.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
So, we don't have the same opportunity.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
So, if you're not bureaucracy, what else?

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
There's a new thing called bureaucracy, which I learned,

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
so what is bureaucracy?

15:36.000 --> 15:39.000
Very simple to put it is that, you know,

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
whoever got the time to do it and put out their hands,

15:42.000 --> 15:45.000
we don't check if they have the qualification or not,

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
just like, we trust them, just do it,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
basically what it is.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
And one of the problems, you know, open source, I like this,

15:52.000 --> 15:55.000
you know, you don't have to have a certificate, right,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
and everybody can contribute to open source,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
we just like, well, of course, we won't,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
we won't question P out that easily, we will double check

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
and have peer review, but, you know,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
we all stop you, like, you don't have to have a computer

16:06.000 --> 16:09.000
science degree to start, like, you know, looking at the PR

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
and start really, you know, doing something that maybe

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
gives them a list of contributions.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.000
Everybody's given a chance, there's no case keeping it,

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
again, like, we are not meeting a CV until you can start,

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
you know, the caretaker requests, right?

16:23.000 --> 16:27.000
So, but it's true, if we think about it, right,

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
open source is new, I can see, kind of,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
because I just made some examples there,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
it's like, there's always work to do in open source,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
like, you know, nobody's got to tell you,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
like, you don't have anything that says you

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
for offering your help, we don't need you to help,

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
like, I think that's very rare in here.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.000
So, anyone can start their own project,

16:48.000 --> 16:51.000
if for example, if you feel that you don't want

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
to conflict with others' project, you can actually,

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
like, you know, clone it and start your own project

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
if you want, that's the best case you can take,

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
and again, like, we are not going to meet your CV

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
and hire you and make you sign an open contract.

17:04.000 --> 17:07.000
So, it's open source, open to women,

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
so that's the thing that I want to bring up

17:09.000 --> 17:14.000
with the story that I'm going to tell you.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
So, this is the career, we are still having a challenge

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
because in, like, you know, you know,

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
game of users, just 5.4% of them are over,

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
so this is actually a statistic done in this book,

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
you can actually, you have the link,

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
if you click on it and see that it's still very small

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
and I'm going to contribute to open source,

17:36.000 --> 17:41.000
if you look at the statistic research done in this book,

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
and also the problem is that in tech industry,

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
like women, a lot of them actually,

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
they latch in their mid-career, so the more you see,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
the more senior you go, the less women you'll see

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
in the company, so since I'm doing like this,

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
why? Really worrying, so an example I want to give is,

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
so, again, like, everybody can contribute to open source,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
you see Python is open source, you can contribute,

18:08.000 --> 18:13.000
but Python Core developer, we are looking at

18:13.000 --> 18:14.000
the Python Core developers, right,

18:14.000 --> 18:17.000
these are the developers who have committed rights,

18:17.000 --> 18:18.000
so these are the leaders, they are like,

18:18.000 --> 18:23.000
see more senior level in some sense in C Python,

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
eight women in a team, do you know how many

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
Core developers in C Python?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
This is a very difficult question,

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
because I don't know why I have to ask someone,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
it's 87% of the total, and actually once,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
these are the actual, you know,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
I think there's 100 and something,

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
people who still have the commit right,

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
you know, if you look at age, out of 87%,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
it's less than 10% of,

18:47.000 --> 18:51.000
there isn't a lot of women Core developers in Python,

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
but why, right? Again, like,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
what was supposed to be the last thing,

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
everybody was supposed to have the same chance

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
to contribute, but why going to technical leadership,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
right, go to more like senior level,

19:04.000 --> 19:08.000
there is a few women, and it's the pressure

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
that I ask myself in the community,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
I was trying to say, why is so little,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
isn't there a lot of female core depth there,

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
I want to be a spy, female core depth,

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
but I'm fine with it, so what is lacking here, right?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
So Marietta is also my friend,

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
and I'm telling you a lot of story about my friend,

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
Marietta, she is the first female core depth,

19:31.000 --> 19:36.000
and you know, I admire her, she is really inspiring,

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
you know, she's also not just, you know,

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
for technical stuff, she also helps with all of

19:41.000 --> 19:45.000
I think Python US for two years, including this year,

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
you know, very senior in tech, so very rare,

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
if you look at the statistics, so I ask her why,

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
there isn't much of, like, female core depth,

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
and that's something that she answered for me,

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
is that, so by the way, she is a mom,

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
so she has a kid, so, it's like, why doesn't it fit,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
like, it's very hard, so they work,

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
are you really hard in their work,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
because there's already some bias in their jobs,

20:13.000 --> 20:18.000
so they have to spend extra time sometimes at work,

20:18.000 --> 20:22.000
and it's like, you know, again, like,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
open source is sometimes like, you have to do,

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
like, spend your spare time doing,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
so for someone who is like, for example,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
like, when you're a mom, you have kids, it's very hard,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
especially when you expect it to be

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
the major caregiver in the family,

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
and another problem that big companies

20:38.000 --> 20:41.000
doesn't allow their employees to spend their work hours

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
to contribute to open source, so there's, again,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
less opportunity for people, especially women,

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
to contribute to open source.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Another thing, I actually talked with someone

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
from the Rust community yesterday,

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
that microaggression is a thing, right,

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
not just items like, you know, Rust and maybe other

20:59.000 --> 21:03.000
more other communities, it's like, we have code of conduct,

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
it's kind of, you know, everybody understands,

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
and it's not like, but there's something for microaggression,

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
that is, you know, something that really

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
you can't make end-force, and it's still not a very nice thing,

21:15.000 --> 21:17.000
it's not very welcoming, and we don't want that,

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
but it still exists.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.000
So, yeah, so what went wrong?

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Well, I don't have to explain this,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
you have all of the, like, when you make a policy there,

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
you know, some conference, they have some big female speakers,

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
very messy, so what's the problem?

21:35.000 --> 21:39.000
Because, I think a lot of, you know, some organizations,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
they still don't understand, like, they think that diversity

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
inclusion is just a slogan, they have to do it

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
because they don't want to be cancelled,

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
they need to look good on the numbers,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
and I talked with some organizers, they said,

21:50.000 --> 21:54.000
oh, I'm women, I have the same merit as men.

21:54.000 --> 21:58.000
Well, I mean, I know a lot of amazing female developers,

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
I've just already shown you two examples,

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
but, you know, but nobody asked me,

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
like, how to contact them, so.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Like, I kind of, like, like this picture, right,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
I was like, well, I can speak Chinese,

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
so there's like a story, old Chinese story,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
saying like, I think it's trying to steal a bell,

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
but like, oh, but touch it, and everybody will know,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
so it's probably scary, assuming everybody's happy

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
and it's probably scary, they're selling,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
but that's basically what happened here.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
What can we do?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
Professor, all we have to acknowledge the problem,

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
we have to say yes, the problem exists, we have to fix it.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
Understand the problem, to not just look at things

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
just like numbers, we have to treat people like people

22:39.000 --> 22:43.000
to understand why, like, these underrepresented folks,

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
they don't feel comfortable, or,

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
so that you have to talk to them, right,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
you have to talk to them, say, how we can help them,

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
what do you need, how we can make it nice over you.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.000
You have to put effort in it, and you have to do it all the time,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
you can't just do it like once, and things are done,

22:57.000 --> 23:02.000
no, it's never going to be done, and it's in the foreseeable future.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
So as a community member, support that,

23:05.000 --> 23:10.000
if someone, you know, is an organization or some leadership,

23:10.000 --> 23:13.000
they're trying to put effort in it, trying to support them,

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
if they're on a big round of a process,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
like you did well, I really love your conference,

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
that kind of thing, so I call it, the Procraste.

23:20.000 --> 23:26.000
The Procraste, and the other two words, I'll just put it there.

23:26.000 --> 23:30.000
So we have the extra effort to support underrepresented folks,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.000
to be successful, so that's our management program,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
it's very important, I'm going to show you an example later,

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
but this is all the things that we can do in the community

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
to support underrepresented folks,

23:41.000 --> 23:45.000
and it's, you know, I don't want to point out all of them at the time,

23:45.000 --> 23:49.000
but you know, this is the thing, a lot of organization and community is doing,

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
keep doing it, keep doing it, but you know, we can do, you know, we can do more.

23:54.000 --> 24:00.000
For example, again, this woman, I also adore her, she's from Wana,

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
she's, I met her at the Papua, so she's living in India,

24:04.000 --> 24:09.000
so she was an outreach team, so coming up, you know, outreach team project?

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
Yay! So outreach team project, they are paying for underrepresented folks

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
to do internship at the Procraste project,

24:17.000 --> 24:22.000
so she used to work as an intern for outreach team at home,

24:22.000 --> 24:26.000
now she moved on, she started a new career,

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
I mean still in tech career, but started new role,

24:29.000 --> 24:32.000
but she's still contributing to the PGA effort.

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
She said that like, you can actually find her talk on the Python India YouTube,

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
so you can look at it, and she said that like,

24:39.000 --> 24:43.000
outreach team program helped her to restart her career,

24:43.000 --> 24:46.000
because you know, I don't have time to tell her a whole story,

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
but so thanks to outreach team program, she's now still a software engineer,

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
I've done it in kids, so I want to take home,

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
not everybody have the same access to resources,

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
we have to accept the problem that we still have, you know,

25:00.000 --> 25:05.000
bias in the community, it's not like, we are not diverse and welcoming enough,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
you know, pay development open source,

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
not just the maintainers, not just like, you know,

25:11.000 --> 25:15.000
like outreach program, they also like pay interns to try to get more new people

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
to come into contribute to open source,

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
you know, educate people with less access,

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
you know, sometimes like free courses, free resources are good,

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
emphasize the success, show these amazing women,

25:26.000 --> 25:30.000
like, I don't want to hear that I can't find female speaker anymore,

25:30.000 --> 25:34.000
I want to like tell people, there are lots of amazing female developers,

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
female community members out there, reach out to them,

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
provide safe environment, if you want them to join your community,

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
to be present at your event,

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
make sure that it's safe and welcoming for them.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
So the last thing, we will have to see our democracy,

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
no, I say like try support democracy,

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
like try something that, you know, is better, I think, too.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
So, thank you very much, I'm running out of time, so...

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
