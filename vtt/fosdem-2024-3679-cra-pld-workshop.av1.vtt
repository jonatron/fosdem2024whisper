WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
So a quick apologies to the people on the live stream.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
What we just did was workshopping.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
It was, in my idea, real fun and also real messy.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
You couldn't see it on camera, but now the program will resume on camera.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
And I'll hand back over to Toby, who will take you through it.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Wonderful. Thank you. Well, I thought that was fun.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
I hope you enjoyed it too.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
So now we're going to, each station, each group will have about five minutes

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
to talk on some of the key findings that they found

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
and share them also so that the live audience actually knows what people are concerned about,

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
what their hopes are, and what kind of solutions we want to.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
So I'm going to invite, why don't we start with the, well, the PLD, is the PLD fine?

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah, I think that's fine.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Good luck.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
Thank you.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Do you want me to go through quickly?

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yeah.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.000
Okay, I think the good word is trust.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
That's the main one.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.000
The idea is really to bring the trust in new type of products, at least.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
The alignment before the piece of legislation is a good wording.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
I mean, as I explained from the beginning, the PLD applies to any type of product,

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
so it needs to be aligned in that sense.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
And I think some people got the idea with the DMA because of the interoperability

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
that the DMA is introduced now.

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
And it's a bit of the idea also of the PLD that when you have hardware

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
and you can install different type of software, you also need to pinpoint

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
the reliability of the person.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
That is a bit of the opening as well to these new possibilities.

01:54.000 --> 02:03.000
I think, so for the fears, we have three types of, across at least two main ones,

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
the scope, I guess it's the, still the clarity of the scope for the commercial activity,

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
and the cheating effects that it could have on the community.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.000
I mean, I can talk for the cheating effects, but that, again, we will have to see

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
exactly how it will work and how it will affect directly the community.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
I cannot tell you in advance, I know that there are fears about that,

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
but that's also the reality.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
And as I said, what we only did is to clarify the situation.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
We did not change drastically the situation.

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
I know this is not what you will hear all the time, but the scope was like this already before,

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
but now has been clarified to his previous way.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
So we will have to check for that.

02:54.000 --> 03:02.000
For the scope itself and the commercial activity, again, I cannot tell you on each case

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
how the commercial activity applies.

03:04.000 --> 03:11.000
What I can tell you is that the commercial activity is not always the same,

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
or at least the scope is not the same of the piece of legislation.

03:16.000 --> 03:23.000
The PRD will not be applicable to certain products that the CRA does not apply to,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
to make it another wording.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
It's not because you're not covered by the CRA that you're outside of the scope,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
that you will be outside of the scope of the PRD.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
You might actually be.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
So just to make it as clear as possible.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
There was a good question on the open source silicon chips.

03:47.000 --> 03:55.000
If I just remember which one put that question, and I will then get back to it just to understand a bit more.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
But I would just go to the solutions.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
There is a good call for guidance.

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
There is something that we call the blue guide that applies for every product in the union.

04:09.000 --> 04:21.000
The blue guide, it's just a guidance, not a piece of legislation that can help market surveillance authorities to apply a legislation, definition, etc.

04:21.000 --> 04:31.000
Could be a good way also to update it for software and specifically to open source software to make it more flexible and more adapted to that.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
I think that's a very good point.

04:34.000 --> 04:46.000
I would just use this time to give a short on the communication because there were some points about contractual liability or limiting the liability.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
That's not possible.

04:48.000 --> 04:58.000
There is no way that you can escape the product liability directive even by putting any type of clothes.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
I'm sorry for that.

05:00.000 --> 05:07.000
The piece of legislation is made for protecting the most vulnerable person.

05:07.000 --> 05:15.000
So you cannot sell a product or you cannot provide a product by limiting it.

05:15.000 --> 05:31.000
But what you can do is if you are a micro enterprise and someone wants to take your open source software, you can decide with him that you will not take over the liability in case something wrong happens.

05:31.000 --> 05:37.000
And so basically if a victim goes to court against you, you will pay.

05:37.000 --> 05:51.000
When I say you, let's not imagine yourself, but you as I say, you can just basically compensate and then you have your own agreement where you get back the compensation from the integrator.

05:51.000 --> 06:01.000
And in the other situation around, if the victim goes against the integrator, the integrator then will not be able to go against you to claim part of the compensation that he gave.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
So that's something that exists in possibility in contract.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Thanks.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
I think we're good.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
Yeah.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Wonderful.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Thank you.

06:10.000 --> 06:16.000
Should we go next?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Do I talk or do you talk?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Do we do both?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Half-half?

06:20.000 --> 06:24.000
That was a bad answer.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
Hi everyone.

06:26.000 --> 06:37.000
So on the workshop on the CRA standards, we have, I think, a lot of participation, a lot of thinking heads and a lot of fears in the beginning for sure.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Some hopes, which was nice to see.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
And there was also nice to see the connection between the hopes and the solutions.

06:44.000 --> 06:52.000
So I think with time we got to some solutions and I'll let the other moderator explain the solutions.

06:52.000 --> 07:01.000
But I think in terms of how we organize the hopes and fears, there's things that the open source community should probably do and or that they should address.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.000
There's things that the standardization development organizations need to address.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
And there's things that the regulator needs to address.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
And I think trying to figure out how we can collaborate and cooperate between this triangulation is going to be key moving forward.

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
So thanks very much for being here and I think we hope we can continue the conversation.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Thank you so much.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
And sorry to put you on the spot.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Don't go away right now because you have not been introduced.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
And so Felipe Jones-Mauw.

07:31.000 --> 07:39.000
He is the standards person for the CRA at the comm, the EU commission.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.000
And so you will, this is the person that you will be able to bug about these issues the most, right?

07:45.000 --> 07:50.000
So thank you very much for being here and thank you for joining me and organizing this session.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
This was great.

07:51.000 --> 07:59.000
So in terms of solutions, we grouped them in a few sort of like topical clusters.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I think the ones that really stood out are open standards.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
Like everyone's really concerned about like the process but also access to the actual output of those standards.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
So I think this is going to be really critical.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Community organization is one that comes up fairly regularly too.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
So how do we do this?

08:16.000 --> 08:25.000
How do we structure ourselves as all of these different stakeholders in the open source community to participate in this is something that we need to work on.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Then there are requests about good EU guidelines.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I think like this is great.

08:31.000 --> 08:43.000
So also requests for EU funding to help was, well probably organization and sending people to actually participate in these efforts would be for example great.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
If I can shamelessly plug into that.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.000
There's actually a call recently being accepted and a project starting called Cyberstand.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.000
And their aim is to support the participation of experts in standardization efforts.

08:59.000 --> 09:06.000
Also some other sort of auxiliary tasks around the standardization, the development of the standards for the CRA.

09:06.000 --> 09:13.000
So I really encourage you to take a look at that and if you're interested in participating then that's probably an avenue for you to do that with some support.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Thanks.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.000
So where can we actually reach out to for this?

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
The name of the project is Cyberstand.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
So from there I hope you can.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
So the answer is Google for the Cyberstand.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Search for Cyberstand sorry.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
Or get in touch.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.000
And lastly, yeah, so one of the things, well, this is great.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
One of the points that came up is better access to policy makers while we're doing this right now.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
And you know, it's a very accessible person.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
So thank you very much.

09:43.000 --> 09:51.000
And then some, well, EU-US mutual recognition of standard compliance.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
So I care about this.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
I think that's great.

09:53.000 --> 10:04.000
And then a focus that we're more on actually doing the work of actually making the security better of software.

10:04.000 --> 10:23.000
And also being able to do self attestation and have the integrators or the manufacturers fund some of the compliance and effort, which of course I believe that open source sustainability is very important.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
So I'm all for this.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
Wonderful.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Thank you very much.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
Last stand.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
Do you all want to come here?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
Can we do this?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Oh, beautiful.

10:34.000 --> 10:50.000
So in those two corners, it was more close to the text and close to close to specific aspects of the legislation.

10:50.000 --> 10:55.000
Over in this corner, we were going from coming from the other end of the chain.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.000
We're talking to people about where they are at the moment and their perception of what is happening, what could be better.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.000
And so we looked at all the hopes and fears and hopes and fears are kind of the same thing.

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
You can hope that something will go wrong or you can fear that it will go wrong.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.000
And so we bunched them together and we made a few different categories.

11:15.000 --> 11:20.000
In general, there was a lot of discussion of funding, but we found this is a complex topic.

11:20.000 --> 11:31.000
And so in funding, we have to think of specific suggestions rather than just increasing funding, make funding available to more smaller entities, remove the costs for certain things.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.000
For example, having to buy a copy of standards.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
And then we noted that participation in projects is also as good as funding projects.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.000
So there are multiple ways to think of funding.

11:43.000 --> 11:49.000
A second thing is procurement and procurement by the EU institutions can be good for supporting projects.

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
It can also be good for increasing the awareness between the EU institutions and our ecosystem.

11:55.000 --> 12:04.000
The third thing is that there is a lot of funding that is currently available and there is little awareness of it.

12:04.000 --> 12:12.000
There was the open science cloud, which has one billion of EU funding and only one person in our group was aware of it.

12:12.000 --> 12:19.000
So there is also an information gap there that we as an ecosystem and the EU institutions can work on.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
There is the issue of being first mover.

12:22.000 --> 12:32.000
So in some of these pieces of legislation, the EU is the first to regulate in a big way the way software is distributed.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
And so we have to keep in mind that when we do this, it may be copied by other parts of the world.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
And so on one hand, it's useful to do it well for our own people.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
It's useful to provide a good example.

12:42.000 --> 12:52.000
And we should probably also try and work with other parts of the world to ensure that other parts of the world don't bring in similar topics into legislation and completely different requirements.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.000
And then we have a different set of requirements in every different region of the world and developers will have a big headache.

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
FOSS awareness within the EU institutions is a big topic.

13:03.000 --> 13:12.000
Basically the more people are aware of what FOSS is and how it is funded and how it's developed, the better we would be treated as FOSS.

13:12.000 --> 13:19.000
So we need to increase awareness of who develops FOSS and increase involvement.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.000
And the last thing is international coordination, working more with the UN, WTO and ITU.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
I've got two minutes left and I said to Benjamin that I'd give him the last two minutes to give his impressions of what he heard in general.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
So if you would like to.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Thanks a lot.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah, so first impression, everyone wants money.

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
I'm not sure we will have all the money that you want.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
We'll make an effort to support the community through calls, of course.

13:47.000 --> 13:56.000
Yes, I think I've noticed that a lot of the hopes that you have are actually the same hopes that we have, right?

13:56.000 --> 14:00.000
So you are hoping that the manufacturers will contribute more back.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
That's also our hope.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
I think the CRA is doing a lot in that direction and I think it can be a game changer.

14:07.000 --> 14:16.000
And yeah, I mean, you are also hoping that the community will step up and also provide solutions such as templates and so forth.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
And I mean, that's of course also our hope.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
I mean, the CRA cannot succeed without you.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I mean, it cannot be just the commission doing all the work.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
We also need you.

14:25.000 --> 14:32.000
So we are really hoping that especially the more those players that are a bit better equipped in the community that they will help draft.

14:32.000 --> 14:50.000
I don't know, cybersecurity policies that then other smaller stewards can maybe copy paste and take over or that you will also maybe start projects for tooling to help companies or open source developers test their products,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
ensure that they are secure.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
So we also really count on you.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.000
That's also one of my messages for today.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
Thank you.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
And thank you for all the participation.

15:02.000 --> 15:14.000
I will hand back now to Martin.

15:14.000 --> 15:20.000
Thank you for everyone who wrote down their hope, fear or solution.

15:20.000 --> 15:32.000
Thank you to the people from the commission that were willing to put up with our chaos, trying to run a workshop in a venue intended for call.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
And thank you in particular to Toby who made all of this work.
