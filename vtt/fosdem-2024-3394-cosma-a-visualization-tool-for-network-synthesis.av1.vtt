WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
Okay, good morning everyone.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
My name is Arthur.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
I'm an assistant professor in Lyon, France.

00:08.000 --> 00:13.000
I'm here today to acquaint you with a little program called COSMA.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
I'm going to present the design choices behind it,

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
touching on mostly two points.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
It's going to be a short presentation.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
The architecture of the program,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
which may interest you if you're working on interactive publications.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
And the features, which may interest you if you're a scientist

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
or working with scientific data,

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
and you have information management needs.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
So that should be every scientist.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
I'm presenting on behalf of the team,

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
and first and foremost, my developer colleague, Guillaume,

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000
who is not here because he's on hiatus for a very happy family reason.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
And also my senior researcher colleagues who have a lot of knowledge

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
and research colleagues who have advised us on the design of the application

00:59.000 --> 01:02.000
since the beginning.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
Okay, COSMA came as part of a research program on Paul Hôtelé.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm very happy to be mentioning Hôtelé here

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
because he was born and died in Brussels.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.000
He was a famous Belgian figure.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
He was a pioneer of knowledge organization.

01:18.000 --> 01:22.000
He's recognized today as a precursor to information science.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
He was a pacifist, an internationalist, a feminist.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
He had also some flaws.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
He was a utopian.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
He had some sometimes a bit dated views on topics,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
but he's a very interesting figure.

01:34.000 --> 01:39.000
He's the one who popularized the word documentation, so that's that.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
His main idea, Hôtelé, was to go beyond the book.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
What he wanted to do was extract all facts from publications

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
and sort of organize them into universal encyclopedia.

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
The idea was that universal access to knowledge would bring peace.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
That was the utopia.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
He worked all his life on tools to achieve this,

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
including bibliography, classification schemes, index cards, and so on.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
There's a museum dedicated to him in Belgium, in Mons,

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
so if you're in Belgium for a few days, I encourage you to go and visit it.

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
So in 2018-2019, we worked on a map of Hôtelé's professional network.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
It was our take on an idea that had been done before,

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
which was to combine a graph view and also a card view,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
so like a little index card with metadata,

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
but the note that you're currently selecting in the graph.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.000
And one day I asked Leone, can you make that for my research notes?

02:41.000 --> 02:45.000
Because at the time I was accumulating files that looked a bit like this,

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
a bunch of plain text files with notes on specific things.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
These aren't actually my notes.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.000
I just borrowed Andy Matousiak's note for this presentation.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Andy Matousiak is a researcher who's working on tools for thought,

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
non-linear writing, etc.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
The idea is that you have files which reference each other with links, internal links,

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
just like in a wiki, double brackets around the title or an identifier,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
if you prefer using an identifier.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
And so what Guillaume made is that he designed a prototype

03:21.000 --> 03:27.000
which became eventually COSMA, which renders these files into an HTML file.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
So yet another graph application,

03:29.000 --> 03:34.000
after all the graph applications that we've seen in the previous presentation about Giffy Lite.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
So this is an HTML file which contains a graph view.

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
The rendering of each file in HTML and also a few navigational tools,

03:44.000 --> 03:49.000
an index, a small search box, etc.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
This could be anything.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
It could be any kind of knowledge base.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
It could be a glossary of terms.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
It could be a network of people, of concepts, of events.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Really it doesn't matter.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
It's like a commonplace book or wiki or a zettelkasten,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
if you're familiar with that word.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Even a mind map to some extent.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Conceptually it's a bit like that.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
What distinguishes COSMA is that we have, well, the architecture

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
and the fact that we designed it around scientific writing needs.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
So I'm going to describe briefly the architecture point

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
and then I'll describe the features a little bit more.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
So it's purely a visualization program.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
You cannot edit data with it.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
It just reads plain text files.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
And most of the features are actually located in the exports.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
So this is actually COSMA.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
It's a command line application.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.000
And you use it to generate these HTML files.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
If you're familiar with Tiddly wiki, it's a bit like that.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
So it's a single HTML file which contains everything except Tiddly wiki.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
You can edit the data.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
This is read only.

05:02.000 --> 05:07.000
So it's less like a web application and more like a sort of augmented document.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
You can share this file, obviously.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
It's just an HTML file and people can open it in their browser.

05:12.000 --> 05:16.000
And the idea was that I was familiar with software like Jaffee

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
and I always wanted to be able to share graph visualizations with colleagues

05:21.000 --> 05:28.000
or students, but not as static images, but as interactive things.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
And there are lots more options now that exist to do this.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
We just did this for little markdown files.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
So that's the brief point about architecture.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
The features, as I mentioned, they're related to information management needs.

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
Everything is designed to encourage knowledge organizations.

05:51.000 --> 05:58.000
So categorizing things, classifying, indexing, tagging, relating things to one another.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
It's basically a memory aid, actually.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
It's not for graph analysis.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
It's more for network synthesis, so to assemble document graphs about things.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
And the way it encourages knowledge organization is to provide a few features

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
that reward this knowledge work.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
So, for example, if you assign types to your notes, colors will appear

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
and you will have filters to modify the display.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
So you can toggle, for example, one type.

06:29.000 --> 06:33.000
Here I've toggled the inside type, which was in orange.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
And it also and mostly encourages link-based knowledge organizations.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
So that's using links in the way you're describing the relations with things.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
And the way it rewards that is to provide contextualized backlinks.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
So that's the thing that's at the bottom right here.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
These are the incoming links.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So you see here where this note has been cited, and most importantly,

06:58.000 --> 07:06.000
how it's been cited because you have the context, the surrounding paragraph that's here.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
So that's a contextualized backlinks.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
Not an idea that we invented, we just borrowed it from actually web pioneers.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
It's been going around for a long time.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
And in recent years, there's been a wave of tools for thought text editors

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
in which you can create little notes, link them together, organize them,

07:28.000 --> 07:31.000
and they pretty much all have this feature.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
We just wanted a way to have it for scientific writing and also to be able to share it easily.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Now the big thing that we did is we have the same feature, but for citations.

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
So if you're working with bibliographic data, so you have maybe a raw JSON file,

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
maybe more likely you're working with a reference manager like Zotero, N-node, Mandalay, etc.

07:54.000 --> 07:58.000
And if you're in your notes, your citing works.

07:58.000 --> 08:05.000
So for example, here on the right, I'm quoting the two references that you can see are stored in the file on the left.

08:06.000 --> 08:12.000
Well, Cosma will generate a bibliographic note, that's the dark gray one here.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
I haven't created a text file for this note, it's been generated automatically.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
And most importantly, it will show me the backlinks as well for the citations.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
So I can see where I've been citing which work and how in which context.

08:27.000 --> 08:36.000
I want to close on the idea of network synthesis very quickly in my dissertation.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.000
What I argue is that linking the simple act of relating two things to one another in hypertext,

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
it's a knowledge organization process.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
So that expression is actually a thing in knowledge organization literature.

08:49.000 --> 08:56.000
It's classifying, indexing, tagging, basically any process that you do that organizes knowledge.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
And linking is a way to do a lot of that.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.000
Linking could be a way to index, to classify, to tag, to assign things to others.

09:05.000 --> 09:12.000
And most importantly to compose with links you can express new ideas, just like Lego.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
If you have a note on a concept and a note on another concept,

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
and you just bring the two together in a sentence, this relates to that because this,

09:21.000 --> 09:28.000
this becomes a new idea, you express it in a new note, and that's ideation, the basic process of research.

09:28.000 --> 09:37.000
I'm going to skip very quickly all these examples that I had added because it'd be fun if there were some time for questions.

09:37.000 --> 09:48.000
And just to say that this process of synthesizing knowledge, this is why I titled the presentation Tool for Network Synthesis.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Obviously in the process of research the first step is analysis.

09:52.000 --> 10:02.000
You start with an object, a phenomenon, and you start, and you try to decompose it to see the fundamental building blocks.

10:02.000 --> 10:09.000
But the goal is to take those fundamental units and sort of mash them together again to produce new things.

10:09.000 --> 10:16.000
And this tool is just that, it's just a tool to help with this process of knowledge synthesis,

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
which is to assemble and expand over time these little document graphs.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
I'm saying document graphs because there's the expression knowledge graph.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
Knowledge graph is usually a set of descriptions in a database,

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
and these are just little documents, so hence the word document graph.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Right, I'm going to hand here, and if you have any questions.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Thank you.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.000
Do we have any questions in the room? We have four minutes.

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
A question about using graph-based and markdown-based, I don't think it improves the blocks or the accident.

10:58.000 --> 11:18.000
So the question was can we use this application to visualize nodes that would have been created with applications such as Obsidian or Luxik.

11:19.000 --> 11:29.000
A colleague actually wrote a little Obsidian to Cosma Converter because we have a data format which is close but not quite the same as Obsidian.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
Obviously you have to have a YAML header, the links have to be a certain way, etc.

11:35.000 --> 11:45.000
So there is a converter for, if you have nodes written with Obsidian, there's a converter out there to transform them into the format.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.000
I don't know that there's such a thing for Luxik.

11:49.000 --> 11:58.000
It's possible because it's just plain text, markdown, YAML, it's very easy to write, I think, a custom parser and convert it.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.000
Do you have time for one more question?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Thanks for an interesting presentation.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
At all I'd really like to use in combination with Obsidian.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
I was wondering about the format of the nodes.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
You mentioned Zetl-Caston, which has a specific format and way of linking.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
There's permanent nodes, there's every node.

12:16.000 --> 12:25.000
Could you elaborate a bit on that, on what type of nodes would work well in this, not a synthesis, a way that you would use?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.000
Yeah, a repeating question.

12:28.000 --> 12:35.000
What type of format would be ideal to work with Cosma since there are many formats out there at Zetl-Caston?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
The type of nodes.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
Oh, the type of nodes.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
Atomic nodes.

12:44.000 --> 12:51.000
I've shown Andy Matushek's notes, he writes a lot about evergreen nodes and the principles behind evergreen nodes,

12:51.000 --> 13:03.000
things should be atomic, densely linked, and the titles of the nodes should describe one thing and maybe work almost like APIs.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
It could be a sentence that describes the idea.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
So that's the best sort of mental model.

13:08.000 --> 13:21.000
It's less suited for a daily log, for instance, than for a sort of conceptual knowledge base, again, where you try to relate events, concepts, people, etc.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
I hope I was clear.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Thank you so much.
