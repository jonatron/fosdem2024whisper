00:00.000 --> 00:12.560
First up, we're going to hear from Hugo Brisson from Disconnected Elements to a Harmonyne

00:12.560 --> 00:14.560
Ecosystem, the APRiverse Trace Project.

00:14.560 --> 00:18.360
Hi, my name is Hugo.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.440
I'm the lead software architect at data.org and today I would like to talk to you about

00:22.440 --> 00:27.040
the work that we are doing to build a harmonious ecosystem for epidemiology as part of the

00:27.040 --> 00:30.840
APRstrace project.

00:30.840 --> 00:35.480
So today's scientific research relies more and more on data science and computational

00:35.480 --> 00:44.640
tools and this is true across fields such as epidemiology, climate science or econometrics.

00:44.640 --> 00:50.080
But the pipelines that are used by these data scientists are getting also increasingly complicated

00:50.080 --> 00:51.720
to maintain and to update.

00:51.720 --> 00:56.440
And to change just a single step in this pipeline just to use a different piece of software,

00:56.440 --> 01:01.520
you may have to spend hours of data wrangling just to get the right format for the inputs

01:01.520 --> 01:05.000
and the outputs.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.000
And the problem is that this maintenance that is really complicated is something that we

01:09.000 --> 01:11.480
cannot afford when we are in the middle of a crisis.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.400
The price is just too high to pay.

01:14.400 --> 01:18.800
When the next pandemic hits and we want to get really fast results to understand what's

01:18.800 --> 01:23.520
happening, it's not the time to do basic boring data wrangling, we want to do actual science

01:23.520 --> 01:26.540
instead.

01:26.540 --> 01:33.560
And so set differently, we have some good isolated free software tool but we don't need

01:33.560 --> 01:39.880
just good isolated pieces of software, we need a robust ecosystem as a whole.

01:39.880 --> 01:42.560
And this is precisely what the APRstrace project is about.

01:42.560 --> 01:48.160
It's an international multistakeholder project to harmonize the ecosystem of epidemiology

01:48.160 --> 01:49.880
tooling in R.

01:49.880 --> 01:56.440
And we do this by making the existing pieces interoperable, by supporting existing tools

01:56.440 --> 02:00.500
to adopt global standards such as the ones that are defined by the Digital Public Good

02:00.500 --> 02:07.280
Alliance or organizations like R OpenSci and by developing a community, a sustainable community

02:07.280 --> 02:12.520
around these ideals.

02:12.520 --> 02:16.240
I can also define our goals by what we don't want to achieve.

02:16.240 --> 02:20.080
We don't want to erase the existing established communities.

02:20.080 --> 02:24.840
We recognize that diversity of solutions is good, it's nice to have a rich ecosystem but

02:24.840 --> 02:31.560
we need interoperability in this ecosystem.

02:31.560 --> 02:36.160
And so the way that we do this is by involving the community.

02:36.160 --> 02:40.600
We work with existing established communities and by this I mean both established communities

02:40.600 --> 02:49.320
of users such as public health institutes or NGOs but also existing communities of developers.

02:49.320 --> 02:54.620
And in the end what we want is to come up with a solution that increases usability, sustainability

02:54.620 --> 03:00.320
and maintainability for everyone involved.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.280
We've had already quite a lot of success with this approach.

03:03.280 --> 03:10.840
We've managed to package and release a lot of un-maintained non-portable code bases

03:10.840 --> 03:17.360
and including many more tools than the ones that are presented here but just for the sake

03:17.360 --> 03:22.280
of this session I should mention that two of them are already registered DPGs and one

03:22.280 --> 03:29.360
is in the process of being submitted.

03:29.360 --> 03:34.200
Having a sustainable network of collaborators is something that is really exciting and really

03:34.200 --> 03:39.000
ambitious but as you can guess it comes also with challenges and in particular research

03:39.000 --> 03:44.920
and academia are really competitive spaces which makes it difficult to build some collaboration

03:44.920 --> 03:46.760
between some communities.

03:46.760 --> 03:51.560
Additionally, because we have a multi-stakeholder community, communication is really difficult

03:51.560 --> 03:55.880
in a network that has so many collaborators and so many nodes which creates delays and

03:55.880 --> 04:00.840
miscommunication and the question is how to build something that is sustainable even

04:00.840 --> 04:05.680
though funding isn't probably in this space.

04:05.680 --> 04:10.800
To conclude I hope that I managed to convince you that responding to this crisis be it the

04:10.800 --> 04:15.760
climate crisis or the next pandemic will require interoperable tools and that this can only

04:15.760 --> 04:19.200
be done for collaboration and multi-stakeholder project.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.720
But even though it's necessary to have this kind of complex community it also brings a

04:22.720 --> 04:27.440
lot of extra challenges especially around communication, collaboration and sustainability

04:27.440 --> 04:32.600
and in the end what may appear initially as a technical challenge is even more of a communication

04:32.600 --> 04:34.640
and social challenge.

04:34.640 --> 04:39.480
With this I will finish just with a picture of the entire core team of the project and

04:39.480 --> 04:43.120
invite you to come to talk to me if you're interested about any of this.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.120
