WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.880
Welcome everybody.

00:12.880 --> 00:21.560
So this is a talk which introduces the FIM image viewer and it's a pretty classical introduction

00:21.560 --> 00:27.560
talk with some new things about new features which I'm working on, which are not so very

00:27.560 --> 00:36.240
stable but half of the presentation is about that, so something which will work very soon.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.480
Good.

00:37.480 --> 00:43.640
So the classical introduction is of those happy times I was using the frame buffer a

00:43.640 --> 00:51.360
lot and I was using the FBI image viewer there and I was happy but I needed more and more

00:51.360 --> 01:02.240
use of the X-Windows system from time to time and foremost I wanted the VIM keys working

01:02.240 --> 01:06.240
in FBI because this was not there and this is very bad.

01:06.240 --> 01:12.640
So at some point I started wanting more things from FBI but FBI couldn't give it to me so

01:12.640 --> 01:18.480
not in this order but I started introducing things like new graphical front-ends, arbitrary

01:18.480 --> 01:25.920
key bindings, custom keywords or commands, shortcuts of course, in a completely different

01:25.920 --> 01:30.720
order of course but no, actually much more than this.

01:30.720 --> 01:37.080
Handling metadata of image files or searching of those metadata so incrementally adding

01:37.080 --> 01:43.080
things which one could do and also interaction with the standard inputs and standard outputs

01:43.080 --> 01:46.920
and shell scripts or scripting from the inside, so wherever.

01:46.920 --> 01:53.040
It was, you had to be a 360 degree nerdy image viewer for my purposes so it was just driven

01:53.040 --> 01:56.560
from my curiosity.

01:56.560 --> 02:02.840
So but still I maintained that this is meant to be and still is a unique tool so it's meant

02:02.840 --> 02:11.240
to show images so not to show movies, not to edit images so to do that with a possibly

02:11.240 --> 02:19.160
minimal user interface, yes this is right, for command line user interface enthusiasts,

02:19.160 --> 02:24.800
for people who like to have perhaps a few lines in the configuration file for some custom

02:24.800 --> 02:32.040
caption or perhaps some other customizable graphical feature and for perhaps people who

02:32.040 --> 02:39.120
want to use it with other utilities, all sorts.

02:39.120 --> 02:46.480
So what happened is that some kind of Kimera came out of the original FBI so I thought

02:46.480 --> 02:52.120
maybe I can call it FBI improved because of this.

02:52.120 --> 03:02.040
So with one executable you get pixel output, ASCII art output with or without colors, the

03:02.040 --> 03:07.240
second part of the talk will be also mentioning that a GTK front end, back end or front end

03:07.240 --> 03:11.480
sorry, front end is there so yeah.

03:11.480 --> 03:15.040
And what's the core of FIM?

03:15.040 --> 03:18.160
On what does FIM, on what is the basic FIM?

03:18.160 --> 03:23.720
FIM is based on a number of commands of a small language which perhaps I could spare

03:23.720 --> 03:29.440
myself if I only had taken some time to learn perhaps Gile or one of those languages so

03:29.440 --> 03:35.840
I evaluated I think the ninth rule of the Greenspan, I mean rules of Greenspan so that

03:35.960 --> 03:44.760
in every highly configurable program perhaps a LISP interpreter would have been done better

03:44.760 --> 03:47.600
so maybe that will come.

03:47.600 --> 03:52.840
Anyway, keys are always bound to commands.

03:52.840 --> 03:58.560
Commands are customizable, keys have names and you can bind them to commands.

03:58.560 --> 04:05.080
Commands live in a space of a simple language which is documented in the man page and there

04:05.120 --> 04:11.440
are also shortcuts so once you enter the command line mode with column of course you can have

04:11.440 --> 04:16.280
some shortcuts for things which are useful like go to the third picture of scale smaller

04:16.280 --> 04:20.560
by 10% or by some other precise amount.

04:20.560 --> 04:25.440
You have top auto completion of commands with a deliberate line.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.440
You don't need this always but sometimes you need it and it can be useful.

04:28.440 --> 04:32.320
I also forget the commands so therefore I have those features.

04:32.400 --> 04:40.400
I also like when I show pictures to my friends to have nice custom captions over the images

04:40.800 --> 04:46.120
and perhaps having those captions customizable in different parts of the screen and therefore

04:46.120 --> 04:56.120
there are four captions which you can customize with expando codes so this can expand to internal

04:56.120 --> 05:02.160
variables or to specified values like width, height and so on.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.520
You can make it look the way you really prefer.

05:05.520 --> 05:06.520
This is your right.

05:06.520 --> 05:10.640
I think this is important in an image viewer.

05:10.640 --> 05:17.080
I also like to use a bit metadata when I have collections of my travel pictures like to

05:17.080 --> 05:23.280
quickly show to somebody a concept from a place where I have been so then there is a

05:23.280 --> 05:32.360
simple text file format which can parse with simple commands there and perhaps some other

05:32.360 --> 05:37.240
features to make those commands perhaps more flexible.

05:37.240 --> 05:45.520
So to categorize groups of pictures or files actually and this allows quite functional

05:45.640 --> 05:52.640
forward and back search with the slash and of course the backspace key just like in VIM.

05:55.640 --> 06:01.400
What happens if you have a lot of pictures in a list in a collection?

06:01.400 --> 06:09.400
Is it also sometimes you just limit what you're showing for a time to some category,

06:09.400 --> 06:16.400
some values to some value key combination, key value combination.

06:16.400 --> 06:23.880
So for instance here you see that from five files that we have selected that we gave to

06:23.880 --> 06:31.880
the FIM we are showing just the four ones which respect this specification.

06:31.880 --> 06:42.320
So there are other limiting features like on size, on date and so on.

06:42.320 --> 06:47.600
Another recent functionality is that one that perhaps if you want to try out systematically

06:47.600 --> 06:55.320
some particular filter command that can be expressed as a UNIX command you can just start

06:55.320 --> 07:02.320
FIM that way with this particular command being specified as an argument to FIM and

07:02.320 --> 07:07.080
then systematically all of the pictures will be filtered that way before being shown to

07:07.080 --> 07:08.080
you.

07:08.080 --> 07:13.360
It can be useful if you don't want to convert all files just to having a preview but having

07:13.360 --> 07:18.440
the preview on the fly happening on temporary files.

07:18.440 --> 07:24.920
I find this also useful to me at least and the syntax is absolutely inspired by FIND

07:24.920 --> 07:30.320
the FIND minus exec feature and also just another important thing is that sometimes

07:30.320 --> 07:36.880
FIM doesn't really read all the formats you wish although it reads many of them but thanks

07:36.880 --> 07:44.520
to the help of external converters it can open many many other sorts of files also with

07:44.520 --> 07:48.560
the use of image magic as a last resort.

07:48.560 --> 07:57.360
So zip pad files, zip files and ISO files I know many of them and what's new in FIM

07:57.360 --> 08:03.560
because all of what I've shown so far it is the classical presentation with all the

08:03.560 --> 08:11.760
stuff but there's some nice stuff coming in a bit instable yet.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.360
It's about GTKB news because I'm getting old.

08:14.360 --> 08:18.360
I don't always remember of the internal commands of FIM.

08:18.360 --> 08:25.800
I wish people to find FIM more accessible, more usable perhaps and I never wished actually

08:25.800 --> 08:27.440
people to remember the commands.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.760
Why the hell?

08:28.760 --> 08:36.880
But still I wish to see myself and to allow others to quickly access to the functions which

08:36.880 --> 08:41.680
exist in FIM because I also forget them actually but yeah there are nice things.

08:41.680 --> 08:49.600
So yeah so this is the boring menu which you see now if you use minus OGTK and it's

08:49.600 --> 08:51.080
a normal menu right?

08:51.080 --> 08:53.080
So there is nothing really particular or funny here.

08:53.080 --> 09:02.880
There are not even like icons but still I cared, I wanted, I want that this menu should

09:02.880 --> 09:09.400
be, you should be able to specify this from the textual configuration file with like one

09:09.400 --> 09:12.800
line per item which seems sane to me.

09:12.800 --> 09:16.800
No XML files, nothing else.

09:16.800 --> 09:21.600
Just my custom and dangerous notation for that.

09:21.600 --> 09:26.160
And also that you should be able to customize the menus on runtime, why not?

09:26.160 --> 09:29.320
I think it is also very important.

09:29.320 --> 09:33.920
And this is actually to have like a reminder to what you can do with FIM when you need it.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.480
So the menus should be there just waiting for the moment.

09:36.480 --> 09:38.000
So back here.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.320
So those are the menus which I just had on my instance of my computer today.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.880
And let's explore the first one, the file menu.

09:46.880 --> 09:51.640
In the file menu you will find the classical open file and quit.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.160
And other things.

09:53.160 --> 09:58.520
And each one of those is like one line which is half-holded here but you can also have in

09:58.520 --> 10:00.280
your FIMRC file.

10:00.280 --> 10:07.520
So if tomorrow you want to have some specific variation of next or go to or jump to something,

10:07.520 --> 10:14.920
it's just one line in the configuration file so no recompilation, nothing is needed.

10:14.920 --> 10:27.520
Since commands are bound to keyboard keys, therefore there will be working automatic

10:27.520 --> 10:34.360
here so documentation hints to which key a specific command refers to.

10:34.880 --> 10:41.680
I mean if there is exists, for instance here, previous file in list, by the way it's b which

10:41.680 --> 10:45.360
is specified in a completely different line but this is kind of let's say detected or

10:45.360 --> 10:46.880
crossed.

10:46.880 --> 10:56.000
And this previous command actually is an alias which this alias is actually go to minus one

10:56.000 --> 11:01.800
and in the moment when the menu is being specified and in the specification of menu, it's only

11:01.800 --> 11:09.600
written that this is like slash file slash previous in list, space go to this and a few

11:09.600 --> 11:15.720
tabs so it's pretty light as a specification I would say and it should stay so.

11:15.720 --> 11:20.120
And only in that moment there is a correlation which looks that by the way, pref is go to

11:20.120 --> 11:23.440
minus one and why not to show this in the tooltips.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.440
So I find this useful.

11:24.440 --> 11:29.280
I find this to ease the path into using FIM.

11:29.280 --> 11:34.640
And you also have like perhaps things which might be useful like next in this directory.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.760
I didn't put it here but also open recursively directories.

11:38.760 --> 11:43.160
I didn't put it here because you don't do it this actually interactively you do this

11:43.160 --> 11:49.600
when you start FIM but it's there so you can put here the things you use more often or

11:49.600 --> 11:53.960
go to the next file from the last search for instance.

11:53.960 --> 11:59.840
Anyway so these are all things which I don't know if many other file image file viewers

11:59.840 --> 12:04.360
have but still this just reflect what already exists in FIM since a longer time.

12:04.360 --> 12:09.520
There's also like the categorization functionality which I introduced in the last time which I

12:09.520 --> 12:13.080
used for my vacation pictures.

12:13.080 --> 12:20.320
So once I used this very simple custom notation for categorizing files so listing the name

12:20.320 --> 12:29.240
of the file, a comment and a few like variables saying I don't know which artist a picture

12:29.240 --> 12:34.920
which artist made a particular picture then kind of also automatically such a menu can

12:34.920 --> 12:42.920
be computed during the rebuild of the menus and this can be useful to like select to short

12:42.920 --> 12:49.720
list remember the pictures of Bill and Richard before.

12:50.120 --> 13:00.000
To shorten the list to only to the files which pertain those particular keywords.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.840
Now also the usability of some functionality like interacting with internal variables should

13:06.840 --> 13:14.640
be easier perhaps with this GTK menus because yeah I said that you can specify the menus

13:14.640 --> 13:21.080
right but you can also specify not only menus which like run an action but also menus like

13:21.080 --> 13:28.600
toggle ones which let's say change between two values and this again fits like one line

13:28.600 --> 13:36.040
can be something custom for you if you want to have some particular let's say variable

13:36.040 --> 13:42.720
on which something else gets triggered because like in VIM you have like auto commands hooks

13:42.800 --> 13:52.840
so perhaps something can happen after you change a value yeah so the toggle is on two values

13:52.840 --> 13:59.280
so after there is a say some hook detects that the variable changes and the picture

13:59.280 --> 14:12.400
is for drone and it's also so that after yeah after such a thing happens yes you have also

14:12.480 --> 14:17.280
in case you have another menu which actually refers to the same variables there should be

14:17.280 --> 14:23.120
some consistency and to say the same state of the widget should be ensured so to avoid

14:23.120 --> 14:29.440
situations like the widget being an inconsistent states in different parts of the menu.

14:29.440 --> 14:34.880
Same story yeah now that there are so many variables in VIM that sometimes yeah there

14:34.880 --> 14:41.080
is a bit of confusion yeah for instance there is a variable that says yeah flip everything

14:41.080 --> 14:47.560
however as it comes and yeah so if you flip let's say the file but also flip all the files

14:47.560 --> 14:54.080
what ends up that it flips twice so you have to do special menus one for this image and

14:54.080 --> 15:00.040
one for whatever comes so this can be useful to me at least and perhaps to you as well

15:00.040 --> 15:05.560
and remember that this is just my choice of what I like so here there could be other defaults

15:05.560 --> 15:10.840
which you find better like your own values for the scaling or orientation

15:14.280 --> 15:14.440
yeah

15:21.000 --> 15:23.240
yeah moment

15:25.960 --> 15:29.640
yes so yeah let's go forward there is a window

15:30.600 --> 15:35.400
default menu which I specified and again you can specify your own you can take it away if you

15:35.400 --> 15:41.640
don't like it where I have put up with other things like since the the menu of VIM is actually

15:44.040 --> 15:50.120
it's using the font from from the linux kernel and it's just very ignorant I mean very simple

15:50.120 --> 15:56.200
pixels you can magnify the text or change the text font yeah by the menu here so just

15:56.920 --> 16:07.800
it refers to what the kernel uses and yeah and if you are to play let's say a bit more

16:07.800 --> 16:13.880
with the configuration of the gtk menus you can kind of rebuild the menus perhaps in a

16:13.880 --> 16:19.480
in more verbose ways so there are ways defaults at the moment I mean in the unstable version

16:19.480 --> 16:24.520
which you should not use yet which will be give more verbosity yes

16:28.600 --> 16:33.720
yeah so it's good that you have things which are experimental to you yourself like I don't know

16:33.720 --> 16:41.000
taking a selfie with with the camera and reading it in FIM at a given moment you you specified here

16:41.800 --> 16:49.160
in a so here we are calling the webcam alias the FIM alias code webcam which is reading from

16:49.880 --> 16:55.720
from the output of a command and it will show it here whatever output it is as long as FIM

16:55.720 --> 17:01.960
can read it the first few bytes will say which format it is and it will be shown same story as I

17:01.960 --> 17:10.200
have shown shown here there is another default here just to say something which means to read loud

17:10.200 --> 17:17.560
allowed the comments via speech synthesizer which I find also useful sometimes so you can have somebody

17:17.560 --> 17:24.520
not seeing the picture but actually giving you the sorry somebody not able to speak but telling

17:24.520 --> 17:30.760
you about the pictures you see so yeah there are also some special menus which are kind of not

17:30.760 --> 17:38.920
specified by you but just requested like the all action alias menu or the help menu which you just

17:38.920 --> 17:45.560
specify with one line but actually a lot of lines in the menu items in the menu gets in because this

17:45.560 --> 17:52.760
is like some kind of automatically generated recapitulation of what commands or aliases or

17:52.760 --> 17:59.480
key bindings or variable or variables exist so this is kind of a documentation intended feature

18:00.280 --> 18:04.680
so in the in the case of the help menu it's also a handy way to get to the

18:05.640 --> 18:11.400
to string telling you which are the options or particular usage modes of particular

18:12.200 --> 18:21.640
commands or aliases yeah so over the years I'm very grateful to for the help of the debut

18:21.640 --> 18:31.000
entertainers they always ensure a higher level of quality of what goes into code so they they help a

18:31.320 --> 18:41.160
finding problems so different maintainers in particular La Basia and so I'm helpful for whatever

18:41.880 --> 18:49.720
bug report hug or patch which comes once in a while and yeah that's that's that was this

18:49.720 --> 18:56.040
presentation and famous package so many Linux distributions and in case you wish to run it I

18:56.040 --> 19:02.600
don't know not only no but somewhere else perhaps I then can help you with it and we can do it I

19:02.600 --> 19:08.360
know that most of the people use film for for the Raspberry PI or for such systems I don't play with

19:08.360 --> 19:15.800
that it's okay if they do it I like to use it interactively and I invite you to do the same and

19:16.520 --> 19:22.040
yeah I welcome your feedback or your ideas of what's not yet there thank you

19:30.760 --> 19:34.360
time for questions first second

19:35.880 --> 19:41.240
is there just the just been used the upload anything to the gpa

19:41.960 --> 19:49.960
no what the question is whether there is a floating functionality of for doing what exactly

19:50.520 --> 19:55.080
for instance I don't know I just wanted to use so starting an image view from scratch if there was any

19:56.120 --> 20:05.080
no no no no no no if you but motivated now or in a different venue why it's useful important or

20:05.160 --> 20:08.920
whatever we can do it but at the moment no it's it's simple

20:16.040 --> 20:25.400
it's not a new project sorry is it a new project official from the new no it's not an official

20:25.400 --> 20:31.480
new project this is why it's called not new.org the website when it's post it looks very new it's

20:32.200 --> 20:37.880
I was confused maybe I maybe knew one day just for yeah perhaps yes I mean it's not going to

20:37.880 --> 20:41.400
itself because it uses so far now it's used to do a project and everything actually there are no

20:41.400 --> 20:45.800
projects there it is the reality yeah next question

20:50.920 --> 20:56.680
all right who used film so far maybe one side yeah one user

20:56.760 --> 21:00.760
who thinks we'll use film

21:02.920 --> 21:05.400
will you who really thinks we'll never use such a thing

21:07.240 --> 21:09.160
oh no yeah the honest good

21:12.120 --> 21:21.000
what's what's the typical use use case for using I use it often for showing what's the use typical

21:21.080 --> 21:28.520
use case of using film I don't track users I know that many people use it for like frames frame

21:28.520 --> 21:33.560
displays which is boring to me if it's useful to them good for them it means that they have

21:33.560 --> 21:39.960
like small computers like changing every each second picture super boring to me but they do it

21:39.960 --> 21:45.400
they're happy I'm happy but what I'm using for I use it for whatever I mean if I'm I create plots

21:46.120 --> 21:54.200
sometimes via pipe so I pipe it to film and film show me the picture I test filters

21:54.200 --> 22:01.000
graphical filters so I pipe picture I go show it to film I have my picture collection of

22:01.640 --> 22:08.280
vacation pictures I want to show how a good pizza looks like to a friend and I just look for pizza

22:08.280 --> 22:14.760
in my in my search in film and show you look this is how you can inspect visually a pizza and

22:16.120 --> 22:20.680
I don't have yet the pizza detector the plug-in for film which tells you the pizza is good

22:20.680 --> 22:27.320
just by showing it but you can easily integrate it with some OCR program if the OCR program is fine

22:27.320 --> 22:33.480
I mean or the pizza detector if you train the pizza detector fine it will show you a

22:34.440 --> 22:39.960
some kind of emotions are not yet supported but perhaps some other caption you can program to

22:39.960 --> 22:45.080
to be shown like good pizza or bad pizza and these are uses which I really support and invite you to

22:46.280 --> 22:53.800
to to have in film or I use it for aliases on on on my shell so sometimes I want to also show

22:53.800 --> 22:58.920
some kind of specific concept like somebody's being nasty to me so I start a special alias which

22:58.920 --> 23:04.600
shows something a gram picket for instance this may have communicating you're being nasty

23:05.560 --> 23:11.480
I don't know what other people do but whatever it's it's about showing a picture not manipulating it

23:11.480 --> 23:18.680
really so keeping the file not modifying the file I think belongs to film if you want to go dangerous

23:19.480 --> 23:24.280
you can compile film with the system I mean you can interact with the shell and you can

23:24.840 --> 23:32.440
you can do dangerous things with him it's many things are possible but I think the best way is

23:32.440 --> 23:37.560
to have a powerful possibly minimal because you don't have to implement all of this fun although

23:37.560 --> 23:42.760
compile in all of those functions so it should be a flexible image viewer that you can use with one

23:44.440 --> 23:50.040
over SSH over screen over T mooks over whatever I said I don't know and with different graphical

23:50.600 --> 23:55.400
outputs so I don't know other programs who do the same six is not there I'm really sorry many

23:55.400 --> 23:59.800
people use six nowadays I know that for some reason they like to encode to use more bytes

23:59.800 --> 24:05.640
than necessary for viewing pixels perhaps one day we'll have six cells six also here yeah

24:09.480 --> 24:17.480
thank you

24:20.040 --> 24:20.940
you
