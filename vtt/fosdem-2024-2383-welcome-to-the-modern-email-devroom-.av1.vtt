00:00.000 --> 00:07.280
All right.

00:07.280 --> 00:11.400
Good morning everybody to the modern email death room.

00:11.400 --> 00:13.720
It's nine o'clock Sunday morning.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.480
I welcome you, I'm Hans JÃ¶rg.

00:15.480 --> 00:20.000
I welcome you on behalf of the organizers of this death room, which is with me Benoit,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.280
Damien and Michele.

00:22.280 --> 00:26.920
We have the honor to have an email death room, which probably didn't happen for like

00:26.920 --> 00:29.120
10 years or so within FOSTA.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.960
So it was a little bit of an experiment because we saw, okay, there's this email thing.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.640
Does anybody still care about email?

00:35.640 --> 00:38.120
So we said, okay, let's call it modern email maybe.

00:38.120 --> 00:41.240
Yeah, so that makes people maybe happy.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.040
And yeah, we were totally overwhelmed.

00:43.040 --> 00:47.040
So thank you everybody attending here during the days.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.360
Everybody submitting some proposals.

00:48.360 --> 00:54.120
So we really, really had a hard time choosing and making the agenda.

00:54.120 --> 01:00.120
You might have seen also our agenda is quite full because we really wanted to honor many

01:00.120 --> 01:03.800
different topics and interesting things that were proposed.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.440
So it might get a little bit rushy over the day.

01:07.440 --> 01:12.840
So I kindly ask you if you switch rooms maybe to make it quickly and efficiently.

01:12.840 --> 01:18.760
We might maybe cut a little bit question time and relay something to the chat, something

01:18.760 --> 01:20.600
like that.

01:20.600 --> 01:24.400
But yeah, otherwise I think that will hopefully a very nice day.

01:24.400 --> 01:28.880
And we also, you've seen there is some metrics channels and so on going on.

01:28.880 --> 01:33.920
So there will be also after this day, hopefully some further discussion about, you know, how

01:33.920 --> 01:43.360
to make and preserve and keep email relevant and nice technology for everybody.

01:43.360 --> 01:48.640
And as for the day, you might have seen we somehow try to cluster a little bit into topics

01:48.640 --> 01:50.320
in the sessions.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.680
So we start with what we call protocols session now.

01:53.680 --> 02:00.400
There will be afterwards some talks about JMAP, which is interesting new technology,

02:00.400 --> 02:06.200
you know, to modernize IMAP in a certain way or make it bring it into the future.

02:06.200 --> 02:12.200
We will have a service session about email service systems later on and operations session

02:12.200 --> 02:16.080
about administrative topics and how to run mail servers.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.160
We have clients, email clients.

02:19.160 --> 02:24.080
Many of them you will know and probably daily use and there will be certainly some interesting

02:24.080 --> 02:25.080
news I think.

02:25.080 --> 02:30.600
We have a security session and finally a small session about a new thing called structured

02:30.600 --> 02:31.600
email.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.800
So hope everybody stays to the end.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.160
And I think let's get started.

02:36.160 --> 02:39.240
And I think the floor is here for Fabian first.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.240
Thank you.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.240
Thank you.

02:41.240 --> 02:42.240
Thank you.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.240
Thank you.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.240
Thank you.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.240
Thank you.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.240
Thank you.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.240
Thank you.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.240
Thank you.
