WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Okay.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.000
Testing, testing.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
Okay.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
Okay.

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Okay.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Okay.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
Okay.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
Okay.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Okay.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Yeah, there we go.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
If I call your attention.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
In the next session, we have a one hour and on the regulators are coming.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
Your chair for this session is going to be Simon Phipps,

00:42.000 --> 00:47.000
and he will tell you all about it.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Welcome.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Thanks for coming.

00:58.000 --> 01:19.000
There we go.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Yay!

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
Hi.

01:24.000 --> 01:31.000
So I'm Simon Phipps from OSI, and I'm part of a group of people from Open Source foundations

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
that have been engaging with the European legislators this year to fix the issues that you all told Benjamin about

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
after his talk at FOSDEM last year.

01:42.000 --> 01:52.000
And the TLDR for when you leave early is that thankfully Benjamin and Omar down here listened very carefully

01:52.000 --> 02:03.000
and have, I believe, addressed all of our concerns with the impact of the CRA on open source developers and open source charities.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
There are some remaining issues that are a little more complex to deal with,

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
and they will be dealt with in some guidance that comes from the European Commission.

02:13.000 --> 02:24.000
So to speak to you today, first of all I've got Benjamin Burgle, who is a head of unit now, head of sector at DG Connect,

02:24.000 --> 02:34.000
and he was one of the authors of the Cyber Resilience Act and has been intimately involved in fixing it with us all year.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
And he is going to tell us all about the CRA. After that we're going to hear from Gail Blondel from Eclipse Foundation,

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
who was also part of our group that was interacting with the Commission,

02:46.000 --> 02:51.000
and he's going to tell you whether Benjamin is telling you the truth or not.

02:51.000 --> 02:59.000
And then Omar is going to tell us the same things about the Public Liability Directive,

02:59.000 --> 03:05.000
and then Doug Villum from Apache is going to tell you whether Omar told you the truth,

03:05.000 --> 03:13.000
and then Enzo here is going to run an audience Q&A so you can ask these people all the questions that you want to.

03:13.000 --> 03:23.000
We've only got 50 minutes, so if your question doesn't get answered, come to our dev room, which is all day tomorrow, in AW1120.

03:23.000 --> 03:33.000
It's an open source in the European Legislative Landscape, and we're running four 2-hour workshops to give written feedback to the Commission

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
on their digital agenda legislative program.

03:36.000 --> 03:44.000
So with all that said, Benjamin, thank you so much for coming back, and they've promised not to throw anything.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
So go for it. Thank you.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
Thank you so much, Simon. Thanks for having me again.

03:57.000 --> 04:01.000
It's been an exciting year. I was here exactly one year ago.

04:01.000 --> 04:08.000
Last year when I was here, I was presenting the Commission proposal, which is the first step of the legislative process.

04:08.000 --> 04:15.000
We as the Commission, we make the proposal, and then the co-legislators, the European Parliament, as well as the Council,

04:15.000 --> 04:19.000
which represents the Member States, they negotiate on the basis of our proposal,

04:19.000 --> 04:23.000
and now I'm here to report back after one year of negotiations.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
The text is almost done. It's quite stable. We still need the final vote by the European Parliament, so it's not entirely finished,

04:30.000 --> 04:37.000
but we are quite confident that what I'm going to present to you today is a rather stable version of the Cyber Resilience Act,

04:37.000 --> 04:42.000
the newest kid on the block when it comes to cybersecurity legislation.

04:43.000 --> 04:52.000
Last year I presented the proposal. I will repeat some of that this year, but I will focus much more on the open source elements,

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
because there are much more open source elements in the final version compared to the original version.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
For those that weren't there, what is the CRA about?

05:03.000 --> 05:14.000
It essentially requires developers, hardware and software manufacturers to introduce security by design in their development processes.

05:14.000 --> 05:24.000
The cheese on the left represents a product with digital elements, as we call them, filled with holes and security vulnerabilities.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
On the right-hand side, once you've complied with the CRA, there will be way fewer holes,

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
although we do acknowledge, of course, that it will be impossible to get rid of all the holes.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
That's just the nature of cybersecurity.

05:38.000 --> 05:42.000
Here is a brief introduction into the main elements of the law.

05:42.000 --> 05:49.000
As I said, it's about cybersecurity rules for the placing on the union market,

05:49.000 --> 05:53.000
the entire European Union of hardware and software products.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
We have three main actors in this legislation, the manufacturers.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
They will bear the brunt of those rules.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
They have to make sure that their products are secure, but then there are also obligations on other types of actors,

06:05.000 --> 06:11.000
mostly the distributors, so these are essentially either brick-and-mortar stores or online shops.

06:11.000 --> 06:19.000
They have to make sure that the products that they sell are secure, as well as importers that import from outside the union onto our market.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
The rules come in the shape of essential requirements.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
So essential requirements are high-level, objective-oriented, technologically neutral requirements for the placing on the market of the products.

06:31.000 --> 06:41.000
They are things like ensure access control, ensure the confidentiality, integrity of stored and transmitted data, and so forth.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
So you know all these are high-level.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.000
This is the cybersecurity 101 that we're essentially putting in the law.

06:47.000 --> 06:56.000
To make it more useful and more easy for manufacturers to comply with those requirements, the European Standardization Organizations,

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
they will develop harmonized standards, and then you can use those standards to comply with those requirements.

07:03.000 --> 07:12.000
The European Standardization Organizations, essentially, they gather the manufacturers, so it will be the manufacturers themselves who will develop those standards.

07:12.000 --> 07:19.000
Depending on the level of risk that is associated with a product, there will also be different types of conformity assessment.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
I will explain that in a moment.

07:21.000 --> 07:31.000
I also want to mention separately that there are going to be reporting obligations, so if you discover vulnerabilities in your products that are being actively exploited,

07:31.000 --> 07:40.000
or you have an incident on your network that affects the security of your product, then you would need to report that.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
And finally, another important element, of course, is the market surveillance and enforcement.

07:45.000 --> 07:53.000
So all 27 member states, they will be required to set up their own national market surveillance authorities to check products

07:53.000 --> 07:59.000
and ensure that the products that are on the market are actually secure or at least compliant with the CRA.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
So these are the main elements.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
We are tapping into an existing framework.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
You've all seen it probably, the CE mark.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
So on your smartphone charges, for instance, you have the CE mark.

08:09.000 --> 08:17.000
The CE mark tells you that this product that you're holding in your hands is essentially compliant with all European product regulation.

08:17.000 --> 08:25.000
And in the future, when you see the CE mark, it will not only mean that you're compliant with safety regulation at the union level,

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
but also with cybersecurity legislation, the Cybersecurity Act.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
So which products are we talking about?

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
The scope is quite wide and deep.

08:35.000 --> 08:43.000
So when I say wide, I mean that it applies to all sorts of hardware and software products, such as laptops or operating systems.

08:43.000 --> 08:50.000
But it also applies not only to the final products, but to the components, because the nature of cybersecurity is, as you all well know,

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
that often vulnerabilities and components can have an impact on the security of the final product.

08:55.000 --> 09:03.000
And in many cases, it is very difficult for the integrator who builds a final product to find all the vulnerabilities in those components,

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
often components of black boxes, in particular when they don't come in the shape of open source.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
So they also need to be secured.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
And so all components that are placed on the market as separate products, they are also in the scope of this regulation.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
What is not in the scope?

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
I already explained that last time, but it was not sufficient for you.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
I explained that non-commercial products would not be in the scope.

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
And I think this has been quite an issue that has been discussed very lengthy.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.000
A lot of people have asked, what does it mean non-commercial in particular in the context of open source?

09:40.000 --> 09:49.000
And this is one of the reasons why for the last year we've tried to flesh out in more detail what non-commercial means for open source.

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
And I can tell you that during the last year, barely a single day has passed by when I didn't wake up to a message from Simon,

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
Dirk Willem or Enzo trying to help along with this process.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
So non-commercial products are not in the scope.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
I will explain in a moment what that means for open source.

10:07.000 --> 10:15.000
Stand-alone services, in particular software as a service, that don't come with a product that are stand-alone,

10:15.000 --> 10:18.000
that you just access through a website, they are also not covered.

10:18.000 --> 10:24.000
And we also have a few outright exclusions of products that are already regulated when it comes to cybersecurity,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
so they don't need to be covered by the CRA.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.000
And that includes, for instance, motor vehicles and medical devices.

10:31.000 --> 10:37.000
Okay, so just to understand, I said the scope is wide and deep.

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
I want to talk a bit about what it means that it's deep, right?

10:40.000 --> 10:45.000
So when you are a manufacturer of a final product, in this case a smartphone,

10:45.000 --> 10:48.000
you will be integrating two types of components.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
On the one hand, like in blue here, components that you've developed yourself,

10:52.000 --> 10:58.000
as well as components here in yellow that you are buying on the market or sourcing from the market,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
and you're also integrating them.

11:00.000 --> 11:07.000
So you are responsible for the security of the entire product as a whole and for its compliance with the CRA.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
But when it comes to the components that you source from third parties,

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
of course it's much more difficult to have assurance about the security.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
And for those components, we've introduced a due diligence requirement.

11:21.000 --> 11:28.000
That means that as a manufacturer you will have to do the utmost to make sure that the components that you integrate are secure.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
That can mean that you simply check the change log.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Is this a component that is regularly maintained?

11:33.000 --> 11:41.000
You check the vulnerability database that are out there on the internet to see if the latest version contains any vulnerabilities.

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
And if it's a commercial product and it is subject to the Cyber Resilience Act,

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
you can also check whether it carries the CE marking.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
So this is how you can achieve that the product as a whole is CRA compliant.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
So now to the conformity assessment, I mentioned it earlier,

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
and this is the first time I'm going to mention open source more explicitly.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
This is where it's explicitly mentioned in the text.

12:04.000 --> 12:09.000
For the vast majority of products, which we call the default category, manufacturers,

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
they will have to undergo a self-assessment.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
That means that it's the manufacturer, Him or herself, that will check and ensure that the product is compliant.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
But then there are some products that are explicitly listed in the annex of this regulation

12:23.000 --> 12:30.000
that the co-legislator have considered as important or critical from a cybersecurity point of view,

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
and they will have to undergo a more stringent type of conformity assessment.

12:33.000 --> 12:39.000
So first we have the category of important products, and manufacturers in this category,

12:39.000 --> 12:44.000
they will have to apply at least a harmonized standard, the ones that I mentioned earlier,

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
or in some instances they will even have to submit their product to a third party to have it checked

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
if it's secure and compliant with the law.

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
So products in this category are for instance operating systems, antivirus software, or also firewalls.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
Then there are also critical products.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
They are also listed in the annex.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.000
These are products such as smart cards and secure elements that we consider to be even more important.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
By the way, only hardware products, no products that are softwares or nothing that is potentially open source.

13:15.000 --> 13:22.000
And for these products we may in the future even go a step further and require a certification of the products.

13:22.000 --> 13:27.000
Now when it comes to free and open source software, we have a special provision in the CRA that says

13:27.000 --> 13:33.000
irrespective of whether your product is important or not, you will always be allowed to undergo a self-assessment.

13:33.000 --> 13:41.000
So you will not have to submit any free and open source software that is in the scope of the CRA to a third party.

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
And the reason behind that is that when it comes to open source, it's a transparent product,

13:46.000 --> 13:51.000
and anyone including the users or integrators, they can check for themselves whether this product is secure.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.000
So you do not need to have a third party that vouches for the product.

13:56.000 --> 14:06.000
Now we also try with the CRA to shift the responsibility from the developers of open source components to their integrators.

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
Because so far integrators have often been free riding on open source components and not giving enough back to the community

14:13.000 --> 14:16.000
in terms of fixing vulnerabilities in these products.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.000
So coming back to the smart phone product that I presented earlier, right?

14:20.000 --> 14:26.000
So imagine a smart phone product that integrates an open source component.

14:26.000 --> 14:33.000
Here is a silly open source component that prints fruit onto your... that prints fruit.

14:33.000 --> 14:39.000
So far it was a one direction thing, right?

14:39.000 --> 14:46.000
So the integrator would take the component and, I mean not always sometimes, of course integrators also contribute a lot back.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
But in many cases they would just integrate the component into their own product and that would be it.

14:51.000 --> 15:00.000
From now on the CRA will say, if you find a vulnerability in your component, you have to inform the developer of that component.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.000
So that developer can also provide a fix to that vulnerability.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
In addition to that, since as a manufacturer of a final product, you are responsible for the product as a whole

15:11.000 --> 15:17.000
and in absence of a fix from the upstream manufacturer, you will also be required to provide a fix.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
I mean either you fix the vulnerability in that component or you replace that component by a different component.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
You just have to make sure that your product is secure.

15:25.000 --> 15:34.000
But if you do provide a fix, then you will also have to provide that fix to the upstream manufacturer so that the upstream manufacturer can integrate it.

15:34.000 --> 15:45.000
So this is how we want to share the burden on security between the developers of final products as well as the developers of free and open source software.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
So is your open source software project covered by the CRA?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I think this is the question that you are all asking yourselves.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.000
I said initially the commission proposal said, if you are not commercial, you are out of scope, right?

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
And now we fleshed this out in much more detail and we've even introduced a new type of actor.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
The open source software steward which I will also present in a moment to you.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
So if you are merely contributing to someone else's project, you are definitely not a manufacturer.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
You're not subject to any obligations.

16:14.000 --> 16:24.000
That was a worry that was expressed several times but here I can assure you, you can just keep contributing and you do not need to worry about CRA compliance.

16:24.000 --> 16:32.000
Now if you are providing the project and not merely contributing to it, the question is, are you developing in the course of a commercial activity?

16:32.000 --> 16:38.000
So if you're not, if it's really just a hobby project, again, you're not in the scope of the CRA.

16:38.000 --> 16:45.000
Now if it is in the course of a commercial activity, the next question is, are you directly monetizing that product?

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
I mean, because we know that many open source projects, they do not directly monetize but they're still a wider commercial setting, right?

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
Many companies coming together to jointly develop a component that they will use for their own products that's a wider commercial setting.

16:59.000 --> 17:03.000
But we only look here at the direct monetization of the project.

17:03.000 --> 17:11.000
If you're directly monetizing it, then you are a manufacturer and then you are subject to the security by design requirements of the CRA.

17:11.000 --> 17:20.000
If you're not directly monetizing the project but it's still taking place in this wider commercial context, this new type of actors introduce the open source software steward.

17:20.000 --> 17:27.000
So these are essentially foundations, not-for-profit manufacturers and so forth.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
Here we've invented a new very light touch regime.

17:32.000 --> 17:43.000
So if you are a legal person that provides support to specific FOSS projects on a sustained basis and these projects they are intended for commercial activities,

17:43.000 --> 17:50.000
then you will have to comply with the light touch regime of the CRA as regards the open source software steward.

17:50.000 --> 18:00.000
But if you're just a collaborative project, no governance frameworks to speak of, no direct monetization, then again you're not in the scope of the CRA.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
That means the vast majority of the open source projects will not be in the scope of the CRA.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
So I don't know how do we still have time.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
I can maybe quickly explain what the open source software steward will be.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I already gave some examples, right?

18:15.000 --> 18:25.000
So foundations, not-for-profits, also companies that build open source for themselves for their own monetization or integration into their own projects,

18:25.000 --> 18:30.000
but then make it available to the public, they will all be open source software stewards.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
And I already said it's a light touch approach.

18:33.000 --> 18:38.000
It's not going to be heavy, but the idea is to place some responsibilities on these types of actors,

18:38.000 --> 18:45.000
but only responsibilities that they can also bear, giving the nature of their project and their organization.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
So there are basically three types of obligations.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
First, you have to put in place a cybersecurity policy.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.000
The CRA is not very prescriptive what that cybersecurity policy should look like.

18:56.000 --> 19:06.000
It provides some basic elements that need to be mentioned, such as supporting the community in providing information about security vulnerabilities,

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
describing how you will mitigate vulnerabilities and so forth.

19:10.000 --> 19:17.000
Secondly, you will be required to cooperate with market surveillance authorities, just like any other actor in the Cyber Resilience Act.

19:17.000 --> 19:22.000
And thirdly, you will also be required to report incidents and vulnerabilities,

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
but only to the extent that you are involved in the development.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
So if you're not involved in the development and you know nothing about the project and the vulnerabilities,

19:30.000 --> 19:33.000
then you will not be required to report vulnerabilities.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.000
Okay, so this was a high level overview of the CRA.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
Just maybe very briefly what are the next steps.

19:40.000 --> 19:46.000
So we are hoping to conclude the CRA very quickly in the coming months.

19:46.000 --> 19:54.000
The entry into force, I cannot be sure, but it will be roughly around middle of 2024, maybe a little bit later.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
And then there's going to be a three years transition period.

19:57.000 --> 20:03.000
During that three years transition period, the European standardization organizations are going to develop the standards.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.000
We as commission are going to develop guidance.

20:06.000 --> 20:11.000
For this, we will need you because of course the CRA is a high level legislation.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
Many of the concepts, they need to be fleshed out through the guidance.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.000
So I'm actually looking forward a lot to all your questions because these questions, they will help us determine what is relevant for the guidance.

20:21.000 --> 20:30.000
Yes, and then in three years time from maybe June this year, so maybe in June 2027, the CRA will enter into force.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Thank you very much for your attention.

20:32.000 --> 20:43.000
Thank you very much.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Thank you very much.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.000
Still got to turn it on. There we go.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
Thank you very much for all that.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
Now Gail Blondel is one of the leaders of the Eclipse Foundation.

20:58.000 --> 21:04.000
Eclipse has been speaking up frequently for the open source community in this legislative process.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
They've had two staff working on it quite a lot of the time.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
Deb Bryant and Enzo over here who you'll hear from later.

21:13.000 --> 21:20.000
Gail, could you come and tell us how the Eclipse Foundation feels about the state of the CRA now?

21:20.000 --> 21:25.000
Yes, thank you very much Simon and thank you Benjamin for the presentation.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
Well, thank you for coming. You see that went well.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
That was okay. So far.

21:31.000 --> 21:40.000
So one first point is that I think that we have always said that we agree with the goal of the CRA.

21:40.000 --> 21:46.000
That was on the first blog that was published by Mike on the topic.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
We agree on the goal but initially that was very scary.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
And I think that last year that was the conclusion of your presentation last year.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
Hey, come on. What are you doing?

21:57.000 --> 22:02.000
How can you put us on the spot like that?

22:02.000 --> 22:09.000
Because putting C marking on all the open source project was just not an option.

22:09.000 --> 22:19.000
One thing and that's very important is that we know that we have lots of open source developers that are volunteers.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.000
And even when they are paid to do open source development, what they focus on is doing the features of their project.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
And non-functional topics like security, etc.

22:31.000 --> 22:39.000
I think that as a community, as an ecosystem, we know we have to take care of that because we had lots of issues in the past.

22:39.000 --> 22:45.000
But having that coming through a regulation was something completely new to us.

22:45.000 --> 22:53.000
And yeah, even if there is a legislative process that is kind of obscure for most of us,

22:53.000 --> 22:59.000
I think that what's interesting is that to see that during the year,

22:59.000 --> 23:10.000
we managed to establish some enough connections that the co-legislators listen to the open source community.

23:10.000 --> 23:16.000
So I think that from your presentation today's obligation to push corrections, to push fixes, upstreams,

23:16.000 --> 23:24.000
also the fact that contributing people are not responsible for, have no obligations, etc.

23:24.000 --> 23:30.000
And also from my perspective, the introduction of a new kind of organization,

23:30.000 --> 23:38.000
that's the first time there is a regulation talking about open source foundations or those kind of organizations as something specific.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
That's very interesting aspects.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
But to conclude, and maybe that's an opening for the conversation after,

23:48.000 --> 23:55.000
is that that's just the beginning because we have mostly three years in front of us.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
And in those three years, so you will write guidelines.

23:58.000 --> 24:04.000
And hopefully we can collaborate well on writing guidelines.

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
But there will also be the standards.

24:07.000 --> 24:11.000
And maybe from the point of view of the open source community,

24:11.000 --> 24:19.000
it says that the standard organizations have not been the best friends of the open source community.

24:19.000 --> 24:24.000
So that's how do we, I think that when you say open harmonized standards,

24:24.000 --> 24:32.000
I guess that a few people in the room say, hmm, it's unlikely we will like such things like an harmonized standard.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
So that's something we need to keep on our radar.

24:35.000 --> 24:41.000
And the fact that the regulators are coming, that's the title of the panel,

24:41.000 --> 24:50.000
I think that that's a good thing because that's also the fact that open source has won and is present everywhere.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
So we used to be under the radar.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
And now I see several faces from the European Commission in the attendance.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
You are here to explain to us and we have established some connections.

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
So that's good things.

25:06.000 --> 25:13.000
And yeah, the conversation continues tomorrow in the panel, in the EU policy day room.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
And that's it.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Thank you.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
So that's the CRA.

25:24.000 --> 25:29.000
Now, the CRA sets the rules for the market surveillance authorities.

25:29.000 --> 25:36.000
It says how countries are going to make sure their citizens are safe from the products that are being sold in those markets.

25:36.000 --> 25:46.000
When it turns out those products aren't safe, Europe's Product Liability Directive gives citizens recourse to have justice brought into their lives.

25:46.000 --> 25:50.000
And the Product Liability Directive has been in place for many years in Europe,

25:50.000 --> 25:55.000
but it doesn't give any liability to software producers.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.000
And so within boundaries that I will fix.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
So the European Commission is going to do something about that.

26:02.000 --> 26:08.000
Those big, bold, lettered disclaimers at the end of your software licenses do not apply in Europe anymore.

26:08.000 --> 26:17.000
And that's because the Product Liability Directive is being updated to give software producers liability towards consumers.

26:17.000 --> 26:24.000
And to tell us about that, we've got the legal and policy officer from DG Grow, Omar Anagi,

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
who was one of the primary authors of the PLD, and he's going to tell us what's in it.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
So Omar, please.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
Thank you Simon, and good afternoon everyone.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
It's a pleasure to be here again this year.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Same as the CRA.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
We are a year after, and we have now more than just a proposal.

26:44.000 --> 26:50.000
We have a legislation that still needs to go through the adoption by the parliament.

26:50.000 --> 26:56.000
But just as a small introduction, whatever has been said just before,

26:56.000 --> 27:03.000
let's try to forget it for the next 12 minutes, because it is not applicable in our case here.

27:04.000 --> 27:12.000
When we speak about the PLD, basically it applies to any type of products.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
The only element that is necessary is whether they are made available on the market,

27:17.000 --> 27:23.000
and made available on the market basically means any supply distribution of a use,

27:23.000 --> 27:29.000
and whether it's return of payment or free of charge.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
And the most important element is actually the commercial activity.

27:34.000 --> 27:39.000
I know that everyone asks always, especially here last year, those questions,

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
what is a commercial activity?

27:41.000 --> 27:49.000
Unfortunately, I cannot tell you exactly if your own product or your own software is in a commercial activity.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.000
This is an assessment that is done by the judge itself.

27:52.000 --> 27:57.000
There are elements, the number of supply of the product, the number of use of the product,

27:57.000 --> 28:04.000
but this cannot be determined beforehand for the PLD, because of its own nature of safety net.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
So the assessment will be done for each individual product,

28:09.000 --> 28:13.000
even if it's let's take the more traditional product like a bottle,

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
and you will have to look at the specific bottle and not the series of bottles

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
to determine whether it is in a commercial activity or not.

28:22.000 --> 28:29.000
And I say this is the scope, but then we arrive to the product itself.

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
Any product, the definition is really legalistic, so you don't need to really get that,

28:35.000 --> 28:42.000
but basically it's everything, and we have clarified that also softwares, raw materials,

28:42.000 --> 28:47.000
and digital manufacturing files are products on the PLD.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
There is no definition of what is a software, as you probably know,

28:52.000 --> 28:56.000
like the software 20 years ago is not the same than today.

28:56.000 --> 29:05.000
So the idea was to leave it as open as possible to ensure future proof safety net nature of the PLD.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.000
You asked me if SIS are covered, yes they are covered.

29:10.000 --> 29:15.000
The PLD disregards how the product is supplied, how the product is bought,

29:15.000 --> 29:22.000
how the product is used, how it is the model of the product, where it is stored.

29:22.000 --> 29:27.000
All of this is totally disregarded. Any software is covered by the PLD,

29:27.000 --> 29:34.000
algorithm, operating systems, AI systems, apps, whatever you want,

29:34.000 --> 29:40.000
all of them are covered under the word actually software.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
As Simon said, the PLD does not kick in.

29:45.000 --> 29:51.000
I mean, you do your job, and in the PLD we're not telling you how to do your job.

29:51.000 --> 29:56.000
The only thing that we are telling you is, nor the risk profile of your product,

29:56.000 --> 30:02.000
because if something wrong happens, and maybe none of you will ever experience the PLD in your life,

30:02.000 --> 30:07.000
if something wrong happens, someone has to get compensated for the damage.

30:07.000 --> 30:12.000
The damages are pretty straightforward. It's basically death and personal injury,

30:12.000 --> 30:18.000
including psychological health, the destruction of property,

30:18.000 --> 30:23.000
and the last one is destruction or corruption of data.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.000
Those are the three main categories of damages that need to be compensated.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.000
If there is a single of one of these ones, you would then have to compensate

30:32.000 --> 30:37.000
basically everything that is related to that.

30:37.000 --> 30:43.000
As I said, you will not have a case if there is no damage,

30:43.000 --> 30:47.000
and you will not have to face the PLD itself.

30:47.000 --> 30:56.000
Except in certain situations, you might have liability even if the damage has not yet occurred.

30:56.000 --> 31:02.000
Let's take a pacemaker. You know that the pacemaker has an issue.

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
You will not wait that the person dies because of it.

31:07.000 --> 31:13.000
You will get preemptively the compensation, namely the damages of going back again for surgery and etc.

31:13.000 --> 31:19.000
I use the pacemaker because they are part of the wider range of medical devices,

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
and medical devices also sometimes implies or include software.

31:25.000 --> 31:30.000
This is a specific situation in itself.

31:30.000 --> 31:36.000
When we talk about the liability, the question is for how long?

31:36.000 --> 31:42.000
The main rule is ten years. This is the general rule.

31:42.000 --> 31:50.000
Namely, if you place your product on the market, you may have it available on the market from the first day.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.000
This is when the time starts running.

31:53.000 --> 32:03.000
But as you know, a software might evolve, AI system for example as well.

32:03.000 --> 32:12.000
Considering that a software that was placed 15 years ago and has been changed through a lot of updates for instances,

32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
it will be kind of limiting to steer or only apply to ten years,

32:17.000 --> 32:21.000
because it means that someone who bought the software ten years ago or eleven years ago

32:21.000 --> 32:27.000
will not be able to cover the damages in case something wrong happens, although the software has been updated.

32:27.000 --> 32:34.000
We have also included a new starting period, which is when the product is substantially modified.

32:34.000 --> 32:38.000
I'm not going to go into detail. We're not explaining exactly what is a substantial modification.

32:38.000 --> 32:43.000
In most of the legislation, you will find what a substantial modification is,

32:43.000 --> 32:50.000
but roughly for software, I don't know if the CRA has a substantial modification definition,

32:50.000 --> 32:58.000
but for instance you will have to go under the CRA to see what is a substantial modification in case of cyber vulnerabilities.

32:58.000 --> 33:08.000
What we say is basically if you update your software and the update is as such that it changes the risk profile of your software,

33:08.000 --> 33:15.000
it is a new product, it is a new software and the time limitation starts running from that moment again.

33:15.000 --> 33:24.000
So each time you will change to that point or to that element of your software, you will restart the clock in that sense.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.000
If it doesn't, then it doesn't, and then you're ten years, ten years.

33:30.000 --> 33:40.000
The extension of the liability has also been put to 25 years in a specific situation, which are the health injuries.

33:40.000 --> 33:49.000
That shouldn't concern you that much, but just for you to know, it's basically pharmaceutical.

33:49.000 --> 33:59.000
That's the easiest one when you realize that you have some damages because of it, but it took more than ten years to appear.

33:59.000 --> 34:05.000
So this is a specific situation, but software you just know.

34:05.000 --> 34:10.000
We talk about time limitation and then we also need to talk about the exemptions.

34:10.000 --> 34:22.000
Exemption means that even though your product caused the damage, one of the three, you might be able to be exempted from your liability.

34:22.000 --> 34:31.000
There is a full list of exemptions, not going to go into details, but maybe two are important for you and I will explain the first one a bit later.

34:31.000 --> 34:42.000
If you did not place your product on the market, but it was placed by someone else, or the development risk defense, what we call the state of the art,

34:42.000 --> 34:58.000
which I think in your field is the most relevant one, and just to be clear, it's not the knowledge of the developer, it's the knowledge of the community, of the science around.

34:58.000 --> 35:04.000
And it's not about the known unknown, it's about only the unknown unknowns.

35:04.000 --> 35:11.000
Only in those cases, you will be able to be exempted from your liability.

35:11.000 --> 35:24.000
So just to take an example for you and maybe to make it as clear as possible, the PRD does not apply for any product when they are supplied outside of a commercial activity.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
This is the same for free and open source software.

35:28.000 --> 35:44.000
If your free and open source software is developed or supplied outside of a commercial activity, but someone decides to integrate it into another product, and therefore the product is then sold to a person and causes harm,

35:44.000 --> 35:47.000
the liability is pretty clear.

35:47.000 --> 36:00.000
The person will only be able to go against the integrator of the software, but not against the developer of the free and open source software that has been supplied outside of a commercial activity.

36:00.000 --> 36:11.000
That's a bit of clarity that is now in the text, which was not there before, but just for you to really understand how it will work.

36:12.000 --> 36:22.000
And the very last point is about, I know that you have clauses in your license.

36:22.000 --> 36:32.000
The PRD is pretty simple. No matter your clause, you cannot use it against a person, a natural person that is claiming compensation.

36:32.000 --> 36:39.000
So there is no leeway for avoiding liability.

36:39.000 --> 36:50.000
If it's a natural person, so me, you, anyone else comes against you, has a damage, asks for compensation, brings you to court,

36:50.000 --> 36:58.000
you cannot say that you had a clause in your license that said that you will not be held liable.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.000
That will not be accepted by a court.

37:01.000 --> 37:14.000
That's a general principle that works for everyone, and for any type of product, is to avoid that the weakest party, namely the consumer, suffers from an imposed contract.

37:15.000 --> 37:32.000
But what we have clarified in the legislation is basically, if you, a small company, very small company, decide that, okay, you sell your software to another company to integrate it,

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
but you do not want to take over the liability.

37:35.000 --> 37:43.000
If this is your case, you can then have a clause in your license or in your contract.

37:43.000 --> 37:57.000
And in that case, the manufacturer of the overall product, the integrator of the software, will not be able to come against you in case he has compensated the natural person.

37:57.000 --> 38:12.000
What happens usually is the natural person goes against the name manufacturer of the product, and then it is that manufacturer of the overall product that will go against the other component manufacturer

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
for getting part of the compensation.

38:15.000 --> 38:20.000
This would then not be possible if you have such a clause.

38:20.000 --> 38:27.000
So that's a bit of the small panorama of the PRD.

38:27.000 --> 38:32.000
So I leave you on that, and I hope you enjoy it. Thank you.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
Thank you very much.

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
Perfect. I'll come get it from you now.

38:38.000 --> 38:45.000
And to respond for the defence, we have Dirk Willem van Gulak from the Apache Software Foundation.

38:45.000 --> 38:56.000
Thanks, Simon. So, yeah, so basically these were, so I think so like in many ways, what's happening here is that software is becoming, yeah, very grown up,

38:56.000 --> 39:03.000
and just sort of like a, I don't know, a phone charger or an electric drill, where sort of like being put under the same rules.

39:03.000 --> 39:15.000
Now, I think the positive news is here that in this process, the open source site, the development site, and also like the micro enterprises are largely sort of like out of scope.

39:15.000 --> 39:22.000
However, what I want to stress, and also want to stress about the CRA, is that it is a massive change for our industry.

39:22.000 --> 39:30.000
Even we as open source developers, we're not alone. We're actually part of that IT industry, and the PLD and the CRA will probably sort of like,

39:30.000 --> 39:36.000
or will absolutely affect our industries way more than they do open source, because the industry has to come to the table.

39:36.000 --> 39:42.000
The industry is basically squarely in the view of the CRA and squarely in the view of the PLD.

39:42.000 --> 39:50.000
So I think one thing sort of like, we can sort of like, yeah, be positive about and celebrate about is that all the worries we had last year around the CRA

39:50.000 --> 39:56.000
and especially about the PLD didn't really come to fruit. I mean, things are now sort of like, we've got a fair balance, I think.

39:56.000 --> 40:03.000
But at the same time, as an IT community, we've got sort of like some massive challenges sort of like they're left.

40:03.000 --> 40:08.000
And I think sort of like some of the questions of you may well be in that area. Thanks.

40:08.000 --> 40:11.000
Thank you.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Okay.

40:14.000 --> 40:23.000
And so we're going to move to an audience Q&A. If you've got a question that you would like to ask the panel, or particularly the guys from the commission,

40:23.000 --> 40:31.000
then if you would like to raise a hand, there's a hand raised down here, and Omar is going to moderate for us.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
I'm Enzo, not Omar.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
Sorry, Enzo is going to moderate. My brain is gone.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.000
Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Please, yeah.

40:45.000 --> 40:52.000
Yeah. So we're glad that a lot of the concerns of the open source community were heard.

40:52.000 --> 40:58.000
We can't hear you.

40:58.000 --> 41:05.000
Yeah, okay. So we're glad that a lot of the concerns of the open source community were heard.

41:05.000 --> 41:18.000
But for Linux distributions, like for example, Debian, we will be exempt because we don't do anything commercially.

41:18.000 --> 41:24.000
But we are worried about our downstream users, which of course use Debian commercially.

41:24.000 --> 41:40.000
So for example, a lot of very small and very small local IT providers sell computers with Debian, for example, or do other business using Debian

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
and integrating it into their products.

41:43.000 --> 41:54.000
And we are worried about how they will be able to comply with the CRA obligations because they are so small that they can't do it themselves.

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
So it would be really hard for them.

41:56.000 --> 42:04.000
And also the margins in the computer industry are not that big that they can just say, okay, I'm going to employ somebody who's doing that.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.000
That's not possible for most of them.

42:07.000 --> 42:13.000
So that's what we want to have guidance for.

42:13.000 --> 42:26.000
And also it's really difficult for them to understand all these regulations and what this means in practice concrete for somebody who's, for example, just selling computers with Debian.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
Thank you very much. I think it's a very good question.

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
I guess Benjamin, it's pretty obvious that this question is for you if you want to answer real quick.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.000
Yeah, thanks. It's a great question, I think.

42:37.000 --> 42:52.000
So indeed, if you are selling a laptop, for instance, with an operating system installed, if you're building that laptop, if you're the manufacturer of that laptop with the operating system, you will be in the scope of the CRA.

42:52.000 --> 42:59.000
And the due diligence requirements as regards the integration of the operating system, they will also apply to you.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
I mean, I explained before what due diligence means, right?

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
So there are a lot of ways in which you can do due diligence.

43:05.000 --> 43:12.000
The CRA is on purpose not very prescriptive because we want to give a lot of flexibility to the integrators.

43:12.000 --> 43:16.000
But one thing is for sure, it doesn't mean that you can only integrate CE mark products.

43:16.000 --> 43:19.000
You can integrate any open source component that you like.

43:19.000 --> 43:26.000
And there is a myriad of ways in which you can demonstrate that the components that you integrate are secure.

43:26.000 --> 43:46.000
I think in a case like this one where the upstream provider, so the Debian project, is such a massive undertaking, I think it would be extremely helpful for your integrators if you provide them with useful documentation on how Debian as a software,

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
how Debian addresses the various security requirements of the CRA.

43:50.000 --> 43:57.000
I mean, just because the CRA doesn't apply to you, doesn't mean that you shouldn't take security seriously and I'm sure you do, right?

43:57.000 --> 44:06.000
So I'm sure many of the things that the CRA requires, such as the access control and so forth, I mean, obviously modern operating systems like Debian do that.

44:06.000 --> 44:19.000
So if you document in a transparent manner how you are actually complying with security by design principles, I mean, you're essentially doing the work for your integrators and then they can just recycle that work for their own documentation.

44:19.000 --> 44:24.000
So their documentation doesn't need to be heavy anymore.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Thank you very much, Benjamin.

44:26.000 --> 44:33.000
Is there another question here over there? Thank you.

44:33.000 --> 44:41.000
Yeah, this is a question for the Eclipse Apache foundations.

44:41.000 --> 44:53.000
Aren't you afraid that you have kind of doomed the software foundations in shielding the developers?

44:53.000 --> 45:07.000
Because when I look at this, the first thing that jumped out of me was, okay, I have to make sure that I'm not going to be a software steward.

45:07.000 --> 45:26.000
So if somebody wants to pay me for work, then the best thing I can do is dump the project into one of the foundations and make myself just a contributor.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Thank you very much.

45:28.000 --> 45:35.000
Dirk, maybe first or Gail?

45:35.000 --> 45:41.000
Right, so I think the question is really like what do I do as a small developer, right?

45:41.000 --> 45:46.000
And this forced me to dump my projects in one of the foundations.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
And I think it's useful perhaps to turn this around.

45:49.000 --> 45:59.000
I mean, what is happening here is that society is asking the software developers to start producing good secure software to basically use industry best practices.

45:59.000 --> 46:06.000
Now in open source, we by and large do that. In fact, we pretty much set every industry best practice around security.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.000
And it's our downstream people in the commercial markets who are often not updating.

46:10.000 --> 46:17.000
I mean, we update log4j within 24 hours and then like now years later, it's still not being done universally.

46:17.000 --> 46:31.000
So I think to a large extent the answer to that question is that as developers basically, we'll have to sort of like get more systematic and more explicit about documenting the good things we're doing.

46:31.000 --> 46:39.000
And I fully expect sort of like that a year from now, two years from now, we basically all more or less have documented that in the same way.

46:39.000 --> 46:45.000
Because I mean, at Apache we've documented some of the things at Eclipse, at Python, we basically all doing the same thing.

46:45.000 --> 46:51.000
So yes, of course, we're going to steal each other's documents, right? It's open source. I mean, that's just the easiest way of doing it.

46:51.000 --> 47:01.000
And then indeed, basically, you sort of like get that foundation like style, all those things which are part of an open source steward like being sustained in the market, being responsible about these things.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.000
Yeah, simply then becomes much wider available.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Thank you, Dirk.

47:06.000 --> 47:22.000
Yeah, just maybe to add something like I hear your point that, OK, if there is some constraint due to the fact that there is an open source steward, I absolutely want to avoid being in this situation or I want to make.

47:22.000 --> 47:38.000
I don't think that people or organizations bring their projects to a foundation just to avoid the theory or to do something like that.

47:38.000 --> 47:48.000
And that's the main point is more likely to set up collaborations or to have a vendor neutral governance or stuff like that.

47:48.000 --> 48:08.000
I think that's our main point in my opinion is that we help create consortia, but the open source steward is a good way to implement the requirements of the CRA in the context where.
