WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.200
And interestingly, this idea of sharing best practices, finding things to do at every level

00:15.200 --> 00:21.240
together seems, I don't know, more important than ever, probably, given the state of the

00:21.240 --> 00:25.080
incredible state of the world in 2024.

00:25.080 --> 00:33.160
So the premise here is that since 2008 or so, we've been doing great in open source,

00:33.160 --> 00:36.120
and most of us have been very busy.

00:36.120 --> 00:43.720
Who makes their money, supports their family, full-time, always, only open source?

00:43.720 --> 00:44.720
Right?

00:44.720 --> 00:49.480
I'm used to, I think all of my clients are still open source, but I'm doing something

00:49.480 --> 00:50.800
slightly different now.

00:50.800 --> 00:54.440
So we've all done great with open source.

00:54.440 --> 00:59.520
My open source origin story is in the Drupal community.

00:59.520 --> 01:07.360
But we have forgotten how special and weird we are, and what is most valuable and interesting

01:07.360 --> 01:10.280
about us is not obvious to everyone.

01:10.280 --> 01:16.240
And I think that we've been so busy winning and succeeding and, you know, having agencies

01:16.240 --> 01:21.600
with 120% bookings over any 18-month horizon.

01:21.600 --> 01:27.440
We forgot to tell people what an economy of plenty is, what sharing your best ideas

01:27.440 --> 01:31.040
with the smartest people you know can do, and so on.

01:31.040 --> 01:37.320
And we are not getting all of the opportunities to win business for ourselves or do good in

01:37.320 --> 01:39.560
the world that we could, right?

01:39.560 --> 01:41.320
That's about where we are.

01:41.320 --> 01:45.320
So very, very briefly, my name is Jim.

01:45.320 --> 01:53.120
I co-founded a company called Open Strategy Partners, and we work with technology agencies,

01:53.120 --> 01:58.960
product companies, and open source projects to communicate clearly about the wonderful,

01:58.960 --> 02:04.160
complicated, interesting stuff that all of us do in open source.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.680
So, right, that's me.

02:07.680 --> 02:13.240
Matthias, please come and introduce yourself.

02:13.240 --> 02:20.880
As I've already said, I'm Matthias Burt Lesniak, and I'll hold this myself, and you

02:20.880 --> 02:22.160
can click yes.

02:22.160 --> 02:26.360
I am living outside of Oslo in Norway.

02:26.360 --> 02:29.560
I do have a wife, and I do have two kids.

02:29.560 --> 02:30.560
Hi.

02:30.560 --> 02:36.800
And I have been using Type 3 since 2003, and I always say that the first time I used

02:36.800 --> 02:41.320
Type 3, I crashed the installation, and I think that's a really important thing to know

02:41.320 --> 02:48.760
for beginners in any CMS that you start by learning, and all of the people who are very

02:48.760 --> 02:53.760
good right now are people who didn't know anything when they started.

02:53.760 --> 02:57.600
So everyone's been in your boat, newbies.

02:57.600 --> 03:03.680
I'm in the Type 3 Association Board, and you're skipping a little bit faster.

03:03.680 --> 03:09.360
I thought I had half an hour for that slide.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.960
I'm in the Type 3 Association Board.

03:10.960 --> 03:18.400
I'm an evangelist at Tuju, and I'm also consulting for Open Strategy Partners as well, and you

03:18.400 --> 03:28.160
can find me on the bird site and on the mammoth sites and other places as well.

03:28.160 --> 03:34.080
So, but of course, when I do presentations about Type 3, I do the next slide.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.440
And what is Type 3?

03:38.160 --> 03:46.840
Well, you know, if you look at it from the top, you know, Type 3 is a PHP-based CMS.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.200
Huh.

03:48.200 --> 03:53.280
It is also free and open source.

03:53.280 --> 04:01.320
It's also community-driven, and it's also backed by an association.

04:01.320 --> 04:06.600
In addition to that, it has a long history.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.640
That actually fits to all of these.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.960
CMS is right.

04:10.960 --> 04:18.040
And just to underscore that, let's just take a look at how similar we actually are.

04:18.040 --> 04:27.280
And for another presentation, I looked at Drupal and their core dependencies, composer

04:27.320 --> 04:28.320
dependencies.

04:28.320 --> 04:32.200
They have 54.

04:32.200 --> 04:34.480
In Type 3, we have a few more.

04:34.480 --> 04:39.320
We have a different way of thinking around what should be in the core of the CMS.

04:39.320 --> 04:45.000
We can take that fight outside, but I think, you know, whatever happens, we have 98 core

04:45.000 --> 04:55.760
dependencies, and what is really striking is that we have 33 in common.

04:55.760 --> 04:58.400
You know, this is the stuff that makes us different.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.960
This is the same stuff, right?

05:01.960 --> 05:06.000
We're made of the same kind of stuff, and that puts things in a different light when

05:06.000 --> 05:10.120
you think about our four CMSs, right?

05:10.120 --> 05:16.040
In the open source world, we're often very good at bashing each other.

05:16.040 --> 05:20.520
We're saying, you know, oh, no, you shouldn't choose Joomla or Drupal.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.440
Type 3 is best.

05:22.440 --> 05:26.360
And no.

05:26.360 --> 05:32.280
One of the reasons why we founded the Open Website Alliance is because the most important

05:32.280 --> 05:39.120
choice that a client can make today is to choose open source, because when you look

05:39.120 --> 05:45.080
at open source, we have more in common than we have differences.

05:45.080 --> 05:51.440
And then the choice of which CMS you need depends on what needs you have, what agencies

05:51.440 --> 05:55.880
are available in your area, those kind of things.

05:55.880 --> 06:01.720
And that means we have so much to win by collaborating.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.800
Jam.

06:03.800 --> 06:11.720
So, on to the substance of the talk.

06:11.720 --> 06:19.600
Let's remember what we're about, and remember, and our aim by the end of the day is to encourage

06:19.600 --> 06:24.440
all of us to get back out in the world and tell everyone we know again.

06:24.440 --> 06:33.000
So we're going to talk about the fundamental idea of freedom as open source as freedom.

06:33.000 --> 06:40.960
We're going to talk about the pragmatic reasons why, if it's an applicable use case, you really

06:40.960 --> 06:43.080
should give open source a fair chance.

06:43.080 --> 06:49.640
You should choose and use open source for completely pragmatic, non-moral, non-ethical

06:49.640 --> 06:50.640
reasons.

06:50.640 --> 06:52.400
There were really good reasons.

06:52.400 --> 06:57.840
My old job was very involved in telling those stories, and I pulled out a bunch of old slides

06:57.840 --> 07:00.760
to talk about this part.

07:00.760 --> 07:09.200
Then Matthias is going to help us shift gears into a real idealistic space where we can

07:09.200 --> 07:14.920
do my favorite part about open source, which is making the world a tiny bit better every

07:14.920 --> 07:19.720
day at a scope that I hadn't considered until I started talking with him a couple of years

07:19.720 --> 07:20.720
ago.

07:20.720 --> 07:26.320
I mean, if you want the tabloid version of this presentation, it's Barbenheimer, right?

07:26.320 --> 07:29.200
And I'm Barbie, and he's Ken.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.200
No, he's...

07:30.200 --> 07:31.200
Yes, he's Ken.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.200
Yeah.

07:32.200 --> 07:33.200
He's Oppenheimer.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.920
So, I do all of the pink stuff, and he does all of the dark stuff.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.640
Oh, is that... is that how it goes?

07:40.640 --> 07:41.640
Okay.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.360
So, really, really interesting.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.680
On Friday, you were at the European...

07:46.680 --> 07:48.480
What was the thing?

07:48.480 --> 07:51.680
The EU Open Source Policy Summit.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.680
Right.

07:52.680 --> 07:58.120
And four or five times during the day, they said, Open Source is one, which is awesome,

07:58.120 --> 07:59.120
right?

07:59.120 --> 08:06.520
We won, which is great, except, you know, and as I just said, I've been making a decent

08:06.520 --> 08:11.080
living at this since about 2008.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.680
All of us are doing all right with this Open Source stuff.

08:14.680 --> 08:21.680
He sent me this article a year ago, almost exactly a year ago, and I got really, really,

08:21.680 --> 08:24.400
really, really upset.

08:24.400 --> 08:34.240
First of all, I was part of the crew that came into Australia and helped Australia get

08:34.240 --> 08:35.240
on Drupal.

08:35.240 --> 08:41.640
Australia has a thing called GovCMS, which is Open Source, which does incredible work.

08:41.640 --> 08:49.200
It enables 133 departments, multiple state governments, generates work and expertise

08:49.200 --> 08:54.120
in the Australian economy, and somebody at Deloitte got the right meeting with somebody

08:54.120 --> 09:00.880
in the Ministry of Something in Australia, where they decided that they needed personalization

09:00.880 --> 09:08.080
and that since the current GovCMS infrastructure couldn't do it, therefore, they were going

09:08.080 --> 09:11.280
to rip and replace it with an Adobe solution.

09:11.280 --> 09:17.120
And the Australian government entered contracts with Adobe for more than 80 million Australian

09:17.120 --> 09:27.520
dollars and spent at least 36 million with Adobe on personalization that was illegal

09:27.520 --> 09:33.000
under Australian law because the data retention required to run the personalization wasn't

09:33.000 --> 09:37.400
allowed.

09:37.400 --> 09:43.920
All while Australia has an incredible success story of Open Source winning, right?

09:43.920 --> 09:50.680
So we have to tell our stories and we have to tell our colleagues and we have to be really

09:50.680 --> 09:56.120
up front about who we are and what we do.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.880
So that was the kickoff.

09:59.880 --> 10:03.280
Then Matthias and I both, I got very angry.

10:03.280 --> 10:07.280
That's my, unfortunately, still my go-to.

10:07.280 --> 10:11.920
And I decided to put, like, that we needed to start telling people.

10:11.920 --> 10:16.840
So Matthias and I went on the circuit for six or eight months last year.

10:16.840 --> 10:21.240
I did a bunch of buffs and a bunch of early versions of this talk and Matthias did versions

10:21.240 --> 10:23.640
of a really cool, completely different talk.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.680
And now we've smashed them together.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.200
So, right.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.840
So we've been complacent.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.240
I think the story picks up.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.800
Oh, no, it's still my year.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.800
Right?

10:33.800 --> 10:36.200
So here's one of my oldest slides.

10:36.200 --> 10:42.560
A gentleman named Jim Alchin in 2001 said that Open Source was an intellectual property

10:42.560 --> 10:46.880
destroyer and he couldn't think of anything worse for the software business, which is

10:46.880 --> 10:52.200
hilarious for all of us paying our rent with this stuff, right?

10:52.200 --> 10:57.760
And we used to think that that was cute and funny, obviously, but we've been busy and we've

10:57.760 --> 10:59.720
been making good things.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.560
We've been taking what we do for granted, right?

11:03.560 --> 11:09.520
And it's special and it's different and it runs on fundamentally different economic models

11:09.520 --> 11:12.840
and still generates incredible value, right?

11:12.840 --> 11:16.640
So we need to be loud and proud and we need to evangelize about it.

11:16.640 --> 11:21.960
So, time to get back to the basics.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.480
And basically, I mean, we've been complacent.

11:24.480 --> 11:32.600
We've been, yes, successful, but, yeah, that thing, you know, free isn't beer, we say about

11:32.600 --> 11:34.200
free and open source software.

11:34.200 --> 11:40.760
We've been maybe focusing too much on the beer, too much on just being free on the beach

11:40.760 --> 11:43.840
or something relaxed.

11:43.840 --> 11:49.480
But we've forgotten these really important questions about, you know, the other things

11:49.480 --> 11:53.160
that open source has.

11:53.160 --> 11:57.920
Like open source is not only free as in beer.

11:57.920 --> 12:04.360
Yeah, I know that comes as a shock to many of you, but it's also free as in free speech,

12:04.360 --> 12:06.200
for example.

12:06.200 --> 12:07.840
You can do whatever you want.

12:07.840 --> 12:12.200
Hello, you can say and do whatever you want.

12:12.200 --> 12:18.960
Open source is a threat to anyone who doesn't want you to do whatever you want.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.640
Hey, what is this picture?

12:22.640 --> 12:31.520
Crayons or, well, we also have choice, right?

12:31.520 --> 12:32.960
With open source.

12:32.960 --> 12:39.360
Open source introduces choice into the software business.

12:39.720 --> 12:44.600
When you have choice, something really interesting happens.

12:44.600 --> 12:51.000
Open source projects do not work the same way as other software projects do.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.600
That's why I have a slide here with the Gingerbread Man.

12:54.600 --> 12:57.080
Hello, this is Gingerbread Man.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.720
Do you know the Gingerbread Man fairy tale?

13:00.720 --> 13:03.200
Hands up.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.320
So some people don't know it.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.760
That gives me a chance to tell it, right?

13:06.760 --> 13:09.280
Which was what I wanted.

13:10.200 --> 13:15.360
The Gingerbread Man, there's this man and this wife who lives in a house in the forest

13:15.360 --> 13:20.120
and they don't have any children.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.000
Maybe they don't know how to make them.

13:22.000 --> 13:25.800
Maybe they have some kind of reason for not having them, but they really, really, really,

13:25.800 --> 13:28.200
really want them.

13:28.200 --> 13:34.720
And so the wife gets this idea that she can bake a Gingerbread Boy for them, which is like,

13:34.720 --> 13:36.360
yes, I know, super.

13:36.360 --> 13:38.160
We should all go home and do that.

13:38.560 --> 13:45.080
What happens when she opens the oven and wants to take out the Gingerbread Boy?

13:45.080 --> 13:49.080
He springs out alive and he runs out the door.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.520
Lots of stuff happens.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.320
Whom?

13:51.320 --> 13:54.520
He meets lots of people.

13:54.520 --> 13:58.000
That's what happens with an open source project as well.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.640
When someone open sources their project, it runs out.

14:01.640 --> 14:06.040
It gets a life of its own.

14:06.120 --> 14:09.960
And if you know the fairy tale, you know that the Gingerbread Boy dies in the end.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.600
He gets eaten by a fox, not Firefox.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.600
We love Firefox, but it's...

14:17.440 --> 14:18.680
Yeah.

14:18.680 --> 14:24.320
There is another side to open source projects as well that we might have forgotten a little bit.

14:24.320 --> 14:28.120
And that is the puppy side of open source.

14:28.120 --> 14:34.480
We have to care for our open source projects and for open source maintainers and everything

14:34.480 --> 14:36.280
that is open source.

14:36.280 --> 14:47.960
Because in the end, this freedom that we have been living with and enjoying also comes with responsibility.

14:47.960 --> 14:52.760
Open source is not only freedom, it is also responsibility.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.800
Thank you.

14:56.800 --> 15:07.080
So, casting myself into my old job, which I loved very much,

15:07.080 --> 15:11.240
free and open source software gives us some really unique value propositions to work with

15:11.240 --> 15:17.200
and make good business choices as good business people.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.720
And it all starts with what we call the four freedoms.

15:20.720 --> 15:25.760
And I guess everyone in this room is basically familiar with the four freedoms.

15:25.760 --> 15:29.000
But I want to go over this for a moment.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.560
You're free to use our software for anything.

15:32.560 --> 15:38.640
Other people are free to do what they want and run out of the oven and get eaten by the fox.

15:38.640 --> 15:45.080
You're free to understand what you're getting and you're free to have anyone else confirm for you

15:45.080 --> 15:47.920
that it does what it says and that there's no tricks and traps in it.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.920
And that's really powerful.

15:48.920 --> 15:56.200
And you're allowed to make it into exactly what you need to solve the exact problem that you have.

15:56.200 --> 16:00.160
And that enables a ton of people at every scale.

16:00.160 --> 16:06.760
The largest businesses like Pfizer who do unique things every day at a scale that we can't even imagine.

16:06.760 --> 16:11.160
They use open source to solve running their business.

16:11.160 --> 16:14.680
And the smallest businesses doing something that no one else does in the world,

16:14.680 --> 16:18.480
they have the same software and the same ability to solve problems uniquely,

16:18.520 --> 16:19.800
which is awesome.

16:19.800 --> 16:26.520
And we're allowed to make that ideal solution and then pass it on to other people.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.720
Sell it, share it, run services on it, whatever we want,

16:29.720 --> 16:32.280
so that its value can go and multiply.

16:32.280 --> 16:38.200
And this virtuous circle gives us all really incredible superpowers.

16:38.200 --> 16:46.000
So when selling open source projects, we love to tell people,

16:46.000 --> 16:51.800
hey, the old way of selling open source was something like,

16:51.800 --> 16:55.280
oh, you can totally make it cheaper because you save money over here.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.600
And being responsible with money is important.

16:58.600 --> 17:04.720
You need to set the expectation that this has a license fee of zero dollars or euros.

17:04.720 --> 17:11.760
But frankly, your superpower there is that when you save money on the license fees,

17:11.760 --> 17:15.200
you can reallocate it into making a better project.

17:15.200 --> 17:20.920
So every IT project, every software project has a lot of costs.

17:20.920 --> 17:21.840
None of it's free.

17:21.840 --> 17:25.840
If you tell people it's free, they're gonna be disappointed in the end, right?

17:25.840 --> 17:33.160
But you have this incredible possibility to invest in choosing exactly an even

17:33.160 --> 17:36.320
better color of blue than you could afford if you were paying a license fee.

17:37.680 --> 17:43.640
You can hire new people, you can train new people, and, right,

17:43.640 --> 17:50.280
you're only paying money for the features that you need that aren't quite there yet, right?

17:50.280 --> 17:55.360
But you get, in all of our projects cases, millions of hours of coding and

17:55.360 --> 17:58.880
contribution work for free, just as your baseline to get started with, right?

18:00.040 --> 18:07.080
Plus, putting together all four freedoms, you have the freedom to choose people working in

18:07.080 --> 18:11.120
your local economy so that your money stays where you live.

18:11.120 --> 18:18.440
And you should be able to control your own data and make it safe and private as it should be.

18:18.440 --> 18:22.440
You should also be able to define what that software does and

18:22.440 --> 18:27.280
when on your schedule and not when Microsoft deems it possible.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.000
And yes, on your time.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.120
My dad used to tell this story.

18:36.120 --> 18:40.080
And I'm not sure why because he's not in the restaurant business, but

18:42.080 --> 18:48.280
he would tell a story about if you open a restaurant,

18:48.280 --> 18:52.160
you should own the building that you have your restaurant in.

18:52.160 --> 18:56.280
Because if you rent a building from somewhere, you build up this business,

18:56.280 --> 18:59.400
you make great spaghetti, people come by, they love it, they know where you are.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.560
At some point, your landlord is going to turn around and come back and say,

19:05.320 --> 19:07.120
I love that your place is doing so great.

19:07.120 --> 19:08.680
I also love your spaghetti.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.440
I'm also doubling your rent, right?

19:11.440 --> 19:14.600
And since the restaurant business happens to be about location and

19:14.600 --> 19:20.240
people walking in and having a habit of going places, you're kind of stuck with that.

19:20.240 --> 19:25.120
And if you move, you're going to lose, potentially most of your business have to start again, right?

19:25.120 --> 19:30.040
So I don't want my government, for example,

19:30.040 --> 19:36.320
to rent the space that they do citizen services with for

19:36.320 --> 19:43.040
me from Oracle or IBM or whomever, who then turns around and say,

19:43.040 --> 19:46.720
by the way, that thing that you've been using, right?

19:46.720 --> 19:50.560
Or I don't know, don't build your business on other people's stuff as much as that's possible.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.960
That thing that you've been using, nobody else wants it.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.560
So we're sunsetting it at the end of the year, but

19:56.560 --> 19:59.880
you can buy this other new version, which costs twice as much next year, right?

19:59.880 --> 20:04.560
So open source gives us a power to live in our own houses, right?

20:04.560 --> 20:08.520
To own the bricks where we work and give control.

20:10.200 --> 20:17.280
I think the security debate is, well, as old as this slide, who remembers this?

20:20.440 --> 20:23.960
But still today, now here's the weird thing.

20:24.040 --> 20:30.760
All the people I know in here, I know we've had this conversation in the 2000 and

20:30.760 --> 20:34.200
zeros with people, but this stuff still comes up today.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.280
And that's the point of this talk, right?

20:36.280 --> 20:40.480
There are new generations of people, new generations of business people, new people

20:40.480 --> 20:45.160
coming up without any of our experiences and we have to go and pull this stuff out

20:45.160 --> 20:47.400
and create sensible resources about it.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.000
And that's also, I mean, just to bring that up.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.800
We have a talk about it later today.

20:53.800 --> 20:59.200
And by going around and thinking that we have won this again and

20:59.200 --> 21:03.160
just looking at each other in the open source business,

21:03.160 --> 21:07.960
we're really, I mean, putting nails into our own coffin.

21:09.960 --> 21:14.680
Owen is going to talk about a small software company called Adobe.

21:15.880 --> 21:19.080
That has a lot of marketing money later today.

21:19.280 --> 21:28.120
And there are things that they can absolutely not do.

21:28.120 --> 21:34.720
And if you get into the situation where you're actually owned by somebody else

21:34.720 --> 21:40.240
because they own your bricks, you are losing your freedom.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.280
And you'll soon be without beer.

21:43.600 --> 21:55.440
Usually in the political world, we think software as two black and white things.

21:55.440 --> 22:02.720
Either the government should build, run, own everything because the government knows best.

22:02.720 --> 22:04.720
Right?

22:04.720 --> 22:11.400
And then there's another side of politics where they say that is absolutely bullshit.

22:12.400 --> 22:17.720
That private sector should own, run everything and whatever the government does

22:17.720 --> 22:20.720
should just be to pay money to them so that it runs.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.720
Right?

22:22.720 --> 22:27.720
None of those are actually open source.

22:27.720 --> 22:31.720
They're both proprietary solutions.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.720
The government can keep secrets and so can the private sector.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.720
Right?

22:35.720 --> 22:37.120
They don't have to publish their code.

22:37.120 --> 22:39.720
They don't have to have open source licenses.

22:40.520 --> 22:45.040
Open source can do something amazing to this picture.

22:46.440 --> 22:55.800
We are underutilizing that ability of seeing open source as a part of civil society.

22:55.800 --> 23:05.680
Civil society is what we as people do together, whether it's going to acquire and singing in that choir

23:06.640 --> 23:11.240
or it's building software or it's trying to help other people.

23:11.240 --> 23:17.240
That happens in the civil society realm of the world.

23:18.240 --> 23:21.240
That is community.

23:22.240 --> 23:32.240
Community is a really important thing and you can have the government pay money into community projects to support them.

23:32.240 --> 23:39.240
Private sector can pick up what is being built by the open source community and make a business out of it.

23:39.240 --> 23:44.240
They can put money back into it, code back into it.

23:45.240 --> 23:51.240
By thinking community around software, we don't just enable one product,

23:51.240 --> 24:01.240
but we enable anyone to make any number of products and business plans and earn any money in any way.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.240
We're talking too little about this.

24:05.240 --> 24:08.240
Here's another picture that I like.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.240
This is a desert, everyone.

24:10.240 --> 24:14.240
What's the thing you think about in a desert?

24:14.240 --> 24:16.240
Well, it's sand.

24:16.240 --> 24:18.240
Sand, sand, sand.

24:18.240 --> 24:21.240
For as long as the eye can see, right?

24:23.240 --> 24:30.240
Well, the desert is a picture of proprietary software.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.240
It's monolithic.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.240
It's a mono culture.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.240
It's monotechnical.

24:35.240 --> 24:41.240
The guy who owns the watering hole in the desert, well, if he's your friend,

24:41.240 --> 24:47.240
you can go there as much as you want to, but he's also the one who decides when you're no longer friends

24:47.240 --> 24:53.240
and when you have to pay more, you still have to go to that watering hole and get your water, right?

24:53.240 --> 24:56.240
That is how it functions.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.240
You might feel free.

24:58.240 --> 25:04.240
You might feel that it's warm, but you are dependent on someone.

25:04.240 --> 25:08.240
Open source, on the other hand, is the jungle.

25:08.240 --> 25:14.240
And, well, the jungle is not a mono culture.

25:14.240 --> 25:18.240
There are lots of different plants, lots of different things going on here.

25:18.240 --> 25:23.240
Any plant can grow up at any time, succeed or not, who knows.

25:24.240 --> 25:29.240
It wouldn't have been here if all of these plants were fighting each other.

25:30.240 --> 25:36.240
This is a picture of collaboration, but also a picture of interdependence.

25:36.240 --> 25:41.240
We're all dependent on each other just like the Drupalian type of three dependencies.

25:41.240 --> 25:48.240
If one of our shared dependencies, you know, isn't anymore, we both have a problem.

25:48.240 --> 25:53.240
So we have a shared responsibility around that.

25:54.240 --> 26:01.240
Everyone has access, but we have to not only take care of ourselves,

26:01.240 --> 26:04.240
we have to take care of others as well.

26:04.240 --> 26:09.240
And another really interesting thing is this is sand, right?

26:09.240 --> 26:10.240
Like in the desert.

26:10.240 --> 26:15.240
And what do we do when we want to stop a desert from growing?

26:18.240 --> 26:19.240
Any ideas?

26:21.240 --> 26:24.240
Exactly, we plant trees.

26:24.240 --> 26:32.240
The roots of the trees, the life, the community that we bring in,

26:32.240 --> 26:37.240
it doesn't only hold the grains, but it also holds water.

26:37.240 --> 26:40.240
It creates organic matter.

26:40.240 --> 26:44.240
That means that the desert will not come back, right?

26:44.240 --> 26:49.240
It changes the environment totally because of community.

26:51.240 --> 27:01.240
And now, Mr. McGuire here will say a few words about how this changes our way of thinking about government involvement.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.240
Yes, yes.

27:04.240 --> 27:18.240
So governments have the power to change the world.

27:18.240 --> 27:22.240
They have a certain amount of money that they can invest in,

27:22.240 --> 27:26.240
and there are some traditional ways to do that.

27:26.240 --> 27:37.240
But I think that the other side, that building a bridge across a given geographical feature will make it possible to have more commerce

27:37.240 --> 27:42.240
or more tinder dates or something, and they think that society will be better for it.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.240
They think the economy will be better for it.

27:44.240 --> 27:48.240
They can plan it, they can execute it, they can build it when the money is spent, it's spent,

27:48.240 --> 27:53.240
and the thing works or it doesn't, we find out when it happens.

27:53.240 --> 27:57.240
The same goes for they can choose to vaccinate people.

27:57.240 --> 28:05.240
They might choose to vaccinate people in another country so that they have better outcomes in that country,

28:05.240 --> 28:12.240
and then maybe change migration patterns, create economic welfare and growth in another place.

28:12.240 --> 28:17.240
Unfortunately, a lot of governments also choose to do sort of the opposite with their money.

28:17.240 --> 28:25.240
In all of these cases, however, whatever amount of money is spent on whatever number of physical things

28:25.240 --> 28:28.240
and necessary or not, this is reality.

28:28.240 --> 28:32.240
There's this really interesting other way to build government infrastructure.

28:32.240 --> 28:42.240
It doesn't cure diseases and so on per se, but when governments invest in open source digital infrastructure,

28:42.240 --> 28:49.240
build the perfect government ministry organizational website, right?

28:49.240 --> 28:53.240
Give it to the next one, give it to the next one, give it to the next one.

28:53.240 --> 28:56.240
Australia's done this very, very successfully and it's not the only place.

28:56.240 --> 29:03.240
It's a terrific model and it's this crazy thing where the money that a government spends once

29:03.240 --> 29:11.240
can infinitely improve and become infinitely, theoretically infinitely more valuable.

29:11.240 --> 29:18.240
The more departments who use that solution, the more value it becomes and the return on investment can grow kind of forever.

29:18.240 --> 29:27.240
It is also entirely reasonable to expect to be able to solve problems in your own country, in another country,

29:27.240 --> 29:36.240
and share this goodness and it's an incredible superpower and it's not just theoretical,

29:37.240 --> 29:44.240
and it's not just sort of government websites versus spending money on vaccines.

29:44.240 --> 29:49.240
There's this incredible real world effect that our work has.

29:49.240 --> 29:59.240
The UK IT supplier map before 2010 looked like this

30:00.240 --> 30:12.240
and these dozen dots or so, London, Reading, Brighton and so on, correspond exactly to HP headquarters,

30:12.240 --> 30:17.240
IBM headquarters, Adobe headquarters, Oracle headquarters and so on in the UK.

30:17.240 --> 30:25.240
And not only that, but they are the foreign headquarters, mostly for American companies, right?

30:25.240 --> 30:32.240
So the UK government was sending a ton of money into these companies.

30:32.240 --> 30:38.240
Now, they had this incredible program in the UK, the digital transformation,

30:38.240 --> 30:44.240
and they did a whole number of things that have had very, very positive benefits.

30:44.240 --> 30:51.240
I had the incredible privilege of being at a talk from the Cabinet Office,

30:51.240 --> 30:58.240
the guy who ran this program inside the Cabinet in the UK, and he gave me these slides originally.

30:58.240 --> 31:00.240
So they did a whole number of things.

31:00.240 --> 31:03.240
They created this procurement system that works quite well.

31:03.240 --> 31:15.240
They did a whole bunch of things, but fascinatingly they said any government IT project with a budget of less than 100 million pounds,

31:15.240 --> 31:19.240
they made a whole smaller businesses could apply for them.

31:19.240 --> 31:23.240
So SMEs got access to government projects under 100 million pounds,

31:23.240 --> 31:33.240
and they said if an open source solution can do the job, there is a preference for open source solutions in these procurements.

31:33.240 --> 31:38.240
There was a bunch of other stuff, but smaller companies were allowed to bid on government projects,

31:38.240 --> 31:44.240
and open source got a leg up based on functionality, not on marketing, right?

31:44.240 --> 31:52.240
So a few years later, the government procurement map looked like that.

31:52.240 --> 31:54.240
Don't drop your mind.

31:54.240 --> 31:58.240
Okay. Now, there's a bunch of wonderful stuff about this.

31:58.240 --> 32:06.240
First of all, all of this UK tax money, there's clearly some of it still going out of the country into large corporations,

32:06.240 --> 32:09.240
but think how many digital agencies, right?

32:09.240 --> 32:14.240
And in all over the map, even in Europe, right?

32:14.240 --> 32:16.240
Even in the Republic of Ireland, oddly.

32:16.240 --> 32:23.240
But right, look how much, imagine how much money the UK government spends on IT,

32:23.240 --> 32:31.240
and how that now goes into local people, local economies, new jobs and training and skills for the UK.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.240
It's an incredibly powerful story.

32:33.240 --> 32:35.240
An open source, right?

32:35.240 --> 32:40.240
It wouldn't be possible without the open source piece of that.

32:40.240 --> 32:51.240
So I believe the next line is, it was a dark and stormy night at the Type 3 Association.

32:51.240 --> 32:56.240
When the telephone suddenly rang.

32:56.240 --> 33:02.240
Yeah, we have somewhat more modern telephones in Type 3 as well, just to say that,

33:02.240 --> 33:08.240
yes, the telephone rang, and it was the government of Rwanda.

33:08.240 --> 33:17.240
They had 250 Type 3 installations that needed upgrading.

33:17.240 --> 33:22.240
Well, they definitely rang the right number, right?

33:22.240 --> 33:26.240
We can do that, but Type 3 doesn't make websites.

33:26.240 --> 33:29.240
Agencies make websites.

33:29.240 --> 33:31.240
How are we going to solve this?

33:31.240 --> 33:37.240
Well, we could have called one of our larger agencies and said, hey, you guys do it.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.240
You know, travel down there.

33:39.240 --> 33:42.240
This is money for you.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.240
You've been supporting us.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.240
We're nice.

33:45.240 --> 33:54.240
Well, and you could imagine, you could imagine in some circumstances and with any version of proprietary software

33:54.240 --> 34:00.240
that some large foreign company would come in, set up an office, do the work,

34:00.240 --> 34:07.240
pull millions out of the country, and potentially leave again.

34:07.240 --> 34:10.240
That's actually how it's done a lot of the time.

34:10.240 --> 34:16.240
We often call it foreign aid, actually, but it's not so much aid.

34:16.240 --> 34:23.240
It's basically an established business that open a local office and then they export all of their earnings.

34:23.240 --> 34:33.240
And they use closed solutions with this wonderful vendor lock-in that we all love to create financial independence.

34:33.240 --> 34:36.240
We've seen this before, right?

34:36.240 --> 34:39.240
We've seen this a hundred years ago.

34:39.240 --> 34:45.240
This, ladies and gentlemen, is colonists and exploitative.

34:45.240 --> 34:47.240
It's just got new clothes on.

34:47.240 --> 34:51.240
It's still the same way of working.

34:51.240 --> 34:54.240
So we couldn't do that.

34:54.240 --> 35:01.240
What we decided to do instead in type of three, and this is unique to open source,

35:01.240 --> 35:16.240
is we decided to use our community to create independent local business and expertise in Rwanda to serve their government.

35:16.240 --> 35:29.240
So you've got an independent financial cycle where the government pays agencies in the country, they serve their government.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.240
It all happens there.

35:31.240 --> 35:36.240
You're building something instead of just locking them in,

35:36.240 --> 35:44.240
and they have all of the freedom they want to do anything else with that expertise as well.

35:44.240 --> 35:52.240
And Daniel who's sitting here has written a wonderful article and we have a report about how that happened,

35:52.240 --> 36:02.240
that we also have some paper copies of, but basically people from type of three agencies in Europe

36:02.240 --> 36:08.240
spent a week in Rwanda training people.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.240
They came back a few times and did the same thing.

36:11.240 --> 36:27.240
And the result of that is we soon have 300 type of three open source based websites running everything in the Rwanda government,

36:27.240 --> 36:35.240
everything from the president's office down to local governments within the country.

36:35.240 --> 36:43.240
It's all done by Rwandans, for Rwandans, it's an opportunity for Rwanda.

36:43.240 --> 36:51.240
And the training, the community people trained both government employees and people from the local economy,

36:51.240 --> 36:56.240
so they created agency skills in Kigali as well.

36:56.240 --> 37:04.240
So yes, both government and local agencies were trained, that was for you online, that was what Jam said.

37:04.240 --> 37:16.240
And to put this into a more tabloid phrasing, what we did was we took a democratic and not-for-profit open source project

37:16.240 --> 37:26.240
and we used that to support sustainable and independent local business, right?

37:27.240 --> 37:30.240
Right?

37:32.240 --> 37:39.240
That's what Australia does when they invest in open source, that's what Germany does when they invest in open source,

37:39.240 --> 37:45.240
that's what governments should do when they work with open source.

37:45.240 --> 37:57.240
They support their ideological foundation in free speech, democracy, peaceful coexistence, hello,

37:57.240 --> 38:06.240
that's a really, really good selling point for open source, who can do that with proprietary exploitative software, eh?

38:07.240 --> 38:10.240
Go ahead.

38:10.240 --> 38:16.240
So, yeah, this is the GovCMS link, do you want to say something about that Jam?

38:16.240 --> 38:20.240
Or should I just continue ranting? I'm going to rant more.

38:20.240 --> 38:33.240
Okay, because basically what we created and what they have created is locally led, non-exploitative, anti-colonial software

38:34.240 --> 38:39.240
and they've created community, they've created civil society.

38:39.240 --> 38:45.240
Civil society, everyone won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022.

38:45.240 --> 38:52.240
Go and look at the reasons for why that prize was given to two organizations and one person.

38:52.240 --> 39:01.240
The last sentence includes civil society, open source organizations are civil society organizations.

39:01.240 --> 39:08.240
They contribute the same way as other civil society organizations too, the welfare of the world.

39:08.240 --> 39:11.240
Now, what next?

39:16.240 --> 39:24.240
Right, so we looked at our origin story and the four freedoms that define us

39:24.240 --> 39:34.240
and then worked up through this scale of how things can be better using open source, thinking open source

39:34.240 --> 39:43.240
and expanding those practices well beyond the scope of just software into the real impact that we have on the world.

39:43.240 --> 39:52.240
So what we really think is important is that our values, right, are the values of a healthy society

39:52.240 --> 40:01.240
and this is not the future we were promised, this is not the happy place that I wanted to be in as a grown-up

40:01.240 --> 40:10.240
and so we have the chance to, we have the chance, we are cross-border international communities of practice.

40:10.240 --> 40:19.240
We are models of democracy in a time when democracy seems to be under attack, right?

40:20.240 --> 40:31.240
So at this point, I think the call to action is look at things like the Cyber Resilience Act,

40:31.240 --> 40:39.240
help governments who are willing to listen, get things right, help your friends in business and elsewhere

40:39.240 --> 40:48.240
make the right choices about software and the open source economy is not taught in schools.

40:49.240 --> 40:58.240
Recently I spent, I had a 45-minute appointment at an embassy talking about a project similar to the one in Randa.

40:58.240 --> 41:05.240
Well, I have 45 minutes. I spent 30 of those minutes trying to convince them that open source actually works.

41:05.240 --> 41:11.240
We need to tell people that open source works and why.

41:11.240 --> 41:16.240
Yes, yes we do.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.240
He agrees.

41:18.240 --> 41:26.240
So, and in that spirit, welcome to the Open Web Alliance Dev Room for the day. We'll take a very short break.
