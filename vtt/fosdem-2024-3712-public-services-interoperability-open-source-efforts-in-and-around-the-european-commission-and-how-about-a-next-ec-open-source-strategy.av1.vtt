00:00.000 --> 00:13.640
Let's start our second session on the, let's now focus even more on the European Commission

00:13.640 --> 00:17.040
and its efforts on the direction of open source.

00:17.040 --> 00:22.800
So we have two experts from the OSPO here to tell us a little bit what has been done.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.880
And again, let's try to remember to look up the future.

00:25.880 --> 00:29.040
Let's see how everything has been done, what we can learn from it.

00:29.040 --> 00:33.120
And let's also try to bring up new ideas on how we can make this work.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.600
So, all yours.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.680
Thank you very much.

00:39.680 --> 00:41.360
We also have stickers.

00:41.360 --> 00:43.520
I think that's important.

00:43.520 --> 00:47.280
Please pick them as you leave the room when you walk away thinking, oh, this is not going

00:47.280 --> 00:48.280
where we wanted to go.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.760
There's a flyer.

00:49.760 --> 00:56.320
And outside you already saw we have a roll-up to make a bit of advertisement for the OSPO.

00:56.320 --> 01:02.120
So Gai Selenius, I'm Dutch.

01:02.120 --> 01:06.920
Sir Anjith Arora, I'm confused.

01:06.920 --> 01:14.560
Indian originally, but have been in the UK for 40 years and Belgium with the last six.

01:14.560 --> 01:19.680
And the two of us will try to do a stand-up comedy show that will tell you a little bit

01:19.680 --> 01:24.720
and bring you up to speed on what happens in open sourcing and around the commission.

01:25.720 --> 01:31.320
We've been here already for quite a few hours and you've heard a lot about the policy developments.

01:31.320 --> 01:39.840
The OSPO was started three years ago to remove legal and organizational barriers so that the

01:39.840 --> 01:44.760
commission could become faster at doing and sharing open source.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.680
And what this first slide, our staircase diagram, should show you is that we've been

01:48.680 --> 01:51.400
in open source forever.

01:52.080 --> 01:57.440
He's right behind the camera now.

01:57.440 --> 02:02.880
He's one of those who worked at the commission and kick-started what now is the Apache project.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.520
That's before this timeline started.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.600
And the commission has always used open source in the infrastructure right from the start.

02:09.600 --> 02:14.680
And I spoke to the people who installed the first lamp stack saying, OK, so that's where

02:14.680 --> 02:19.000
we kept notes on which server was doing what and what the passwords were and who was doing

02:19.000 --> 02:24.720
things and so we could transfer it when we rotate it around the organization.

02:24.720 --> 02:33.360
And pretty soon other DGs, because Srinjeet and I are talking from the Digit, the Directorate

02:33.360 --> 02:38.960
General for Informatics that's doing like an internal service provider, pretty soon

02:38.960 --> 02:43.360
other services, the ones who are doing policy or putting things in place, were calling Digit

02:43.360 --> 02:50.080
saying, I need a server for, I have a pesticide database system, it ran on a lamp stack.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.680
And so the second layer, the use thing, that really exploded quite fast.

02:54.680 --> 03:02.600
And so in our data centers, I think the numbers are 60, 70 percent these days are Linux machines,

03:02.600 --> 03:05.800
replacing other Unix types by the way.

03:05.800 --> 03:14.720
And then around 2003, 2006, in our Directorate General people started realizing we need to

03:14.720 --> 03:18.360
work at the member state because this stuff is reusable, it's going to save us pots and

03:18.360 --> 03:19.880
pots of money.

03:19.880 --> 03:27.200
And the interoperability program was started that led to the interoperable act.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.200
Thank you.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.200
Thank you.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.200
Thank you.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.200
Thank you.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.200
Thank you.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.200
Thank you.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.200
Thank you.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.200
Thank you.

03:35.200 --> 03:36.200
Thank you.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.200
Thank you.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.200
Thank you.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.200

03:41.200 --> 03:42.200
Thank you.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.200
Thank you.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.200
Thank you.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.200
Thank you.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.200
Thank you.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.200
Thank you.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.200
Thank you.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.200
Thank you.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.200
Thank you.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.200

03:55.200 --> 03:56.200
Thank you.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.200
Thank you.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.200
Thank you.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.200

04:08.200 --> 04:09.200
Thank you.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.200
Thank you.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.200
Thank you.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.200
Thank you.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.200
Thank you.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.200
Thank you.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.200

04:29.200 --> 04:30.200

04:30.200 --> 04:31.200
Thank you.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.200
Thank you.

04:32.200 --> 04:33.200
Thank you.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.200
Thank you.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.200

04:35.200 --> 04:36.200

04:38.200 --> 04:39.200
Thank you.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.200
Thank you.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.200
Thank you.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.200
Thank you.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.200
Thank you.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.200
Thank you.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.200

04:47.200 --> 04:48.200
Thank you.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.200
Thank you.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.200
Thank you.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.200
Thank you.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.200
Thank you.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.200
Thank you.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.200
Thank you.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.200
Thank you.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.220
Thank you.

04:57.220 --> 04:58.200
Thank you.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.200
Thank you.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.200
Thank you.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.200
Thank you.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.200
Thank you.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.200
Thank you.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.200
Thank you.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.200
Thank you.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.200
Thank you very much.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.200
No matter how much I say this.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.200
Your time is above.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.200
Thank you.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.200
Thank you very much.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.200
Thank you.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.200
Thank you very much.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.200
Thank you.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
Thank you.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.200
Thank you.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.200
Anna.

05:23.200 --> 05:32.200
I've been trying to observe this change in the Commission ever since 2007 when I started writing for the European Commission on the open source observatory.

05:32.200 --> 05:40.200
And so I've seen it going on this path. And I helped the Commission ask if I could help revamp the open source strategy.

05:40.200 --> 05:50.200
In the year 2000 and 20, we announced an open source strategy that came with 10 action plans.

05:50.200 --> 05:54.200
They are in the strategy, the strategy is open, it's out there.

05:54.200 --> 05:58.200
Except that we never gave the details that was far too much.

05:58.200 --> 06:04.200
The shopping list was like this. And first being recursive, start yourself, set up an open source program office.

06:04.200 --> 06:14.200
That was really quite easy. But the two big barriers we had was that the Commission had a big problem in making its software available as open source.

06:14.200 --> 06:25.200
Because we had a red tape process that would take six months of just a project person chasing signatures to get permission to make the software available as open source.

06:25.200 --> 06:32.200
In the room we have one of the IP specialists who helped us a great deal with removing this barrier.

06:32.200 --> 06:38.200
We now have, the default is if you want to share your software, it is open source.

06:38.200 --> 06:44.200
If you want to share this proprietary, you go into this paperwork process that will take you six months, which means no project will do this.

06:44.200 --> 06:54.200
Because we don't have time. No development project has a project developer that can spend 10 minutes every Friday afternoon chasing signatures.

06:54.200 --> 07:05.200
Now when the project team says this is a useful software solution, it shares its open source.

07:05.200 --> 07:15.200
That came with code.jropa.tu because we needed a place to share our software repository, share our software.

07:15.200 --> 07:22.200
And the other big thing is that we moved our internal teams to sharing software amongst themselves.

07:22.200 --> 07:28.200
And finally when you created a project on your internal repository, it was closed to you and your team.

07:28.200 --> 07:34.200
Which means that I as an external, not in that team, could not see what the code was.

07:34.200 --> 07:42.200
I didn't have access, only saw the name and you could find with a bit of luck the project owner and you could ask for permission to see the code.

07:42.200 --> 07:48.200
We've changed this default and we already see the rewards because teams are now starting to reuse each other's work.

07:48.200 --> 07:54.200
Not so much literally the code, but they're starting to build on each other's preparations.

07:54.200 --> 08:00.200
Open sourcing, I managed it. I talked about it already. We have 400 projects, 2000 users. It's growing.

08:00.200 --> 08:10.200
You're all welcome at code.jropa.tu. It's GitLab based. You need to log in, but that's just my small step.

08:10.200 --> 08:21.200
The legal barrier was removed. I talked about that. We have labs, an important way to onboard new open source tools to our users.

08:21.200 --> 08:27.200
So people from other services can come to us and say, can you, you know, we would like to experiment with HedgeDoc for example.

08:27.200 --> 08:34.200
Well, now we can do that. Here are the ones we're currently running. Ythsi, OpenTalk, HedgeDoc, CripPad, Discourse.

08:34.200 --> 08:41.200
And we're always looking for others. Outreach is what we're doing here and in other places.

08:41.200 --> 08:52.200
We successfully integrated open source in our IT governance projects, which means that when a new project is proposed,

08:52.200 --> 09:03.200
we are asking questions about open source. So we are forcing projects to from the start compare and look on the market to see if there's an open source alternative for their proprietary product.

09:03.200 --> 09:16.200
And if they are willing to share whatever they're doing as code. And I will hand over to Srinjeet for the important pilot and preparatory action. Thank you.

09:16.200 --> 09:31.200
So I joined, as I said, six years ago on this project, EU FOSSA 2. So we have this cycle. We may start some initiative.

09:31.200 --> 09:42.200
The European Parliament gives us some money and we start what's called a pilot project. If that's successful, we move on to what's called a preparatory action project.

09:42.200 --> 09:54.200
So hence the number two after the initiative. And in the EU FOSSA 2 initiative, we actually created an inventory of our open source.

09:54.200 --> 10:06.200
We didn't have one. Not ashamed of that because I don't think many organizations have one even today. And it's a fast moving, changing scenario.

10:06.200 --> 10:19.200
And then from that software inventory, we were able to identify which was our most important software. And then we decided to run back bounties and hackathons to improve the security.

10:19.200 --> 10:31.200
So a lot of things were done under EU FOSSA, many for the first time like back bounties and hackathons. And then we thought, why are we not doing this on a European scale?

10:31.200 --> 10:51.200
Really, we need to cooperate on open source and bridge these islands that exist. And actually it's the right time because open source has matured to a very high degree in many member states.

10:51.200 --> 11:07.200
So it makes sense to cooperate and on a number of areas. So basically in terms of specific initiatives, so FOSSA is about FOSSA for European Public Services.

11:08.200 --> 11:19.200
And it's about cooperation. Now breaking that down into specific work packages, one of them is to create a catalog of solutions.

11:19.200 --> 11:30.200
So the French government, the Italian government, all member states have built wonderful open source systems, solutions. Why are we not reusing them?

11:30.200 --> 11:45.200
Often we are not reusing them in our own countries, let alone across Europe. So giving visibility to solutions built by and for public administrations is a wonderful idea.

11:45.200 --> 11:57.200
And we've had great successes in national catalogs and regional catalogs, saving lots of money, time and increasing interoperability.

11:57.200 --> 12:11.200
So FOSSA is going to, we already have an MVP and we're going to expand it to many more member states. And hopefully we'll have a rich catalog which will save time and money.

12:12.200 --> 12:21.200
Can I steal back? Yeah, please. Yeah, because we're being flagged also for going over time in our own session. I just wanted to round off with one thing.

12:21.200 --> 12:32.200
Is that we are trying to prove that we can reuse software. So the catalog system is actually thanks to the Italian government team digitalicus.

12:32.200 --> 12:42.200
We're starting to reuse their tool and the standard public auto jamal is also developed by them and others. And this is also something we're implementing.

12:42.200 --> 12:50.200
And there's the author. There we go. So thanks for that. And I think you should deserve the credit for this.

12:50.200 --> 13:03.200
And we are now in the process of launching our internal efforts to revamp the strategy once more. Because the staircase diagram, the first one, those were the internal strategies.

13:03.200 --> 13:09.200
The last one, the most recent one was an external communicated internal strategy. And we're going into this process again.

13:09.200 --> 13:20.200
And so the next round here is where we would like to discuss with you, whether we would like to have ideas from you, we would like to know what else can we do as an Ospo.

13:20.200 --> 13:27.200
And I think the whole day so far has given us a lot of stuff to work with. But that's what we'll do in the next session.
