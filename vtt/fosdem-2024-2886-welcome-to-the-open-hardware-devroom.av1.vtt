00:00.000 --> 00:15.120
Okay, so it is 9 o'clock, which means that it is time for us to start the open hardware

00:15.120 --> 00:17.360
in CAD-CAM Dev Room.

00:17.360 --> 00:21.600
First of all, I want to say welcome to the Dev Room.

00:21.600 --> 00:30.640
We've had a long run at Fosdame where we had about eight years in a row and then we

00:30.640 --> 00:33.520
missed one last year.

00:33.520 --> 00:38.400
But with a little bit of luck and a little bit of help from our friends, we're back again

00:38.400 --> 00:41.920
this year and hopefully we'll continue on.

00:41.920 --> 00:51.200
So we've had two years without updates on what we are doing in the hardware community,

00:51.200 --> 00:56.200
what we're doing in the open hardware community, and what we're doing in the hardware development

00:56.200 --> 00:57.200
community.

00:57.200 --> 01:03.520
And today we're going to have a series of talks that really delve into some of the most

01:03.520 --> 01:12.760
interesting aspects of creating hardware and building things for your use to make things

01:12.760 --> 01:16.000
easier, to make things better for us and better for the world.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.000
So I'm excited to listen to what each of our speakers here have to say.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.600
Just a couple of administrative things.

01:26.600 --> 01:31.880
As you come into the room, we're pretty light here at the beginning because no one wants

01:31.880 --> 01:34.200
to listen to the intro talk.

01:34.200 --> 01:39.840
But as you come into the room, do try to move to the center.

01:39.840 --> 01:45.160
That will give people who come in late the ability to have a seat without standing in

01:45.160 --> 01:46.880
front of you.

01:46.880 --> 01:54.040
And other than that, we are scheduled on a back to back basis, which means that our

01:54.040 --> 01:59.200
speakers will be taking questions while the next speaker sets up their laptop.

01:59.200 --> 02:04.920
And you saw that I was just kind of fiddling with my laptop here to get the resolution

02:04.920 --> 02:05.920
right.

02:05.920 --> 02:10.200
We'll have five minutes of change over time, so you get five minutes to kind of set up

02:10.200 --> 02:11.640
your laptop.

02:11.640 --> 02:16.920
Taking that five minutes while you're setting up your laptop for the next talk, we're going

02:16.920 --> 02:22.040
to have questions for the previous speaker.

02:22.040 --> 02:28.800
We have a microphone that we're going to pass around for questions.

02:28.800 --> 02:36.040
Do try to either wait for the microphone or if you are the speaker and someone asks a

02:36.040 --> 02:40.400
question without the microphone, repeat the question back.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.440
Repeat the question back.

02:41.440 --> 02:43.160
You'll record it on the video stream.

02:43.160 --> 02:49.640
That will allow our audience to get into the...

02:49.640 --> 02:55.960
Yes, that will allow our audience online to be able to see the questions.

02:55.960 --> 03:01.160
So we have our helpful placards here at the front.

03:01.160 --> 03:07.700
They will give you 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 5 minutes, and then times up.

03:07.700 --> 03:14.220
So when times up, that means that you are in the five minute change over period.

03:14.220 --> 03:20.100
So the next person is going to come up and begin setting up, and you should ideally already

03:20.100 --> 03:21.980
be taking questions.

03:21.980 --> 03:29.020
Now the other placards that you have, you'll either say, speak closer to the microphone.

03:29.020 --> 03:33.940
As you can see, this microphone is picking up things pretty well and pretty far away

03:33.940 --> 03:35.140
from the microphone.

03:35.140 --> 03:40.340
But if you whisper and you're a very quiet speaker, you might need to talk closer to

03:40.340 --> 03:41.340
the microphone.

03:41.340 --> 03:44.340
There's a sign for that.

03:44.340 --> 03:47.900
Other than that, there is also a reminder.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.780
Can you please repeat the question?

03:49.780 --> 03:52.820
So if you see the sign, please repeat the question.

03:52.820 --> 03:53.960
Just stop.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.260
Repeat the question.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.380
Double check that that's what you're answering.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.700
Get it recorded and then continue on.

03:59.700 --> 04:07.140
So with that in mind, I would like to welcome up our first speaker for the day.

04:07.140 --> 04:15.540
We are going to have a quick introduction, not so quick maybe, to building information

04:15.540 --> 04:18.380
management from Tomas Kirchen.

04:18.380 --> 04:20.540
No, not.
