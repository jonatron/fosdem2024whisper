00:00.000 --> 00:12.640
Welcome everyone to the LLVM Dev Room.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.800
I hope the microphone is working.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.720
This year we have three organizers.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.320
We'd just like to very briefly introduce ourselves.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.120
My name is Christoph Bales.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.360
My name is Peter Smith.

00:24.360 --> 00:27.560
And my name is Marius Brila.

00:27.560 --> 00:32.400
We thought we'd use the first five minutes to give a little bit of general information.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.880
It's an anniversary this year.

00:33.880 --> 00:36.560
This is the 10th LLVM Dev Room.

00:36.560 --> 00:41.200
The first one got started in 2014.

00:41.200 --> 00:46.960
Every year we were here, except for 2021, we couldn't find volunteers to organize.

00:46.960 --> 00:50.600
And there's been quite a few different people who helped with the organization over the

00:50.600 --> 00:51.600
years.

00:51.600 --> 00:52.600
I've put in a few names on the slides.

00:52.840 --> 00:55.280
Not going to call them out.

00:55.280 --> 00:57.640
And I'm pretty sure I probably forgot someone.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.520
My apologies.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.760
This year is the first time.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.960
There's also a GC Dev Room.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.600
And I'm very happy that we're running it back to back.

01:05.600 --> 01:11.000
So I'm hoping that enables some cross-pollination of IDs across the two communities.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.400
So that is very nice to see.

01:15.400 --> 01:21.720
Maybe a few words on if you're interested in participating in the LLVM project that

01:21.720 --> 01:26.760
you're not entirely sure exactly where to start or if you're a newcomer.

01:26.760 --> 01:28.920
I've put a few links here on the slides.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.800
I'll very briefly go over them.

01:32.800 --> 01:38.760
Most of the communication in the LLVM project happens on this course, which is a forum or

01:38.760 --> 01:39.880
discord.

01:39.880 --> 01:43.760
If you want to have the links, go to the FOSDEM schedule page.

01:43.760 --> 01:47.360
You can download the slides there and just click on the links there.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.560
The LLVM project has office hours and online sync-ups.

01:51.560 --> 01:57.760
Office hours, it's where an individual expert on something in the LLVM makes themselves

01:57.760 --> 01:59.240
available on a regular schedule.

01:59.240 --> 02:03.880
You can dial in and any question goes as long as it's on topic.

02:03.880 --> 02:08.280
You can just follow the link as I think about a dozen different experts who volunteer to

02:08.280 --> 02:09.280
do that.

02:09.280 --> 02:13.240
If you're an expert yourself and you think this is a good idea, please consider volunteering

02:13.240 --> 02:16.320
some of your time, too.

02:16.320 --> 02:21.160
Online sync-ups are regular sync-ups, simply on a very specific topic.

02:21.160 --> 02:24.400
They're also all documented on the website.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.280
We have a community calendar.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.920
I have a screenshot on the left there.

02:29.920 --> 02:33.720
You can't read what's in there, but it just gives an indication of pretty much any day

02:33.720 --> 02:34.720
of the week.

02:34.720 --> 02:40.720
There's at least something going on where people, sometimes on a specific topic, can

02:40.720 --> 02:44.640
come together to have an interactive discussion.

02:44.640 --> 02:51.160
All the ways to get started is have a look at getting started issues in the issue tracker.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.720
This morning, I were 148 open.

02:53.720 --> 02:59.480
We're now three hours later, so I'm not sure if that count is exactly correct still.

02:59.480 --> 03:03.520
There's a link getting involved with HTML, which gives you lots of starters on the technical

03:03.520 --> 03:04.520
details.

03:04.520 --> 03:13.680
LLVM does take part in Google Summer of Code, also in Outreachy.

03:13.680 --> 03:19.280
If you would like to work on LLVM and get paid for it, there's always quite a few different

03:19.280 --> 03:27.400
companies looking, having job openings to work on LLVM.

03:27.400 --> 03:28.200
That's all.
