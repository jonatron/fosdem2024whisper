00:00.000 --> 00:15.200
Hi, I'm Steve. I'm a Swiss software engineer. I like to thinker. I like to make things. I

00:15.200 --> 00:20.640
like to share the thing that I like and the thing that I make. This talk is a lot about

00:20.640 --> 00:27.400
these kind of things. And the story starts, as many stories started today I think, in

00:27.400 --> 00:33.840
2020, 21. And for some reason lots of people started to pick up new hobbies and I was no

00:33.840 --> 00:40.720
exception. So I started to do 3D printing. And it was a lot of fun. I bought a cheap Chinese

00:40.720 --> 00:48.160
printer. I think you're quite a bit with it. And I must admit the hardware part was not

00:48.160 --> 00:53.720
really my thing. I was more into the modeling part. But yeah, lots of fun. The thing is it

00:53.720 --> 00:59.040
was not as easy to share with friends. A lawyer friend, they're not going to thinker as much as

00:59.040 --> 01:05.680
I do. So it's more difficult to share. The thing is the machines are getting better nowadays.

01:05.680 --> 01:12.440
They're getting closer to being appliances. And so I can share them with them. And I can try to

01:12.440 --> 01:18.040
share the hobby, generally speaking. And the good thing is the modeling part, people are not going

01:18.080 --> 01:23.800
to model. I assume that these people that are interested potentially in 3D printing, that are

01:23.800 --> 01:28.160
going to interested. They're going to go on one of these websites, if you don't know, they're a

01:28.160 --> 01:35.720
repository of 3D models. And they're going to apply a very simple workflow. And they're going to

01:35.720 --> 01:42.520
download the model. They're going to slice it. So use the software that you tell the software,

01:42.520 --> 01:46.640
what is the model, what is the filament you use, what is your printer, and it magically spouts out

01:46.680 --> 01:52.440
a file. That is a print. That is just it. It's very simple. And if you're not technical, that's

01:52.440 --> 01:59.200
perfect. And I've been using this workflow for different things. If you look on the left, you

01:59.200 --> 02:05.160
have this thing that you might be using. And it's a way to make snowballs that are perfectly

02:05.160 --> 02:10.560
shaped. And if you remember, I'm a Swiss engineer, so I like my snowballs to be perfectly shaped.

02:10.560 --> 02:15.480
The other ones are not beer crates, because I don't have a printer that big. Therefore,

02:15.680 --> 02:19.040
batteries. Anyway, they're great models. They're simple models. They're fun to print. They're

02:19.040 --> 02:23.920
fun to share with people and to give them and all things like that. And this is not what I'm going

02:23.920 --> 02:29.640
to talk about. You know, these are very well modeled and shared as just a single file. What I want

02:29.640 --> 02:35.760
you to talk about are things that are more like that. So this is a very good project that you can

02:35.760 --> 02:43.560
find on printables called the Honicom Storage Wall. So it's a way to do pegboards for the printing.

02:44.520 --> 02:50.600
You have this base plate, which is a Honicom that you put on your wall and then the community

02:51.320 --> 02:56.800
has gone well and done a bunch of different attachments. And you can attach anything. So here

02:56.800 --> 03:01.080
it's probably in someone's office, but I've seen people using it in their bathroom, in their

03:01.080 --> 03:06.680
kitchen. You have attachments, people model attachments for everything. And it's just great.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.840
There's a lot of big community around it and all these kind of things. So I'm not going to talk

03:10.840 --> 03:16.040
about the attachments and modeling the attachments here. I'm going to talk about the plates. Because

03:16.040 --> 03:21.480
what happens is, you know, these things are made for 3D printing and 3D printers that tend to,

03:21.480 --> 03:27.520
you know, have different sizes and different beds. And this is what you can see in this file. You

03:27.520 --> 03:33.240
have different sizes of base plates that correspond to popular printers. They're not going to cover

03:33.240 --> 03:38.160
all of them, but you know, you can get quite far. You then have people who want to have, you know,

03:38.240 --> 03:42.200
nice borders because, you know, perhaps it's in for their kitchens and they want to have the kitchens

03:42.200 --> 03:48.080
being looked really well. And so people, you know, the community has provided. But then you get into

03:48.080 --> 03:56.160
these explosions of combinations and you don't have it covered necessarily by the community. And

03:56.160 --> 04:02.160
I can see people in the back just screaming parametric models. And yeah, yeah, I know. And this is

04:02.240 --> 04:10.160
what we usually think about it. And I mean, small parametric models, software, and anyway, I don't

04:10.160 --> 04:15.720
think these are the best answers. This is the best work, one of the best ways that we have now. But I

04:15.720 --> 04:21.520
think we can approve on it. And I'm going to show the limits first. And the people making the

04:21.520 --> 04:27.600
honeycomb storage wall projects are really good. And they have shared their the files that they've

04:27.600 --> 04:34.000
used to build. So they build the thing with Fusion 360. They also have some people in the community

04:34.000 --> 04:40.480
have re-implemented the model in OpenSCAD. And I'm just going to walk the, you know, the simple

04:40.480 --> 04:46.560
workflow I was at the beginning, you know, download slice print, what it looks like if, you know,

04:46.560 --> 04:52.080
you were new to 3D printing and you want to, you know, change the size of your build plate. So you

04:52.080 --> 04:56.480
download the model, this part of the same, then you have to find the hobby version of Fusion 360,

04:56.480 --> 05:00.240
or I don't know what it's called now. And if you try to do that, you know what I mean, it's not

05:00.240 --> 05:06.320
easy to kind of hide it. And then, you know, they try to get some money. If you figure that out,

05:06.320 --> 05:11.440
then you download it, pick sometimes a big file. Then you just, you know, you have a professional

05:11.440 --> 05:17.360
tool in front of you. And presently, I, you know, I'm comfortable with Fusion 360. This is what I

05:17.360 --> 05:23.680
use to actually learn CAD. So it's quite nice. But, you know, you just have a huge program in front

05:23.680 --> 05:27.360
of you and you don't know what to use. Perhaps you, like me, and say, oh, it's a challenge, I'm

05:27.360 --> 05:31.040
going to be interested and watch a lot of video and learn how to CAD. But perhaps then when you're

05:31.040 --> 05:37.920
done, you just don't know what you were trying to do. Or, you know, what is more likely to happen is

05:37.920 --> 05:41.920
you're going to abandon. You know, you're not going to customize it, or perhaps you're going to ask

05:41.920 --> 05:46.400
your friend who's more technical to do it for you. With OpenSCAD, you have something that's

05:46.400 --> 05:50.560
similar. I'm going to go faster. So download the model, then you download OpenSCAD. And the thing is,

05:51.360 --> 05:56.080
perhaps you're, you know, it's an open source thing. You don't know exactly what it is. It

05:56.080 --> 06:00.480
doesn't look as professional as the other tools. And, you know, the computer telling you, oh,

06:00.480 --> 06:04.560
it's not only software, you're sure, perhaps you're just going to abandon there because you don't

06:04.560 --> 06:10.640
trust it. Then, you know, it's code CAD. I love code CAD. But if you're a lawyer, code CAD is not

06:10.640 --> 06:15.360
your thing. And perhaps you're going to try anyway, but you're going to change the wrong line and add

06:15.360 --> 06:19.280
the wrong type of code and all these kind of things because, you know, not everyone is a

06:19.280 --> 06:22.880
programmer. And so, you know, you're going to feel that you're going to abandon and you're not going

06:22.880 --> 06:28.400
to have the thing that you want. So what do we want? We want to lower the bar for the end user,

06:28.400 --> 06:35.200
make it, you know, make these parametric models accessible to everyone. And the solution that,

06:35.200 --> 06:40.320
you know, proposes to have something that works very fairly similar to what we have before. You

06:40.320 --> 06:46.320
just add the configure model step and then, you know, download, slice and print. And how can you

06:46.320 --> 06:51.200
do that? You have these web generators and configurators. I don't know if you know them,

06:51.200 --> 06:58.640
but typically, if I want to create a QR code, I just, you know, Google QR code generator,

06:58.640 --> 07:04.160
I skip the first five because there are probably just lots of ads in there and I know the good one.

07:04.160 --> 07:08.560
I don't remember right now, but, you know, you have these kind of things for these two. It's

07:08.560 --> 07:15.040
single serving for a particular purpose. And it's just great. And there is no reason, or there might

07:15.040 --> 07:20.480
be a little bit, why we shouldn't share our parametric model that way. You know, it's just

07:20.480 --> 07:27.920
software to just do one thing, you know, the UNIX philosophy. And so what I have is a QR code

07:27.920 --> 07:36.000
for you. You don't need to go there, but it's because you can see it here. So it's a configurator

07:36.000 --> 07:46.240
that, you know, creates the Honeycomb wall storage thing. In the middle, you have the model. If you

07:46.240 --> 07:52.080
are on the top, you have something to configure it, you know, the number of rows, the number of columns.

07:52.080 --> 07:56.560
And here you can just download. You can see what goes, you know, configure, download. I don't have

07:56.560 --> 08:02.640
the slicing and the printing because it's another tool. I don't want to implement a slicer and a

08:02.640 --> 08:07.680
printer in my software. It's just something very simple. And you know, you have a couple of things

08:07.680 --> 08:11.120
where you can edit, you can see the code and all these kind of things because, you know, we share

08:11.120 --> 08:19.040
stuff. The code is open. Just go. What you're thinking is, I don't want to build my own configurator

08:19.040 --> 08:24.800
because it's, you know, you have them to maintain a server. You have to pay for it. You know, you

08:24.800 --> 08:33.920
have many reasons that you might have. Oh, I just went a bit too far. But, yeah. Yeah, you don't want

08:33.920 --> 08:39.280
to pay for it. Many reasons that you might not want to do it, right? Because perhaps you're more

08:39.280 --> 08:42.880
back-end person and you don't really care about building the UI. Perhaps you're more, you know,

08:42.880 --> 08:48.960
you don't want to touch C++ or you don't want, you know, you don't want to install, to compile

08:48.960 --> 08:52.880
some stuff on servers. You know, many reasons you don't want to do that. And so the thing that

08:52.960 --> 08:57.120
you've already seen because there was a bit of spoiler, we want to lower the bar for the maker as

08:57.120 --> 09:04.000
well. And the way that I've been trying to do that is with this project that I've been building. So

09:04.000 --> 09:08.560
it's not the first purpose. The first purpose is going to come later. It's just a bit of suspense.

09:08.560 --> 09:15.440
But with Replicad, you can, you know, as someone who is interested in code, make a web configurator

09:15.440 --> 09:22.560
very easily. So what is Replicad in that context? First is the online workbench for CodeCAD. So if

09:22.640 --> 09:31.440
you want to do CodeCAD, so it's drawing with code, you can just go to the workbench and you

09:31.440 --> 09:35.040
code on the left and you have your model on the right. It's something that, you know, was

09:35.040 --> 09:42.000
probably originally done by OpenSCAD. You have many, many different examples now. You have

09:42.000 --> 09:46.400
cat query, you have something similar. And in the terms of something purely online, you have

09:46.400 --> 09:50.800
something called Cascade Studio that exists. So it's nothing completely new. But you have it there,

09:50.800 --> 09:56.320
it's something that exists. You can do your model. Then it's something that is a bit different.

09:56.320 --> 10:01.520
It's a dot in JavaScript TypeScript. And perhaps some people are just, why would you choose JavaScript?

10:01.520 --> 10:06.080
Many reasons. It's a great language now. You should try it again. And the second one is,

10:06.080 --> 10:14.720
if you are actually new to CodeCAD, you might want to learn to code. And there are lots of

10:14.720 --> 10:20.160
resources for JavaScript online. It's, you know, it's a bit everywhere. And so there's a lot,

10:20.160 --> 10:25.040
there are lots of resources to learn it. Also, NPM exists. If you want to do some

10:25.040 --> 10:31.040
Voronoi stuff, there's a library for that. So it's also quite nice to just use a language

10:31.040 --> 10:37.440
and not have a specific language for what you do. It uses the OpenCascade kernel. So it means that

10:37.440 --> 10:42.080
you can make fillets as well as you can make them in FreeCAD, which, you know, means what it means.

10:43.520 --> 10:48.400
It, I mean, it means it's a powerful kernel. It's not perfect, but it's very powerful. So you can

10:48.400 --> 10:53.360
do lots of things with it. And the last thing, which is coming back to why I was introducing

10:53.360 --> 10:58.320
Replicant in the first place, we have a built-in web configurator. So, you know, you draw your thing,

10:58.320 --> 11:03.120
you can download the model, or you can click on something to share it, and you generate the link.

11:03.120 --> 11:09.200
And the thing that if you, perhaps, didn't let you the time to open the configurator that had before,

11:10.400 --> 11:15.600
is what you have directly. Just, you know, a bunch of parameters that you expose,

11:15.600 --> 11:22.000
a way to download it. It's very simple. But it's not everything. The first thing, you know, as a

11:22.000 --> 11:26.480
software developer, we build things for ourselves. And so, you know, I'm saying that I'm rolling the

11:26.480 --> 11:30.640
bar for the end user and, no, no, I'm doing it for myself. But it also means that, you know,

11:30.640 --> 11:35.840
perhaps you're a bit like me, and you're a web dev, and it means that the bar is also lower for you

11:35.840 --> 11:41.040
to build things with this. So perhaps in the list of things that I had before, some of them say,

11:41.040 --> 11:46.480
well, it's not that bad to build your own UI paths. I want to. And actually,

11:46.480 --> 11:52.560
replicates this library, and so it means that you can. I can just import it. You build your own

11:52.560 --> 11:58.960
front-end project and use it to the library. And as an example, I'm going back to my conference-driven

11:58.960 --> 12:04.960
development project that I had before. And here, you can look in the corner, and it's just parameters,

12:04.960 --> 12:12.240
right? It's not that great, because what I want is distances. I don't want rows and columns. And so,

12:12.240 --> 12:18.400
oh, what you'd have to do is actually do a bunch of math before actually, which is not very good

12:18.400 --> 12:26.960
either. So I did another project that you can look at, which is what you expect. It's an online

12:26.960 --> 12:33.040
configurator that just generates the same model than the other one did, but with my own UI. So it

12:33.040 --> 12:37.920
doesn't, you know, it shares some resemblance with the other model, because, you know, I'd meet both,

12:37.920 --> 12:44.240
and so I have a bit of style or try to. And the thing is, now you have distances. You don't need

12:44.240 --> 12:50.240
to have rows and columns and do the math, etc. Yeah. You have an undo button, because it was already

12:50.240 --> 12:54.240
there in the thing that I copied, but you might want to do undo in your particular project. But

12:54.240 --> 13:00.320
it's something that I built just for that. And there is a viewer, and actually it's more responsive

13:00.320 --> 13:05.040
than the other, because I spent five minutes to do the responsiveness and all these kind of things.

13:05.040 --> 13:12.880
So this is what you can do with this kind of thing. And my aim was to use CAD as a web API.

13:13.520 --> 13:18.640
Nowadays, the browser is just an amazing piece of software. You can do audio in it. You can do,

13:18.640 --> 13:24.320
you know, 3D rendering, which I use actually. But drawing stuff with CAD is not something that is

13:24.320 --> 13:29.520
there by default, which is probably a good thing. But you might want to do CAD in the browser anyway,

13:29.520 --> 13:37.680
and perhaps use replica for that. That's kind of my point. Actually, you know, going back to

13:37.680 --> 13:42.720
why I did it, this is something that I did. Another thing that I'm into is making boxes for board

13:42.720 --> 13:49.360
games. Don't ask, you know, people have some more niche hobbies. And so I made a specific UI for

13:49.360 --> 13:55.600
making boxes for board games. So, and it generates the box. But, you know, someone might want to

13:55.600 --> 14:00.800
generate documentation or to make the first step and not have to install a free CAD for that. So it

14:00.800 --> 14:08.960
might be a tool for it. Or, you know, if you have some specific needs, perhaps just for hobbies,

14:08.960 --> 14:14.960
but for work, it's something that you could use. It's kind of my point. And so if, you know, we get

14:14.960 --> 14:20.160
in towards the end of the day, and we're going to think a bit about what have we learned. The first

14:20.160 --> 14:24.240
thing that I didn't really mention, but I want to stress, because it's quite important, you know,

14:24.320 --> 14:29.600
I've said, oh, perhaps not great to share things, you know, parametric models. Actually, there's no

14:29.600 --> 14:36.480
wrong way to share stuff, right? It's just, let's try to be better about it. The thing that you can

14:36.480 --> 14:42.720
do is we can lower the bar, make it easier to share parametric models and, you know, as configurator,

14:42.720 --> 14:49.280
especially. And then, if you were a bit code-cautious and want to play with these kind of things,

14:49.280 --> 14:52.880
perhaps have a look at the workbench. You know, there's a bit of a community on the GitHub

14:52.880 --> 14:58.240
repos. You can ask questions, discussions, people are interested. So have a look. And if you are a

14:58.800 --> 15:02.800
web dev and you want to do a bit something more involved, you can think of replicat as a library

15:03.280 --> 15:10.160
to work. And so this is all I had for you. I hope you had fun.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.520
Do you have any questions?

15:18.480 --> 15:26.000
You make this sound so easy, which is wonderful. But where were the dragons?

15:30.320 --> 15:37.520
I mean, part of the thing is, was learning, I mean, I rely a lot on a project called OpenCascade.js.

15:38.080 --> 15:42.160
And to me, the dragons are here. Copiling C, C++ is not something that I want to do.

15:42.240 --> 15:50.080
And so I could avoid them. Then, it's lots of fun of, you know, building the thing, trying to

15:50.080 --> 15:54.240
figure out the different technologies and things like that. There was no, I mean, and then it was

15:54.240 --> 15:59.760
about learning OpenCascade. And, you know, one of the things that a replica does is it tries to

15:59.760 --> 16:05.200
handle memory as well as possible, because OpenCascade is C++. And, you know, you have to manage

16:05.200 --> 16:12.080
some times the memory. And there are definitely memory leaks in my project, but, you know,

16:12.080 --> 16:16.720
you're welcome to find them and fix them. But yeah, it was trying to find ways to do that. At

16:16.720 --> 16:22.640
some point, I designed the API to handle it. And then I found a way that was better to just have

16:22.640 --> 16:31.680
it magically disappear. So when will you buy a laser cutter? So you also make laser cutter boxes?

16:32.640 --> 16:38.640
Actually, it won't be, I don't have a laser cutter and I've been, you know, resisting buying one for a

16:38.640 --> 16:46.880
while. Before getting into 3D printer, I bought a silhouette machine. So, you know, it's to cut

16:46.880 --> 16:52.160
paper. And if you go to the website, the deck in the box website to make boxes, before making the

16:52.160 --> 16:59.760
3D printed boxes, I mean, boxes in paper. And so you have the die lines and it generates, you know,

16:59.760 --> 17:05.040
you have the same interface to generate die lines to cut things for paper. But yeah, so, you know,

17:05.040 --> 17:11.280
I'm resisting as much as I can. And perhaps there is also one thing that is a bit of a dragon,

17:11.280 --> 17:17.920
that is perhaps a rabbit hole that I partially fell into, is the 2D part, because the OpenCascade

17:17.920 --> 17:26.080
is not that great for 2D Boolean operations. And so I started to implement them by myself and I'm,

17:26.080 --> 17:31.760
you know, starting to build a 2D CAD kernel and it's getting a bit out of hand.

17:39.840 --> 17:47.040
Great talk. Thank you. Have you ever thought about free CAD import or kind of a connection to free

17:47.040 --> 17:55.120
CAD as modeling free CAD might be easier than coding it? I'm not sure exactly how that would,

17:55.120 --> 17:59.920
I mean, you can import step files, but then you have, you know, the whole model and the way it is,

17:59.920 --> 18:06.720
I'm not sure that it would be easy to do. And part of the thing with code CAD that, you know,

18:06.720 --> 18:10.320
makes it easier, typically, you know, you have the type of naming problems that they're, they're

18:10.320 --> 18:14.720
solving currently, you don't really have it, because instead of selecting by, you know, the

18:14.720 --> 18:19.200
number, you know, which one you have in the array, because you clicked on it, you can say, oh, I want

18:19.200 --> 18:24.480
to take the edge that is at this distance from that, because you know this when you, you know,

18:24.480 --> 18:28.400
you model and batch, yeah, you have to do a little bit of mass to figure out what is the distance

18:28.400 --> 18:32.080
and things like that, but normally it's basic geometry and you're going to have it wrong and

18:32.080 --> 18:37.680
do it again, but it's going to be okay. And so, no, the answer, short answer, sorry.

18:41.360 --> 18:46.800
Okay, thank you, Steve. Thank you.
