WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Hi, thanks for coming.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Huberview is working in the government of all the government in this room.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
I bet it's only a few.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh, maybe 10% or something.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah, quite a lot.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
Okay, so, hi, my name is Marco.

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
So let's talk about 2AM and why am I here.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
I am active in the Floss community for about 10 years now of contributions to SignalDino

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
and also in projects in the wireless mesh community tooling.

00:40.000 --> 00:48.000
I have a background in IT security and my current project during the last three years

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
was in this building state-of-the-art infrastructure for the public administration in Germany

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
in a German federal IT agency.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
And yeah, we think a lot about how we can improve our infrastructure,

01:02.000 --> 01:09.000
especially in Germany, but we also try to, yeah, think out of the box, out of the border.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
And this is why, why Metrix is very interesting for us.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.000
But let's start with what public administration does in Germany and other countries.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
So the government provides a lot of services that ranges from healthcare services to social services.

01:27.000 --> 01:32.000
There's dog tags registration, for example, there are holding benefits.

01:32.000 --> 01:41.000
And in Germany, there are 575 service categories with a total of 13,000 individual services

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
that the government offers on different federal levels.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
So that's a lot.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
And also what we need to think about is that the government has a monopoly on these services.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.000
Like if you want to have some housing benefits, probably the government is the only institution

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
that will provide you with these services and with this support.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
So if you want to receive these services, you need to go to your local government.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
And this is why it's important to have a, like, see how these services are designed, how they work,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
if they are privacy-friendly, if they're usable, et cetera.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
So in my opinion, it's very important to have a look at the tech stack behind these services

02:26.000 --> 02:32.000
and also the privacy usability, accessibility aspects in there.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
So how do we apply for these services?

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
First, there's, yeah, the option that you don't have to apply for them.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
The government starts the process by itself.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
For example, sending you money for your child benefits.

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
The government usually knows everything about your child when it's born,

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
and then they could theoretically send your child benefits by themselves.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
That's what we call proactive government.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.000
That's usually a thing, a neat thing, but it doesn't really work in all cases.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
So there are use cases where this doesn't work.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
For example, for a registration in the kindergarten,

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
it's probably a good idea to ask the people where they want to bring their kids

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
or if they want to bring their kids to this specific kindergarten

03:24.000 --> 03:28.000
instead of just, like, distributing the kindergarten places.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
That wouldn't really be a great usability thing there.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
The second option, you could always and probably have already done this offline.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
You can go to your local city hall.

03:43.000 --> 03:48.000
That works for many people, but still for many people, that's kind of inconvenient.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.000
So the third option that comes naturally, you can apply online for these services.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
For example, via an app or via a website.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
And I'd like to look at this third option a bit in detail.

04:03.000 --> 04:09.000
Okay, let's start by requesting some government services

04:09.000 --> 04:14.000
via a web formula or via a mobile application, for example.

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
That's comparatively easy because, like, the government websites are public.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
You can just find them online.

04:23.000 --> 04:27.000
And the contact details of the government agencies are also public,

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
including their private, sorry, their public keys, hopefully not their private keys,

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
sometimes they are public, but that's not by intention.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
So you can just encrypt your application form and send it to the right government agency,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
and you're basically done.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
So that's comparatively easy.

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
Then usually, hopefully, the government responds.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.000
But the person that applied for the government service

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
may have already left the website, for example,

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
and installed the app where they applied for the service.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.000
So that's a bit harder because the contact details of these individuals of us

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
are not publicly available, and that's also by design.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
We don't want that.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.000
But also, we don't want the people to force installing some random application

05:18.000 --> 05:22.000
and keep it installed for a longer period, or even at all.

05:22.000 --> 05:25.000
There should be different ways to access these services.

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
We can't just hope that the app is still installed

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
and we can send a message to the people via this app, for example.

05:36.000 --> 05:43.000
So let's have a look on how the industry solved this problem.

05:46.000 --> 05:54.000
And here, for example, banks and some insurances put some online mailboxes in place.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
That's usually very easy because they just stored the plaintext messages

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000
on their central service and provide a web interface or an interface via an app

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
to receive them.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
That might be okay for some banks and insurance companies

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
because they already know everything about BitOS anyway.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
So that's their service.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
They're directly communicating with us.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.000
Still, it's not really anti-antimcryptus here,

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
but the two ends are the bank insurance agency and the people.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.000
That's occasioned some way, but if we built this for all people

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
and for the whole country, we definitely need encryption.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.000
So we have local government agencies that want to communicate with the people.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
And there's a huge, so there's a large amount of information,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
a large of different services that are being provided.

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
We don't want to have a central server that stores all this information

06:46.000 --> 06:52.000
about the applications and responses to that online on the server.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
So how did government agencies solve this?

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You have to summarize.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
Mostly, they did it very badly.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
We've seen a lot of data leaks in the past years.

07:07.000 --> 07:14.000
And I think there must be a way that doesn't include any risk of data leakage.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
These are just some examples.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
I found a line there probably a lot of more issues,

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
but this is not a European problem.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
This is like a global problem.

07:24.000 --> 07:28.000
You can find governments on basically every continent

07:28.000 --> 07:36.000
that lost personal identification information of all the people in their country.

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
So that must be a better way.

07:43.000 --> 07:48.000
So let's have a look how did the German government solve this issue till date.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
We have a lot of different online mailboxes.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
There's ELSER for those of you from Germany.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
We probably know it.

07:57.000 --> 08:00.000
It's a big application to pay your taxes.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
We have so-called the email.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.000
That's a German email variant that should be super secure.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
It's basically some regulation on standard email protocols.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
We have BundID, which is like a central identification service

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
that also contains a mailbox.

08:18.000 --> 08:24.000
Then in the justice context, we have a lot of different mailboxes

08:24.000 --> 08:33.000
that are somehow interoperable, but none of these really follows

08:33.000 --> 08:36.000
the security by design principles and the Cedar Trust approach.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
And this poses a huge risk to privacy and security to highly sensible data.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
So this might explode somewhere, somewhere.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
In fact, actually, there have been incidents in Germany too, of course,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
as in other countries.

08:52.000 --> 09:00.000
For example, we had the, since 2021, we have so-called digital health apps,

09:00.000 --> 09:06.000
and they got analyzed by, it's a forschung, that's a collective of IT security researchers

09:06.000 --> 09:12.000
in Germany and the fact that these apps leaked personal data of more than 20,000 people.

09:12.000 --> 09:17.000
That's especially problematic because like in the healthcare sector,

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
there are often very sensible information that might get leaked here.

09:23.000 --> 09:30.000
We also had a recent leak in the justice domain.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.000
That was the case of the Justice Maybox leak last year between October 13th and November 9th,

09:36.000 --> 09:44.000
a directory with personal identity data was publicly accessible to you to a config error.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
So this shouldn't have happened at all.

09:46.000 --> 09:52.000
There should have been technical measures in place to, yeah,

09:52.000 --> 09:57.000
that, yeah, make sure that this won't happen.

09:57.000 --> 10:01.000
That's especially bad in this domain.

10:01.000 --> 10:07.000
For example, if stalking victims use this Maybox to contact some, some Kurds,

10:07.000 --> 10:12.000
and especially then it's not, not really a great idea of their personal information,

10:12.000 --> 10:19.000
including their address is publicly accessible.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
So let's talk about some solutions.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
And I brought this vision here.

10:24.000 --> 10:30.000
What if, if, if communication between governments and citizens was easy, reliable and encrypted?

10:30.000 --> 10:36.000
And since we are in the metric deaf room, yeah, let's take metrics to the rescue.

10:36.000 --> 10:40.000
Metrics already provides enter and encrypted messages.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
It provides multi-device access from apps and web applications.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
It also provides access via third party apps and services.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.000
So for example, corporate IT service or e-governance apps, et cetera.

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
This is all possible using the metrics protocol.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
So why not build a metrics-based secure communication channel between citizens and governments?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
And that's exactly what we are planning to do.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
We wanted to integrate metrics in Germany's national identity system.

11:10.000 --> 11:19.000
So first challenge here would be to build a proof of concept this year to demonstrate that this is technically possible.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.000
And we have some like technical things we want to discuss here.

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
Also, for example, usability issues would be discussed here.

11:29.000 --> 11:35.000
And in general, when we do this, we of course want to have a great user experience.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
So what do we need for that?

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
We need polls and multiple choice questions.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
We need push notifications and status updates.

11:43.000 --> 11:47.000
We need also machine readable data.

11:47.000 --> 11:57.000
For example, these polls would then make it easy for bi-directional interaction with the public administration using machine readable polls.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
That would be an interesting thing to look into.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
Also image and document uploads might be a feature.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
And the neat thing here is that metrics already built comes with these features.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
So there's not really much to build on top.

12:12.000 --> 12:18.000
We can just use this and go from there.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
Of course, we also need a great developer experience.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
That's something most government projects don't really think about.

12:24.000 --> 12:34.000
But I think especially here it's very important for us to have some SDKs in place for developers that are working on IT systems either inside the government,

12:34.000 --> 12:42.000
but also to help building apps and an ecosystem of apps and services for citizens and company-facing apps, for example.

12:42.000 --> 12:49.000
That helps us here with development speed for government services.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.000
So again, what does Matrix offer us?

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
We have a great usability, especially compared to email-based systems here.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
We have tried and tested security.

13:01.000 --> 13:10.000
This exists already a bit and the protocols are known and we don't reinvent the wheel here security-wise.

13:10.000 --> 13:17.000
It's interoperable and it's easy to integrate and it's also ready to use in the real-world layer.

13:17.000 --> 13:25.000
Many features are already there in the Matrix specification.

13:25.000 --> 13:31.000
Some strategic thoughts on enter and encryptive communication.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
In my opinion is a key enabler for seamless e-government services.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
We need this anyway.

13:36.000 --> 13:41.000
We will also be able to...

13:41.000 --> 13:52.000
This will enable us to really build a privacy-preserving realization of the so-called once-only principle that enables governments to reuse already submitted data and documents.

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
We have all this data in a machine-readable, secure way.

13:57.000 --> 14:06.000
It also might support us in some wallet-like use cases, for example, at a station presentation of attributes like driver's licenses.

14:06.000 --> 14:17.000
This also needs a secure communication channel before we think about all the additional challenges cryptography-wise here that we need to tackle.

14:17.000 --> 14:30.000
We need to start all of these things, need a communication layer as a starting point to interact between peoples and governments.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.000
A proud vision, where might this journey go?

14:34.000 --> 14:46.000
We will start with a mailbox app and later, if this works out, it might be a good starting point to provide the most common e-government services via this app.

14:46.000 --> 14:51.000
We would have an entry-end process to apply for all these services.

14:51.000 --> 14:56.000
This will definitely help us with usability and user experience.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
This might be a neat thing to look into.

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
In Germany, there are very little government services that are already integrated into an easy-to-use app.

15:06.000 --> 15:15.000
Most of them are just huge web forms where you have to enter lots of data and then you send a form and hope for the best.

15:16.000 --> 15:22.000
If we go further, finally, why not build a framework for any e-government service?

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
Basically, the service that is integrated into the app is basically a config file.

15:28.000 --> 15:43.000
This would help us to scale, obviously, and give us an opportunity for modulary specifying different services that we want to provide by just providing a config file

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
that defines how the UI, for example, in the app looks like.

15:51.000 --> 16:01.000
Putting it all together, this will provide us a National Privacy First e-government app, which would be a neat thing to have.

16:01.000 --> 16:10.000
Maybe it will help us build up speed and get better in this domain.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.000
To conclude, let's talk a bit about infrastructure.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
The status quo is that we have different text tags for requesting services and also for replies.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.000
These are completely different infrastructures.

16:29.000 --> 16:40.000
For example, we are able to request services via a REST API and then there's a SOAP API to provide messages back.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
This is completely different.

16:43.000 --> 16:52.000
Also, it would be nice to... Currently, we have different text tags between different government agencies.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
These might be encrypted or not.

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
That's obviously not good.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
What can we do about it?

16:59.000 --> 17:04.000
The obvious solution here would be to take metrics as an interability layer.

17:05.000 --> 17:13.000
In my opinion, that would totally make sense to have a basic common ground to communicate with different government agencies.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Actually, that's what metrics is designed for.

17:15.000 --> 17:26.000
We don't have only the chat application use case, but also the communication layer between different organizations or people.

17:26.000 --> 17:31.000
That might be an interesting thing to look into and build some prototypes here.

17:32.000 --> 17:38.000
Plus, it would also be very easy to integrate industrial needs here.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
The industry is also, of course, a large customer, so to say, to the government.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
They are requesting, for example, building permits for wind parks.

17:51.000 --> 18:03.000
It would be nice if they didn't have to do this wire paper, but also wire an easy-to-use API and integrate their own IT services in this ecosystem.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
Everything becomes easier for the government and for the industry to work together here.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.000
Okay. That's all I have. Thanks for listening.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
I would really like to continue the discussion of course via metrics, if you like.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
Join the Metrics channel. It's metricsforgov.org.

18:26.000 --> 18:31.000
It would be really interesting to discuss with you there.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
I think we might have time for some questions.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
You already answered one of the questions online for where is the place to discuss about it.

18:47.000 --> 18:55.000
Another question online was, is there any plans to bring it together with the TI messenger communication from the German healthcare sector?

18:57.000 --> 19:06.000
Yes, of course. We hadn't any in-depth discussions how to bring this together, but obviously we would then be using the same tech stack.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
From an architectural point of view, this is what we want to do.

19:11.000 --> 19:28.000
We have all these different Maybox infrastructures in Germany right now, and we need an interoperability layer between them to make it easy to use all of them and have one place for people to receive these messages or send messages to the government.

19:28.000 --> 19:42.000
This is one of the design goals in the long term, to have all these services using the same communication infrastructure, making it easier for people and governments.

19:58.000 --> 20:07.000
So the question was, if the GNUTALA project that also has some origins in Germany might be...

20:07.000 --> 20:26.160
So the question was if the Nutala project that also has some origins in Germany might

20:26.160 --> 20:32.040
be, so if there might be some lessons we learned there, so I'm personally not that involved

20:32.040 --> 20:39.120
in the Nutala project but I'm looking at it with great interest because I think that

20:39.120 --> 20:45.000
would be a nice candidate to have privacy preserving payment, a privacy preserving payment

20:45.000 --> 20:46.640
system here.

20:46.640 --> 20:54.120
That would of course greatly integrate in such an app here, so just yesterday I thought

20:54.120 --> 21:01.000
about this aspect of maybe looking a bit deeper into Nutala there.

21:01.080 --> 21:09.400
From the perspective of making it more or interoperable in the European domain we are

21:09.400 --> 21:15.640
trying to or we are looking into of course other European or we're talking to other European

21:15.640 --> 21:20.280
governments if this might be also a great thing for them.

21:20.280 --> 21:27.760
We have the Interoperable Europe Act, we have the Single Literary Gateway regulation in

21:27.760 --> 21:33.400
the EU so it might be a good thing to maybe harmonise this not only on the national level

21:33.400 --> 21:35.240
but also on the European level.

21:35.240 --> 21:41.240
I think that's an important aspect when we build infrastructure and I don't know any

21:41.240 --> 21:46.680
other standard, the metrics that has the potential to solve this quite nicely.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.680
We are talking to them.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.680
It's our question.

21:50.680 --> 22:19.160
So the question was if authentication will provide the requirements that government

22:19.160 --> 22:25.320
services have in terms of authentication would have any impact on what is needed with metrics

22:25.320 --> 22:31.560
and I think we're going in the right direction here with OpenID Connect so this is like what

22:31.560 --> 22:34.160
government services already use.

22:34.160 --> 22:40.120
The thing is here this is not completely zero trust and so we are not there yet with security

22:40.120 --> 22:45.440
and privacy by design here because if there would be one central authentication server

22:45.440 --> 22:51.320
that would provide identities for all people in Germany using OpenID Connect this will

22:51.320 --> 22:53.920
be a huge attack surface of course.

22:53.920 --> 23:00.120
So we are also thinking about how to maybe integrate the German EID system that have

23:00.120 --> 23:02.040
it in my backpack.

23:02.040 --> 23:08.720
So we have some EID cards that can be used to authenticate people and that would also

23:08.720 --> 23:17.080
be an interesting thing to look into if we could deploy this privacy preserving authentication

23:17.080 --> 23:21.360
system for these kind of services.

23:21.360 --> 23:29.080
So that's a huge thing we are thinking about how to reduce risks here security and privacy

23:29.080 --> 23:35.600
wise when we build such a massive system that deals with highly critical personal data.

23:35.600 --> 23:55.200
Yeah so the question was if we provide any OZG services via this protocol OZG is like

23:55.200 --> 24:04.800
the German government service accessibility law that requires governments to provide services

24:04.800 --> 24:13.880
online and of course we have this thought if this would be possible at all.

24:13.880 --> 24:18.960
Right now we have like different systems other systems in place that are using different

24:18.960 --> 24:26.680
text stacks here but in my personal opinion this would be the like natural evolution to

24:26.680 --> 24:32.880
if we like communicate with people via such an app or via the metric standards we might

24:32.880 --> 24:40.600
also look into using metrics to fulfill these services but I think that's a long journey

24:40.600 --> 24:41.600
to go.

24:41.600 --> 24:48.720
There are some things you need to consider when we build this infrastructure because

24:48.720 --> 24:59.920
not just the communication you also have to deal about which services or who can request

24:59.920 --> 25:04.920
these government services we have to deal about authentication routing which government

25:04.920 --> 25:08.480
agency is the right agency you want to address.

25:08.480 --> 25:14.880
So I think from a technical perspective this would work but I think it will take time to

25:14.880 --> 25:20.960
think about and maybe sometime build this but yeah we also don't want to build something

25:20.960 --> 25:26.680
separate to the services that are already in place so I think the only natural solution

25:26.680 --> 25:34.440
here would be to transform existing services to yeah maybe sometimes using metrics and

25:34.440 --> 25:44.400
have a roadmap to or for developers and organizations how to migrate from existing services to metrics

25:44.400 --> 25:50.480
otherwise this will probably not work and yeah will create a lot of confusion I think.

25:50.480 --> 26:09.120
Yeah so the question was how to deal with with backups and device signing and all that

26:09.120 --> 26:14.160
stuff so how to handle private keys basically and yes we are thinking about this and we have

26:14.160 --> 26:20.920
some some ideas how this could be could be done of course we don't want people to like

26:20.920 --> 26:27.600
manually store some private key file on their laptop and like take the burden to them but

26:27.600 --> 26:32.880
this is like definitely a thing we are thinking about so if you have any inputs on this thing

26:32.880 --> 26:38.240
I'd be very happy to hear from you in the metrics chat.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.240
Thanks.

26:39.240 --> 26:58.600
Yeah there is so the question was could we use our German EID cards for this and the

26:58.600 --> 27:06.840
German EID cards are so they are able to put some some digital signatures out there the

27:06.840 --> 27:13.600
problem is that currently the the signing keys are not deployed on this EID card so

27:13.600 --> 27:17.800
you would have to build some infrastructure to deploy the the yeah signing keys for for

27:17.800 --> 27:23.160
the people like private keys and as a like certificates for for every people this is

27:23.160 --> 27:29.240
like a huge organizational thing but yeah maybe this this might be an option to go for

27:29.240 --> 27:34.200
but I expected to be I don't know nothing that happens in the next one or two years

27:34.440 --> 27:38.880
production takes a bit of time to build this.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.880
Thank you very much.

27:40.880 --> 27:41.880
Thanks.
