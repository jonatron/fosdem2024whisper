00:00.000 --> 00:13.200
Okay, I think that we can start. It is my pleasure to welcome everybody here in behalf of our

00:13.200 --> 00:20.320
team who is organizing open source firmware BMC and bootloader dev room. Today we have fully

00:20.320 --> 00:27.840
packed schedule with very interesting presentation about bootloaders including grab, U-boot,

00:28.400 --> 00:38.480
system D also about security in this area and also we will be talking about

00:39.600 --> 00:46.240
secure boot, DRTM and other stuff. Unfortunately we are not able to accommodate all presentations.

00:47.360 --> 00:53.120
We got much more interesting presentations unfortunately due to lack of time in our

00:53.440 --> 01:02.240
room. We are not able to accommodate all of them. Some organizational stuff as I said the schedule

01:02.240 --> 01:07.920
is fully packed so we have to be careful with all presentations and all presentations will be

01:09.920 --> 01:19.040
stopped shortly just before the end. There will be some time for questions around five minutes.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.400
Also we have after the FOSDEM and meeting which is organized in the funky monkey

01:30.000 --> 01:39.280
pub I think. We have some places reserved there so we are invited to meet with us there and to

01:39.280 --> 01:48.000
discuss all topics which we are talking about during this presentation. I think that's it from our

01:48.080 --> 01:58.880
side. Peter do you want to add something? Yes I forgot about that. Thank you. Any questions before

01:58.880 --> 02:11.440
we start? Yes, Mike is only for recording. Yes this is confusing. I was confused yesterday during

02:11.440 --> 02:17.120
one of the presentation but this year this works in that way that the Mike is used only for recording.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
Anything else? Okay so let's start.
