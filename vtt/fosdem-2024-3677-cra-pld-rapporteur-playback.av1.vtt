WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
So I'm trying to summarize what we have learned in this session.

00:09.400 --> 00:21.400
We had a great opening from Toby who kind of explained to us the importance of these

00:21.400 --> 00:26.120
standards that will be written to accompany the legislation.

00:26.120 --> 00:32.520
We had a lot of discussion about the 200 pages of text that is the law.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.520
And we will then have fun reading the 4,000 pages of text that are the implementation

00:36.520 --> 00:44.160
standards and a lot of the details will be in those standards and are still to be developed.

00:44.160 --> 00:48.360
He also pointed out that the CAA has landed now and is not catastrophic, which I think

00:48.360 --> 00:50.480
is an important point to take.

00:50.480 --> 00:57.480
It is also an opportunity for the FOS ecosystem to step up here and to play a leading role

00:57.480 --> 01:00.480
as stewards.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.960
We have a lot more clarity with the separation of roles.

01:03.960 --> 01:13.200
We also have the first time that a major law in a major economic block talks about free

01:13.200 --> 01:19.360
and open source software and describes a specific role for open source software stewards.

01:19.360 --> 01:24.560
So I think that's a win.

01:24.560 --> 01:31.240
Next we had Rob walking us through the wonders of the hardware and software supply chain and

01:31.240 --> 01:36.480
how liability, especially strict liability, can work out in that and highlighting that

01:36.480 --> 01:43.200
the approach in the UAPLD is one of strict liability.

01:43.200 --> 01:51.320
We had a panel where besides the really interesting questions which I will go to in a second,

01:51.320 --> 01:54.360
we also had a very symbolic picture here in the front.

01:54.360 --> 01:59.160
We had the Python Software Foundation sitting in the middle squeezed between the Cyber-Syber-Zerians

01:59.160 --> 02:02.960
Act and the Product Liability Directive.

02:02.960 --> 02:09.880
And I really thought when I saw this, this is kind of a, the picture of what we're seeing

02:09.880 --> 02:16.400
because we have a group of people that is making free software available to the world

02:16.400 --> 02:24.120
trying to do the best and essentially really, yeah, working in the public interest here

02:24.120 --> 02:30.760
and trying to see how to, how can we make this work in the environment of our own regulatory

02:30.760 --> 02:37.840
frameworks.

02:37.840 --> 02:44.640
Also are the highlights here.

02:44.640 --> 02:51.840
I found it indicative in the question to Ben who is going to be a steward and what happens

02:51.840 --> 02:56.680
if the steward is outside of the EU that, first he said, looking through the law, which is

02:56.680 --> 03:00.560
the right recommendation, but he also said this is to be more clarified further down

03:00.560 --> 03:03.120
the road.

03:03.400 --> 03:10.040
Yes it is, but that is just indicative of this uncertainty that we are currently in.

03:10.040 --> 03:15.280
And so it's the right answer, but it means that we need to stay on this topic and we

03:15.280 --> 03:19.520
need to get answers to these questions.

03:19.520 --> 03:28.000
I also thought that the question from the audience about what if we have a very decentralized

03:28.000 --> 03:32.320
open source community, maybe with a legal entity in France, but that's not really controlling

03:32.320 --> 03:36.120
anything that the developers do, it is just coordinating the work.

03:36.120 --> 03:42.680
It was very pertinent because this is exactly the gray zone between being an individual

03:42.680 --> 03:49.960
developer, being a loosely organized community and then being a well organized centralized

03:49.960 --> 03:53.840
community, a more centralized community that clearly qualifies as a steward.

03:53.840 --> 04:00.360
And I think there, it's not just on the lawmakers to make this clear, this is an impact where

04:00.360 --> 04:07.400
the free and open source software community will have to sharpen our own governance norms

04:07.400 --> 04:10.680
to make it more clear which are we in this situation.

04:10.680 --> 04:16.760
So there will be implications on how the communities operate that were clear in, this was one of

04:16.760 --> 04:25.320
my takeaways that was clear in this discussion.

04:25.320 --> 04:29.240
We focused a lot on the Cyber Zillions Act because it was such a pertinent topic recently,

04:29.240 --> 04:33.160
so I was really glad to see the Part Liability Directive here.

04:33.160 --> 04:38.360
Key takeaways that I took from the discussions are you cannot escape the Part Liability Directive,

04:38.360 --> 04:46.160
I hope I'm quoting that right, and I think Oma also was able to say why.

04:46.160 --> 04:55.000
If a law protects the most vulnerable person in the chain, then it can easily exclude others.

04:55.320 --> 05:01.080
Who is the most vulnerable person will probably have to always be accessed in a concrete case.

05:01.080 --> 05:08.240
He also pointed out that an important aspect of EU law making is that all these laws have

05:08.240 --> 05:14.280
review cycles and they're not one-off written and then collect dust and we will have to

05:14.280 --> 05:15.880
live with the consequences.

05:15.880 --> 05:22.600
They will be reviewed and he encouraged us to engage in the review process and to provide

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
our feedback.

05:23.600 --> 05:28.480
This is probably one of the most important takeaways today for the people in the room

05:28.480 --> 05:37.600
is let's stay engaged here basically.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.000
How am I doing on time?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.680
Two minutes, okay.

05:43.680 --> 05:48.360
We talked a little bit at the end of the discussion period on how will the European Commission

05:48.360 --> 05:50.680
engage with the standards.

05:50.680 --> 05:54.120
Oma pointed out that the European Commission does not write the standards and what the

05:54.120 --> 06:00.040
process will be and that your source community will be encouraged or is encouraged to actively

06:00.040 --> 06:01.760
participate in this.

06:01.760 --> 06:05.720
That's a big takeaway that we need to take.

06:05.720 --> 06:10.000
There was always the question of who pays for the additional bureaucracy, who pays for

06:10.000 --> 06:13.120
the fees to participate in some development organizations.

06:13.120 --> 06:17.640
I think we didn't really get good answers here today but it was made clear that this

06:17.640 --> 06:23.360
is an open issue because our organizations are almost exclusively non-profit organizations

06:23.360 --> 06:25.320
and that's additional cost.

06:25.320 --> 06:29.400
Additional cost requires more fundraising.

06:29.400 --> 06:33.320
I think the question of who pays for this, who pays for this and who pays for this got

06:33.320 --> 06:41.880
repeated a couple of times including in the workshops.

06:41.880 --> 06:47.600
Let's go to, if we have a little time, I summarized a couple of highlights here.

06:48.040 --> 06:52.920
One is a big shout out to our own lawmakers here.

06:52.920 --> 06:54.360
The EU is approachable.

06:54.360 --> 06:55.680
It was here in this room.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.000
It was in multiple panels.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.440
It was willing to answer questions from angry developers.

07:02.440 --> 07:11.600
I really congratulate them to this attitude so thank you for being here.

07:11.600 --> 07:16.520
Another takeaway is why is this room so important because I think it was Toby who pointed out

07:16.520 --> 07:22.560
that we have a very diverse set of stakeholders and normally in the processes the stakeholders

07:22.560 --> 07:28.920
that are well heard are the ones that have the means to do so, the big foundations, the

07:28.920 --> 07:34.720
larger projects and we need to have the hobbyist community, just small like one person enterprises

07:34.720 --> 07:40.880
and all those also like, yeah, involved and that's I think more in this room than in the

07:40.880 --> 07:42.760
discussions until now.

07:42.760 --> 07:51.360
I want to point out one thing and this is in response to Omar who said software is only

07:51.360 --> 07:53.240
one thing out of a million products.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.240
That's true.

07:54.240 --> 08:01.080
Software is also an every product and every product consists of 80% for you know, so software.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.120
That means we're not one in a million.

08:03.120 --> 08:08.520
We're 40% of the overall market if you divide it 50, 50 between hardware and software.

08:08.520 --> 08:15.240
So I think we're totally worth it to be especially considered in the law and I think we do have

08:15.240 --> 08:18.360
the impact that justifies that.

08:18.360 --> 08:26.000
Regarding engagement in standards, last statement here, the EC made a very direct offer to engage.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.160
I think we should take that especially the foundation I speak for the Linux Foundation

08:30.160 --> 08:31.160
here.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.200
We will engage.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.920
There's one really positive signal here.

08:35.920 --> 08:40.920
We've recently been appointed to the multi stakeholder platform for ICT standardization

08:40.920 --> 08:45.920
which is kind of the consulting group to the commission here and we will use our influence

08:45.920 --> 08:52.560
there to bring more free and open software players into standards development.

08:52.560 --> 08:57.880
Regarding that as well, keep in mind that standards development is also a national activity

08:57.880 --> 08:59.400
in the member states.

08:59.400 --> 09:05.080
There will be representatives of your member states appointed into those standards bodies

09:05.080 --> 09:10.760
and it's a great way to engage through where you live and get somebody into that.

09:10.760 --> 09:15.800
With that I would like to close, a big thank you to the panelists, to the moderators and

09:15.800 --> 09:17.480
to all the participants.

09:17.480 --> 09:17.920
Thank you very much.
