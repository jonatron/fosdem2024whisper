00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Hi, so my name is Toby Langelle.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.080
I run a small consulting firm based in Geneva, Switzerland.

00:11.080 --> 00:14.120
And I have kind of straddled throughout my career open source and standards.

00:14.120 --> 00:19.560
So people thought it was a good idea to bring me in to talk about this.

00:19.560 --> 00:26.400
So this lightning talk is called 40 New Ways to CRI Can Accidentally Harm Open Source.

00:26.400 --> 00:31.600
And that of course references the 40 plus standards that are, the harmonized standards

00:31.600 --> 00:37.080
that are going to be written in the next couple of years to essentially make it possible to

00:37.080 --> 00:41.760
implement the CRI.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.720
So the first thing I want to say is the CRI has landed.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.000
It could have been really, really bad.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.600
A lot of us were really, really concerned.

00:50.600 --> 00:53.400
And it turns out that it isn't.

00:53.400 --> 00:58.200
Firstly, first thing is the open source community rose to the occasion.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.720
And I think that's really amazing and it was beautiful to see.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.920
And like a lot of people put a lot of work in.

01:02.920 --> 01:08.480
And I think we should all be very thankful for the work they have put into helping us.

01:08.480 --> 01:14.600
And then also policy makers actually paid attention, listened, and considered the input

01:14.600 --> 01:15.880
from the community.

01:15.880 --> 01:20.800
And also for this, I think we ought to be really thankful.

01:20.800 --> 01:26.640
So thank you for both sides for making this happen.

01:26.640 --> 01:32.040
In the process, we avoided harming open source pretty seriously.

01:32.040 --> 01:37.760
And we also avoided harming that EU's ability to leverage open source, which was another

01:37.760 --> 01:43.240
one of the potential risks of the original versions of the CRI.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.360
So we do now have a lot more clarity.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.960
There's an asterisk there because lots of people still have lots of questions, myself

01:48.960 --> 01:50.200
included.

01:50.200 --> 01:56.280
My key takeaways from the last version of the CRI is that the responsibility falls

01:56.280 --> 01:57.640
in the right place.

01:57.640 --> 02:00.640
IE was the people monetizing open source.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.840
The company is monetizing open source.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.520
So for me, this is really important and it's great that this has spelt out really clearly

02:07.520 --> 02:09.000
in the last version.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.240
And then the other thing that I thought was really interesting is the open source stewards,

02:14.240 --> 02:19.200
this new notion of open source stewards, which really institutionalizes the foundations

02:19.200 --> 02:22.120
that have been playing an important role in our space.

02:22.120 --> 02:31.440
And it's also, I believe, a really smart instrument for the EU's ambition around Southern Tech.

02:31.440 --> 02:35.800
That said, it's going to have industry and ecosystem-wide impact.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.360
I think companies will be a lot more cautious.

02:38.360 --> 02:43.120
I will certainly advise my clients to be more cautious.

02:43.120 --> 02:49.180
And a lot of projects will move to foundations and I think they will do so earlier.

02:49.180 --> 02:53.860
And then the conformance requirements, they're going to climb up the dependency tree.

02:53.860 --> 03:00.540
And so essentially, I'm suspecting pretty quickly most of the ecosystem will actually

03:00.540 --> 03:11.300
be subject to some parts of the CRA, probably the lighter version that is for open source

03:11.300 --> 03:13.540
stewards.

03:13.540 --> 03:16.300
And I do have a question that was this.

03:16.300 --> 03:19.620
This is going to create a lot of financial and work overhead.

03:19.620 --> 03:23.660
And I'm still kind of wondering who's going to be paying for this.

03:23.660 --> 03:29.980
So I think this is a question that will need to be dug into a little more in the future.

03:29.980 --> 03:35.820
So to meet the CRA, there are essentially going to be two options.

03:35.820 --> 03:43.620
Either you demonstrate conformity by yourself, so the burden of proof is on you, or you will

03:43.620 --> 03:48.300
essentially follow a set of standards, the harmonized standards, and this is going to

03:48.300 --> 03:52.260
provide presumption of conformity.

03:52.260 --> 03:57.780
So the fact, though, the standards are going to be how the CRA impacts open source because

03:57.780 --> 04:00.740
that's what everyone's going to do.

04:00.740 --> 04:06.380
Essentially follow the standards so that they can be presumed to be conformant.

04:06.380 --> 04:12.260
And so 40 plus standards, that's 40 plus way things can go wrong.

04:12.260 --> 04:19.940
If you believe that the standardization process is less opaque, easier, more open source community

04:19.940 --> 04:25.580
friendly than policymaking, I have bad news for you.

04:25.580 --> 04:32.140
And so essentially the same kind of misunderstanding, the same kind of risk that CASC carry through

04:32.140 --> 04:38.140
the CRA is probably going to carry through 40 different standards.

04:38.900 --> 04:44.460
Actually sitting in 40 different rooms to make sure that 40 different standards don't

04:44.460 --> 04:49.620
harm open source in a weird and unexpected way is a lot of work.

04:49.620 --> 04:53.860
So I mentioned the opaque standardization processes.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.220
Also open source has special requirements.

04:56.220 --> 04:58.260
Things have to happen in the open.

04:58.260 --> 05:02.460
They cannot be patterns around the standards.

05:02.460 --> 05:09.740
And not every organization functions in an open source friendly way to put it mightily

05:09.740 --> 05:17.380
when it comes to how they deliver the standards and how non-uncumbered by patterns these standards

05:17.380 --> 05:18.380
are.

05:18.380 --> 05:22.460
So that's also something that will be incredibly important to make sure that the open source

05:22.460 --> 05:27.740
community can actually have access to those standards and be able to implement them.

05:28.020 --> 05:34.580
The two last points is there's a huge diversity of open source stakeholders, a lot of which

05:34.580 --> 05:40.820
were very poorly represented in the CRA even though the open source community was there.

05:40.820 --> 05:45.100
So there were these two words obviously and they were very much involved.

05:45.100 --> 05:49.100
Hobbyists, it's very hard to actually represent hobbyists, right?

05:49.100 --> 05:54.340
Small commercial open source startups that are going to be incredibly impacted, including

05:54.340 --> 06:00.980
in the EU because they will be considered manufacturers, rightfully so.

06:00.980 --> 06:08.180
Probably don't have the resources or the know-how to be involved in the process.

06:08.180 --> 06:12.580
And the last point is interop was other jurisdictions.

06:12.580 --> 06:18.740
One of the huge strengths of open source is the fact that licensing is essentially standardized

06:18.740 --> 06:23.180
worldwide and like the MIT means the same thing here and there roughly sufficiently

06:23.180 --> 06:25.780
that it's like okay.

06:25.780 --> 06:30.660
And if we start having security standards that are different across different jurisdictions

06:30.660 --> 06:36.020
it's going to be a huge burden on open source maintainers and open source developers and

06:36.020 --> 06:41.740
we want to make sure that if you comply to whatever the EU comes up with in terms of

06:41.740 --> 06:48.100
standards it's fairly similar to what NIST is coming up in the US, etc. etc.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.100
And that's it.

06:49.100 --> 06:49.600
Thank you very much.
