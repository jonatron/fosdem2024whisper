WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Okay, I think we can start.

00:10.000 --> 00:15.000
Hi, I'm Vivien Barnier and this is Martin Jager.

00:15.000 --> 00:22.000
We will talk about Power to the People technology for energy access, or access to energy.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.000
We have seen a lot of great presentation today, very technical, very detailed.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
This presentation will start slightly differently.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
It goes also like this general discussion we had shortly about community

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
and how to grow the community for energy projects.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
I want particularly to talk to you guys about access to energy

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
and how we can use open source and which potential open source has

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
for this completely under-explored area for open source,

00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
because a lot of these great projects are particularly targeting industrialized

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
geographies, let's say, and their realities.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
But there's also another reality which looks like that.

01:08.000 --> 01:18.000
As you can see, in the north and hemisphere, like the global north,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
a lot of lights in the night.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.000
While you see, there's a lot of people living here and here and also here.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
But there's much less light. That's because there is no electricity.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.000
So if it's the energy death room, we should also think about how to leverage open source,

01:35.000 --> 01:41.000
both software hardware and community to help electrify these areas.

01:41.000 --> 01:52.000
And if we look particularly on how electrification has gone in the recent years,

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
you can see there's been some progress in reducing people without electricity.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
So we started in over a billion in 2012.

02:00.000 --> 02:07.000
But then in the recent years, this improvement of access to electricity stopped

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
and we have even a back trend.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
Any idea why?

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Not exactly.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.000
Not only Bangladesh as well and also on the African continent.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
There's a bit of progress.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.000
And now it's not getting cheaper anymore?

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Exactly. General population growth.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
The speed of electrification is the same.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Just the population growth has outpaced the speed we are electrifying.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
So we have now every year more people with electricity than less.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.000
So we need to speed up the process of electrification in general.

03:05.000 --> 03:10.000
Now electrification of areas which haven't been electrified in the past

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
brings particular challenges.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Which is you have extremely low income customers.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000
You have extremely remote areas and don't think about what is remote in Belgium

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
or in Europe or somewhere.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
It's completely different.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.000
You have unknown future demand patterns and forget about AI machine learning.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
It's just not going to work.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
You don't have data.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
It's people that never use electricity.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.000
So you have no clue and you can't use these like digitalized methods to predict

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
what will be the demand.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Data connectivity issues.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.000
So if you want to communicate with the assets, extreme weather conditions

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
and regulatory uncertainty.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Because a lot of countries which are not that stable in the political situation.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
So you also don't know if they are coming the main good.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
If they are not coming the main good, what technology will they need and so on.

03:58.000 --> 04:04.000
So you need extremely low resilient technology to achieve universal electricity

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
because you have to respond to all these particular challenges.

04:08.000 --> 04:13.000
And now you have NGOs, you have private companies, you have international companies.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
Large utilities are trying to go into this market.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Non-profits, corporatives, communities, even agribusiness.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
Because they are already present in these areas.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Often are going into energy ventures.

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
And all these companies or stakeholders or NGOs are developing technology.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Software, hardware and also business models.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
And very often they come up with exactly the same thing.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Almost the same thing.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
So they are constantly reinventing the wheel.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Because it's a very decent sector with a lot of players.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
So perfect playground for open source I would say.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
Because we have to overcome this constant reinvention of the wheel and it's decent.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
So there is a lot of possibilities to still shape the sector.

04:54.000 --> 04:59.000
Which in industrialized countries often is a bit more tricky because there are more established industries,

04:59.000 --> 05:02.000
more established players, bigger players and so on.

05:03.000 --> 05:12.000
So what we do at an access is we promote and support open source development and adoption for energy access.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
Very particularly for technologies that are meant to provide electricity to people who have not been electrified in the past.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
Particularly to generate an equitable ecosystem.

05:23.000 --> 05:29.000
Where more local companies, particularly domestic companies can participate.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
They can compete against large utilities like the ANGIS of this world.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
And so on like trying to grab this market.

05:37.000 --> 05:45.000
And have this adaptable and resilient infrastructure that we need to electrify.

05:45.000 --> 05:49.000
And to say what that means.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
A couple of projects that we have funded and supported in the development in the past.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
They range from software, hardware and business models.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
I will not go into details for the sake of time.

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
And we want to speak particularly about one in particular today.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
Which is an open hardware project.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
Which is the open source battery management system.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
The Libre Solar, BMS C1.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Which has been developed by Libre Solar.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
And which Martin will now provide you more insights on.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Yeah, thank you very much.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
Yeah, so I'm from Libre Solar.

06:27.000 --> 06:31.000
Which is mostly an open source hardware and firmware project.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
But we're also a very small company.

06:33.000 --> 06:39.000
And doing some consultancy work around the open source hardware development.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
And yeah, we've developed these battery management systems.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
With a particular focus on energy access in a project together with the NXS foundation.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.000
And I will explain a little bit what a battery management system is at the very beginning.

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
And talk about some of the technical aspects.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
As well as the community.

06:59.000 --> 07:04.000
And how we are interacting with other people interested to join our movement.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
So to say.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
Yeah, a battery management system is part of almost any modern electrical equipment.

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
That's battery powered because all those batteries, those systems use lithium ion batteries.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
And yeah, in the energy sector, energy access sector in the past.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
There was still a huge use of lead acid batteries.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
Which have some issues with environmental damages.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And which also don't last that long.

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
And nowadays lithium ion batteries are getting cheaper.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
And so also.

07:44.000 --> 07:50.000
Okay, so I covered the antenna apparently.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Yeah, so.

07:53.000 --> 08:00.000
Yeah, nowadays also in the energy access sector, which is very cost sensitive, as you can imagine, we also.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
Yeah, using lithium ion batteries more and more.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
And so we need a battery management system that takes care of the safety of those battery systems.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
So that's basically what it does.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
We have a pack of lots of different cells, which in series connected in series.

08:17.000 --> 08:22.000
We measure each single cell voltage, make sure that they are well balanced.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
We measure the current.

08:24.000 --> 08:29.000
And if something goes wrong, we have the safety measures like a fuse and a switch, which open the battery.

08:29.000 --> 08:35.000
And so that you don't get an overheating battery that could potentially even explode.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
And of course it's a safety critical component.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
So you have to take care to develop it right.

08:42.000 --> 08:52.000
And yeah, open source is a really good method for collaborating and not reinventing this wheel, which could be a costly process.

08:52.000 --> 08:58.000
So yeah, this is the hardware board that we developed.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
It can be divided into two parts largely.

09:01.000 --> 09:07.000
This is the power part, which does the switching and the current measurement.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.000
And you see those pretty large connectors.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
We can handle up to 100 amps, which is not that common for most people used to Arduino and so on.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
Of course, for the own take guys who had the presentation before, it's also going in that direction.

09:23.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah, and that's a little bit challenging to put the microcontroller and the power parts onto the same PCB.

09:29.000 --> 09:39.000
But we decided to go with that route because we really have to make it as cheap as possible, but still handle this amount of power.

09:39.000 --> 09:52.000
And with these 100 amps and up to 48 volts, you can provide one huge in that sector AC inverter with enough electricity,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
like 3, 4, 5 kilowatts almost.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
And that's sufficient to build a small AC mini grid in such an area.

10:00.000 --> 10:09.000
There are also so-called solar home systems, which are really tiny, like 150 watts, 50 to 150 watts are really tiny systems.

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
This BMS is not targeted at those systems, but more at the slightly larger systems.

10:14.000 --> 10:26.000
But you can also use the technology for light electric vehicles and other things, especially because the firmware is open and can be adapted easily.

10:26.000 --> 10:39.000
For in terms of communications, we have the CAN bus, which is the automotive and industrial state of the art protocol used for batteries as well.

10:40.000 --> 10:47.000
But we also have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth low energy, so that would be more for the non-control part.

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
So we can talk to inverters, for example, with the CAN bus, but you can also have a smart phone app and connect to your battery.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
Where's the antenna?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Okay.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
All right.

11:06.000 --> 11:14.000
So for an open source product, we think it's also essential to use only open source tools.

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
And so that's why we decided to go with the Kikead, obviously.

11:18.000 --> 11:27.000
And yeah, so since a few years, I think Kikead is really a completely professional, great PCB design software.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
And it has very nice plugins, which you can use to automate some processes.

11:32.000 --> 11:40.000
And we're always trying to somehow get towards a similar experience than you have with software development for the hardware development.

11:40.000 --> 11:49.000
Because if you get a pull request and you get a binary, then you try to understand what's happening, what did the person change.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
That's difficult.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.000
So we use some community developed tools to create diffs in PDF format.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
So you can see what the pull request changes.

12:00.000 --> 12:08.000
And that makes it easier to collaborate also on hardware development, even though it's still not as easy as with software.

12:08.000 --> 12:15.000
Yeah, also we generate an interactive HTML bill of materials where you can see all the part placement.

12:15.000 --> 12:22.000
So if you want to assemble it manually or you want to fix something, then it makes it easier to understand and find the parts.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000
Yeah, all those are community developed plugins.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
And for the firmware side, the software that's running on the BMS, we are using the Zephyr real time operating system.

12:34.000 --> 12:42.000
And I can really recommend anyone who's into embedded development and maybe didn't use R-Tosys before, really try it out.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
It's maintained by the Linux Foundation, so really fully open source.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
And it has extremely great features.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
So you can use it for almost any architecture.

12:52.000 --> 13:00.000
And you can also switch between different microcontrollers because it's very well abstracted.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
And that's something we experienced during our development.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
So we started with an SDM32 microcontroller.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
And then a chip crisis came and we couldn't get any SDM32 microcontrollers anymore.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
So we thought, hmm, what are we going to do?

13:15.000 --> 13:23.000
And we replaced the microcontroller with an ESP32 C3 microcontroller.

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
And it was really just a matter of changing a few board configuration files.

13:28.000 --> 13:35.000
And then all the things like UART communications and so on worked out of the box, almost out of the box, I have to say,

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
because there were some bugs in some drivers, which we, of course, upstreamed and fixed.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
But this is now fixed because that microcontroller was still pretty young.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
But yeah, that's really a huge advantage.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
And so if someone comes and needs this battery management system,

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
but needs a different communication protocol or slightly different hardware configuration,

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
a different microcontroller for whatever reason,

14:00.000 --> 14:07.000
it's almost a matter of a day to get it ported to a different board.

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
Yeah, as mentioned already, we have lots of communication stacks in DeFa already working out of the box.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
For this energy access market, the GSM communication is very important

14:19.000 --> 14:26.000
because most of those batteries or off-grid systems need remote communication through GSM.

14:26.000 --> 14:34.000
But we can also use Bluetooth Low Energy and CAN and Modbus for the more local communication.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.000
Yeah, there are also some Zephyr folks here at FOSSTEM.

14:38.000 --> 14:45.000
We don't have a dedicated DEF room, but yeah, so if you want to learn more about Zephyr,

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
I'm also an active contributor and maintainer.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
Just let me know afterwards and then we can talk about it a bit more.

14:53.000 --> 15:02.000
For the communications, we are using a protocol, so to say, that's called Thinkset,

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
which you can think of as an API, a REST API, but for microcontrollers.

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
So you can use it over the serial interface, you can use it over WebSocket remotely,

15:13.000 --> 15:17.000
you can use it over CAN bus, over Bluetooth Low Energy.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
We are using exactly the same upper layer of the communication protocol for all these layers,

15:22.000 --> 15:26.000
which makes it really easy to integrate it also into other projects.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
It's not meant to be just for battery management systems and it's self-explanatory.

15:32.000 --> 15:36.000
So you can see an example here. You can send a request.

15:36.000 --> 15:45.000
This would request the battery parts from the battery with a question mark for a GET request

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
and then you get the data as JSON, including the units.

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
Whether they are read-only or write-only values and so on.

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
It's quite versatile and we are making good experiences with that in case you're interested.

15:59.000 --> 16:04.000
Here are the links. The presentation is also uploaded online, by the way.

16:06.000 --> 16:12.000
Now, coming to one challenging part of open-source hardware development,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
which is the manufacturing or production.

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
So, often you can order electronics hardware on JLCPCB,

16:21.000 --> 16:24.000
but for these power electronics boards it's a bit more difficult.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
Sometimes you don't get the board specifications you need,

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
because you need thicker copper layers than with boards where you just send out some data

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
or communicate on the PCB.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.000
And also we have some quite heavy connectors on the boards,

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
which need special soldering processes and so on.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.000
So far we haven't ordered anything with the Chinese manufacturers yet,

16:48.000 --> 16:53.000
but mainly ordered boards locally in Germany.

16:53.000 --> 16:59.000
And we're in contact with some companies in Nigeria who are also trying to produce it,

16:59.000 --> 17:02.000
or they will be able to produce it in the future,

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
so that we want to basically also break this chain of developing something in Europe,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
producing it in China and shipping it to Africa.

17:12.000 --> 17:17.000
So, yeah, the idea is that it can be produced locally.

17:17.000 --> 17:23.000
And thanks to these features in KiCat, you can also easily,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
kind of easily solder it by hand.

17:25.000 --> 17:30.000
So this is an image of the first prototype in our FabLab in Hamburg,

17:30.000 --> 17:33.000
where we have a manual pick and place machine, but you can also use tweezers.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.000
And you need a pizza oven and a small reflow oven,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
and then you can do it yourself.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
That being said, we have ordered some PCBs.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
If you want to participate in the project, they will be ready soonish in one month, maybe.

17:50.000 --> 17:53.000
And you can also get in contact with us.

17:53.000 --> 18:01.000
Our plan is, of course, in the future to be able to provide boards for easily and for low price,

18:02.000 --> 18:07.000
so that everyone can participate, but it's also regulatory issues,

18:07.000 --> 18:12.000
or that's on our list to improve on that situation as well.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.000
Right, so final slide, almost.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.000
So how's the situation with adopters?

18:20.000 --> 18:28.000
We have had about 10 companies who started using the product during our project,

18:28.000 --> 18:36.000
and more than five companies who are actually starting to use it in their products and in the field.

18:36.000 --> 18:43.000
Also some companies from Europe picked it up and provided really valuable feedback and pull requests.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.000
We also tried to really start from the very beginning, from requirement specification,

18:47.000 --> 18:52.000
towards the final design of the PCB, to have everything on GitHub.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.000
So the specification was on GitHub, everyone could interact with us.

18:57.000 --> 19:03.000
And yeah, we've also got a community forum, one is on the AdNXS foundation website

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
and in the LibreSolar forum.

19:07.000 --> 19:13.000
But I usually prefer just using GitHub issues and pull requests for communication,

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
so you have it in the right place and people will find it.

19:18.000 --> 19:23.000
Yeah, so if you're interested in developing such systems or using them,

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
just join us on our journey to bring power to the people.

19:27.000 --> 19:33.000
And here are some resources, some websites where you can find all the hardware designs,

19:33.000 --> 19:36.000
firmware designs and the community.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
And now, yeah, we're open to hear your questions.

19:40.000 --> 19:57.000
So first, thank you very much for your presentation and for your great work in the open source community.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
I had several few questions.

20:00.000 --> 20:05.000
First, I saw that you had a passive balancing board on your BMS.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
I was wondering if you are also offering or thinking about active balancing.

20:11.000 --> 20:17.000
Yeah, good question.

20:17.000 --> 20:24.000
We really tried to use active balancing at the very beginning and had this on our requirements list,

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
but finally dropped it because of cost reasons.

20:28.000 --> 20:31.000
So there are some linear technologies chips and Texas Instruments chips,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
which cost $5 each for six cells.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
And they are really expensive.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.000
You have lots of passive components as well that you need.

20:38.000 --> 20:42.000
So that was the main reason that we are just going with passive balancing at the moment.

20:42.000 --> 20:47.000
There are some Chinese chips we couldn't get anywhere from a reliable distributor

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
and we couldn't get any data sheets and so on.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
So that was also not an option.

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
If you have an idea how to implement a cheap active balancing system, let me know.

20:58.000 --> 21:03.000
There was also already some contributors that wanted to do active balancing.

21:03.000 --> 21:08.000
Okay.

21:08.000 --> 21:13.000
Did you already have some cases in which you had to handle the balancing between

21:13.000 --> 21:19.000
lithium cell storage and other kind of storages such as compressed air

21:19.000 --> 21:27.000
or concrete and fibers or the storage system than lithium cell?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
No.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.000
So far it was only lithium cells of the different chemistries like iron,

21:34.000 --> 21:38.000
lithium iron phosphate, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide.

21:38.000 --> 21:45.000
We were in discussions with some people developing redox flow batteries

21:45.000 --> 21:52.000
where the voltage is smaller so you could potentially monitor multiple cells at once

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
and get an average kind of.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.000
But yeah, so far these technologies you mentioned we haven't tried.

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
But if the voltage range matches then it should also be possible to do the monitoring

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
at least for those cells.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
I have a couple of questions.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
I don't know if I can ask multiple questions or just one.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Okay.

22:19.000 --> 22:24.000
I can also stay outside the room after the session.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
Okay.

22:25.000 --> 22:36.000
You talk about network and notably having GSM but you don't talk about

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
security feature for software and remote control.

22:41.000 --> 22:47.000
So I don't know, is there any, how is it handled or anything?

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
Yeah, so we are using TLS certificates for the communications.

22:57.000 --> 23:06.000
And currently, yeah, that one of the problems with security is that with TLS

23:06.000 --> 23:11.000
you have the handshake mechanism every time you restart sending something out

23:11.000 --> 23:18.000
via the modem and in these areas you usually have SIM cards with roaming

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
and they are rather expensive for high data rates.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
So you have like six megabytes per month only.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
And if you do a TLS handshake every time then that gets tricky

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
so you have to reduce your data rate.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.000
We also thought about other things like co-op where you don't have the handshake

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
but it's tricky but we're still implementing security

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
so we're not making any compromises on that.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.000
Thanks.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
Originally it was the same question as the first one

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
but I can switch to the next one.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
Did you consider to have a bit more modularity like on the other models you had?

23:51.000 --> 23:56.000
Those were somehow split up because on a bicycle for example 36 volts

23:56.000 --> 24:00.000
I wouldn't need 100 amps so that would be a bit much.

24:00.000 --> 24:03.000
And I think for everyone afterwards,

24:03.000 --> 24:08.000
we'll come out together and we could chat about the Vigotech project,

24:08.000 --> 24:09.000
Ointech mentioned.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.000
Yeah, so you have a certain degree of modularity

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
which you can implement through leaving out some components.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
So you could just have less MOSFETs

24:23.000 --> 24:26.000
or take cheaper and smaller connectors

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
and then reduce the amount of time you have to do that.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
That's possible in that direction but not in the other direction.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
So we designed it for 100 amps which is almost the limit

24:37.000 --> 24:42.000
of what you can get with the power and control PCB

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
on the same control part on the same PCB

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
because the chips have small pin pitches

24:47.000 --> 24:50.000
and if you need a huge copper then you get into trouble with that.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
So, yeah.

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
And as you mentioned the bicycle, so this is really designed for energy access as we said

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
and for high power appliances in energy access.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
So like milling machines or stuff like, or a tri-cycle

25:03.000 --> 25:07.000
where actually then you possibly get to the 100 amps that you will need

25:07.000 --> 25:11.000
and not for like an e-bike, like one person e-bike.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Last question.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.000
We have a certain number of people who are using the same power supply

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
and the same power supply to e-bike, like one person e-bike.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
Last question.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
We have 13 seconds.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
It's precise.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
I'll be quick.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.000
So, as you know there isn't a standard protocol for talking to BMSes from all,

25:35.000 --> 25:38.000
you know, because you're going to be talking to standard inverters

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
in a typical system assuming there's some solar input

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
and the problem is that most of those aren't open yet.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.000
So, they expect that there's a whole series of battery protocols.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
And so, currently if you buy a generic inverter,

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
it speaks 15 different battery impersonation modes.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I'm just wondering what you've done some of that

25:55.000 --> 25:59.000
or if anybody's thinking of a sensible standard for this madness.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
Five seconds, Enswer.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Okay, yeah.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
We thought about that, but that's all only software.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
So, the ideas that we have are RS485 and CAN bus,

26:13.000 --> 26:17.000
so you can implement any special kind of battery protocol.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
We have CAN open readymade out of Zephyr,

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
so that's already something, yeah, a higher level complicated stack

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
that's already pre-built in.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
But, yeah, anything, any very special thing would have to be implemented.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000
Thank you so much.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Thank you very much.
