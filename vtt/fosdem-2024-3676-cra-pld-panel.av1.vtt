WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
Okay, so welcome back to this session on the CRA and PLD block.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.680
We are having a panel with some of the people that directly wrote the pieces of legislation

00:16.680 --> 00:18.580
we're discussing in this block.

00:18.580 --> 00:23.680
To my left we have Benjamin Bergle, who is working for the European Commission as Head

00:23.680 --> 00:29.560
of Sector for Standardization and Product Security.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.680
I almost did it right.

00:32.680 --> 00:38.080
Next to him is Chuck Dinghou, who is Director for the Python Software Foundation and we

00:38.080 --> 00:43.440
really wanted to get a community perspective on this panel, which is what Chuck will provide

00:43.440 --> 00:48.880
and also what Chuck will challenge you to help us provide, because that's kind of what

00:48.880 --> 00:50.560
we are trying to do here.

00:50.560 --> 00:58.120
And finally we have Omar Enaji, who is Policy Officer for DGGROW, who has worked on the

00:58.120 --> 01:02.640
Product Liability Directive for multiple years now.

01:02.640 --> 01:06.520
My name is Martin and I will try to ask some questions.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.560
You will be asking the really clever ones.

01:08.560 --> 01:13.080
I will be asking the other ones.

01:13.080 --> 01:14.680
So let's get started.

01:14.800 --> 01:22.440
I would like to ask our panelists to do a real quick introduction specifically to answer

01:22.440 --> 01:26.400
the question, what does implementation of these laws mean to you?

01:26.400 --> 01:33.200
Because we've been over the proposals, we've had the negotiations, they're about to be

01:33.200 --> 01:34.960
confirmed by Parliament.

01:34.960 --> 01:38.040
So what this panel is about really is about looking forward.

01:38.040 --> 01:41.840
We're not doing the negotiations over.

01:41.840 --> 01:51.080
We're now looking at when will these actually hit Europe and what's needed to get there.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.440
Thanks a lot, Martin.

01:52.440 --> 01:57.680
So for the Cyber Resilience Act, I mean the text isn't final yet, right?

01:57.680 --> 02:00.320
So we don't know exactly when it will enter into force.

02:00.320 --> 02:07.600
As I said yesterday, sometime around the middle of 2024, maybe a little bit later.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.440
And then we have a three years transition period.

02:10.440 --> 02:16.360
So manufacturers, hardware and software manufacturers, they will have to start applying the rules

02:16.360 --> 02:20.200
roughly around June 2027.

02:20.200 --> 02:25.240
So that gives us three years during which we can prepare for the implementation.

02:25.240 --> 02:29.440
We just had this fascinating presentation on the 40 standards, right?

02:29.440 --> 02:35.160
So that's going to be a huge part of our work, helping the European standardization organizations

02:35.160 --> 02:36.960
with the standards.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.600
We will also have to produce guidance, of course.

02:39.600 --> 02:43.760
And thank you actually very much for inviting us here because I think these are the venues

02:43.760 --> 02:48.320
where you get all the tricky questions that need to be answered in the guidance, right?

02:48.320 --> 02:51.680
Because of course the CRA is a high level piece of legislation.

02:51.680 --> 02:57.120
It will not provide an immediate answer to every edge case that you may have.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.280
So I think this is where the guidance really comes in.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.880
And we want to be inclusive in this process.

03:02.880 --> 03:07.520
We want the community there, open source, single vendors, everyone.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.600
And we're really looking forward actually to this process.

03:10.600 --> 03:16.680
Thank you Martin as well.

03:16.680 --> 03:25.200
So for the PLD, a bit different from the CRA because it's a directive and not a regulation.

03:25.200 --> 03:30.800
So it requires transposition at a new level in each member states.

03:30.800 --> 03:36.680
Actually the law will be applicable in each member state.

03:36.680 --> 03:43.200
So this year will be 2026 in theory around June, July.

03:43.200 --> 03:48.800
It will depend exactly when the parliament will give the vote.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.720
And by then the liability rules will be kicking in.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.720
So yeah, that's roughly it.

03:54.720 --> 03:59.240
Would you mind spending a couple of cents more on the difference between a regulation

03:59.240 --> 04:03.960
and a directive because we appreciate that a lot of you may know a lot about software

04:03.960 --> 04:08.720
and we also think some of you may not know a lot about you lawmaking.

04:08.720 --> 04:09.720
So can you?

04:09.720 --> 04:17.120
Yeah, so I mean just a quick legalistic view says at you level you have three types of

04:17.120 --> 04:18.120
acts.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.120
You have three types of acts.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.000
A regulation, a directive and a decision.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.920
A regulation and a decision basically only requires to be directly applicable at national

04:27.920 --> 04:28.920
level.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.840
But the law remains the same.

04:31.840 --> 04:37.200
For a directive it requires transposition and the transposition is basically incorporation

04:37.200 --> 04:38.760
into the national law.

04:38.760 --> 04:43.320
You will have 27 different laws that would say the same basically.

04:43.320 --> 04:48.560
But because of the particularity of the directive it would also require changes in some other

04:48.560 --> 04:51.840
parts of the national legislation.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.880
A directive also requires implementation along with the incorporation.

04:56.160 --> 04:59.480
The regulation only requires the implementation of it.

04:59.480 --> 05:04.680
And it's directly applicable as a regulation into the national laws while the directive

05:04.680 --> 05:07.200
needs to be incorporated to be applicable.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.160
So you will have the central piece of legislation but for the rest you will have national laws

05:11.160 --> 05:13.600
that will tell you or give you the answer.

05:13.600 --> 05:18.160
And the role of the commission during the transposition, the two years transposition,

05:18.160 --> 05:21.320
that's why there is a deadline for that.

05:21.320 --> 05:28.040
It's to check each legislation to ensure that there is no mistakes that doesn't go against

05:28.040 --> 05:30.720
what the main legislation says.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.880
So that's the big picture.

05:39.400 --> 05:45.000
So my next question is about your personal experience trying to express false into law

05:45.080 --> 05:52.080
or maybe to interact in the EU policy space whereas you may have previously focused on

05:52.080 --> 05:53.560
the developer space.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.800
So a different question for each of you.

05:55.800 --> 06:00.720
So for you, what was it like to work on a policy topic as someone who is very knowledgeable

06:00.720 --> 06:03.280
about software development?

06:03.280 --> 06:10.200
For each of you, what was it like to work on a topic with the nuances that open source

06:10.200 --> 06:12.680
has in your policy?

06:15.680 --> 06:21.720
So first of all, again, my background is very similar to a lot of developers.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.640
I'm closer to a software developer than a policymaker.

06:24.640 --> 06:31.320
So for us, I think we have a lot of concern about whether I will be reliable.

06:31.320 --> 06:36.120
I mean, maybe I've created some fun stuff.

06:36.120 --> 06:40.600
I publish it as open source because I want to share it but then you have no control of

06:40.600 --> 06:43.200
who is taking it and doing what about it.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.600
For example, the car example maybe at the beginning when I created this project, I'm

06:47.600 --> 06:51.080
not expecting someone to use it in a car and then the car will hit someone.

06:51.080 --> 06:55.360
So that is something that I think a lot of developers have that in their mind.

06:55.360 --> 07:04.400
There's a bit worry that now if this happens, will we be not publishing anything anymore

07:04.400 --> 07:07.680
so that will affect the open source ecosystem a little bit more?

07:07.680 --> 07:13.000
And also, for example, if you're working for companies or maybe then your company would

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
tell you to not do it because the company don't want to get involved in your hobby

07:17.000 --> 07:18.960
project that may get into trouble.

07:18.960 --> 07:26.200
So there is a lot of concern, I think, as someone who, you know, and also, because

07:26.200 --> 07:28.000
software is very different from hardware, right?

07:28.000 --> 07:33.200
You can't make something at your backyard and then come and in fact you can take it in

07:33.200 --> 07:34.200
production.

07:34.240 --> 07:39.280
But software, you know, the power of software is like, you know, some individual developers,

07:39.280 --> 07:44.640
they can still develop a piece of software that is, you know, very applicable in a lot

07:44.640 --> 07:49.080
of application but is maintained with very limited resources.

07:49.080 --> 07:53.640
I think that that make hardware and software a huge difference in terms of scales.

07:53.640 --> 07:58.200
You know, you don't have enough, you know, resources, you can't massively produce something

07:58.200 --> 08:02.680
in hardware but if you have limited resources, you can still massively produce some things

08:02.680 --> 08:04.960
in software that like a lot of people use, right?

08:04.960 --> 08:09.040
So that's the concern from a developer perspective.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
Yeah.

08:10.040 --> 08:11.040
So.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.040
Thanks.

08:12.040 --> 08:20.120
Yeah, I mean, for us, I think it was a huge challenge to adopt the existing European framework

08:20.120 --> 08:24.800
for product legislation, the new legislative framework, as you call it, or the CE marking

08:24.800 --> 08:29.040
that you're familiar with, to software and to cybersecurity, right?

08:29.040 --> 08:32.360
Because, I mean, software is not a tangible good.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.880
It's different and cybersecurity is also very special.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.240
It's not the same as safety.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.800
Usually we've always regulated safety.

08:39.800 --> 08:45.040
Now, for the first time, we are regulating security and I found that to be a huge challenge.

08:45.040 --> 08:49.520
I think we managed to get it right but it was a challenge.

08:49.520 --> 08:53.200
What I really liked about engaging with the open source community is that you meet a lot

08:53.200 --> 08:56.160
of passionate people who really care, right?

08:56.160 --> 09:01.440
So when we regulate other areas, you get to meet lobbyists who are simply paid to defend

09:01.440 --> 09:02.520
interests.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.440
Of course, you're also defending your interests.

09:04.440 --> 09:08.680
But on top of that, I mean, you meet people that actually really care about the things

09:08.680 --> 09:12.960
that they work on and you see it's more than just a job, it's a mission for them.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.560
And I really appreciate that.

09:15.560 --> 09:25.360
Well, I mean, for me, it's a bit different because let's say that the product I really

09:25.360 --> 09:28.520
like to direct is about any type of product.

09:28.520 --> 09:32.720
So what I had, it's basic.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.720
I think it's the CO2.

09:34.720 --> 09:47.880
Do you see maybe it's a defective product.

09:47.880 --> 09:53.000
But the idea is basically how to deal with perfume industry, with car industry, with

09:53.040 --> 10:00.160
tables, with chairs, with vaccines, with pacemakers, with hats, with whatever you want, all of

10:00.160 --> 10:01.160
those industries.

10:01.160 --> 10:04.080
With the PRD, we didn't have a specific sector.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.320
We had all of them at the same time.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.040
And what we actually needed is basically to have people that could represent each of those

10:10.040 --> 10:15.840
sector to hear the concerns and what could work and what could not work.

10:15.840 --> 10:21.880
And I have to say that with the open source software community, it was maybe a bit harder

10:21.880 --> 10:27.920
to achieve that because of the fact that you are all individuals, there is not really

10:27.920 --> 10:29.400
someone that represents you.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.280
You need to speak a little bit harder because this is not a mic.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.440
It's only for the recording.

10:33.440 --> 10:39.840
So what was really complicated for the open source software community for me is basically

10:39.840 --> 10:46.120
I could not have a single voice that could tell me what were the full concerns, had different

10:46.120 --> 10:47.360
voices.

10:47.360 --> 10:53.200
But to be totally honest, the one that we're more talking about, your issues, let's say

10:53.200 --> 10:57.200
the bigger one, which I pretty sure do not represent you.

10:57.200 --> 11:03.240
And so that was the main difficulties for us from the PRD perspective, was to get what

11:03.240 --> 11:06.200
are the real concerns and how do we reply to them.

11:06.200 --> 11:09.520
But at the same time, we also had to be totally honest.

11:09.520 --> 11:15.160
The PRD is a piece of legislation made for victims, which is basically all of you, all

11:15.160 --> 11:16.160
of us.

11:16.160 --> 11:21.200
So we needed to find the right balance, not to put too much pressure on the one that creates

11:21.200 --> 11:25.720
the product, but also not too much pressure on the person that actually suffered the damage.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.080
And that was what we needed to achieve.

11:28.080 --> 11:35.000
And where we need to find the good balances when we have your inputs, this is where we

11:35.000 --> 11:42.480
can actually find the perfect balance in a way.

11:42.480 --> 11:46.760
So I will be asking, giving the crowd a opportunity to ask questions.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.840
So if you have one, raise it before I'll get to you.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.400
I'll ask two questions to Benjamin so I can have a look around.

11:53.400 --> 11:57.840
So my first question, Benjamin, and it's about stewards, is how can a steward know they're

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
a steward?

11:58.840 --> 12:03.200
And my second question is, suppose they find out they're a steward, but they're not in

12:03.200 --> 12:09.840
the EU, who is the supervisory authority they are supposed to be talking to?

12:10.840 --> 12:18.920
Okay, so I mean, you find out if you're a steward by looking into the law, the law defines

12:18.920 --> 12:20.840
the concept of steward, right?

12:20.840 --> 12:26.200
It says you have your, if you're someone that's, I mean, if you're a legal person that supports

12:26.200 --> 12:32.520
a project on a sustained basis, and this project is ultimately intended for commercial

12:32.520 --> 12:35.480
purposes, you are a steward.

12:35.480 --> 12:40.640
The regulation also gives a few examples, such as foundations, I mean, not every foundation

12:40.640 --> 12:45.360
will be a steward, but if it meets those criteria, it's a steward.

12:45.360 --> 12:48.400
And so you can look it up in the law.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.760
As I said before, there will be cases where it's maybe not as clear cut, right?

12:52.760 --> 12:56.440
We hope that with the guidance, we can also address those cases.

12:56.440 --> 13:01.240
So I'm quite confident that the end of the implementation process, people will usually

13:01.240 --> 13:04.600
know if they're stewards or not.

13:04.720 --> 13:11.720
Now, if you're outside the EU, so the CRA is indeed a regulation, yeah?

13:11.720 --> 13:18.120
It means it applies across the entire single market in a uniform manner, and all the market

13:18.120 --> 13:21.560
surveillance authorities are responsible for you, essentially, yeah?

13:21.560 --> 13:28.400
If your product is, or if your software is published and accessible across the entire

13:28.400 --> 13:34.560
internal market, then all the market surveillance authorities will also be responsible for supervising

13:34.560 --> 13:35.560
you.

13:35.560 --> 13:45.720
So I will be walking into the crowd to get a question.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.120
I will be off camera, which is fine.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.920
So please state your name and affiliation and a question if you have it.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.520
I'll hold the mic.

13:53.520 --> 13:54.520
Okay.

13:54.520 --> 14:00.520
My question is about a Debian, which there is a Debian foundation in France, and there

14:00.520 --> 14:07.720
is software in the public interest, but these foundations only handle financial issues.

14:07.720 --> 14:12.120
They have nothing to do with code in any way or form.

14:12.120 --> 14:18.120
Are they going to be considered stewards?

14:18.120 --> 14:22.040
Yeah.

14:23.040 --> 14:31.400
So unfortunately, I cannot give legal advice on individual projects, right?

14:31.400 --> 14:35.560
Because if I get it wrong now, then it's a huge problem.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.440
So you will have to check for yourselves.

14:37.440 --> 14:42.080
I mean, what I can tell you is, I mean, we put some indications into the law when you

14:42.080 --> 14:44.280
could be considered a steward.

14:44.280 --> 14:49.560
So for instance, when you are hosting the collaboration platform, if you are to some

14:49.560 --> 14:55.440
extent governing the project, if you take decisions on the project, or if you do steer

14:55.440 --> 15:01.640
the development process, then you would be considered a steward.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.640
Taking another audience question.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.080
So please state your name and affiliation and then the question.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.080
I'll hold the mic.

15:07.080 --> 15:11.880
Thierry Carreze, Open Infra Foundation and the open source initiative.

15:11.880 --> 15:18.240
You mentioned the chilling effects on development and engagement from the open source community.

15:18.240 --> 15:25.240
And I think it's the main fear we have is that whatever legislation is created, it would

15:25.240 --> 15:30.680
prevent or discourage people from participating in the open source commons.

15:30.680 --> 15:36.000
And I think it's linked to any uncertainty will be interpreted in a worse way.

15:36.000 --> 15:43.280
So how are we going to, with 40 standards on the CRS side and transposition in every

15:43.280 --> 15:49.680
country, 27 countries on the PLD side, how are we going to have enough certainty for

15:49.680 --> 15:54.840
those people to, for them not to have this chilling effect on their participation?

15:54.840 --> 15:55.840
Thank you.

15:55.840 --> 16:00.040
I'm going to Omar first.

16:00.040 --> 16:05.560
Well, I think you can send an email to one of us.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.520
That's basically the first.

16:07.520 --> 16:14.840
I mean, we are open to have any discussion with anyone that has an issue on the ground

16:14.840 --> 16:16.200
because we are not on the ground.

16:16.200 --> 16:24.320
So this is how it works for every unit in the commission is basically everyone has legislation

16:24.320 --> 16:29.040
or has a policy and we receive feedbacks from people.

16:29.040 --> 16:33.800
Someone, for example, for transposition would say, well, I'm in Spain and this is how the

16:33.800 --> 16:35.000
law applies in Spain.

16:35.000 --> 16:39.760
And I'm pretty sure that that was not the main idea because when I looked into the main

16:39.760 --> 16:42.240
piece of legislation, it says something opposite.

16:42.240 --> 16:45.600
Well then it's the work of the commission to realize, well, that something goes wrong

16:45.600 --> 16:50.000
there and then we enter into contact with the national authorities.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.520
That's for the transposition part.

16:51.520 --> 16:57.720
But if there is like, there are issues during the years of applications of the directive,

16:57.720 --> 17:02.440
then we have what we call a review clause in each piece of legislation.

17:02.440 --> 17:06.440
Every three years or five years, you will have someone from the commission, usually

17:06.440 --> 17:13.120
one of us that will do the review with the study, having interviews, taking all the evidences

17:13.120 --> 17:17.080
and proof and you will collect all of them and then realize, OK, there is an issue that

17:17.080 --> 17:19.040
was not foreseen at the beginning.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.040
How do we solve it?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.040
There was a gap.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.280
How do we, how do we feel it?

17:22.280 --> 17:26.920
That was actually the main, the same thing that happened with the PRD, the PRD that dates

17:26.920 --> 17:28.800
back from 85.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.240
It took 40 years to review it.

17:31.240 --> 17:37.480
Before that, we started the collection of the reviews of the proof and we collected all

17:37.480 --> 17:43.240
the opinions and this is where I say that maybe your community was the one that was not

17:43.240 --> 17:48.880
really involved into that because of how the process is, but everyone has a voice in the

17:48.880 --> 17:49.880
seat there.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.880
Sorry, I want to ask a follow-up question.

17:51.880 --> 17:55.920
So I know that like sometimes the White House will have some open call for like suggestions

17:55.920 --> 17:56.920
and comments.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.640
Will you plan to do something like that?

17:59.640 --> 18:07.320
Well, first of all, we need to apply it, but that is for sure that for the next review,

18:07.320 --> 18:09.440
which will happen.

18:09.440 --> 18:13.880
So it's two years, four years, it will be in six years.

18:13.880 --> 18:19.680
In six years, we will take us, do a state of play of how it's applied and then obviously

18:19.680 --> 18:25.880
we'll have to collect a bit of information and we will have to check with people of the

18:25.880 --> 18:30.880
industry, the communities to see what is their experience and if there are things that

18:30.880 --> 18:32.400
work or don't work.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.240
So that's how we will have to do it.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.760
But I cannot tell you right now, but it will be one, but I'm sure that it will be one because

18:38.760 --> 18:43.240
it's how it works for these kind of things.

18:43.240 --> 18:50.720
Yes, so I would like to fork Omar's answer.

18:50.720 --> 18:54.280
I would like to add that, I mean, I don't think there will be a chilling effect on open

18:54.280 --> 18:57.440
source coming from the CRA, to be honest.

18:57.440 --> 19:01.000
I mean, let's be frank, open source is essentially outside the scope.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.840
I mean, of course, there will be cases where manufacturers will, of course, try to place

19:06.840 --> 19:12.160
requirements upstream, right, and talk to upstream developers, but I mean, you are for

19:12.160 --> 19:16.680
the most part not covered by the Sub-Brazilian Act.

19:16.680 --> 19:20.400
If you want to make sure that the transition goes smoothly indeed, I mean, please do reach

19:20.400 --> 19:21.400
out to us.

19:21.400 --> 19:27.520
I think we've proven over the last year that we are a very approachable bunch here.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.960
We are taking your concern seriously.

19:29.960 --> 19:35.880
We are going to do our utmost to find solutions, but we are even legally obliged in the CRA.

19:35.880 --> 19:40.240
There is a specific provision that requires the commission to consult the community.

19:40.240 --> 19:46.000
I mean, we would do so anyway, but you even have that reassurance that we have to do it.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.160
And yes, I mean, just please do reach out.

19:51.160 --> 19:56.600
Just one thing for the chilling effect, because for the PRD we have experience with that.

19:56.600 --> 20:03.640
Forty years ago, I could show you the newspapers that was going all around Europe from manufacturers

20:03.640 --> 20:08.280
saying that if this piece of legislation would enter, there would be no products anymore

20:08.280 --> 20:09.480
in Europe.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.320
I'm pretty sure that this is not the case anymore.

20:12.320 --> 20:16.080
What the PRD did is basically give trust into people.

20:16.080 --> 20:19.760
When they buy something, they know that if something goes wrong, at least they will have

20:19.840 --> 20:21.040
the back cover.

20:21.040 --> 20:26.040
That is the idea of the entire piece of legislation.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.520
One practical comment I would like to make with respect to the question that was just

20:33.520 --> 20:36.680
asked is that after the panel, we'll have a workshop.

20:36.680 --> 20:41.840
And one of the mechanics is that we want to ask you about your fears, but also hopes and

20:41.840 --> 20:43.440
perhaps your solutions.

20:43.440 --> 20:47.520
So if you're listening to this and think, hey, but I have these corner cases that I'm

20:47.560 --> 20:53.400
really worried about, make sure to remember for like 20 minutes more and then put them

20:53.400 --> 20:57.520
to paper because we're actually trying to collect these.

20:57.520 --> 20:58.680
I saw multiple hands.

20:58.680 --> 21:04.760
I'm first going to ask a question myself and then I'll return to the audience questions.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.920
So it's related to the PLD.

21:07.920 --> 21:12.640
In December, a political deal was reached on the PLD and one of the things that was

21:12.640 --> 21:19.640
publicized by the MEPs looking out for open source specifically was that open source would

21:20.160 --> 21:24.680
not be in scope if it was not a commercial activity.

21:24.680 --> 21:31.680
And it was a delegation to the technical level to implement this idea along the principles

21:32.280 --> 21:33.920
of the CRA.

21:33.920 --> 21:40.920
Now when the text of the PLD became public in end of January, what we saw was that there

21:40.920 --> 21:47.920
was a single or maybe one and a half PLD recital and the CRA has seven, eight maybe.

21:50.840 --> 21:56.840
So I'm asking is the PLD team that much better at writing recitals?

21:56.840 --> 22:03.840
Can we somehow use the nuance that was expressed in CRA in the PLD or are you going to offer

22:06.520 --> 22:07.680
guidance?

22:08.640 --> 22:10.360
Because I was a bit surprised.

22:10.360 --> 22:14.920
I was expecting more nuance but maybe I'm wrong and you're the expert.

22:14.920 --> 22:21.200
So maybe a bit of a tough question for you Omar and I'd like to hear from you.

22:21.200 --> 22:25.760
So I mean I will ask you a very short question.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.040
How many products do exist in the world?

22:29.040 --> 22:36.040
Because what you as a community got is basically one full recital over 47 while the PLD applied

22:37.760 --> 22:41.040
to millions of products.

22:41.040 --> 22:45.760
So I think in proportions you got quite a lot actually.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.920
The difficulties for the PLD is basically to say that yes there is a CRA that gives an

22:49.920 --> 22:54.400
explanation about open source software but you will also have the AI act for that.

22:54.400 --> 23:00.520
You will also have all the type of legislation that will get the open source point and we

23:00.520 --> 23:02.940
have to cover all of them at the same time.

23:02.940 --> 23:08.060
We cannot copy paste from one single legislation because we apply to all of them at the same

23:08.060 --> 23:09.100
time.

23:09.100 --> 23:14.140
So the difficulties was really to find the right wording.

23:14.140 --> 23:21.140
I think as you said the MEP that quoted said that the main idea is that is the commercial

23:21.260 --> 23:22.740
activity.

23:22.740 --> 23:27.780
While this is applicable for any product, any product that's actually been developed

23:27.780 --> 23:33.140
or supplied outside, mostly supplied outside of a commercial activity, it's out of the

23:33.140 --> 23:35.020
liability regime.

23:35.020 --> 23:38.220
And that's what we written in the recital.

23:38.220 --> 23:42.620
It's basically restating the fact that if it's outside of a commercial activity then

23:42.620 --> 23:43.820
you're out.

23:43.820 --> 23:47.660
But if you're in, that's where the PLD applies.

23:47.660 --> 23:54.420
We cannot create a specific regime of open source in the PLD itself also because of the

23:54.420 --> 24:01.420
nature of the legislation that has to be neutral and you cannot have just very specific provisions

24:03.140 --> 24:08.500
about one single product because each provision has to apply in the same way to any other

24:08.500 --> 24:09.380
type of product.

24:09.380 --> 24:13.660
That's a bit of the, and the CRI would apply for cyber vulnerabilities but then you will

24:13.660 --> 24:18.900
have the AI act that would apply also for open source.

24:18.900 --> 24:23.900
And for us we need to cover all of them so that's why it's in this way.

24:24.260 --> 24:31.260
So I have a question that relates to work that will be a little bit out of your hands.

24:31.900 --> 24:37.700
So for you Omar, it's about the 27 member states that somehow need to get the work

24:37.700 --> 24:44.060
you did and then make their own and somehow understand the nuance of what open source

24:44.060 --> 24:45.060
is about.

24:45.060 --> 24:49.060
For you it will be about Toby Stark on 40 standards.

24:49.060 --> 24:55.700
What will you be doing for Chuck and me and all the other people writing software to apply

24:55.700 --> 25:02.180
what you learned in the past 12 months or maybe you already were to help the people

25:02.180 --> 25:09.180
doing that work not make, like understand the nuance of what is essentially a niche of

25:10.500 --> 25:16.980
a niche but also rules the world of products with digital elements.

25:16.980 --> 25:23.980
So what will the commission do to help the community in these stages of the process?

25:28.820 --> 25:29.660
Okay.

25:29.660 --> 25:33.980
Yeah, I mean, so the commission is not writing the standards, right?

25:33.980 --> 25:35.620
I mean, that is how it works.

25:35.620 --> 25:39.060
I think you also would not want us to write the standards.

25:39.060 --> 25:43.100
So that's probably a good thing that we are not writing them.

25:43.100 --> 25:46.140
It's the European standardization organizations.

25:46.140 --> 25:51.780
They are made up of national delegations from the national standards bodies.

25:51.780 --> 25:58.780
These standards bodies, they often send representatives from manufacturers and from others.

26:00.260 --> 26:06.260
We have like, the commission has basically three ways of being involved in that process.

26:06.260 --> 26:11.820
First, we are the ones drafting the standardization request, which is the basis on which the ESOs,

26:11.900 --> 26:15.780
the European standardization organizations are going to work on those standards.

26:15.780 --> 26:20.700
So in the standardization request, we can already express our expectations,

26:20.700 --> 26:22.900
what the standards should look like.

26:22.900 --> 26:27.100
Then, although while we are not going to be writing the standards,

26:27.100 --> 26:29.260
we are going to be there all the way, right?

26:29.260 --> 26:31.260
So we will be in all the meetings.

26:31.260 --> 26:35.220
We will listen to the conversations.

26:35.220 --> 26:37.260
We will give our views.

26:37.260 --> 26:42.140
We will answer questions on how things are to be interpreted in the CRA and so forth.

26:42.140 --> 26:45.980
And in the end of the day, we also have to rubber stand the standards.

26:45.980 --> 26:54.420
They have to be cited in the official journal of the European Union that gives them this power to give presumption of conformity.

26:54.420 --> 26:58.620
So what I can reassure you is that we are going to be there all the way.

26:58.620 --> 27:01.340
We are going to look at the process very closely.

27:01.340 --> 27:07.740
We are also more than happy to engage with those parts of the open source community that do have expertise in standards, right?

27:07.740 --> 27:10.620
To find solutions to the issues that you may have.

27:10.620 --> 27:16.940
So again, I mean, I already said it a couple of times, please do reach out and let's discuss that in more detail.

27:16.940 --> 27:17.940
Thank you.

27:22.460 --> 27:25.540
Well, I mean, my work is not done yet.

27:25.540 --> 27:31.820
As I said, the transposition will kick in as soon as the co-legislator have officially voted,

27:31.820 --> 27:37.420
which should happen either in June, July or September in any event.

27:37.420 --> 27:41.260
And then after that, we launch the transposition period,

27:41.260 --> 27:47.820
which means basically that we will be receiving the 27 piece of legislation piece by piece,

27:47.820 --> 27:49.740
or sometimes just the entirety of it.

27:49.740 --> 27:58.740
And we will have to work closely with each single member state to ensure that the legislation reflects exactly the directive.

27:58.740 --> 28:05.740
What we have as a tool in the commission is what we call the infringement procedure.

28:05.740 --> 28:14.140
So when the commission realizes that a member state does not conform itself with a new legislation,

28:14.540 --> 28:20.740
we can bring the case to the court to ensure that the member state applies it or does it properly.

28:20.740 --> 28:30.340
I'm not, I mean, as a small background, the first PRD took for some member state more than 20 years to properly transpose the directive.

28:30.340 --> 28:35.340
So I hope we're not going to be there, but this is how it works from our side.

28:35.340 --> 28:44.740
And then once it's transposed in any event, we will have to check constantly if there is a good application,

28:44.740 --> 28:48.340
because one of the things is it's not only the transposition by the member state,

28:48.340 --> 28:53.140
but also how the jurisdictions will be applying the law.

28:53.140 --> 28:58.340
A national court is also a representation of the member state at your level.

28:58.340 --> 29:06.340
So if there is a misapplication at that level, we would also have to intervene to ensure that it is done in conformity.

29:10.340 --> 29:15.740
Thank you very much. I will take two audience questions, one here and one there.

29:15.740 --> 29:20.340
And then we will continue with the panel if there's time.

29:20.340 --> 29:23.140
I will be holding the mic. Please state your name and affiliation.

29:23.140 --> 29:30.140
Alistair Woodman representing 2501C3's outdoing open source projects.

29:30.140 --> 29:40.540
As far as the PLD is concerned, do you anticipate that the market will support insurance policies for this to deal with the sort of quenching thing?

29:40.540 --> 29:50.140
Or is it a non-goal or a goal to encourage insurance in this particular regard for non-mulse-feasant behavior?

29:51.140 --> 29:54.140
I think that was for you Omar.

29:54.140 --> 29:59.140
So the PLD does not have any requirement about insurances.

29:59.140 --> 30:03.140
So everyone is free to do whatever they want.

30:03.140 --> 30:06.140
Basically, it's just you need to calculate your own risk.

30:06.140 --> 30:12.140
And once you know your risk exposure, you will know whether you need one or not.

30:12.140 --> 30:14.140
But it's not from outside that we do it.

30:14.140 --> 30:17.140
And to be also totally frank with you, as I said also yesterday,

30:17.140 --> 30:24.140
most of you here will never have a claim on PLD.

30:24.140 --> 30:29.140
I mean, this does not happen every single day for each type of product.

30:29.140 --> 30:32.140
We have a few cases that can happen.

30:32.140 --> 30:35.140
You can have access to all of them.

30:35.140 --> 30:38.140
It's true that for software it's a bit more rare that this happens

30:38.140 --> 30:42.140
because you have something that the traditional products don't.

30:42.140 --> 30:49.140
You can correct the piece of software before something wrong would happen.

30:49.140 --> 30:51.140
You know that there is a vulnerability.

30:51.140 --> 30:53.140
You know that there is maybe something defective inside.

30:53.140 --> 30:58.140
And then you will correct it with an update and then you avoid having any issue.

30:58.140 --> 31:01.140
That's a bit more of a facility for you.

31:01.140 --> 31:07.140
And we will not impose from our end-in-end insurance for that.

31:07.140 --> 31:09.140
That's a bit of the approach.

31:13.140 --> 31:19.140
Audience question. Please state your name and affiliation.

31:19.140 --> 31:22.140
Hi. Olli Johansson.

31:22.140 --> 31:27.140
I'm an open source developer also active in OpenSSF and OVASP.

31:27.140 --> 31:32.140
The problem with those 40 organizations that create standards for us open source developers

31:32.140 --> 31:37.140
is that ECMA, Sennilec, all of them require quite huge fees.

31:37.140 --> 31:41.140
Who will pay them so we can take part in the standardization effort?

31:42.140 --> 31:45.140
I think this will be for Benjamin.

31:50.140 --> 31:55.140
Yes, I don't think I have necessarily a satisfactory answer for you, right?

31:55.140 --> 31:57.140
Yeah.

31:58.140 --> 32:02.140
So I will take note of your financial needs.

32:04.140 --> 32:09.140
But indeed, I mean the CRA is just one of many pieces of legislation.

32:09.140 --> 32:13.140
So we do not shape the standardization policy.

32:13.140 --> 32:17.140
We just use the standardization process for the CRA.

32:17.140 --> 32:22.140
But indeed, I mean this is an important question and we are more than happy to look into that.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.140
Thank you.

32:24.140 --> 32:27.140
So we're slowly nearing the end of this panel.

32:27.140 --> 32:34.140
I'm going to ask a number of questions in succession and then we'll see if there's more time for audience questions.

32:34.140 --> 32:41.140
So to Omar, I'll ask, do you know about any other related legislation that is coming for this community

32:41.140 --> 32:44.140
that we should be waking up about?

32:44.140 --> 32:46.140
So take a moment to think about it.

32:46.140 --> 32:48.140
I'll get to you for the answer.

32:48.140 --> 32:53.140
So for Benjamin, I would like to talk to you about the guidelines.

32:53.140 --> 33:00.140
Can you be very specific about how people can contribute to the process of writing them?

33:00.140 --> 33:08.140
And there is this delegated act possibility about voluntary security at the station programs.

33:08.140 --> 33:13.140
Can you talk about what your intentions are, maybe how people can help?

33:13.140 --> 33:22.140
So my goal is with these three questions to the two of you, is to give people in the room a clear view of what they can do.

33:22.140 --> 33:27.140
Should they have the time, the money, etc. to be involved in EU policymaking?

33:27.140 --> 33:30.140
So now I'll hand over to Omar.

33:33.140 --> 33:35.140
Well, I have no idea.

33:35.140 --> 33:38.140
I have to be totally honest with you.

33:38.140 --> 33:41.140
We are many, many directorates.

33:41.140 --> 33:45.140
But it's as simple and it doesn't really require any money.

33:45.140 --> 33:51.140
It's just two times time to check what the commission is doing.

33:51.140 --> 33:58.140
The various directorate channels, I mean, mostly did connect, but it can also be did you grow?

33:58.140 --> 34:02.140
Could be just wherever the directorate is.

34:02.140 --> 34:07.140
And then if you have a question, you are wondering something, you are...

34:07.140 --> 34:12.140
I mean, don't say that to my other colleagues, but you can send an email to the units.

34:12.140 --> 34:14.140
And this doesn't cost any money.

34:14.140 --> 34:19.140
They will happily reply to you and give you any answer that you're seeking.

34:19.140 --> 34:22.140
There are stuff that you don't understand from legislation.

34:22.140 --> 34:27.140
There are information that you would want to bring to the attention to the commission itself.

34:27.140 --> 34:30.140
Our emails are open for that.

34:30.140 --> 34:36.140
And this is also our role to have a look into what happens on the ground.

34:41.140 --> 34:45.140
I mean, as I already said, we are legally obliged to consult.

34:45.140 --> 34:48.140
But we would do it anyway, of course.

34:48.140 --> 34:58.140
As the commission, I mean, we are very likely going to organize conferences where people can attend and bring their ideas to the table.

34:58.140 --> 35:10.140
We are likely going to have some form of expert group or a similar body where people that want to, like, be more involved than just ad hoc,

35:10.140 --> 35:13.140
but in a more structured manner where they can engage with us.

35:13.140 --> 35:16.140
And, of course, you will be seeing us at conferences.

35:16.140 --> 35:18.140
You can invite us to your events.

35:18.140 --> 35:22.140
We're happy to attend, maybe not always physically, but online.

35:22.140 --> 35:25.140
So there will be plenty of opportunities to engage.

35:25.140 --> 35:30.140
As regards the voluntary security attestation programs,

35:30.140 --> 35:49.140
so, yeah, I mean, the idea is basically to give those projects that are not directly in the scope of the CRA a chance to provide some form of assurance that the projects are secure, right?

35:49.140 --> 35:55.140
We know that many of these projects, they don't have financial resources.

35:55.140 --> 36:00.140
So the provision is quite open in that regard.

36:00.140 --> 36:07.140
It does not require the ones that develop a project to also pay for that program, but other people can step in.

36:07.140 --> 36:15.140
So, for instance, integrators that take an active interest in a certain component because they need it for their own due diligence, they need the assurance that it's secure.

36:15.140 --> 36:19.140
They could also team up and pay for that assurance.

36:19.140 --> 36:25.140
Now, these attestation programs, there is only a so-called empowerment in the law.

36:25.140 --> 36:27.140
That means that the commission is empowered.

36:27.140 --> 36:30.140
We are allowed to flesh them out.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.140
So they are not there yet.

36:31.140 --> 36:34.140
We don't have these assurance programs at this point in time.

36:34.140 --> 36:37.140
But the commission will be able to work on this.

36:37.140 --> 36:46.140
And for this, we will also need your input so that we can shape these programs in a way that they are useful for the integrators or users to have the assurance that they need.

36:46.140 --> 36:53.140
But they also take into account all these specificities of open source projects because they are often so different, right?

36:53.140 --> 37:07.140
The way they are structured and the promises or commitments that they can make compared to more traditional, manufacturer-based projects.

37:07.140 --> 37:18.140
So I think we'll take one more audience question and then I'll ask Chuck if she wants to do any reflection on what this means for Python maybe.

37:18.140 --> 37:23.140
Let's see. I think there was a hand pretty early on.

37:23.140 --> 37:26.140
So name and affiliation, please.

37:26.140 --> 37:31.140
Hi, Vittorio Bertola from Open Exchange, which is a 300-people German open source software maker.

37:31.140 --> 37:38.140
So the question is, well, first, this is creating cost, of course, not for security because we have a flow of security record.

37:38.140 --> 37:41.140
We already spend all the money that's necessary on security.

37:41.140 --> 37:44.140
But for the bureaucracy that now you are introducing for compliance.

37:44.140 --> 37:49.140
So this is making us less competitive and all our competitors are from outside Europe, including Google.

37:49.140 --> 37:52.140
So how is this going to be compensated?

37:52.140 --> 37:54.140
And maybe ours, we are a pretty big company.

37:54.140 --> 37:56.140
We can cope for it.

37:56.140 --> 38:00.140
But the French Foundation for Debian that has to hire a lawyer, there are going to be costs.

38:00.140 --> 38:06.140
Are you going to put some money onto this, maybe to fund developers to cope with security issues or to fund the bureaucracy?

38:06.140 --> 38:10.140
And also, how are you going to avoid the international players from gaming the system?

38:10.140 --> 38:14.140
I mean, it's way too easy. I see this happen for like the Googles and Apple.

38:14.140 --> 38:16.140
They create some initiative, which is a non-profit.

38:16.140 --> 38:18.140
They put the code into that.

38:18.140 --> 38:22.140
It gets outside of the CRA scope or maybe gets the like system, whatever.

38:22.140 --> 38:25.140
And then they don't have to support the cost of compliance.

38:25.140 --> 38:30.140
Well, we still compete with the same piece of software and we have to pay the full cost of compliance.

38:30.140 --> 38:33.140
So do you have any thoughts on this?

38:38.140 --> 38:41.140
Do you want to check to go first or answer the question first?

38:41.140 --> 38:43.140
Yeah.

38:45.140 --> 38:49.140
Yeah, I mean, it's true, of course, that there will be some bureaucracy.

38:49.140 --> 38:53.140
I mean, no law has ever been created that doesn't create some bureaucracy.

38:53.140 --> 38:59.140
Okay, maybe the PLD doesn't because it only hits you once something happens and not before.

38:59.140 --> 39:04.140
But usually, of course, there is a certain compliance cost that's quite unavoidable.

39:04.140 --> 39:16.140
I think the competition concerns there may be a bit overstated because the CRA does not only apply to European companies or manufacturers or open source projects,

39:16.140 --> 39:23.140
but it applies to anyone who is bringing, publishing or putting on the market those products in Europe, right?

39:23.140 --> 39:26.140
And we all know that Europe is a big continent.

39:26.140 --> 39:28.140
It's quite relevant.

39:28.140 --> 39:34.140
There are probably very few manufacturers in the world that do not place products on the European market.

39:34.140 --> 39:38.140
So they will all be subject to the rules.

39:38.140 --> 39:44.140
We do have some field facilitations actually for small manufacturers when we talk about actual manufacturers.

39:44.140 --> 39:48.140
So there is a provision that again, it's an empowerment for the commission.

39:48.140 --> 39:55.140
It allows us to create a form for a simplified technical documentation for small companies.

39:55.140 --> 40:07.140
So that means that small companies, they will only have to fill out one form essentially and the length of the form is somehow going to inform the expectations towards how much information you're going to provide.

40:07.140 --> 40:12.140
So I think that can help a lot like one single form makes your life much easier.

40:12.140 --> 40:15.140
And then we also have some funding calls.

40:15.140 --> 40:30.140
Actually there are funding calls ongoing right now until the end of March that also aim at helping small companies deal with the implementation of the CRA.

40:30.140 --> 40:31.140
Thank you Benjamin.

40:31.140 --> 40:34.140
So I think we are at time.

40:34.140 --> 40:40.140
I would like to thank our panelists for the courage to come here to talk to us, to have this conversation.

40:40.140 --> 40:45.140
They're not leaving yet, but I will ask you for a round of applause before we continue.
