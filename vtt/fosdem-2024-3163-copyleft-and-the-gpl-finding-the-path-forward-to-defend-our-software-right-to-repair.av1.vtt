00:00.000 --> 00:10.780
I'm very pleased to welcome someone who many of you will know, Bradley Kuhn, I'll let

00:10.780 --> 00:17.020
him introduce himself and he's going to talk about copy left and the GPL and its role in

00:17.020 --> 00:19.520
defending our right to repair.

00:19.520 --> 00:20.520
Over to you Bradley.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.520
Thank you.

00:21.520 --> 00:25.520
I never thought of myself as a legend so it's kind of you to say that but I don't know if

00:25.520 --> 00:27.640
it's really accurate.

00:27.640 --> 00:36.320
In many ways this will be an update of the keynote that I gave at Fosdham 2017.

00:36.320 --> 00:41.920
I realize many of you may not have been to Fosdham from four years ago or whatever, more

00:41.920 --> 00:44.600
than four years ago, six years ago.

00:44.600 --> 00:50.440
If you didn't, I don't mind if you start clicking on the links, they're in my notes

00:50.440 --> 00:55.480
on the Fosdham page and you can click through those slides as I get started if you want

00:55.480 --> 00:59.440
the context because my goal here is to kind of give an update on what's happened in the

00:59.440 --> 01:02.240
last couple of years.

01:02.240 --> 01:09.880
I approach all of the things in free and open source software from the role of an activist

01:09.880 --> 01:17.040
which is frankly quite different from most of the kind of work that people tend to do.

01:17.040 --> 01:22.960
I am trained as a software developer, I spent many years doing software development including

01:22.960 --> 01:29.120
proprietary software development once upon a time and it's what turned me into an activist

01:29.120 --> 01:35.360
such that I'm not doing so much software development but instead trying to change the way that

01:35.360 --> 01:41.120
the technology industry works with regard to the rights that people have with regard

01:41.120 --> 01:43.160
to their technology.

01:43.160 --> 01:49.040
I really believe it's important if you're an activist to keep your goals and your area

01:49.040 --> 01:50.520
of activism narrow.

01:50.520 --> 01:55.040
It's not that I don't believe other causes are very important.

01:55.040 --> 02:00.760
Probably most of the causes that you would expect I am supportive of, I am.

02:00.760 --> 02:09.000
But I spend my time focused really narrowly on trying to reach a world where everyone

02:09.000 --> 02:14.160
has universal software freedom or the phrase that I've been using a lot more to refer to

02:14.160 --> 02:17.960
it is a universal right to software repair.

02:17.960 --> 02:22.560
You should have the right to fix your software and I want a world where everyone has that

02:22.560 --> 02:25.680
right for all the software that they use.

02:25.680 --> 02:33.360
As I get older I become more and more morbid, I was already morbid but now even more so

02:33.360 --> 02:39.520
and not a week goes by that I don't think about the fact that this activist cause that

02:39.520 --> 02:44.240
I'm working on has basically no chance of succeeding in my lifetime.

02:44.240 --> 02:49.800
I will die in a world that most people in the world are using proprietary software for

02:49.800 --> 02:55.200
most of the things that they do with computers and most people won't have the right to repair

02:55.200 --> 02:57.400
that software the day that I die.

02:57.400 --> 03:07.600
It's an unfortunate fact but it's expected with regard to work as an activist.

03:07.600 --> 03:12.760
Ultimately activism is not really just politics although it feels that way most of the time.

03:12.760 --> 03:17.400
Most days I end the day feeling like I'm some sort of politician and I don't particularly

03:17.400 --> 03:25.680
like that feeling but it's fundamentally different from politics because politicians

03:25.680 --> 03:33.360
really seek only to achieve what is politically viable and the art of politics is the art of

03:33.360 --> 03:39.640
compromising to a solution that everybody can agree on.

03:39.640 --> 03:45.120
But activists tend to, oh shoot sorry my colleagues are apparently talking about my talk and I'm

03:45.120 --> 03:49.920
getting notices about it.

03:49.920 --> 03:55.880
I think the big contrast to all of that in between activism and politics is that activism

03:55.880 --> 04:00.800
is really trying to reach something that's politically unviable that really doesn't seem

04:00.800 --> 04:09.560
like it could ever happen and the only similarity between the two really is that the goal of

04:10.320 --> 04:13.760
the activist is different but the strategies tend to be the same.

04:13.760 --> 04:18.920
So as an activist I have to find and every activist needs to find strategies that are

04:18.920 --> 04:26.720
politically viable but those are not end goals in themselves and it's a mistake to look at

04:26.720 --> 04:32.120
them as end goals in themselves and if you look at my previous talk you'll see I've talked

04:32.120 --> 04:37.240
about how copy left is not an end goal in itself it's a strategy to achieve software

04:37.240 --> 04:38.240
freedom.

04:38.680 --> 04:44.240
Now being an activist you often get insulted as it turns out.

04:44.240 --> 04:49.160
I've been called many times to be tilting at windmills.

04:49.160 --> 04:54.840
I counted at least ten times that's happened either after one of my talks and I actually

04:54.840 --> 05:00.120
always wonder if folks who have said that to me or actually have read the source material

05:00.120 --> 05:02.640
or at least the cliff notes.

05:02.680 --> 05:08.520
Here is actually an excerpt from the cliff notes on the book Don Quixote and I actually

05:08.520 --> 05:12.480
think it really explains activism quite well.

05:12.480 --> 05:19.720
Ultimately acts of rebellion or reform are quixotic because the reformer aims to undermine

05:19.720 --> 05:27.200
the existing institutions in order to change them and I believe that activism for software

05:27.200 --> 05:34.920
rights is designed to undermine the existing technology industry in order to change it.

05:34.920 --> 05:44.720
Copy left is a strategy a politically viable mechanism to bring about that change.

05:44.720 --> 05:53.520
Copy left is subversive, copy left is quixotic, copy left is counterculture.

05:53.520 --> 06:00.720
Now the interesting thing is that it also has to be politically viable and we also have

06:00.720 --> 06:08.960
to succeed at using it to push forward the long term, never happening in my lifetime

06:08.960 --> 06:14.480
goal of software rights for everybody.

06:14.480 --> 06:19.280
Now one of the things that's been incredibly difficult for copy left to continue to succeed

06:19.280 --> 06:26.680
and I think it has had some success but its success is in peril in recent years is because

06:26.680 --> 06:36.320
of the level of co-option that we now see with regard to free and open source software.

06:36.320 --> 06:43.560
Co-option is a process that happens in social justice movements whereby the mainstream takes

06:43.640 --> 06:55.680
control of the politically viable parts of the otherwise idealistic activist cause and

06:55.680 --> 07:07.920
uses them to seek its own goals and usually supersedes the activists in time without tremendous

07:07.920 --> 07:10.280
work to fight against it.

07:10.400 --> 07:20.720
You can actually look at the history of copy left and really see that the technology industry

07:20.720 --> 07:29.040
has done a really good job of co-option of free and open source software and copy left

07:29.040 --> 07:35.240
has faced challenges as a strategy because of that co-option.

07:35.240 --> 07:43.640
Since 2001 almost every large big technology company has had some sort of strategy to discredit

07:43.640 --> 07:47.360
undermined or otherwise work against copy left.

07:47.360 --> 07:53.640
You'll find that most big companies really really love non-copy lefted open source and

07:53.640 --> 08:00.160
free software and they really dislike copy lefted open source and free software.

08:01.080 --> 08:08.000
This is not necessarily, I was just going to say, it's reasonable that they take this

08:08.000 --> 08:13.760
position because copy left is designed to undermine the technology industry and they

08:13.760 --> 08:14.920
don't want it undermined.

08:14.920 --> 08:21.480
They want to continue to make proprietary software and copy left is attempting to prevent that.

08:21.480 --> 08:27.360
I realize a lot of you probably work for some of these companies and I suspect that last

08:27.400 --> 08:30.840
slide for those of you in the audience who work for one of those companies or the many

08:30.840 --> 08:37.040
others that aren't on the list, it creates a certain amount of cognitive dissonance.

08:37.040 --> 08:40.680
I want to be clear that it's not your fault.

08:40.680 --> 08:46.920
You're part of a system, as am I, that has systemic institutionalized problems that take

08:46.920 --> 08:51.640
away people's rights to repair and improve their software.

08:51.640 --> 08:58.040
No individual in the culture altogether can avoid this.

08:58.040 --> 09:03.440
If you take a look at the keynotes that Karen Sandler and I gave in previous years about

09:03.440 --> 09:07.720
the issue of trying to use only free software in your life, it's very very difficult.

09:07.720 --> 09:14.440
So it's not necessarily a surprise that many people are going to be in a situation where

09:14.440 --> 09:20.080
they're both working for and against open source and free software at the same time.

09:20.080 --> 09:24.160
In the end, these are the systems, these systematic problems in the technology industry that are

09:24.160 --> 09:31.160
the windmills that someday the activist cause of universal software freedom will take down

09:31.160 --> 09:36.800
but try to get comfortable with the cognitive dissonance that if you're doing work at a

09:36.800 --> 09:41.160
company, even if you're working on open source, but that company also does lots of proprietary

09:41.160 --> 09:45.880
stuff, you're both part of the problem and part of the solution at the same time.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.440
And I'm going to talk about a couple things at the end of the talk that you can do to

09:50.440 --> 09:51.940
help.

09:51.940 --> 09:56.520
Companies have been paying attention to what copy left does and how it works for a very

09:56.520 --> 10:01.280
long time, the entire history of copy left more or less.

10:01.280 --> 10:08.880
And this is the laundry list I came up with of basically the playbook that companies use

10:08.880 --> 10:12.840
to keep copy left from succeeding.

10:12.840 --> 10:21.640
It's relatively disturbing that you'll find, for example, on GitHub.

10:21.640 --> 10:26.560
For a while there was a GitHub employee who spent, I guess, their free time, maybe their

10:26.560 --> 10:30.720
paid time, not sure, going to various different projects that were copy left and trying to

10:30.720 --> 10:34.560
shame them into changing their license to a non copy left license.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.720
I don't think that's occurring anymore, but it was one of the many examples I saw where

10:38.800 --> 10:44.560
there was real pressure from the corporate environment to shame people who chose copy

10:44.560 --> 10:47.640
left, tell them their software was never going to be popular.

10:47.640 --> 10:52.720
And I've seen many colleagues who work for companies reassigned from working on a copy

10:52.720 --> 10:58.920
lefted project to a non copy lefted one, or who asked to have a project be released under

10:58.920 --> 11:05.720
copy left to be told they have to release it under the MIT license or something else.

11:05.720 --> 11:10.880
It's very interesting to me, too, that there has been such pushback in the free software

11:10.880 --> 11:16.640
world about assigning copy rights to nonprofit entities that want to pursue this long term

11:16.640 --> 11:25.280
goal of copy left and software freedom when most of the copy rights generated in software,

11:25.280 --> 11:29.320
open source and free software, are held by companies because your company keeps the copy

11:29.320 --> 11:32.000
right when you are an employee.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.700
And for Europeans, I'm talking about the exploitative rate, and moral rates really tend not to

11:35.700 --> 11:40.020
come into play with regard to copy left licenses.

11:40.020 --> 11:48.140
And what we've seen in my work doing enforcement and compliance with copy left licenses is

11:48.140 --> 11:53.460
that really companies have become incredibly brazen and simply ignoring copy left requirements

11:53.460 --> 11:59.620
entirely, or just promulgating interpretations that make no sense, saying that, well, that's

11:59.620 --> 12:01.180
what the source code is.

12:01.180 --> 12:05.020
Even though it's not the source code that they use, they make up a separate source release

12:05.020 --> 12:10.300
to give to you and claim that it corresponds to the binaries you've received, but it doesn't

12:10.300 --> 12:11.860
in fact do that.

12:11.860 --> 12:19.620
So there's a lot of activities that folks who want to take away software freedom are

12:19.620 --> 12:21.660
using to succeed.

12:21.660 --> 12:29.900
Now, we've had a lot of success doing various different actions around copyright law to

12:29.900 --> 12:31.980
succeed in making copy left work.

12:31.980 --> 12:35.740
I don't want this to sound like copy left has been a mitigated disaster.

12:35.740 --> 12:38.060
I think it's actually been quite successful.

12:38.060 --> 12:44.300
Howard Veltner for years was doing enforcement in Germany that was very successful under

12:44.300 --> 12:45.300
copyright law.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.860
He's no longer doing that activity.

12:47.860 --> 12:52.540
The organization I work for, Software Freedom Conservancy, had a successful copyright litigation

12:52.540 --> 12:58.780
regarding the Busy Box project that did gain software freedom on a few devices.

12:58.900 --> 13:08.260
We've learned a lot of lessons from doing copy left as a copyrighted focused endeavor.

13:08.260 --> 13:19.220
The remedies that courts offer for copyright rather are not particularly well fitting with

13:19.220 --> 13:22.460
what we're trying to get done with copy left.

13:22.460 --> 13:28.500
Typically courts offer either injunction, which is a prohibition on further distribution

13:28.500 --> 13:31.860
of the software and financial damages.

13:31.860 --> 13:38.740
Now, it's never been our goal to stop people from copying and redistributing copy lefted

13:38.740 --> 13:39.740
software.

13:39.740 --> 13:45.820
So injunction tends not to be that interesting other than leverage to get compliance.

13:45.820 --> 13:50.140
And similarly, a threat of financial damages is not normally what activists want.

13:50.140 --> 13:53.540
I don't want money for copy left infringement.

13:53.540 --> 13:56.140
I want compliance with the copy left license.

13:56.140 --> 14:00.780
I want users to have the rights they were supposed to get in the first place.

14:00.780 --> 14:07.020
And there's no amount of financial reward that can ever replace the importance of having

14:07.020 --> 14:10.420
the right to modify the source code of your software.

14:10.420 --> 14:18.860
Additionally, any copyright action has to be brought by the copyright holder or someone

14:18.860 --> 14:20.580
they've assigned to.

14:20.580 --> 14:21.940
This creates a weird burp.

14:21.940 --> 14:31.340
I think Harold Vulta was a true hero that he spent basically 10 to 15 years with probably

14:31.340 --> 14:39.020
half or 75% of his time just doing GPL enforcement to liberate Linux devices that had his code

14:39.020 --> 14:40.140
in it.

14:40.140 --> 14:46.900
But it's a lot to ask of any developer who would rather be writing code to have to go

14:46.900 --> 14:54.140
out and do these actions to get compliance with software that companies have violated

14:54.140 --> 14:56.460
the GPL on.

14:56.460 --> 15:01.980
So I've come to the conclusion, and many of us who do this work, that copyright was

15:01.980 --> 15:08.500
a pretty clumsy mechanism for getting what we actually want with copy left.

15:08.500 --> 15:13.220
The goal of copy left was to have a strategy that would liberate software for users.

15:13.220 --> 15:14.660
They would have the right to the source code.

15:14.660 --> 15:16.220
The source code would compile.

15:16.220 --> 15:18.180
The source code would install.

15:18.180 --> 15:24.820
But in the end, courts in copyright cases don't order entities to do the things that

15:24.820 --> 15:27.380
GPL says.

15:27.380 --> 15:33.540
So over the last few years, I've been thinking a lot about this quote that was actually the

15:33.540 --> 15:37.100
quote I put in the US you put in your high school yearbook.

15:37.100 --> 15:42.820
It's when you finish your four-year post-secondary education and you get to put a quote in your

15:42.820 --> 15:43.820
yearbook.

15:43.820 --> 15:48.380
This is the quote I put in my yearbook, which I should have went back and read long before,

15:48.380 --> 16:00.780
because in fact, always trying to do copy left enforcement as a copyright-based action

16:00.780 --> 16:04.900
was really a foolish consistency, because other options were available.

16:04.900 --> 16:13.020
In fact, when you look at the GPL v2, the word you or your appears 93 times.

16:14.020 --> 16:19.220
It refers to what you are supposed to be allowed to do, what your rights are.

16:19.220 --> 16:22.460
The phrase copyright holder appears twice.

16:22.460 --> 16:28.660
The GPL and copy left license general have never been about the copyright holder.

16:28.660 --> 16:30.420
They're about you.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.700
They're about the user.

16:31.700 --> 16:37.060
They're about the person who received the software and what their rights are, namely,

16:37.100 --> 16:44.460
their right to modify, repair, and reinstall the software.

16:44.460 --> 16:54.260
What the lawyers call this is they are third-party beneficiaries of the GPL agreement.

16:54.260 --> 16:57.860
For various reasons that I can't get into because there's only eight minutes left in

16:57.860 --> 17:03.180
my talk, we spent a lot of years only looking at copyright solutions and not looking at

17:03.180 --> 17:09.620
the third-party beneficiary solutions to getting compliance with copy left and getting

17:09.620 --> 17:14.580
source code to users who were looking for it.

17:14.580 --> 17:19.060
At Software Freedom Conservancy, we currently have a third-party beneficiary case in the

17:19.060 --> 17:21.100
United States that is going quite well.

17:21.100 --> 17:26.900
You can read about it on our website against a seller of Linux-based televisions in the

17:26.900 --> 17:27.900
United States.

17:28.580 --> 17:34.620
We're also engaged in some grant making to bring actions outside the U.S. on a third-party

17:34.620 --> 17:39.220
beneficiary basis with regard to the GPL.

17:39.220 --> 17:46.060
I believe this is an important step that we have to take because we can't, as the English

17:46.060 --> 17:49.700
phrase goes, put all our eggs in one basket.

17:49.700 --> 17:54.780
Copyright-based solutions for copy left are useful and they've succeeded in the past,

17:54.780 --> 17:56.580
but we shouldn't only be doing those.

17:56.580 --> 18:01.140
We should be looking at other mechanisms that we have in the legal infrastructure that

18:01.140 --> 18:08.500
we have for the defense of users' rights and software and using any of the mechanisms

18:08.500 --> 18:13.220
that we find and really all of the mechanisms that we find.

18:13.220 --> 18:18.420
The other thing we're doing in the Visio case is we're asking for this thing that lawyers

18:18.420 --> 18:20.620
call specific performance.

18:20.740 --> 18:28.900
Now, specific performance is typically used for things like a family heirloom or some

18:28.900 --> 18:35.940
other type of object or thing that has no equivalent and no amount of money can replace

18:35.940 --> 18:36.940
it.

18:36.940 --> 18:42.420
Well, the fact is we never felt that any amount of money could replace users' rights anyway,

18:42.420 --> 18:47.780
so specific performance is exactly the type of legal mechanism that we should seek with

18:47.780 --> 18:54.740
regard to getting the proper and correct source code for the devices that we have that contain

18:54.740 --> 18:56.540
GPL software.

18:56.540 --> 19:00.420
Furthermore, we don't even ask for financial damages.

19:00.420 --> 19:06.940
Our goal being that we're being very clear with the court what we want as activists.

19:06.940 --> 19:12.420
We want the right to copy, modify, and reinstall the software so that we can make use of it,

19:12.420 --> 19:18.020
so that we can take these computers, which just look like televisions, and use them

19:18.020 --> 19:22.580
for other purposes like every other computer was 20 years ago.

19:22.580 --> 19:30.380
Today, most of our computers can't be repurposed, and usually they can't be repurposed because

19:30.380 --> 19:32.620
they're violating the GPL.

19:32.620 --> 19:34.580
That's something that we want to change.

19:34.580 --> 19:39.580
Now, there's a lot of stuff that you can do to help with this.

19:39.580 --> 19:44.900
I know I fed you some cognitive dissonance early, but there's real steps you can take

19:44.900 --> 19:51.180
if you're employed doing open source and free software development.

19:51.180 --> 19:56.660
I mentioned that companies tend to require their employees to effectively assign their

19:56.660 --> 19:57.660
copyrights.

19:57.660 --> 19:59.380
Usually it's part of your employment contract.

19:59.380 --> 20:03.780
Now, I realize if you're unemployed and desperately looking for a job, you don't have a lot of

20:03.780 --> 20:08.620
leverage, but most people in the technology industry switch jobs voluntarily.

20:08.620 --> 20:14.340
I ask that when you switch your job voluntarily, make it a term and condition of your new employment,

20:14.340 --> 20:19.060
that you get to keep your own copyrights, that you can decide when your software should

20:19.060 --> 20:26.140
be copy-lefted or not, instead of letting your employer decide that for you.

20:26.140 --> 20:33.100
As I said, we still will need to pursue copyright-based solutions to open source and free software

20:33.100 --> 20:35.380
issues with regard to copy-lefts.

20:35.380 --> 20:39.140
Assign your own copyrights is a useful thing.

20:39.140 --> 20:43.380
And if you're willing, you can assign them to SFC, because I don't think it should then

20:43.380 --> 20:49.060
on top of that be your job to go out and figure out how to get compliance with the copy-left

20:49.060 --> 20:54.140
license after you've done all the hard work to get it released under a copy-left license.

20:54.140 --> 20:58.420
SFC is one of the organizations that's willing to do that work for you, and we're prepared

20:58.420 --> 20:59.940
to do it.

21:00.940 --> 21:06.780
You can also help on these two, and we have a new program that I'm announcing today at

21:06.780 --> 21:13.980
SFC that will hopefully really make it possible for you to make real progress in dealing with

21:13.980 --> 21:14.980
these issues.

21:14.980 --> 21:18.500
We're launching this new thing called Use the Source.

21:18.500 --> 21:26.540
Use the Source is designed to be a program where we can teach you and mentor you and

21:26.540 --> 21:32.460
get you involved in the process that we do to deal with all these millions of embedded

21:32.460 --> 21:37.380
devices that are violating the GPL.

21:37.380 --> 21:43.300
We've, as FOSS developers, have taken a FOSS development approach to it.

21:43.300 --> 21:48.300
We want a solution where volunteers can check the offers for source, because almost every

21:48.300 --> 21:55.100
device that you've bought in the last five years probably is based on Linux and probably

21:55.100 --> 21:57.700
has an offer for source.

21:57.700 --> 22:06.700
With the Use the Source community, you can post any source requests that you've made,

22:06.700 --> 22:13.060
submit whatever the company gave you, and work with the rest of the community to figure

22:13.060 --> 22:17.540
out how to get it to build, because the big problem is that most of these companies are

22:17.540 --> 22:20.220
not actually giving the right source code.

22:20.220 --> 22:23.820
They are not giving you the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the

22:23.820 --> 22:29.260
software, which the GPLE2 has mandated since 1992.

22:29.260 --> 22:36.020
You have so much power as consumers and users of these devices to put pressure on these

22:36.020 --> 22:40.060
companies that are constantly telling us, oh, it's going to take us six months to get

22:40.060 --> 22:41.060
you the source code.

22:41.060 --> 22:44.380
Oh, well, that's an old product, and we don't have to give you the source code.

22:44.380 --> 22:46.660
Not true.

22:46.660 --> 22:53.180
I want to and would like you to join with my colleague Denver and I to learn how to verify

22:53.180 --> 22:54.580
these source releases.

22:54.580 --> 22:55.580
It really hearkens back.

22:55.580 --> 23:02.660
If any of you were on Harold Delta's mailing list in the early 2000s on gplviolations.org,

23:02.660 --> 23:06.500
they're now defunct, but if you look back at those archives, you'll see that's what

23:06.500 --> 23:14.140
people were doing in the early 2000s to try to get companies into compliance as a collaborative

23:14.140 --> 23:16.060
effort.

23:16.060 --> 23:22.700
We want the issues of copy left to be something that operates like an open source and free

23:22.700 --> 23:24.180
software community.

23:24.180 --> 23:27.180
I hope that you'll join us in doing that.

23:27.180 --> 23:30.780
This was really scheduled to be an update from my previous talk, so I'm going to finish

23:30.780 --> 23:31.780
up there.

23:31.780 --> 23:33.340
I don't have a lot of time for questions.

23:33.340 --> 23:38.100
However, we have the legal and policy dev room that's happening this afternoon.

23:38.100 --> 23:42.620
There will be lots of discussion of issues related to copy left there, and I'll be there

23:42.620 --> 23:46.300
along with my other colleagues who work on this kind of stuff that you can ask questions

23:46.300 --> 23:47.300
there.

23:47.300 --> 23:51.060
Use the source was launched today, and so you can take a look at the website and read

23:51.060 --> 23:52.940
more about it there.

23:52.940 --> 23:54.780
I hope you'll donate to become a sustainer.

23:54.780 --> 23:59.620
We're a non-profit charity that we operate based on your donations, and I'd really appreciate

23:59.620 --> 24:00.620
it.

24:00.620 --> 24:01.860
With that, I think I'm completely out of time.

24:01.860 --> 24:03.940
I'm sorry I can't take questions, but please find me later.

24:03.940 --> 24:06.460
Thank you very much, Steve Bradley.
