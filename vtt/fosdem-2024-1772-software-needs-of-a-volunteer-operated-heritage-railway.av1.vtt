WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
So, we're coming to the end of our last talk for today.

00:07.000 --> 00:13.400
I'm very happy that we are closing with a real training

00:13.400 --> 00:14.400
operation.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.200
And in this case, we're talking about how to do that with

00:18.200 --> 00:20.400
open source, how the source can help there.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.720
And yeah, Niels, it's your stage.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.400
Yeah, thank you.

00:24.400 --> 00:27.200
So my name is Niels.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.400
During the week, I try to make medical devices speak

00:30.400 --> 00:31.640
together.

00:31.640 --> 00:34.240
And on the weekend, I'm playing with trains.

00:34.240 --> 00:41.120
So I'm working at Dampfbahn Frankische Schweiz on the

00:41.120 --> 00:44.160
weekends, which you can't see because it's too bright on the

00:44.160 --> 00:45.880
beamer.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.880
For location, this is Feuchheim, which some people might

00:49.880 --> 00:52.680
know in the medical industry, because that's where my

00:52.680 --> 00:54.160
employer is.

00:54.160 --> 00:57.160
And the next bigger city is Nuremberg, which is somewhere

00:57.160 --> 00:59.480
around here.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.320
We have a short line, 16 kilometers.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.920
It was closed down in 74.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.920
We are running it since 80-something.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.400
There's something like 30,000 passengers per year.

01:10.400 --> 01:17.000
So we are slightly sized for a heritage line or museum

01:17.000 --> 01:18.280
ray-ray.

01:18.280 --> 01:22.120
We have 400 members in the club, of which 40 are actually

01:22.160 --> 01:22.960
active.

01:25.280 --> 01:28.680
We are running steam and diesel every Sunday from May to

01:28.680 --> 01:33.640
October, sometimes occasionally holiday train or

01:33.640 --> 01:35.800
special train, or whatever.

01:35.800 --> 01:40.040
But May to October is the main time.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.640
We are completely volunteer run.

01:41.640 --> 01:49.760
So we have a professional safety manager, but everything

01:49.760 --> 01:54.440
else is completely volunteers.

01:54.440 --> 01:59.880
We are a real railway running under FONE regulations, so

01:59.880 --> 02:03.840
slightly easier rules than the Deutsche Bahn has, but still

02:03.840 --> 02:05.680
real railway rules.

02:05.680 --> 02:10.520
And because we are kind of the only railway in the region, a

02:10.520 --> 02:12.720
lot of local initiatives are in contact with us.

02:12.720 --> 02:16.520
There are some initiatives we want to reopen public transport

02:16.520 --> 02:18.920
on the line, which for us would be good, because then we

02:18.960 --> 02:20.800
can get a lot of TrassengebÃ¼hr.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.600
And it would also help the area quite a lot.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.920
So why do I do the talk here?

02:31.920 --> 02:34.840
So first, I want to put heritage lines generally on the

02:34.840 --> 02:38.960
radar for you guys, A, to come and visit us, and B, because

02:38.960 --> 02:43.280
we have a lot of need for people doing IT stuff.

02:43.280 --> 02:48.320
And the interesting thing is, as we are running some of the

02:48.320 --> 02:51.720
heritage lines, have their own line, where we can do more

02:51.720 --> 02:55.000
or less whatever we want and what the E-Bahn allows in

02:55.000 --> 02:56.920
Germany.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.360
We are the perfect experimentation ground, if you

02:59.360 --> 03:00.600
want to try out some stuff.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.000
If you look at Europe, we have about 100 heritage lines in

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Germany.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.840
UK is the absolute mecca.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.680
They have, I don't know, far above 100.

03:13.680 --> 03:17.560
They are about 50 in Austria, 20 in France, 10 in Belgium.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.520
So all over Europe, you will find some lines.

03:21.520 --> 03:25.480
They are organized in larger communities.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.320
In Germany, it's the Faudi MT.

03:27.320 --> 03:31.640
In Austria, the EMT.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.480
UK has the Heritage Railway Association, the HRA.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.200
So there's a bigger group, and there's a European

03:38.200 --> 03:39.800
organization called Fedeg Rail.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.200
What's our problem?

03:45.240 --> 03:49.360
We like trains, but we are horribly bad at computers.

03:49.360 --> 03:53.560
So this is kind of the typical members.

03:53.560 --> 03:57.400
So that's me after a training shift as a fireman.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.840
This is our engineer who is in real life a state attorney,

04:01.840 --> 04:05.960
and this was my trainer for firemen.

04:05.960 --> 04:08.000
He is in real life a medical doctor.

04:09.000 --> 04:15.000
So I'm the only one who has to do something with IT in this

04:15.000 --> 04:19.440
picture, and I'm probably the one of three in the whole

04:19.440 --> 04:22.280
club who has to do something with IT.

04:22.280 --> 04:27.720
So big problem if we want to run anything in IT.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.720
What do we do?

04:28.720 --> 04:31.720
Of course, we do the stuff that a normal railway does.

04:31.720 --> 04:33.280
So we sell tickets.

04:33.280 --> 04:35.080
We run trains.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.680
We operate and repair the infrastructure.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.760
So we have switches and signals and things.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.760
We operate and repair rolling stock.

04:43.760 --> 04:52.080
So we have coaches and wagons and locomotives and everything.

04:52.080 --> 04:56.080
Not the usual stuff the Deutsche Bahn has to take care of.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.080
There's a little overlap.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.080
We have a V60, which I think is still in operations at

05:00.080 --> 05:01.080
Deutsche Bahn as well.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.080
But most of the stuff is 80 to 100 years old.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.080
And we have workshops and sheds and all the infrastructure

05:09.080 --> 05:10.080
around.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.080
You need to have a railway running.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.080
But also we have a nonprofit part of things.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.080
So we have archives.

05:16.080 --> 05:18.080
We do this to preserve history.

05:18.080 --> 05:21.080
So we have a lot of documentation on our trains.

05:21.080 --> 05:25.080
We have photography, everything on the historic side of

05:25.080 --> 05:26.080
things.

05:26.080 --> 05:30.080
We are a club, a fein in the city of Germany.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.080
So we have to do membership management.

05:34.080 --> 05:40.080
We have to do all the tech stuff you need to do for fein.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.080
And we need to get somehow money for everything.

05:43.080 --> 05:48.080
So we need to organize donation campaigns and try to get

05:48.080 --> 05:50.080
fundings for things.

05:50.080 --> 05:55.080
And it's not just the, so we cannot just run on tickets alone.

05:55.080 --> 05:58.080
If you need to do a full inspection of a steam engine,

05:58.080 --> 06:01.080
we are talking about half a million of euros.

06:01.080 --> 06:05.080
And that is about 10 years of running.

06:05.080 --> 06:08.080
And we need to do every 10 years this inspection.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.080
So, and we have four steam engines.

06:11.080 --> 06:16.080
So you see the problem.

06:16.080 --> 06:20.080
OK, we still run railways as in the 1950s.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.080
So our line, in our case, closed down 74.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.080
It's more or less in the same state.

06:25.080 --> 06:29.080
We are now, but the rest, the signalling,

06:29.080 --> 06:32.080
everything is still in like in 74.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.080
Our active members, unfortunately, are getting older.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.080
We get newer active members again.

06:39.080 --> 06:46.080
But unfortunately, the everyday workload on people has

06:46.080 --> 06:48.080
also increased.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.080
So you cannot spend all your life at the railway anymore.

06:51.080 --> 06:54.080
Some people need to earn money.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.080
And this is kind of increasing, decreasing the time that

06:58.080 --> 07:00.080
people can spend on the railway.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.080
They are higher safety requirements.

07:02.080 --> 07:06.080
So even if we run railways like in the 50s,

07:06.080 --> 07:08.080
we still have to fulfill all the safety requirements

07:08.080 --> 07:11.080
from the 2020s.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.080
So this is kind of challenging.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.080
Our customers want more.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.080
So you cannot come and say, yes, the ticket office is open

07:19.080 --> 07:22.080
from 8 till 9 on Saturdays.

07:22.080 --> 07:26.080
They want to buy a ticket on the internet.

07:26.080 --> 07:30.080
And of course, growing regulations and administrative

07:30.080 --> 07:34.080
effort, which you have everywhere.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.080
So the problems we have, tickets, we still sell these

07:38.080 --> 07:40.080
Edmondson tickets.

07:40.080 --> 07:43.080
As you can see there, there's carport things.

07:43.080 --> 07:46.080
And one of our members also has a printing machine for that.

07:46.080 --> 07:50.080
So this problem is solved.

07:51.080 --> 07:55.080
But we also want to sell tickets via the internet.

07:55.080 --> 07:58.080
And there's not really a good solution.

07:58.080 --> 08:03.080
There's Farkapendrucker.de in Germany, which works.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.080
And works reliably.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.080
But this thing is stuck in the 90s.

08:08.080 --> 08:11.080
So if you look at the layout, it doesn't have responsive

08:11.080 --> 08:12.080
design.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.080
And it's really hard to use.

08:15.080 --> 08:18.080
The back end is quite OK, but the front end for the customers

08:18.080 --> 08:20.080
is horrible.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.080
Unfortunately, it's the only thing we have.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.080
The other thing is you could use some kind of an event

08:25.080 --> 08:26.080
ticketing software.

08:26.080 --> 08:31.080
So a lot of people here would probably know Pre-Tex.

08:31.080 --> 08:35.080
Pre-Tex is absolutely great, but not made for railways.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.080
So it starts with seating arrangements.

08:38.080 --> 08:42.080
So usually we want to have some algorithm that not everybody

08:42.080 --> 08:46.080
sits at the windows, but that if you book multiple places,

08:46.080 --> 08:47.080
you have to set the window.

08:47.080 --> 08:50.080
And then you fill up until you only then are allowed to have

08:50.080 --> 08:52.080
the next window, because else you have all the windows taken.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.080
And then the rest will stay empty because people say,

08:54.080 --> 08:55.080
I want a window.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.080
I don't go there.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.080
There are hundreds of bachelors and master thesis on how to do

09:02.080 --> 09:05.080
a ticket selling system.

09:05.080 --> 09:09.080
But none of them has made it into an open source software,

09:09.080 --> 09:10.080
unfortunately.

09:10.080 --> 09:14.080
So this is something Farkapendrucker works.

09:14.080 --> 09:19.080
Using it helped needed.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.080
Running trains.

09:20.080 --> 09:23.080
So for timetables, for us it's pretty simple.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.080
We have one line, one train.

09:25.080 --> 09:29.080
So we take the same timetable since 20 years.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
So this works.

09:30.080 --> 09:34.080
But if we get more complicated, we might want to run two trains.

09:34.080 --> 09:38.080
And then we need to have a serious timetable.

09:38.080 --> 09:43.080
We use now J-train graph and FPL edit, which is made for model trains.

09:43.080 --> 09:46.080
Works really well.

09:46.080 --> 09:50.080
The FPL edit author also added GTFS export now.

09:50.080 --> 09:56.080
So we might show up on Google Maps hopefully soon.

09:56.080 --> 10:00.080
And OpenStreetMap and Traveling and all the other apps which could

10:00.080 --> 10:01.080
use GTFS.

10:04.080 --> 10:10.080
So there's probably also some larger software interesting.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.080
We have some stuff like the signaling.

10:12.080 --> 10:16.080
So this is our signal box, the complete signal box.

10:16.080 --> 10:22.080
The other safety feature you need to know, there's a key.

10:22.080 --> 10:25.080
This is something where we can improve on.

10:25.080 --> 10:30.080
And it might be some stuff like just putting a GPS tracker on the train,

10:30.080 --> 10:32.080
which then has the other problem.

10:32.080 --> 10:36.080
There's no mobile phone reception on our line because we're in Germany

10:36.080 --> 10:38.080
and in the middle of nowhere.

10:39.080 --> 10:43.080
So there are lots of things where, for example, the IoT department

10:43.080 --> 10:47.080
can have a field day.

10:47.080 --> 10:50.080
We have passenger information systems, whatever.

10:50.080 --> 10:54.080
So there's a lot of things where you could create new software,

10:54.080 --> 10:57.080
which would help us a lot.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.080
Managing rolling stock.

10:59.080 --> 11:05.080
So right now, every train management, so train cars have regular inspection

11:05.080 --> 11:07.080
dates and a lot of paperwork attached to.

11:07.080 --> 11:14.080
This is now managed in an XCloud and an Excel sheet.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.080
And that's already the advanced technology solution.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.080
Usually it's paper folders.

11:19.080 --> 11:23.080
So a lot of things there.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.080
We have reports, regulations, whatever.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.080
So this is kind of a nightmare right now.

11:29.080 --> 11:33.080
But we also got good feedback from our regulating body

11:33.080 --> 11:36.080
because we handed them readable PDFs and they said they were better

11:36.080 --> 11:41.080
than what they get from Deutsche Bahn.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.080
So what's our problem?

11:43.080 --> 11:47.080
So basically, the left side is the museum railway,

11:47.080 --> 11:51.080
half where we need to know our problems.

11:51.080 --> 11:54.080
We still don't really understand the problems well,

11:54.080 --> 11:56.080
so we need to get better at that.

11:56.080 --> 12:00.080
We need to find the solution and we need to be able to apply the solution.

12:00.080 --> 12:02.080
That will be the big thing.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.080
And the other thing is also the software side of things,

12:05.080 --> 12:07.080
so it needs to fit to our problem.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.080
We need to be able to find this software.

12:09.080 --> 12:11.080
So if you search for ticket systems,

12:11.080 --> 12:13.080
you will find G-RA and all that stuff.

12:13.080 --> 12:17.080
So completely unsearchable now.

12:17.080 --> 12:21.080
And it needs to be really ease of use

12:21.080 --> 12:25.080
because we are not good at computers.

12:25.080 --> 12:30.080
So this whole thing started at the Gulasch Programmier Nacht,

12:30.080 --> 12:32.080
a couple of, actually last year.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.080
We did a workshop at the KS Communication Camp

12:35.080 --> 12:41.080
and a small group formed trying to get the IT nerds

12:41.080 --> 12:44.080
and the railway nerds together.

12:44.080 --> 12:48.080
And that's also what I want to present here.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.080
For you guys, why should you bother

12:51.080 --> 12:54.080
if you don't like playing with trains?

12:54.080 --> 12:56.080
Playing with trains is fun.

12:56.080 --> 13:01.080
But you could also use museum railway as a learning ground.

13:01.080 --> 13:05.080
So if you work in software and want to do something for transport

13:05.080 --> 13:08.080
but don't know how railway works,

13:08.080 --> 13:10.080
we are a place where you can learn that.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.080
We are an experimentation area.

13:12.080 --> 13:16.080
So you can do a lot of stuff on museum railways.

13:16.080 --> 13:23.080
So the railway regulations are quite wide open for experimentation.

13:23.080 --> 13:27.080
So I'm really surprised what's possible sometimes.

13:28.080 --> 13:32.080
Coming from medical device where you can't do anything.

13:32.080 --> 13:36.080
And you can use this as a test bed where you have,

13:36.080 --> 13:37.080
we have the simple case.

13:37.080 --> 13:41.080
So we have one line one train or one line two trains

13:41.080 --> 13:43.080
if it gets more complicated,

13:43.080 --> 13:46.080
but we don't have the full network like DBS.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.080
How you can join?

13:49.080 --> 13:52.080
So to have the super easy entry point,

13:52.080 --> 13:55.080
we just created a Discord chat where you could just join.

13:55.080 --> 13:59.080
We are currently four or five people, so smaller.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.080
Hope to grow more.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.080
We have a wiki at kaosban.net

14:05.080 --> 14:10.080
where we, which was kind of the original idea dumping ground,

14:10.080 --> 14:14.080
which now gets a bit more formalized into a knowledge base

14:14.080 --> 14:16.080
where we try to collect the problem cases,

14:16.080 --> 14:19.080
the possible solutions, where there aren't solutions

14:19.080 --> 14:22.080
to get an overview of things.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.080
And we're starting now to network with different heritage

14:26.080 --> 14:27.080
line associations.

14:27.080 --> 14:32.080
So at the Faudi MT meeting in three weeks in Aachen,

14:32.080 --> 14:35.080
I will present basically this talk again

14:35.080 --> 14:41.080
and do the same publicity for heritage lines then.

14:41.080 --> 14:44.080
So then I'm done.

14:44.080 --> 14:48.080
So join us on the Discord if you like.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.080
We're open for crazy ideas.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.080
And if you want to play with trains,

14:53.080 --> 14:55.080
there's a museum railway near you

14:55.080 --> 14:58.080
which takes you with open arms normally.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.080
There's one question.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.080
Yeah.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.080
More information.

15:11.080 --> 15:13.080
I started this with a Netflix presentation.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.080
And in Norway, we had six rotation train nights

15:17.080 --> 15:21.080
that is using the M plan that we don't mention

15:21.080 --> 15:23.080
to produce netx data.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.080
So they are integrated in national trip mapping.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.080
Yeah.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.080
Yeah, I made a lot of notes during your talk.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.080
So.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.080
We also converted the beganesis.

15:33.080 --> 15:39.080
So just repeating for the video, in Norway,

15:39.080 --> 15:43.080
there are, how many you said, six museum railways

15:43.080 --> 15:47.080
to all you're already using the netx tool from the first talk.

15:47.080 --> 15:51.080
So if you haven't watched the first talk.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.080
Do you regulations on station visibility

15:54.080 --> 15:57.080
that the station has to be on a straight section of track

15:57.080 --> 15:59.080
applied to the historic railways?

15:59.080 --> 16:05.080
We have kind of at the limit of what I know.

16:05.080 --> 16:10.080
So I think we have some kind of heritage protection

16:10.080 --> 16:13.080
that still stuff can stay.

16:13.080 --> 16:16.080
But for example, we have one halt in a curve

16:16.080 --> 16:21.080
which we cannot use anymore because the border of the platform

16:21.080 --> 16:22.080
is not really there.

16:22.080 --> 16:26.080
So it's just a meadow which ends up in the track.

16:26.080 --> 16:28.080
And we need to put a clear border

16:28.080 --> 16:30.080
between the platform and the track there.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.080
So there are some regulations and some safety rules.

16:33.080 --> 16:39.080
But I think not 100% what the big railways have.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.080
In the Czech Republic unfortunately a lot of cities have lost

16:42.080 --> 16:45.080
their railways service because of this regulation.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.080
Yeah.

16:46.080 --> 16:52.080
So for video question was on the, if the regulations for stations

16:52.080 --> 16:54.080
that it must be on a straight part of track

16:54.080 --> 16:56.080
and that everything must be visible

16:56.080 --> 16:58.080
applied for museum railways.

16:58.080 --> 17:03.080
And then Czech Republic, a lot of towns have lost

17:03.080 --> 17:07.080
their railway access to that for that.

17:08.080 --> 17:10.080
So one last question.

17:10.080 --> 17:11.080
Thank you for the presentation.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.080
I really enjoyed it.

17:12.080 --> 17:14.080
I have also a lot of ideas.

17:14.080 --> 17:19.080
I'd be a very consider to get into the debate network.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.080
Because for example in Italy you have the foundation of

17:22.080 --> 17:23.080
like Vain Tardien.

17:23.080 --> 17:26.080
And you can actually buy within the ticketing system

17:26.080 --> 17:30.080
tickets in the Vain Tardien system.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.080
So the question is if we have considered joining

17:32.080 --> 17:38.080
DBNETs or DB infrastructure as well.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.080
Not really.

17:39.080 --> 17:42.080
So for ticketing for example we didn't consider that

17:42.080 --> 17:46.080
because it worked so far.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.080
It was a lot of manual work but somehow it works.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.080
And everything which is external gives external costs

17:52.080 --> 17:56.080
because DB doesn't do stuff for free.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.080
But we get work time for free.

17:59.080 --> 18:03.080
So if we can do it by hand or have to pay for it

18:03.080 --> 18:05.080
then we do it by hand.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.080
But they do have like their eye or their mind.

18:07.080 --> 18:08.080
Yeah.

18:08.080 --> 18:12.080
So there might be something I haven't really looked at that.

18:12.080 --> 18:16.080
But for tracks for example if we go out we are running

18:16.080 --> 18:20.080
on DB tracks and have to join their tools and work

18:20.080 --> 18:25.080
with their tools to get into the timetables.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.080
OK great.

18:26.080 --> 18:27.080
Thank you Niels.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.080
Thank you.
