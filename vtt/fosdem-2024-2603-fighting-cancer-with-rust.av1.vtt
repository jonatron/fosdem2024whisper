00:00.000 --> 00:02.060
you

00:30.000 --> 00:32.060
you

01:00.000 --> 01:02.060
you

01:30.000 --> 01:32.060
you

04:00.000 --> 04:15.000
you

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
different search parameters like a bit of

04:21.000 --> 04:28.260
genomic data and this is our architecture so I already mentioned lens

04:28.320 --> 04:36.160
this is what the researcher sees in their browser this is the front end and then it

04:36.160 --> 04:48.320
has its own back end which we actually call spot and in some projects the old

04:48.320 --> 04:54.200
spot which is made in Java is still running but we are about to replace it

04:54.260 --> 05:03.720
with a new spot which is made in Rust then there's these are beam proxies

05:03.720 --> 05:08.560
they're also made with Rust focus is made with Rust Blaze is a store and it is

05:08.560 --> 05:15.020
made with closure and then we have those operations which are shell scripts

05:15.040 --> 05:23.560
mostly so what is happening here a researcher says I need to find samples

05:23.560 --> 05:37.120
with type plasma that come from donors with diagnosis C61 for example and where

05:37.140 --> 05:48.340
the age at diagnosis is between 1450 for example and then that request goes to

05:48.340 --> 05:58.180
spot where it's packed into a certain beam task beam is a task broker which

05:58.240 --> 06:07.800
actually solves problems of strict network environments we face in hospitals

06:07.800 --> 06:15.480
in Germany because of the data protection concepts so on the sites which are

06:15.480 --> 06:22.320
hospitals by banks there are beam proxies which ask beam do you have a task

06:22.460 --> 06:32.300
for me and when they do beam sends the task and focus this component here gets

06:32.300 --> 06:39.420
the task then focus unpacks the task decides for which endpoint it is a task

06:39.420 --> 06:47.040
blaze is only one of the possible stores and also we can query other

06:47.420 --> 06:55.900
applications so it's not only for sorry for database types we also have another

06:55.900 --> 07:03.780
application which is exporter called exporter and one more which is called

07:03.780 --> 07:10.900
reporter so those can also query blaze in their own ways blaze is actually a

07:11.080 --> 07:22.680
fire server fire is a standard of exchange of information in e-health and

07:22.680 --> 07:31.040
healthcare in general and medicine and focus then runs the query against blaze

07:31.040 --> 07:38.520
or against some other store it gets sorry I keep clicking it gets the results

07:38.700 --> 07:43.940
return results to a beam proxy which returns it to beam which returns it to

07:43.940 --> 07:49.580
lens backing which is spot and in the end the browser gets the result and this

07:49.580 --> 07:58.340
component here Laplace this is used for obfuscation obfuscation of data is done

07:58.340 --> 08:08.060
on sites so unobfuscated data never leaves the sites we decided it was the

08:08.080 --> 08:17.000
best to put it there and we have multiple projects that actually run our bridge

08:17.000 --> 08:27.440
heads these set of applications on sites we call them bridge heads you can look

08:27.440 --> 08:34.440
later in our bridge head repository which installs all those components so we

08:34.460 --> 08:40.380
have a lot of projects those are some of the projects that actually run bridge

08:40.380 --> 08:46.580
heads this is map of Germany which with bridge heads in Germany but besides

08:46.580 --> 08:54.220
German Biobank node we also have the European version of it which has biobanks

08:54.220 --> 09:01.820
in other European countries that's bbmri eric then German cancer consortium I

09:01.840 --> 09:12.880
already mentioned and cancer core Europe which intends to facilitate a

09:12.880 --> 09:21.880
translation of clinical research into new drugs and then because children

09:21.880 --> 09:29.080
usually have different types of cancers and cancers differently affect children

09:29.100 --> 09:39.500
we have a separate project which is intended to facilitate the invention of

09:39.500 --> 09:51.400
drugs for pediatric cancers and also applying applying existing drugs which

09:51.420 --> 10:03.380
are for adults but also for those genetic markers for which no drugs exist it

10:03.380 --> 10:12.780
is intended to facilitate personalized medicine this is another project we have

10:13.040 --> 10:31.400
this is for cancer images so MRI CT pet cat it is intended to actually enable AI

10:31.400 --> 10:42.000
analysis of images and then I mentioned beam beam is a distributed task broker

10:42.420 --> 10:52.780
which enables communication with biobanks which are behind the proxies and

10:52.780 --> 11:03.900
have very exotic configurations it handles the encryption beam proxies on

11:03.920 --> 11:14.040
each side encrypt all the traffic and decrypted and it also handles certificates

11:14.040 --> 11:21.260
and it only allows outbound connections which means it is only possible that

11:21.260 --> 11:32.640
beam proxies connect to beam and then we have focus which is a query dispatcher

11:32.860 --> 11:42.980
in which the obfuscation happens so first I need to mention CQL that's what we

11:42.980 --> 11:47.980
use it is clinical quality language I know that there's another CQL which means

11:47.980 --> 12:02.100
something else so parts of CQL come from front end and currently we are working

12:02.480 --> 12:11.320
with certain query replacements to prevent CQL injections but soon we should

12:11.320 --> 12:20.040
have a translation of abstract syntax tree from lens from front end into CQL

12:20.040 --> 12:29.440
completely done in focus I'm working on it and also abstract syntax tree gets

12:29.940 --> 12:35.540
translated or rather simplified for you came the project for a medical imaging

12:35.540 --> 12:47.860
I mentioned before as I said it uses the sampler Laplace library yeah these QR

12:47.860 --> 12:57.460
codes you can scan them and you can get to the GitHub repository I hope it is

12:57.480 --> 13:05.920
large enough and also if you want if you want to get to the beam repository this

13:05.920 --> 13:20.400
is the QR code and the problem with aggregated data is still that with a

13:20.900 --> 13:30.460
search narrow enough it could be deduced in which store in which database or in

13:30.460 --> 13:40.260
which Biobank samples or data about a certain patient are stored so we need to

13:40.260 --> 13:47.580
offer a similar level of privacy to the patients who are supposed to consent

13:47.800 --> 13:52.720
they are more likely to consent to having their samples and their data

13:52.720 --> 14:00.280
available if they know that their level of privacy is the same if they are in a

14:00.280 --> 14:06.920
Biobank and if they are not in a Biobank because we obfuscate the data enough we

14:06.920 --> 14:15.840
add a small number and we round it up I'm gonna mention why K anonymity means

14:16.060 --> 14:24.940
that for each set of parameters there would be at least K patients for whom

14:24.940 --> 14:34.060
they the search would return results but that's still not enough because we can

14:34.060 --> 14:44.380
we have some rare diagnosis we can narrow the age range enough so that we

14:44.400 --> 14:53.520
could have searches return only one patient and that's why we had to do this we

14:53.520 --> 15:00.040
use a Laplace distribution with certain parameters we take a random value from

15:00.040 --> 15:09.640
the distribution we add it to every count in all those counts in all those

15:09.900 --> 15:20.460
stratifiers we get for example for each diagnosis for each sample type and this

15:20.460 --> 15:27.640
shows how depending on the values we can lower the privacy but we can make the

15:27.640 --> 15:38.460
data more usable so here we would get more higher values with B which is 0.1

15:38.480 --> 15:46.680
and here we get more lower values but values that are closer to the true state

15:46.680 --> 15:57.840
of the database are actually more usable privacy budget is something that

15:57.840 --> 16:03.520
everybody has to decide for themselves but sensitivity depends on what is being

16:03.660 --> 16:14.700
obfuscated it is the number of those resources per patient so if it's diagnosis

16:14.700 --> 16:21.540
then it's the number of diagnosis per patient if it's a samples then it's the

16:21.540 --> 16:32.140
average number of samples per patient so we are working with 10 and 3 and

16:32.920 --> 16:42.000
4 patients of course it is one patient per patient this is the library and it is

16:42.000 --> 16:50.600
a rust crate and we also made it Java library for our friends in Erlangen who

16:50.600 --> 17:00.040
use it in their Java projects it is highly configurable but I have included

17:00.660 --> 17:07.300
parameters that might be needed in medical informatics so of course epsilon

17:07.300 --> 17:14.260
and delta I mentioned before but also what to do with values under 10 we round

17:14.260 --> 17:20.500
them to 10 some might want to round them down to 0 or they can be obfuscated in

17:20.500 --> 17:28.180
the usual way also for zeros we have chosen not to obfuscate them that is

17:28.240 --> 17:36.040
because after the search there comes another process the researchers select

17:36.040 --> 17:43.040
the biobanks they want to negotiate with and then use the tool which is called

17:43.040 --> 17:49.360
negotiator which was made by our friends in Czechia and in the negotiator

17:49.740 --> 17:58.940
they describe the research they intend to use and in the biobank the head of the

17:58.940 --> 18:05.340
biobank or whoever is tasked with it but in any case real humans decide who is

18:05.340 --> 18:11.540
going to get those samples because samples are very valuable and once they

18:11.540 --> 18:17.780
used up you don't have them anymore and it could be last sample for a combination

18:17.840 --> 18:27.040
of diagnosis and certain sample type certain genetic markers especially so

18:27.040 --> 18:36.880
we didn't want for those biobanks that really have zero values to okay that's

18:36.880 --> 18:45.400
it we didn't want them to border people in biobanks so all our code is open

18:45.420 --> 18:55.060
source you can scan this and you are going to then get to our organization

18:55.060 --> 19:04.780
on github you can look at our other also software and if you want to join us

19:04.780 --> 19:11.300
live in beautiful Heidelberg help cancer research then scan this this is a job

19:11.320 --> 19:17.320
posting just please don't be don't the fact that German languages mention

19:17.320 --> 19:24.440
prevent you from applying because my German is still not good enough and it

19:24.440 --> 19:29.800
is not a requirement really you will be asked to learn German but the company

19:29.800 --> 19:34.120
pays for it so thank you

19:41.300 --> 19:43.360
you
