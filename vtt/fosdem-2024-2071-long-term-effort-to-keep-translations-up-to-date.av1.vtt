WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.120
Okay, can I start now?

00:29.120 --> 00:34.120
Okay, sorry for the delay.

00:34.120 --> 00:55.120
So, I will try to present about how Indonesian teams doing translation for several transition projects I have involved with.

00:55.120 --> 01:01.120
Okay, this start from one project.

01:01.120 --> 01:08.120
I mean, I have the calculate, I have create statistic from one project.

01:08.120 --> 01:31.120
And then I try to add other project that I have greatly miscalculate the effort need to do the statistic.

01:31.120 --> 01:43.120
But you will see how difficult, maybe because I'm not skilled enough to create the statistic long term one.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.120
Maybe some of you can help me.

01:46.120 --> 02:04.120
So, this is the start. Why we Indonesian team doing translation? Because in Indonesia we have around 276 million people there.

02:04.120 --> 02:18.120
And from this many people we have several major languages. Actually we have more than 1000 languages, especially here.

02:18.120 --> 02:30.120
Every, every, what do you call, every small density, we call in Indonesia is Desa, Kampong.

02:30.120 --> 02:42.120
Village, yes, village. Every village has their own languages. But do we really need to support or translate to everything? No.

02:42.120 --> 02:53.120
So, at least we need to consider that to translate in this big six, one, two, three, four, five, six languages.

02:53.120 --> 03:00.120
But I, myself, I only fluent in Indonesian and Japanese, so I cannot help the other languages.

03:00.120 --> 03:13.120
So, my, my, my, I try to, okay, let's start with one language that you say, used by the most of people here.

03:13.120 --> 03:24.120
So, so we can, we can start doing something then can be quickly used by many people.

03:24.120 --> 03:36.120
Okay. So, then in my talk I will compare about the Bravis, GNOME and Ubuntu. Why three of them?

03:36.120 --> 03:49.120
Because I thought they have sufficient data to create a long time historical data.

03:49.120 --> 03:56.120
I thought, but let me see how difficult it is to, to extract this.

03:56.120 --> 04:06.120
The other thing that, that three of them has periodic release schedule, good release schedule.

04:06.120 --> 04:17.120
For instance, LibreOffice is in February right now. I think last year they, they released in March and September.

04:18.120 --> 04:23.120
But I think starting this year, February and September.

04:23.120 --> 04:33.120
And then GNOME, GNOME usually a little later than, than LibreOffice.

04:33.120 --> 04:45.120
They also release two times each year. Also Ubuntu, Ubuntu you can see from the version numbering.

04:45.120 --> 05:14.120
Something 04, something 10. So every, every April and October Ubuntu release the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the platform to, to the translation for current one.

05:15.120 --> 05:30.120
They have very detailed, very good statistic. But if you want to see the previous version, especially the version mentioned that maybe it's already out of support or something.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.120
It's, it's not easy.

05:34.120 --> 05:45.120
So with that in mind, I plan to compare how many string changes in its release.

05:47.120 --> 05:54.120
Is it easy to get this kind of data? How many string changes in its release?

05:54.120 --> 06:23.120
It's difficult. Why, why is it important? Why is it important that, that we translator need to know how many string or how many words need, because we need to, to have size to, to, to try to guess how many, how many days, how many days, how many days.

06:24.120 --> 06:29.120
How many hours we need, we need to, to spend to do, to do this translation.

06:30.120 --> 06:48.120
I think, I think it, it, it will be helpful for, for every project that they can, can create that kind of data extract to prepare those transient themes.

06:49.120 --> 07:10.120
But how far translation for instance, you can, you can use, usually you can use percentage. Some projects use the percentage to, to filter out all this, this language translation is definitely include into release.

07:10.120 --> 07:19.120
Maybe less than a certain percent is, is like, like the mother most, it's beta version or something.

07:20.120 --> 07:41.120
So, again, for current version, this number is easily, ah, fine out. But, but for past releases, yeah, you need to, ah, I don't know.

07:42.120 --> 07:49.120
Some, some, some platform maybe still have the data, the other now.

07:50.120 --> 07:58.120
And the other thing is, I want to, how, how, who did this translation?

07:59.120 --> 08:13.120
For, for instance, in, in, in my teams, ah, in, in this project, I have, ah, let's say 10 members and this project 5 members, who really do the, the nation?

08:13.120 --> 08:32.120
Not all platform can provide that, that kind of data. But GNOME, ah, because the workflow is using, ah, the whole file, download, ah, claim to be translated, then upload.

08:32.120 --> 08:39.120
So, so it is quite, ah, obvious who doing what kind of translation.

08:40.120 --> 08:44.120
Okay, so let's see. LibreOffice.

08:45.120 --> 08:49.120
Right now, the, the main platform is, we have played.

08:51.120 --> 09:08.120
It has powerful search facility. Too many options. It's quite difficult to, to get, ah, ah, the, the correct, correct query to, to, to, to, ah, convey my, my need to, to extract.

09:09.120 --> 09:26.120
Ah, data I need. It also has, we have played API. Maybe I'm, I'm old school, never use API, so when I try, so many data, so many options, how to, how to create the correct API to, ah, this.

09:26.120 --> 09:39.120
So, actually, we have played, ah, it's good, but, but, need, need time. I'm not sure, ah, where, where to, who, who, who has, ah, access, ah, create something from their API.

09:40.120 --> 09:43.120
I, I want to learn from him or her or something.

09:44.120 --> 09:58.120
Yeah, the other thing that, ah, from the weblet, ah, they create a crown, they create, ah, ah, schedule job to push from this, transition platform into the main repository, kit repository.

09:59.120 --> 10:13.120
So, actually, ah, I can choose between, ah, source of data, data source. Do I want to take from weblet directly or from the git repo?

10:14.120 --> 10:34.120
I tried to access the git repo also. For instance, ah, ah, I, I get, I create a clone and then, ah, change to a certain release and then, ah, there is a git repo for, for Indonesian translation.

10:34.120 --> 11:03.120
So, from the directory, I try to list all of commits. From there, I can try to see how many, ah, line changes. Who do commits, but actually, when web, ah, when someone doing translation in, in web,

11:04.120 --> 11:23.120
from weblet, the data stop in, in weblet because commit from weblet to the, the git is done by some special, ah, special account, not the initial translator.

11:23.120 --> 11:37.120
So, so, there is data missing there. If we, we, ah, take from git commits, but, ah, some other details, it's good.

11:38.120 --> 11:56.120
And actually, the, the data I, I can present here came from way back machine and from my wiki because I, I, I maintain a wiki to, to maintain. I, I, and maybe 20, 30 translation projects to Indonesia.

11:57.120 --> 12:10.120
So, so many. So, I, I don't want to make a bookmark. My wiki is my bookmark for translation. So, this is the result. This is the latest status.

12:11.120 --> 12:33.120
The office. You see that, ah, UI only 99% of, ah, ah, finished. Only a few, this, this few strings not, not here. It's because we, we are not, not sure how to translate.

12:34.120 --> 12:49.120
This is missing context. Now, but, but this one is very bad. Help 70% and even for the newest release, less than 70%.

12:50.120 --> 13:11.120
UI for this, ah, ah, two, ah, ah, last four years. So, any, ah, between, between releases is, is, is six months. So, this four years. Relatively, almost 100%.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.120
That for help.

13:17.120 --> 13:24.120
So, a French version 70, 7.0. We have 3,000 strings.

13:25.120 --> 13:31.120
And right now, ah, 18,000.

13:32.120 --> 13:47.120
Untranslated. We, we have a good, good, ah, result when in version 6.2, UI and help for admission 100% translated.

13:48.120 --> 14:03.120
We, ah, that can happen because we, we did, ah, translation spring, ah, two or three days and how many people, maybe 30 people or something.

14:04.120 --> 14:17.120
Going together, boom, zero, untranslated. That unknown quality.

14:18.120 --> 14:27.120
Because, because they, they, they start transit only for, for that, for that occasion. Yeah, we, we tried it.

14:27.120 --> 14:35.120
Oh, so this time we tried to, to, ah, quantity, not quality. So, let's try.

14:35.120 --> 14:41.120
But after that, we, we don't have, ah, they are, they are only involved in, in, in that occasion.

14:42.120 --> 14:50.120
After that, ah, the long-term translator do not have enough energy to continue help.

14:50.120 --> 14:57.120
I, I, I sometimes try to, ah, maybe 10 or 20, 20 string to translate.

14:57.120 --> 15:08.120
Why? Because if UI, one string usually consists of maybe from one word to five, maybe 10, the longest one.

15:09.120 --> 15:19.120
But help string. One string consists of 30 words, 40 words, 50 words, ah, so long.

15:19.120 --> 15:26.120
So, ah, ah, you cannot compare only, only a certain string. No, no, no.

15:26.120 --> 15:36.120
You need to see how many words that really, ah, show how large effort need to, to, to do them.

15:38.120 --> 15:43.120
Okay. So, who did? Actually, only two.

15:43.120 --> 15:57.120
These three, I think, they involved in updating the, the source, not, not doing the translation, but, but they search, ah, ah, giving this data.

15:57.120 --> 16:02.120
Okay. That's LibreOffice. And then, let's see GNOME.

16:03.120 --> 16:15.120
These are the latest. You can see GNOME, GNOME, ah, divide their many modules into several categories.

16:15.120 --> 16:29.120
What we need to, ah, translate is usually, ah, we prioritize translation in this one, user interface for this, this group.

16:30.120 --> 16:35.120
But other groups usually, we, we, for instance, GIM and FRAMPS.

16:35.120 --> 16:42.120
This, this, ah, I never touch those for maybe, ah, for many years.

16:42.120 --> 16:52.120
Because not every project are easy to be translated.

16:53.120 --> 16:59.120
Especially if, for GIM is, ah, image editor.

16:59.120 --> 17:08.120
I'm not familiar about the terms used in, in this, this, ah, this community.

17:08.120 --> 17:13.120
What kind of translation usually use?

17:13.120 --> 17:33.120
So, so I, I, I, I, I don't have enough time to consult with, with, ah, what we call, ah, SME, subject matter expert on image processing, image editor.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.120
So, I didn't do that.

17:35.120 --> 17:47.120
But other, ah, the, ah, UI is good. Help, ah, still some effort to do that, but, but not quite good.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.120
Yeah. This is the statistic.

17:51.120 --> 17:59.120
Since version 3.6, GNOME, Indonesian translation is almost always 100%.

18:00.120 --> 18:04.120
And help getting better.

18:07.120 --> 18:13.120
This period I have too much free time. So, I do many, many translations.

18:13.120 --> 18:17.120
And then after that, ah, VC time.

18:18.120 --> 18:29.120
This how many commits? This to, to, to calculate who did commit?

18:29.120 --> 18:33.120
Actually only two people here.

18:34.120 --> 18:48.120
Two people can, can maintain that kind of, ah, percentage quality for how many years?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.120
I don't remember. Maybe 10 more.

18:50.120 --> 19:00.120
I started as a GNOME Indonesian Transition Connector in 2010.

19:01.120 --> 19:08.120
I offer many people, would you replace me and, and when come forward?

19:08.120 --> 19:12.120
Nothing special with translation coordinator.

19:12.120 --> 19:16.120
It's because no one else want to do that.

19:16.120 --> 19:20.120
Okay. Ubuntu is the most difficult one.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.120
Yeah. You see here?

19:22.120 --> 19:33.120
I'm translating 200,000. So much. Why?

19:33.120 --> 19:39.120
Because many of them GCC. Do you want GCC to be translated?

19:39.120 --> 19:44.120
Why? Do you want GDB to be translated?

19:45.120 --> 19:59.120
Exhib, library. So, so, so, so, because you want to use that, ah, what was the preference?

19:59.120 --> 20:03.120
Trans, ah, what, what is the?

20:03.120 --> 20:04.120
Transfects.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.120
Transfects, eh?

20:06.120 --> 20:13.120
They, they do not create a subcategory. So, so, it's quite misleading.

20:13.120 --> 20:18.120
How, how good Indonesian was translated into Ubuntu.

20:18.120 --> 20:27.120
How good, for any language is, ah, how good translated into this, any language.

20:27.120 --> 20:43.120
Okay. Ah, I think that's the statistic that, statistic analyzer, someone said it.

20:43.120 --> 20:46.120
So, so, why, why, why I care about this?

20:46.120 --> 20:55.120
Because I hope that if some other team can, can recreate the, the effort to, to do that,

20:55.120 --> 21:09.120
that, maybe they can use that for create a funding proposal or maybe, ah, can be used to plan transition phase,

21:09.120 --> 21:22.120
ah, spring, need for many people, ah, how, how long and target to can, can be, ah, can finish how many strings.

21:22.120 --> 21:32.120
It's, it's, it's rather difficult to, to use data from one language into others, yeah.

21:32.120 --> 21:41.120
But, but at least we can have, ah, approximation.

21:41.120 --> 21:47.120
Okay. I think that's my thought. Any question?

21:47.120 --> 21:59.120
Good. Ah, sorry, yes.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.120
Yes.

22:02.120 --> 22:12.120
Because we are all from Asian, right? And, ah, I'm not very familiar with the Indonesian, but I know you did a lot of translation work for upstream like Ubuntu.

22:12.120 --> 22:21.120
Okay. Ah, if I, if I come back to China, I want to do, okay, I want to do some translation for the upstream, ah, over assistance.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.120
So, ah, how can I solve it?

22:24.120 --> 22:29.120
Sorry. Sorry. How can you start?

22:29.120 --> 22:37.120
Ah, sorry, ah, what kind of language do you, Chinese?

22:37.120 --> 22:47.120
Because, ah, as, as far as I know, in Ubuntu, they, they have traditional Chinese and the other one.

22:47.120 --> 22:55.120
So, so, so you just joined those, those existing team and start translating. I think it's, it's quite, quite easy.

22:55.120 --> 23:09.120
I think, ah, I'm not sure what is the number, but, but it's already has a team, already has many translators, but you can join them and then, then continue.

23:09.120 --> 23:18.120
I think for a language that has not been started, it's rather difficult, but, but for Chinese, I think.

23:18.120 --> 23:26.120
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Ubuntu, Ubuntu is, is, is quite established, I think, for the Chinese translation.

23:26.120 --> 23:42.120
For different projects, ah, you need to check, they, they, they have different, different way to, to do translation, different way to, different platform, different, different.

23:42.120 --> 23:58.120
So, for instance, ah, like my, my three example, GNOME, LibreOffice and Ubuntu, different platform, different, ah, algorithm, process, different process.

23:58.120 --> 24:10.120
GNOME, they, they need to take the, the whole file, translation file, doing translation locally in your computer and then upload back to the system.

24:10.120 --> 24:26.120
The other one, Ubuntu and LibreOffice, you can do two way, you can do translation online or, or you can download the file, translate locally, upload back.

24:29.120 --> 24:35.120
Okay, other question? No? Ah, yes.

24:35.120 --> 24:56.120
Because in the beginning you mentioned you have had some problems using the WebLay API for your projects. How many projects, different languages actually do you use within the WebLay process? Six, I think, right? Six different Indonesian languages, local languages?

24:56.120 --> 25:00.120
No, no, no, no, I only, only one main Indonesian.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.120
So it's only one project?

25:03.120 --> 25:05.120
Yeah, code name ID.

25:08.120 --> 25:12.120
And what, what, especially are problems with the API?

25:12.120 --> 25:23.120
Ah, for instance, ah, ah, if I want to see, ah, which one?

25:23.120 --> 25:30.120
How, how many strings left? Not translated yet.

25:30.120 --> 25:36.120
For help. This version, help.

25:36.120 --> 26:03.120
API can only, ah, need, need, need to be, need to be expressed with, ah, URL and then, ah, main function and then project name, project name is, ah, they have a list of, ah,

26:06.120 --> 26:13.120
UI master, UI version, ah, certain, and then help, master, help.

26:13.120 --> 26:24.120
So, that's the project name. And then the, the next component is, what do you call? Module or something?

26:24.120 --> 26:35.120
Module, ah, from, from this, this one, one project name, they has 200 modules or something.

26:35.120 --> 26:51.120
And then slash language, ID. Ah, so, ah, it says, I need to, I need to iterate all those things and create the, the summary to add and then something.

26:51.120 --> 26:57.120
It's, ah, quite difficult for me.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.120
So, it's more an organizational problem?

26:59.120 --> 27:10.120
Yeah, yeah. So, so, maybe because, because I don't understand enough the API, so, so my, my, my approach is not efficient enough.

27:10.120 --> 27:20.120
So, that's, that's why I, I need to consult or discuss with whoever, ah, more familiar with this, this API, that API.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.120
Okay. No more questions. Thank you.
