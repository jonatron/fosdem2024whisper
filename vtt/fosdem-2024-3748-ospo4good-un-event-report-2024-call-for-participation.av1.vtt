00:00.000 --> 00:13.200
Hello everyone. How was everyone doing today? Good. Alright. Little energy is always helpful.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.320
This is an interactive talk. Please feel free to stop me at any time and ask questions.

00:17.320 --> 00:22.920
There's no dumb questions and I'm happy to answer any questions at all. With that said,

00:22.920 --> 00:29.320
I'm Jacob Green. I'm from Ospo Plus Plus. Does everyone know what an Ospo is? Okay.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.320
Nope. Just for those that don't, it's an open source program office or an open source program

00:35.320 --> 00:41.680
organization. It ends up being the epicenter of open source for an organization. Whether that

00:41.680 --> 00:47.920
organization is a company, an industry, a government from a city to a nation state government,

00:47.920 --> 00:54.520
as we've heard earlier. Germany now has an Ospo. Yay. We have university Ospos now and hopefully

00:54.520 --> 01:01.000
we're going to get some NGO Ospos coming up soon. I'm here to ask you to come to a party.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.920
Kind of like FOSTA, but we're throwing a party at the United Nations. On June 9th and 10th,

01:08.920 --> 01:15.760
we have a huge room available for 800 people and we want to bring together the entirety of the

01:15.760 --> 01:25.120
open source community, including governments, universities, NGOs, and industry. But not just

01:25.120 --> 01:30.120
from Europe, not just from North America, we want to bring people together from all over the globe.

01:30.120 --> 01:40.640
We held this event last year in June, June 20th, I think. We had about 80 people. This time we're

01:40.640 --> 01:50.000
going for 800 people. This is the report that we came out of that event. Ospos for good, building

01:50.000 --> 01:59.320
cooperative digital infrastructure. We're going to be hoping for this report to come out next year,

01:59.320 --> 02:05.200
but that all depends on your participation. A little bit of history about how this came to be.

02:06.160 --> 02:15.760
We held this event, I'm from Baltimore, the city of Baltimore. You have seen the wire? We have

02:15.760 --> 02:23.040
some challenges. This is why we're in the public code dev room here. We want to cooperate with

02:23.040 --> 02:27.720
you as a city of Baltimore, as a representative, not of the official city of Baltimore, but just as

02:27.720 --> 02:33.360
a resident looking to cooperate with you. We need infrastructure to do it. We want to run your code

02:33.520 --> 02:39.160
and I want anything that's developed in Baltimore to help in your cities. The swap going back and

02:39.160 --> 02:45.000
forth between you all. We've been working with the United Nations, the European Commission.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.240
There's a European Commission Ospo Network now of governments. We have about 13 of them. We have

02:52.240 --> 02:57.480
about 12 university Ospos now in the US. We're starting to branch out these Ospos everywhere.

02:58.440 --> 03:06.000
Now we're going to need to start cooperating. On November 21st of this year, at the European

03:06.000 --> 03:13.360
Commission Open Source Awards, the UN Secretary General's envoy on technology, Mr. Amadeep

03:13.360 --> 03:21.800
Gill, said some remarkable words. He equated the Ospo as soft infrastructure, just as important as

03:22.320 --> 03:28.040
hard infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, etc. The Ospo itself is an organizational construct,

03:28.040 --> 03:35.560
like the Office of the CTO. He equated it to helping us to solve challenges, those challenges

03:35.560 --> 03:44.360
being helping to localize and advance the SDGs, helping to get cross-border solutions in Europe

03:44.360 --> 03:50.600
and interoperability, which is very important for digital sovereignty, to helping achieve AI

03:50.760 --> 03:57.520
governance and working with AI. You in this room could think of a bunch of other policy issues

03:57.520 --> 04:05.040
that might be used by an organizational construct that's about cooperation. He took it a step

04:05.040 --> 04:13.160
further and he called for the cooperation between these Ospos. He said, and I'm going to hopefully

04:13.320 --> 04:22.680
screw this up. We need to start connecting Baltimore, Buenos Aires, Bangalore to Barcelona.

04:22.680 --> 04:30.840
Four B cities, so we're looking for more B cities. We have Berlin coming up hopefully next.

04:30.840 --> 04:37.560
Boston hopefully is coming up soon after that. If you're in Berlin, happened to be on March 5th

04:37.560 --> 04:43.560
for FOS backstage. We have a Berlin Breakfast Club that's been going on. The Berlin City Ospo

04:43.560 --> 04:49.720
will be there talking and answering your questions. The event we're going to do now

04:50.600 --> 04:57.880
was announced yesterday at the Open Forum Europe Policy Summit. Both the UN Secretary of General

04:57.880 --> 05:04.360
Technology Envoy, again called and opened up, made the announcement for this event. The UN OICT,

05:04.360 --> 05:13.960
which is like the office of the CIO, also enforced and asked people to come. I would like your help

05:13.960 --> 05:21.400
in making this possible. What does that mean by help? Well, we would love your help in making sure

05:21.400 --> 05:27.080
that it's a global event. So one, I'm looking for attendance. We would love for everyone here

05:27.080 --> 05:33.240
to come, whether you're a developer, a community manager, you're a policy wonk, you're in government,

05:33.880 --> 05:42.440
or you're looking to use open source to achieve policy missions. Various NGOs that you would think

05:42.440 --> 05:46.840
about as not having to do with open source are actually heavily involved in using open source

05:46.840 --> 05:53.240
to achieve their policy outcomes. We're looking for attendees. Second, we're looking for those

05:53.240 --> 05:59.320
attendees to come as groups, as a delegation, you might say, because one of the things we were

05:59.720 --> 06:06.120
to happen after you leave the event is for you to work on building cooperative infrastructure

06:06.120 --> 06:13.800
in your own city, your own government, your own NGO, your own university. Third, we're looking for,

06:13.800 --> 06:20.200
as I said, the attendees to be coming from all over the world. So that means industry from all

06:20.200 --> 06:25.080
over the world, universities from all over the world, cities from all over the world, world

06:25.080 --> 06:30.760
governments from all over the world, and NGOs from all over the world. I can't pull that off

06:30.760 --> 06:37.800
myself. My organizing team can't pull that off themselves. We need your help in that. So attend,

06:39.240 --> 06:47.240
help drive her participation, and then come have a good time. The United Nations is an amazing

06:47.240 --> 06:53.160
place if you have not visited. It was awe-inspiring last year when we went, and I would like for the

06:53.160 --> 06:58.520
open-source community for us to come together there if possible. We're making this a yearly event.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.840
I'm opening the floor now to questions.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.480
Questions? Okay.

07:11.400 --> 07:17.640
So, also, how do we get our governments involved? Because we need to have governments

07:18.600 --> 07:26.120
engaged with us, the members of the United Nations. Any thoughts on how beyond the city of Baltimore

07:26.120 --> 07:32.120
you're going to, like any hope of giving the White House to show up? Yes. We're going to show up?

07:32.120 --> 07:38.920
I don't know yet. Can I repeat the question? How do we get our, how the question was,

07:38.920 --> 07:44.040
how do we get our governments to show up? One, we have examples now. When I first started

07:44.120 --> 07:49.880
evangelizing hospitals around, we didn't have examples. Now we have 12 European governments

07:49.880 --> 07:55.880
formed in a network together. That network was just approved in European budget legislation

07:55.880 --> 08:01.960
called FOSEPs 2. So now you have a point of contact to point your government to, to say,

08:01.960 --> 08:08.280
you're not alone. Second, we can connect them to the United Nations itself who is looking to

08:08.280 --> 08:12.680
bring this together. The ITU, the International Telecommunications Group, just announced a

08:12.680 --> 08:17.320
program for governmental OSPOs that they're, they're running. So it's no longer a theoretical

08:17.320 --> 08:22.760
thing. We now have programs starting up for OSPOs for good and just OSPOs and government in general.

08:23.800 --> 08:33.560
So please reach out to myself, jakeupatospoplusplus.org, Yan Oralena. Thank you.
