WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.240
Thank you everyone for joining Solate in the first day of FOSDEN.

00:16.240 --> 00:18.240
Quick introduction before we start.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.640
My name is Thierry Carreze.

00:19.640 --> 00:25.000
I'm the general manager for the Open Infrastructure Foundation, which was previously known as

00:25.000 --> 00:26.880
the OpenStack Foundation.

00:26.880 --> 00:32.080
I was also elected to the board of the Open Source Initiative, and I'm serving as its

00:32.080 --> 00:34.280
vice chair right now.

00:34.280 --> 00:39.840
And as part of those activities, I've been working on the draft response for the OSI

00:39.840 --> 00:46.040
on the release of a new license called a Functional Source License.

00:46.040 --> 00:53.040
And as part of that, I really reflected back on some of the licensing that has been happening

00:53.040 --> 00:59.440
over the past few years, and recently at Ashicorp, I don't know if you're familiar

00:59.440 --> 01:06.280
with that probably, a very well-known previously open source company that decided to switch

01:06.280 --> 01:13.080
licensing for products like Terraform or Vault, and therefore creating some tension in the

01:13.080 --> 01:14.440
ecosystem.

01:14.440 --> 01:21.560
So looking at those critically, it just occurred to me that single vendor open source is the

01:21.560 --> 01:23.800
new proprietary.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.160
And this talk will get into details why I think that way.

01:27.160 --> 01:31.320
And I realize this might be a controversial opinion.

01:31.320 --> 01:34.000
I realize that some people will disagree with me.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.640
I realize that I will probably make some enemies out of this.

01:38.640 --> 01:45.400
But I think it's an important way of looking at it, and it might be a bit of an extreme

01:45.400 --> 01:47.480
characterization.

01:47.480 --> 01:52.600
The rant will be very short so that we have plenty of time at the end for you to engage

01:52.600 --> 01:57.960
in an open discussion and hopefully prove me wrong before I do it again.

01:57.960 --> 02:04.280
So all this real licensing that we've been hearing recently, hello.

02:04.280 --> 02:12.880
All the real licensing that we've been hearing about recently is all built on the same narrative

02:12.880 --> 02:15.160
around open source.

02:15.160 --> 02:16.600
And the story is very well known.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.200
It starts like this.

02:20.200 --> 02:27.320
At the dawn of the computer age, I think some people will get in at the end of the rant.

02:27.320 --> 02:30.880
At the dawn of the computer age, software was not considered very valuable.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.000
It was all about the hardware.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.120
And the people using those machines would actually develop the software that would run

02:38.120 --> 02:42.600
on those hardware as a commons and share it relatively freely.

02:42.600 --> 02:48.400
And it's with the advent of the 80s and the rise of the PC that made hardware a lot more

02:48.400 --> 02:52.680
like a commodity and with it made the software much more valuable.

02:52.680 --> 02:58.240
And that's when software companies like Microsoft were created and with it the proprietary software

02:58.240 --> 02:59.440
approach.

02:59.440 --> 03:05.400
The proprietary software approach is when a single entity owns the software that is produced

03:05.400 --> 03:11.640
and intends to capture all value thanks to restrictive licensing conditions.

03:11.640 --> 03:18.760
And we've seen the 90s after that that really led to a lot of excesses, especially as Microsoft

03:18.760 --> 03:23.680
decided to exploit that dominant position that they had.

03:23.680 --> 03:29.640
And openly developed open source really grew in the 90s in reaction to this evil proprietary

03:29.640 --> 03:30.640
approach.

03:30.640 --> 03:36.880
It predates obviously that period, but that's really when it really caught on.

03:36.880 --> 03:44.200
In that model, software is produced as a commons by a community of participants of organizations

03:44.200 --> 03:50.680
of individuals openly collaborating and the value is shared across the participants in

03:50.680 --> 03:52.400
that ecosystem.

03:52.400 --> 03:57.580
And this is all made possible thanks to free and open source licenses which guarantee a

03:57.580 --> 04:04.000
number of freedoms including the freedom to build on it without asking for permission

04:04.000 --> 04:09.600
and the freedom to use it for any purpose including making money.

04:09.600 --> 04:15.280
And in the next 20 years, really open source got overwhelmingly popular and it unleashed

04:15.280 --> 04:18.040
a software revolution.

04:18.040 --> 04:24.640
And those that have been around for that time measure how dramatic that change was.

04:24.640 --> 04:30.960
A recent study estimated that the demand side value of open source software today is nearly

04:30.960 --> 04:33.880
$9 trillion.

04:33.880 --> 04:39.680
It is estimated to be part of 96% of the software that is run.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.880
Like 96% of software contains an open source component.

04:42.880 --> 04:51.200
And it would be very hard to develop new software today without using open source.

04:51.200 --> 04:57.360
And so like everyone else, the companies that produce software massively adopted open source.

04:57.360 --> 05:02.960
They would develop in-house but release the end product under an open source license.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.800
And we call that single vendor open source.

05:06.800 --> 05:12.480
And with internet becoming more ubiquitous, some turn to a software as a service model

05:12.480 --> 05:17.520
and we saw the rise of the cloud and without the rise of the hyperscaler clouds.

05:17.520 --> 05:23.800
And some of those hyperscalers would run open source software at scale which would be seen

05:23.800 --> 05:28.960
as unfair competition by those open source software companies that were using this software

05:28.960 --> 05:31.120
as a service model.

05:31.120 --> 05:37.720
And that brings us to today where those companies say that while open source is great to get

05:37.720 --> 05:42.800
that initial visibility, it's bad for monetization.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.400
It's bad for business.

05:44.400 --> 05:49.920
And so if it's not business friendly, we need to invent new licenses, you know, to continue

05:49.920 --> 05:55.200
defending open source and especially against this evil proprietary software.

05:55.200 --> 06:01.000
And you know, with those licenses, we continue to give you access to the code for free.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.040
So you know, what's not to love.

06:03.040 --> 06:08.640
And in some cases, the license will even revert to an open source license after some time.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.120
Why do you hate us, Thierry?

06:11.120 --> 06:13.320
And I'll explain why.

06:13.320 --> 06:19.240
I think this narrative is built on three misconceptions, especially the last part, which this talk

06:19.240 --> 06:21.040
is going to deconstruct.

06:21.040 --> 06:27.960
The first one is that open source is great because you don't have to pay for it.

06:27.960 --> 06:35.080
The second one is that single vendor open source is the reasonable way to do open source.

06:35.080 --> 06:40.320
And the third one, interestingly, is that proprietary software is evil.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.120
So let's go one by one.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.800
The first one, open source is great because you don't have to pay for it.

06:45.800 --> 06:50.120
I mean, we are the ones writing the software and we continue to give it to you for free.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.120
Like why do you not happy with that?

06:53.120 --> 06:55.680
We just need to preserve our business interests, you know.

06:55.680 --> 07:00.480
So, well, the problem is open source is not great because you don't have to pay for it.

07:00.480 --> 07:04.640
Open source is great because everyone is free to use it.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.080
And that's a subtle distinction.

07:06.080 --> 07:07.080
I realize that.

07:07.080 --> 07:13.520
I mean, cost is a factor, but this goes way beyond monetary concerns, monetary barriers.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.800
What matters is not having to ask for permission.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.360
Just use it.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.840
Anyone, anywhere for anything.

07:21.840 --> 07:25.920
Not just the ones with deep pockets, not just the ones in certain geographies.

07:25.920 --> 07:31.800
And this really, this permissionless innovation that enabled a ton of valuable software itself

07:31.800 --> 07:37.360
often released as open source, which fed into that virtual cycle.

07:37.360 --> 07:43.080
Those non-compete licenses that they propose restrict you from doing anything with the software

07:43.120 --> 07:47.560
that the company disagrees with or considers competition.

07:47.560 --> 07:53.080
And they use pretty vague and untested legal terms and the end result is that it ends this

07:53.080 --> 07:54.960
permissionless innovation.

07:54.960 --> 07:59.040
You can no longer just use it.

07:59.040 --> 08:03.240
The second misconception is that single vendor open source is the reasonable way to do open

08:03.240 --> 08:06.520
source and resist evil proprietary software.

08:06.520 --> 08:11.320
I mean, we are the self-proclaimed commercial open source companies.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.440
We are the business conscious open source folks.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.480
You should follow our model, et cetera.

08:15.480 --> 08:20.840
Well, let's go back to the definition of proprietary that I used earlier.

08:20.840 --> 08:27.720
Single entity owns the software that is produced and intends to capture all value derived from

08:27.720 --> 08:31.040
it thanks to restrictive licensing conditions.

08:31.040 --> 08:36.280
Well, if you take that definition, single vendor open source companies are still doing

08:36.280 --> 08:38.920
what is essentially proprietary software.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.040
I mean, they will disagree, obviously.

08:42.040 --> 08:47.520
But they still consider the software being produced as their exclusive property and intend

08:47.520 --> 08:50.120
to capture all the value that derives from it.

08:50.120 --> 08:56.120
They aggregate copyright assignment so that they can change license anytime they want.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.280
So it's still proprietary.

08:57.280 --> 09:04.840
They just choose for now to release their software under an open source license.

09:04.840 --> 09:09.400
So single vendor open source is not the reasonable way to do open source and fight evil proprietary

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
software.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.840
It's actually just another way to do proprietary software.

09:13.840 --> 09:16.920
It's just a relicensing time bomb.

09:16.920 --> 09:20.280
And sure enough, a lot of those exploded over the past year.

09:20.280 --> 09:26.600
So the proprietary development model is moving back to restrictive licensing now in a very

09:26.600 --> 09:30.680
predictable attempt to capture incrementally more value.

09:30.680 --> 09:36.320
Now that was predictable if only we had seen single vendor open source as the temporary

09:36.320 --> 09:40.720
tactic of proprietary development that it is.

09:40.720 --> 09:44.400
And that it always was.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.720
The third one, proprietary is evil.

09:46.720 --> 09:51.480
Well, this whole story would not hold if we did not demonize proprietary software in

09:51.480 --> 09:56.480
the first place and opposed it to open source software.

09:56.480 --> 10:02.520
But as we've seen, you can be proprietary, have a proprietary development model, and do

10:02.520 --> 10:05.120
open source as a temporary tactic.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.320
So it's not open source versus proprietary.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.480
We need to shift that.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.560
It's actually more complex than that.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.840
You can represent it as a quadrant.

10:12.840 --> 10:18.160
On one axis you have open source licensing versus not open source licensing.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.280
That's pretty clear cut.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.320
The open source initiative defines it.

10:21.320 --> 10:24.240
It comes with a bunch of freedoms.

10:24.240 --> 10:28.200
And it ultimately enables that permissionless innovation that I talked about.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.240
Why do we have those freedoms?

10:30.240 --> 10:34.160
It's because they enable the permissionless innovation model that we all benefit from

10:34.160 --> 10:35.880
today.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.640
On the other axis you have the development model.

10:38.640 --> 10:43.800
It's either openly developed by your community that will share the value of the work or it

10:43.800 --> 10:47.360
will be developed by a single entity that will own it.

10:47.360 --> 10:53.160
And if you look at the traditional proprietary software, that's what I call restricted software.

10:53.160 --> 10:58.160
It's when you're using a non-open source license to impose some licensing conditions,

10:58.160 --> 11:03.960
especially to preserve your business model or to gain some other benefit.

11:03.960 --> 11:13.320
If you look at the open source side, depending on whether it's developed by a group of organizations

11:13.320 --> 11:19.280
as a commons or if it's developed by a single entity that retains all copyright aggregation,

11:19.280 --> 11:23.960
it's either openly developed open source or single vendor open source.

11:23.960 --> 11:31.400
And the issue here is that we're seeing movement from single vendor open source back to restricted

11:31.400 --> 11:33.040
software.

11:33.040 --> 11:38.920
And they hope that by doing that they will retain enough aura from their open source days

11:38.920 --> 11:45.320
to hide the fact that it's just restricted software and pretend to continue to be on

11:45.320 --> 11:49.720
the good guy's side and fight against the evil proprietary software.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.640
But proprietary software is not evil.

11:52.640 --> 11:56.200
The abuse of dominant position in the 90s was evil for sure.

11:56.200 --> 11:59.960
But the proprietary model itself is not evil.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.560
In my opinion it's just inferior.

12:03.560 --> 12:09.520
If you truly think that software developed by a diverse set of actors working in open

12:09.520 --> 12:14.320
collaboration is not better, you should definitely do proprietary development.

12:14.320 --> 12:15.600
That's fine.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.920
Just be honest about it.

12:18.920 --> 12:23.400
What's evil is really the lies and hypocrisy that we are seeing there.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.560
Doing proprietary while pretending to be open, that's evil.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.920
That's what we call open washing.

12:28.920 --> 12:33.600
Trying to dilute the meaning of open source by creating deceptively named licenses like

12:33.600 --> 12:38.920
common clothes or server side public license or business software license.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.840
That's evil.

12:40.840 --> 12:45.800
Switching licenses from under your community after having promised to be forever open source

12:45.800 --> 12:47.360
like Aishikop just did.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.480
That's evil.

12:49.480 --> 12:53.520
Being fitting from open source freedoms to build your software in the first place.

12:53.520 --> 12:57.440
And then denying that those freedoms actually have value.

12:57.440 --> 12:58.440
That's evil.

12:58.440 --> 13:04.600
So yeah, as a summary, and I thought I would leave a lot of time for engagement from the

13:04.600 --> 13:06.720
crowd so I want to make sure we have time.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.880
I want to leave you with three takeaways.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.760
Three actions.

13:10.760 --> 13:16.680
First, I think it's time for us to remind everyone that the permissionless innovation

13:16.680 --> 13:21.760
that we currently benefit from should not be taken for granted.

13:21.760 --> 13:27.480
It is a direct consequence of the prevalence of open source licensing as defined by the

13:27.480 --> 13:28.960
open source initiative.

13:28.960 --> 13:33.200
And it requires all of the open source freedoms including the freedom to use the software

13:33.200 --> 13:35.840
for any purpose.

13:35.840 --> 13:40.160
The second takeaway is that I think it's time for us to describe what a world where

13:40.160 --> 13:41.880
they win looks like.

13:41.880 --> 13:47.920
Because if their vision wins, if everyone adopted their approach, all the innovation

13:48.000 --> 13:53.120
that those open source freedoms allow to unleash would come to a halt.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.240
And we would quickly be back in the 80s.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.960
And I've lived through the 80s.

13:56.960 --> 13:57.960
You don't want to be there.

13:57.960 --> 14:02.840
Imagine a world where you have to ask your lawyers for permission before you use any

14:02.840 --> 14:06.680
library, any programming language.

14:06.680 --> 14:11.720
And they will say that after some time it reverts to open source license.

14:11.720 --> 14:17.040
After two, three years, four years, the license automatically transforms into an open source

14:17.120 --> 14:18.120
license.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.440
But that's a trap too.

14:19.440 --> 14:23.480
Like imagine a world where you have to run a buggy two-year-old version of the software

14:23.480 --> 14:27.160
with known vulnerabilities because that's the one that is open source.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.160
That's not just practical.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.840
Finally, takeaway number three.

14:31.840 --> 14:38.000
I think it's time for us to reassert the value of software developed in an open collaboration.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.720
Everything else is proprietary.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.320
Everything else is a relicensing time bomb.

14:44.320 --> 14:50.480
So beware of CLA's when they are not held by an openly governed non-profit.

14:50.480 --> 14:55.040
Beware of single vendor open source software because it's just a proprietary model that

14:55.040 --> 14:59.600
happens to temporarily use open source licensing.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.960
And they have lots of money, lots of resources to spread their very confusing message around

15:03.960 --> 15:04.960
openness.

15:04.960 --> 15:07.160
And we're clearly disorganized.

15:07.160 --> 15:12.600
So I think as a conclusion that it's time for us to all clearly say that single vendor

15:12.600 --> 15:14.280
is the new proprietary.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.280
Thank you.

15:16.280 --> 15:21.280
Ah, objections.

15:21.280 --> 15:35.080
No, actually my questions are answered in your notes.

15:35.080 --> 15:41.080
So I'm interested in having your notes if that's possible with the slides.

15:41.080 --> 15:48.920
So the short story about this talk is actually the text that I wrote for the OSI to answer

15:48.920 --> 15:50.520
the functional source license.

15:50.520 --> 15:57.800
It was deemed to be too extreme to be representative of the organization.

15:57.800 --> 16:01.240
And so we toned it down and changed it.

16:01.240 --> 16:05.480
But that's actually what made me have the idea that I should turn it into a rant that

16:05.480 --> 16:06.840
I would present.

16:06.840 --> 16:11.840
And first then is clearly the right crowd to try it.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.040
So you would publish the notes?

16:14.040 --> 16:17.840
Yes, basically I'll make a blog post that's basically the same speech.

16:17.840 --> 16:23.240
OK, I have a question.

16:23.240 --> 16:31.840
What if the code is even developed by one component but under a position of Linux foundation?

16:31.840 --> 16:33.840
There's happened many times.

16:33.840 --> 16:37.840
You can notice that it's quite common at this moment.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.840
I wouldn't call that proprietary.

16:40.840 --> 16:45.840
What makes the proprietary approach is not just that you have a single participant.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.840
It's that it's close to others to join.

16:47.840 --> 16:53.840
And I'm pretty sure in the case of a project under the Linux foundation where they have a major vendor,

16:53.840 --> 16:55.840
they would be happy to have someone else.

16:55.840 --> 17:04.840
And I'm pretty sure that they would not be able to unilaterally change the licensing conditions

17:04.840 --> 17:12.840
because the trademarks and copyrighted creation would belong to the Linux foundation and not to that single company.

17:12.840 --> 17:15.840
So I think it protects you.

17:15.840 --> 17:22.840
If by design it's a single entity but I don't think they have a lot of projects like that,

17:22.840 --> 17:24.840
then yes, there is a problem.

17:24.840 --> 17:33.840
If you are prevented from participating as an equal in an open collaboration, yes, then there is a problem.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.840
So a provocative question.

17:36.840 --> 17:39.840
Is the GPL...

17:39.840 --> 17:42.840
It doesn't allow you to do anything.

17:42.840 --> 17:47.840
You cannot choose to follow the GPL as invasive in that sense.

17:47.840 --> 17:56.840
In your definition, is it still free, software in the most direct sense or is it something in between?

17:56.840 --> 17:58.840
I mean, a GPL?

17:58.840 --> 17:59.840
No, the GPL.

17:59.840 --> 18:00.840
The GPL itself?

18:00.840 --> 18:03.840
No, it's totally embedding those freedoms.

18:03.840 --> 18:08.840
To me, it's clearly an open source license.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.840
Some would say the one, the open source license.

18:17.840 --> 18:25.840
The main difference between the GPL and the permissive licenses is how much of a function you want to have back into the contribution cycle.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.840
It's really what makes it slightly different.

18:28.840 --> 18:33.840
And depending on how much you think you will get contributions without it or with it,

18:33.840 --> 18:38.840
all the big projects they have that moment where they have to choose between permissive and copy-left licenses,

18:38.840 --> 18:40.840
it's all a bet on the future.

18:40.840 --> 18:47.840
If you think that your ecosystem is so big that you will get contributions anyway without forcing people to give back,

18:47.840 --> 18:51.840
it's actually better to have a wider funnel to get into your system.

18:51.840 --> 18:58.840
If you think your project is never going to be super big and you can use all the contributions you get,

18:58.840 --> 19:02.840
I think the GPL approach is better.

19:02.840 --> 19:07.840
So you said a couple of things that I found sort of interesting.

19:07.840 --> 19:17.840
So one is, I think the objection or the observation is that if you leave the control to commercial entities,

19:17.840 --> 19:24.840
they are going to be continually tempted to re-license it, de-license it, change the licensing.

19:24.840 --> 19:35.840
So are you advocating that one should try and get the licensing and, well, the copyright transferred to a notionally neutral entity?

19:36.840 --> 19:42.840
Because it doesn't, for me, it doesn't seem to be that having like GPL on the side of a license,

19:42.840 --> 19:49.840
if the copyright belongs to one of these companies, they can just say, okay, fine, we'll leave that on the side,

19:49.840 --> 19:51.840
but we'll keep doing stuff over here.

19:51.840 --> 19:57.840
So you either then focus the GPL community and everybody has to turn it with their own resources.

19:57.840 --> 20:02.840
So it doesn't seem that GPL provides the protection that you're suggesting.

20:02.840 --> 20:07.840
So I think it's more about the ownership that you're pointing at. Is that correct?

20:07.840 --> 20:20.840
Yes. I would say copyright aggregation is just one of the assets that you need to have in a neutral asset lock in open collaboration.

20:20.840 --> 20:24.840
Trademark is another one. If one of the companies has the trademark,

20:24.840 --> 20:29.840
it means it's more difficult to weaponize, I guess, than copyright aggregation,

20:29.840 --> 20:37.840
but you can still pull the project identity away from the project, and so that can create some tension.

20:37.840 --> 20:47.840
So, yeah, clearly being able to put all of those assets that make that project initially possible and have some stability,

20:47.840 --> 20:55.840
so the name, the ability to change the license, under some kind of an asset lock,

20:55.840 --> 20:59.840
and I'm not necessarily saying go for an open source foundation like the one I work for.

20:59.840 --> 21:09.840
There are other ways today to actually create those open collaboration fields without necessarily going for a foundation.

21:09.840 --> 21:15.840
I think today foundations really bring value to make that open collaboration successful, not just possible.

21:15.840 --> 21:22.840
But yes, I think it's part of how you would fix the problem.

21:22.840 --> 21:30.840
The problem is really that it's a single entity, it's software that is developed by a single entity.

21:30.840 --> 21:34.840
They will try to hide it. They will say, well, we take contributions from the community.

21:34.840 --> 21:42.840
I mean, that worked for some, and clearly there is the difference between the contributors that are on the inside and the contributors that are on the outside.

21:42.840 --> 21:51.840
So it's free labor, it's not contribution, it's not an openly, it's not a common.

21:51.840 --> 21:56.840
The common you have to make sure that the future participants will benefit from it.

21:56.840 --> 22:03.840
Here it's like it's the pure ownership of one single company, and they take free labor when it's available,

22:03.840 --> 22:08.840
and then they change the license under you when some VC tells them to, so it's bad.

22:09.840 --> 22:16.840
I'm not a professional developer, so I know this is a rookie question. I don't know the answer.

22:16.840 --> 22:22.840
How would an entirely new thing come into being if no one person can have that thing?

22:22.840 --> 22:28.840
Doesn't every idea start with one person? So at that moment it is a proprietary thing.

22:28.840 --> 22:33.840
And it may often live for some time before it becomes something else.

22:34.840 --> 22:42.840
Your rant clearly doesn't cover somebody having a good idea. So how does something completely new come into being?

22:42.840 --> 22:47.840
So it starts as one person, but that person makes a choice at that point.

22:47.840 --> 22:54.840
They decide either to put it on some software force, name names,

22:54.840 --> 23:00.840
and have a proto-open governance around it that says, well, I'm the maintainer,

23:00.840 --> 23:08.840
but I would consider adding more maintainers and wants to create an open collaboration ground around it.

23:08.840 --> 23:12.840
Then they take the role of openly developed open source.

23:12.840 --> 23:17.840
At that initial stage they decide, wow, that's very interesting.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.840
I could build a company around it and monetize the heck out of it,

23:21.840 --> 23:23.840
and so I need to make sure I keep control over it.

23:23.840 --> 23:28.840
And the second contribution, I want to make sure they assign copyright to me or my organization

23:28.840 --> 23:30.840
that I can do whatever I want tomorrow.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.840
That's there going the way of the proprietary software.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.840
And it's really a thinking model.

23:36.840 --> 23:43.840
You either want to monetize something that goes beyond those comments that you create with others,

23:43.840 --> 23:48.840
or you think that software is going to be the real value that you create,

23:48.840 --> 23:51.840
and you want to make sure you capture all of it.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.840
Thank you very much for your...

23:56.840 --> 23:58.840
I'm here at the top.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.840
Thank you very much.

24:00.840 --> 24:06.840
I'd like to have your view on what happened to the Matrix Element ecosystem,

24:06.840 --> 24:20.840
where the server port was re-licensed in the last three years from a permissive license to a AGPL license.

24:20.840 --> 24:28.840
So this is re-licensing in the opposite way you're describing, so kind of more open,

24:28.840 --> 24:34.840
but there are still lots of discussion because they are forking their own community with their own software,

24:34.840 --> 24:38.840
and the whole community is not really kind of it.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.840
What is your view about that fact?

24:40.840 --> 24:44.840
So yes, it's going in the right direction, but it's still proprietary software.

24:44.840 --> 24:47.840
If they can actually do that, they can do it again.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.840
And you never know exactly in which direction.

24:51.840 --> 24:57.840
So I would argue that it's a proprietary holdout in the middle.

24:57.840 --> 25:02.840
That is probably well-intentioned right now, and a lot of those companies are actually well-intentioned when they start.

25:02.840 --> 25:06.840
It's when money comes in and they get some pressure about return on investment

25:06.840 --> 25:11.840
that suddenly you need to extract a bit more juice from that lemon,

25:11.840 --> 25:15.840
and the only lever you have is re-licensing.

25:15.840 --> 25:20.840
And I don't think HashiCore planned it from day zero.

25:20.840 --> 25:26.840
Although the VCs at some VC ventures actually have a playbook for it.

25:26.840 --> 25:29.840
So it's a published tactic.

25:29.840 --> 25:33.840
It's not as if it was like a secret or a surprise.

25:33.840 --> 25:40.840
In the end, it's all a calculated move around their approach of how we build software today.

25:40.840 --> 25:49.840
They can't really get around it, so they adopt it and try to make it do what they need.

26:00.840 --> 26:02.840
I'm not sure if it's just the VCs.

26:02.840 --> 26:06.840
I like to blame the VCs and investors too.

26:06.840 --> 26:13.840
But one of the things that I think is that people that are paying for software

26:13.840 --> 26:17.840
don't value open development and open collaboration as much.

26:17.840 --> 26:19.840
They just want the vendor to be around.

26:19.840 --> 26:21.840
They don't really value the history.

26:21.840 --> 26:26.840
They could have been around for 10 years on their open source development,

26:26.840 --> 26:33.840
but at the end of the day, they're still willing to pay for the software, the cloud offering, whatever it is.

26:33.840 --> 26:38.840
But they don't value the open development as much as the rest of us do.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.840
So I would disagree with that.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.840
It depends on the software.

26:42.840 --> 26:47.840
Obviously, if you run Firefox and you suddenly decide to use Chromium instead,

26:47.840 --> 26:51.840
because you're weird, it's possible.

26:51.840 --> 26:56.840
But in some cases, the project that I've been mostly working on

26:56.840 --> 26:58.840
over the past 12 years is OpenStack.

26:58.840 --> 27:02.840
And if you make an investment in an open source technology

27:02.840 --> 27:05.840
because you think open source is the way to build it,

27:05.840 --> 27:11.840
or you think that the software, the way it's built, it's not going to be changed on you.

27:11.840 --> 27:17.840
There will not be new licensing that will force you to pay support from one single company, one of those things.

27:17.840 --> 27:25.840
Having the guarantee that it's not going to change two years, five years, ten years from then

27:25.840 --> 27:30.840
is an important guarantee because you make a pretty significant investment in that infrastructure.

27:30.840 --> 27:36.840
So there are other open source solutions for providing infrastructure than OpenStack,

27:36.840 --> 27:38.840
but all the others are single vendor.

27:38.840 --> 27:43.840
And so that means you're potentially, if you choose them,

27:43.840 --> 27:46.840
they might decide to do something else with the software,

27:46.840 --> 27:52.840
and they might put your investment at risk because they might decide that you need to pay them for support

27:52.840 --> 27:59.840
per seat, per server, for whatever, some condition that you can't really accept,

27:59.840 --> 28:01.840
especially if you're a nonprofit.

28:01.840 --> 28:09.840
I really like the idea of the kind of frictionless way you can use the open source.

28:09.840 --> 28:15.840
What I think I'm hearing is that we really should be thinking about the fact

28:15.840 --> 28:21.840
that even if you can use particular open source projects, you might want to if they're like this.

28:21.840 --> 28:22.840
That's what I'm hearing.

28:22.840 --> 28:28.840
And I'm just wondering then, practically speaking, if we have to check whether or not they're like that,

28:28.840 --> 28:31.840
does that not interrupt the kind of value of the frictionless use thing?

28:31.840 --> 28:37.840
Because now, I just don't understand how we flag those, or how do you know,

28:37.840 --> 28:43.840
or how do you avoid this basically without interrupting this idea of just being able to use things that have open source software licenses?

28:43.840 --> 28:45.840
It's an excellent point.

28:46.840 --> 28:49.840
You can't just look at the license.

28:49.840 --> 28:53.840
That's actually another thing that I've been speaking about a few times.

28:53.840 --> 28:57.840
We need to go in the way we look at the software.

28:57.840 --> 29:04.840
We need to go beyond just the open source license because it's not going to give you this certainty that I think you need.

29:04.840 --> 29:06.840
And yes, it's a problem.

29:06.840 --> 29:10.840
And there are some organizations when they put out a project,

29:10.840 --> 29:17.840
they're pretty sure that they're under an open governance and they will be there forever, et cetera, et cetera.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.840
But there is no label.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.840
There is no brand.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.840
I'm trying to say openly developed open source.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.840
I have much as much as it's like a math fall.

29:26.840 --> 29:31.840
It might not be the right, like, I don't want to say good open source, bad open source.

29:31.840 --> 29:36.840
But yes, we need some way to say this sounds like safe open source

29:36.840 --> 29:40.840
and this sounds like potentially a restrictive in two days open source.

29:40.840 --> 29:43.840
And how do we differentiate that?

29:43.840 --> 29:44.840
I don't agree.

29:44.840 --> 29:45.840
We have an issue.

29:45.840 --> 29:48.840
The talk here is more to...

29:48.840 --> 29:58.840
The goal is to more of a wake-up call where I want people to realize how much we benefit from that permissionless innovation that open source licensing has.

29:58.840 --> 30:03.840
I want people to realize that this...

30:03.840 --> 30:08.840
Not all open source is aligned with that permissionless innovation.

30:08.840 --> 30:17.840
A lot of it is actually saying open source should not be allowed to run on any purpose by anyone for any purpose.

30:17.840 --> 30:25.840
And so going back to, you know, we've been through this cycle from the 60s to 2020,

30:25.840 --> 30:37.840
going back to the age where computers, where we did not have this 9 trillion body of code that we can easily pull from and that we are free to build on.

30:37.840 --> 30:41.840
And there's nothing that guarantees that's going to continue.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.840
Like, 10 years from now, we could...

30:43.840 --> 30:47.840
Why would open source still be around?

30:47.840 --> 30:50.840
It's because if we hold the line on open source licensing,

30:50.840 --> 30:55.840
if it's all the line, if the open source initiative continues to grab the open source definition,

30:55.840 --> 31:03.840
make sure that all the freedoms are in there and we don't remove one freedom and see what happens to permissionless innovation.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.840
And I think that's the general idea.

31:06.840 --> 31:08.840
And yes, be more...

31:08.840 --> 31:14.840
Look under the hood and see how the open source software that you're being sold is actually built.

31:14.840 --> 31:15.840
I'm sorry.

31:16.840 --> 31:21.840
It's at 6 o'clock, folks, so rain, livestreams ended.

31:21.840 --> 31:25.840
But continue your questions if you have any theory outside.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.840
Everyone agrees?
