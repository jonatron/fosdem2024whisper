00:00.000 --> 00:09.320
Okay.

00:09.320 --> 00:14.120
Let's welcome our next speakers on the news with open source law.

00:14.120 --> 00:18.120
Yes, good evening everybody.

00:18.120 --> 00:22.200
It's a great honor to be here at this conference at the FOSSTEM.

00:22.200 --> 00:28.280
It was many years ago when I was here last time, but now I'm glad to be back and I'm

00:28.280 --> 00:36.040
very happy to present together with Rika Koch our new law that we achieved basically getting

00:36.040 --> 00:37.040
in Switzerland.

00:37.040 --> 00:42.560
It has been a long journey and it's great that we can now present this and we are very

00:42.560 --> 00:48.360
interested also for your feedback in the end if something similar is existing in other

00:48.360 --> 00:54.160
countries or how we also have to continue in this journey.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.960
So briefly just our background.

00:55.960 --> 01:02.840
We are academics from Berlin, Switzerland, but from my side I'm also an activist since

01:02.840 --> 01:08.640
almost 20 years when I wrote my master thesis about open source community building and I'm

01:08.640 --> 01:17.320
very glad that we can now present this to you and Rika will start.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.200
Good afternoon from my side as well.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.360
My name is Rika Koch.

01:20.360 --> 01:28.040
As Matias mentioned, I'm a law professor at the Benefach Hochschule in Bern and I want

01:28.040 --> 01:33.960
to speak to you today about the regulation, the legal side of open source software in

01:33.960 --> 01:39.440
Switzerland for the public sector.

01:39.440 --> 01:40.600
Here it is again.

01:40.600 --> 01:47.120
So in the beginning when we talk about regulation of open source in the public sector there

01:47.120 --> 01:53.920
was literally nothing.

01:53.920 --> 01:59.080
And I wrote here dark past but we're not talking about the so far past.

01:59.080 --> 02:03.000
We're talking about 10, 20 or even two years back.

02:03.000 --> 02:08.320
Although there was a strategy of the Swiss federal government that said well basically

02:08.320 --> 02:12.840
open source software would be nice because it's economically efficient and it produces

02:12.840 --> 02:15.200
good quality but there was nothing in the law.

02:15.200 --> 02:19.600
We had a strategy.

02:19.600 --> 02:26.280
So when there is nothing regulated you don't really know whether you can do it, whether

02:26.280 --> 02:31.960
it is allowed for the public sector to develop their software open source, licensing it open

02:31.960 --> 02:37.760
source or not, which is called in legal terms there was a lot of legal uncertainty.

02:37.760 --> 02:43.720
So developers or the private sector who offered their software to the public sector didn't

02:43.720 --> 02:45.760
really know whether it was possible or not.

02:45.760 --> 02:55.280
So the crucial question here is can the public sector develop and also distribute open source

02:55.280 --> 02:59.360
software or do they have to do it closed source?

02:59.360 --> 03:08.760
Well if you ask the IT experts probably all of them tell you yes of course they can but

03:08.760 --> 03:14.680
in comes the spoilers, the legal persons, the lawyers and they say wait a second it's

03:14.680 --> 03:16.480
not that easy.

03:16.480 --> 03:27.440
So the Swiss government was in this situation where the IT experts please do open source

03:27.440 --> 03:32.800
software and the lawyers say no no it's complicated please don't and what do they do?

03:32.800 --> 03:39.680
They ask they pay a lot of money for of course the legal experts for a legal opinion.

03:39.680 --> 03:49.640
Oh sorry I hand over to Matias to explain first why the pressure arose.

03:49.640 --> 03:57.160
Thank you so basically from a historical point of view this is interesting because it was

03:57.160 --> 04:05.680
being done open source by several state agencies for many years so from the IT side obviously

04:05.680 --> 04:11.800
there were lots of open source activities on GitHub from different agencies however as

04:11.800 --> 04:20.240
Rika said it was not legally allowed and so when actually we started from our group of

04:20.240 --> 04:25.640
parliamentarians it's called parliamentarian group for digital sustainability, Paul Deghi

04:25.640 --> 04:33.520
we started basically lobbying for open source release from the Swiss government in 2011

04:33.520 --> 04:39.880
so it was back then when we had our first initiative and asking politicians to actually

04:39.880 --> 04:45.160
support the release of open source software by the government and it seemed like a natural

04:45.160 --> 04:51.600
thing although the federal government rejected this that there will be no additional support

04:51.600 --> 04:58.000
it was basically clear to us that it will take place anyway and even more actually the

04:58.000 --> 05:04.120
Swiss federal court is very open source minded for many years they actually are completely

05:04.120 --> 05:11.160
based on open source software they host their all entire stack it's they use LibreOffice

05:11.160 --> 05:18.640
back then it was open office and all the federal court lawyer federal judges they use LibreOffice

05:18.680 --> 05:26.760
for their activities so and they even wanted to open source their back then their court

05:26.760 --> 05:33.760
management system called OpenEustizia it still exists OpenEustizia.ch it actually is still online

05:33.760 --> 05:43.280
this website but something happened very little Swiss Bernese law company IT law company they

05:43.320 --> 05:49.680
actually objected to against this release of open source software by the federal court because

05:49.680 --> 05:57.440
their business was jeopardized basically they were afraid of this government competition because

05:57.440 --> 06:06.160
they actually had a market of local courts where they sold their proprietary court management

06:06.160 --> 06:11.400
systems too and when actually federal court the big court actually releases open source they were

06:11.440 --> 06:19.680
obviously afraid that this government would destroy their market and what they did actually

06:19.680 --> 06:27.120
they asked another politicians to hand in to hand in actually another question on political

06:27.120 --> 06:35.040
side that would ask what is basically the aim of the federal court would they want to destroy the

06:35.040 --> 06:43.080
market for IT companies and then basically compete with small companies and this basically

06:43.080 --> 06:49.800
actually was the beginning of this legal dispute for last 10 years and now I hand over to the

06:49.800 --> 06:57.760
lawyer again and she will explain to you what the lawyers said about this story. Yeah maybe you

06:57.760 --> 07:03.120
know the saying we have in German two lawyers three opinions and it was exactly that so we had a

07:03.160 --> 07:12.000
first legal opinion issued in 2014 with the crucial question can the government develop and

07:12.000 --> 07:19.560
distribute open source software and this legal opinion said basically no why there is in the

07:19.560 --> 07:25.320
Swiss constitution and I'm sure in other constitutions as well the principle of competitive

07:25.320 --> 07:32.280
neutrality this means that the government should not mess with the private sector to the contrary

07:32.320 --> 07:40.560
that the government should make so-called favorable conditions for the private sector and they said

07:40.560 --> 07:47.360
that this is not the case when the government publishes open instead of closed source software.

07:47.360 --> 07:57.520
Now it gets a bit legal they said that distribution of software by the public sector is a so-called

07:57.880 --> 08:07.600
economic acts that would per se distort the free market. This would actually be allowed but only

08:07.600 --> 08:14.080
if there is a sound legal basis and if it's proportionate which means also necessary and these

08:14.080 --> 08:22.960
two quite old law professors they said no it's not written in the law okay that's that was true at

08:23.000 --> 08:29.680
that time but it's not necessary at all because everything you want to do with public software

08:29.680 --> 08:35.640
or software by the public sector you can might as well do with closed software it's even more

08:35.640 --> 08:46.200
it's even better suited suited to reach the public tasks so it's private basically but

08:46.480 --> 08:57.920
luckily some persons thought okay let's just ask another lawyer and paid for another legal

08:57.920 --> 09:04.280
opinion three years later and I when I say some persons I look at Matias so this second legal

09:04.280 --> 09:11.440
opinion said well we're not too sure whether publishing open instead of closed source software

09:11.440 --> 09:19.480
really is an economic and distorted act per se we might call it also an auxiliary services so

09:19.480 --> 09:26.360
you can't do the software because it serves the fulfillment of a public task and whether you do

09:26.360 --> 09:32.840
it with closed or open source software it does not really change the fact that you have the

09:32.840 --> 09:40.920
legitimation to do so so they said it's an auxiliary service does not distort the market and we do

09:40.960 --> 09:51.360
not even need a legal basis with this in mind this was government after long consultation they

09:51.360 --> 09:58.360
issued a law although you do not really need a legal basis they thought yeah we might as well make

09:58.360 --> 10:07.960
legal basis better saved than sorry and they negotiated the so-called federal law on the use

10:08.120 --> 10:14.640
of electronics means for the fulfillment of governmental tasks and there they did not only

10:14.640 --> 10:26.200
put the possibility to make open source software but a mandatory requirement this is the text we

10:26.200 --> 10:33.600
will look at this now and I will speed it up a bit so here it says the public bodies subject to

10:33.640 --> 10:43.160
this law shall disclose the source code of software that they develop or have Dilla developed by

10:43.160 --> 10:52.520
third parties unless the right of third parties or security related reasons preclude this so we

10:52.520 --> 10:59.720
have the first sentence is the principle that opens our software is by law mandatory for software

10:59.760 --> 11:08.400
that the public sector develops or for developments that they buy via third parties and the private

11:08.400 --> 11:14.720
market so not for software that already exists so if they they can still buy pre-existing

11:14.720 --> 11:23.880
software on the free market so and there's the rule and there's the exception the exception is you

11:23.920 --> 11:31.000
do not have to make it open for software if third right parties would preclude that that's clear

11:31.000 --> 11:40.280
that's usually intellectual property rights closed licenses maybe or for security related reasons

11:40.280 --> 11:47.720
and I personally really don't know what this should mean I've been told by people with more IT

11:47.720 --> 11:53.360
knowledge than I have that they do not need her so if someone of you knows what this could be please

11:53.720 --> 12:03.200
please raise your hand afterwards and give us this input and this was paragraph one the principle

12:03.200 --> 12:10.080
of mandatory open source software there are a lot of other principle paragraphs I don't delve deeper

12:10.080 --> 12:17.920
into that but just to show you that we've come from open source software is really distortive and

12:18.080 --> 12:26.720
against market neutrality of the Swiss government to also this and this is paragraph four and five

12:26.720 --> 12:34.840
and they said so the public sector they can develop the open source software and they can also offer

12:34.840 --> 12:45.240
supply services other services to other governmental bodies for if they charge for it so they have to

12:45.240 --> 12:55.040
take money usually but they can also also make provide other services which is then not deemed

12:55.040 --> 13:06.000
market distortive thank you Rika so basically here we have the issue about is the federal court

13:06.000 --> 13:11.200
this are the background of this whole clauses is the federal clause a court allowed to actually

13:11.200 --> 13:17.360
make community building basically help other courts to use their software and maybe answer some

13:17.360 --> 13:22.680
questions and also participate in the community and this is actually now also a legal basis for

13:22.680 --> 13:29.640
community building on the federal level now we have the law so what does this mean so a law is not

13:29.640 --> 13:36.680
helpful if it's not implemented it's and this is basically the activities of my next 10 years to

13:36.680 --> 13:46.080
make this law alive so one aspect and this is where also Rika comes in because she's a specialist in

13:46.080 --> 13:53.840
public procurement now we hope actually to find in the next few years more and more public tenders

13:53.840 --> 14:01.320
where actually the government procuring IT solutions will have to include different criteria

14:01.320 --> 14:09.080
which actually support the open source the release of open source software and the community

14:09.080 --> 14:15.680
building so this is actually a real excerpt from one of them public tenders it's actually not

14:15.680 --> 14:21.960
with the new law but I think it could actually serve as a good example from my point of view

14:21.960 --> 14:28.560
because it says that first one of the issues is that the software which is being built by the

14:28.600 --> 14:35.320
company is providing the solution has to be open sourced under an open source license on the

14:35.320 --> 14:41.280
GitHub account of the city of burden then actually they have to use not just any license but a

14:41.280 --> 14:51.120
copy left license including you PLH EPL so we heard about that thank you Bradley and we also

14:51.120 --> 14:58.280
have then the need for companies with experience in open source software development and community

14:58.280 --> 15:05.400
building and actually the community management is also one of the services provided by this

15:05.400 --> 15:12.040
IT distributor so from my point of view it looks quite nice that it's really something which should

15:12.040 --> 15:20.040
be in the future being used as one of them open source role models or good practices at least

15:20.360 --> 15:29.440
for for IT procurement nevertheless we have not much not as much activities in Switzerland

15:29.440 --> 15:35.800
compared to other countries especially Germany and we have a few activities so one thing was

15:35.800 --> 15:41.520
during pandemia that there was the federal IT administration which released the COVID

15:41.520 --> 15:48.120
certificate app as open source software which was then actually used by the Austrian government

15:48.680 --> 15:57.480
and used for their national COVID certificate and this is I think a very nice example of how

15:57.480 --> 16:06.280
governments can also interchange source code another example includes the Swiss map agencies

16:06.280 --> 16:13.080
Vistopo they produced open they supported open layers in the past and collaborated with some

16:13.160 --> 16:18.280
institutionalized crowdfunding with other agencies the first development of open layers

16:19.640 --> 16:28.120
another aspect is from a company initiated in swissland at Finis they actually started an open

16:28.120 --> 16:38.280
source project Kaluma and some workflow component framework and they supported now several canton

16:38.280 --> 16:46.040
several local departments of swissland to use this company to use this software and they founded

16:46.040 --> 16:51.800
this in osco community and this is also another good example which I think shows that even swiss

16:51.800 --> 16:59.480
people are able to produce open source software in a good way and the last the last thing you have

16:59.560 --> 17:08.840
heard all the railway activities open rail association today this was also partly driven by

17:08.840 --> 17:16.200
the swiss federal railway association I think it could also be a good example how swiss government

17:16.200 --> 17:23.080
or government companies can collaborate with others so hope there's still hope for switzerland

17:23.080 --> 17:27.720
and their open source activities and maybe with and especially if they'll you know there should be

17:27.720 --> 17:35.080
more activity soon there's one monitoring thing which we do osasbenchmark.com this is a very

17:35.080 --> 17:44.520
hobby pet project of mine which where we collect basically the the open source repositories of

17:44.520 --> 17:51.960
organizations from swiss government and companies and look how many repositories are released by

17:51.960 --> 18:00.680
which kind of company and here again you can see basically of 150 agencies and institutions how

18:00.680 --> 18:08.360
much open source they are already providing on github now what I hope in the future will also help

18:08.360 --> 18:17.080
us is the the the the also the high level political environment around digital sovereignty and

18:17.080 --> 18:22.920
digital sustainability so a few years ago we created the report on data colonialism where

18:22.920 --> 18:30.360
we pointed out this is danger of the big tech companies appropriating and privatization of

18:30.360 --> 18:37.480
data and also obviously of software and nowadays I'm working on a new report for the digital

18:37.480 --> 18:45.080
sovereignty strategy for the government where they have to actually release some some new

18:45.640 --> 18:50.760
recommendation by the end of this year and so we hope that this again also will help open

18:50.760 --> 18:58.120
source software development in switzerland now we are very interested in your feedback for the

18:59.080 --> 19:05.800
for discussion because first of all we would be interested on do other countries have similar

19:05.800 --> 19:11.000
laws in this way where it actually is not just allowed to open source software but it's really

19:11.080 --> 19:16.920
actually the default second question what is the potential and the challenges of this new swiss law

19:16.920 --> 19:23.160
what do you think could be also something in other countries being implemented and from the

19:23.160 --> 19:29.480
operational and the implementational point of view we know of several activities of other countries

19:29.480 --> 19:36.920
but so what in your opinion would be the best to do next in switzerland because now we have the law

19:36.920 --> 19:42.760
now we do need to do other things is our parliamentary group okay so that's it for the moment and

19:42.760 --> 19:59.960
very very interested in your feedback thank you very much I was a little bit irritated that you

19:59.960 --> 20:05.720
mentioned within the tender that you're demanding copy left while for some organizations within

20:05.720 --> 20:11.400
their own code if they want to contribute it for this to reduce their costs having a copy left may

20:11.400 --> 20:20.520
actually be exclusionary because some people using code that under a different license more

20:20.520 --> 20:27.400
permissive license may not be willing to put their stuff under a copy left in other words what's

20:27.400 --> 20:33.800
wrong with actually saying a copy left or a apache or a bsd or one of these other more permissive

20:33.800 --> 20:43.480
licenses so this basically as if I understand you correctly so the question is why is copy left

20:43.480 --> 20:53.320
license being recommended which actually excludes a number of organizations who may want to

20:54.040 --> 21:00.920
develop software with a much more permissive license than copy left well it doesn't exclude them

21:01.880 --> 21:09.080
well it can be integrated into copy left and final product

21:18.360 --> 21:21.240
so maybe someone else can add on this but

21:21.960 --> 21:30.200
um do you want to are you responding to that Bradley yeah please so so what it sounds like

21:30.200 --> 21:36.840
you're saying is that if it if it has a must on copy left then they might just have to upgrade the

21:36.840 --> 21:43.480
license that's under you know under mit to be copy left when they put the solution forward right

21:43.480 --> 21:48.840
yes so as far as I understand if you have the end product the final product this is include

21:48.840 --> 21:56.840
permissive license software and but you still can use the the less permissive the less restrictive

21:56.840 --> 22:12.760
license software thank you for the great talk you just mentioned that there was this argument of

22:12.760 --> 22:19.480
that providing open source software does market distortion that somebody gave that argument

22:19.480 --> 22:25.240
like the right of a private enterprise to make money on licensing fees is above other things

22:26.200 --> 22:32.040
shouldn't there be an argument that the government should make best use of taxpayer money rather

22:32.040 --> 22:38.760
than blowing taxpayer money on licensing fees and isn't this a good enough argument to reject that

22:39.560 --> 22:48.280
yeah absolutely I mean I did not understand myself the argument that why this should I mean just

22:48.280 --> 22:55.880
enable some companies to pursue a business model in a certain ways does not mean to be market

22:55.880 --> 23:04.680
competitive so I think we to the contrary I mean to enable the government to make a software that

23:04.760 --> 23:14.760
has the best return of use money for value value for money sorry for the taxpayers should be

23:15.800 --> 23:22.600
the first public interest so and that's how the interpretation of term competitive neutrality

23:22.600 --> 23:27.160
changed luckily

23:28.680 --> 23:38.760
okay you mentioned that the slow is forced in 2017 am I right sorry the law was the law

23:38.760 --> 23:47.000
like six years ago no no the law started on February January 1st 2024 this this year okay

23:47.080 --> 23:52.440
because I've got the question that's how often can be used that's security reason because there are

23:52.440 --> 23:58.600
you mentioned there are two reasons like it's third party and the second is security reason when

23:58.600 --> 24:07.480
there is exception so when it comes for like minister of defense the software could be perhaps

24:07.480 --> 24:13.560
proprietary software but if it's like pretty new so so I don't know if it's off or no yeah

24:14.200 --> 24:19.800
so this is this is exactly the point so the law is very new so we don't know yet how strongly

24:19.800 --> 24:25.720
will be implemented and fulfilled we we know that the government is kind of behind on releasing

24:25.720 --> 24:32.440
some guidelines and they're right now actually providing some guidelines but it will still take

24:32.440 --> 24:41.720
a few months or maybe years to really get it going on okay so on on the security issue I've

24:41.800 --> 24:46.760
so it should be used very sparingly right but there there are arguments that can't be made like

24:46.760 --> 24:52.040
Bradley mentioned when you're looking for people who're trying to evade like taxes

24:53.240 --> 24:59.080
there you can make an argument that people knowing how the government looks for tax evaders

24:59.080 --> 25:05.240
makes it easier to actually like beat these algorithms right so I think it's a good thing

25:05.240 --> 25:11.240
that's in the law while at the same time security by obscurity is a very bad thing and it should be

25:11.240 --> 25:16.200
like we should use that very sparingly but I think it's good that it's in the law so just from a

25:16.200 --> 25:23.640
like cyber security guy point of view and then the actual question do you know what the because we

25:23.640 --> 25:28.760
have the same argument in Austria where it says like the government may not publish open source

25:28.760 --> 25:33.960
because it it like distorts the market of proprietary companies profiting of proprietary

25:33.960 --> 25:41.160
software can you summarize what like the other side of the argument was and what what claims

25:41.160 --> 25:51.000
the lawyers made why this is not an issue actually you mean the pro side the like how was that how

25:51.000 --> 26:00.440
did they debunk that hopefully like you know ps yeah a good thing that you're from Austria so I

26:00.440 --> 26:09.240
can just send it to you the little penny but um to summarize they just said only real economic acts

26:09.800 --> 26:16.520
can distort the market so they compared it if it's open source or closed source is like if you

26:17.080 --> 26:26.840
write using a pen or your laptop it's just a means to help you doing your work so an auxiliary service

26:26.840 --> 26:33.000
and even if it was market distorted then you just have to have the legal basis okay but but then

26:33.000 --> 26:42.760
it's still necessary for to have better quality so very quickly I've seen other laws in other

26:42.760 --> 26:47.320
countries that were open source by default failing so it's good that you have already clarified that

26:47.320 --> 26:54.280
for instance security can be a way to circumvent this I wonder if there are some regional I'd say

26:54.280 --> 27:01.480
regional car valves like this is federal can a city or a canton or whatever avoid to apply this

27:01.480 --> 27:08.040
law because it doesn't apply to them uh yes so I have to say this is only for the federal government

27:08.040 --> 27:13.640
this is binding only for the federal government sub federal governments can do whatever still

27:15.480 --> 27:20.200
but what I would would also expect that usually in Switzerland at least the what the federal

27:20.200 --> 27:28.040
government is doing the canton's and also the non let's say the non federal players are also

27:28.040 --> 27:33.240
looking at so when they see there are benefits and there are obviously benefits otherwise it

27:33.240 --> 27:41.560
wouldn't be here so then I hope that people will be more used to actually procure open

27:41.560 --> 27:56.920
source software services and build communities okay let's let's thank you Mattias and Rita
