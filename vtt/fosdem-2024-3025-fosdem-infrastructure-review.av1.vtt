WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.880
Okay, so for the end of the Lightning Talk Room, we have Richard Hartman and Sebastian

00:12.880 --> 00:26.240
Schubut with the Fasdame Infrastructure Review.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.640
Thank you and it's great to have you here for the last Lightning Talk of the day for

00:29.640 --> 00:34.840
our traditional infrastructure review that we are giving and trying to tell you how we

00:34.840 --> 00:37.400
are running this conference.

00:37.400 --> 00:42.360
So let's get this started.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.040
We were running on a quite stable platform for the last years.

00:45.040 --> 00:51.360
We have one Cisco AZR 10,000 or 106 that we do for all the magic that happens here.

00:51.360 --> 00:59.280
So you have some Wi-Fi connections and that our customers or our friends that are watching

00:59.280 --> 01:03.360
the live streams right now, I hope they can see us, that it will get the live streams.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.760
That's what we use those infrastructure for.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.320
Most of the traffic we're generating is actually for the live streams that we're doing.

01:09.320 --> 01:15.720
We see that in a bit, but roughly 500 megabits per second are just going out of the building

01:15.720 --> 01:22.440
to our multiplexing service and where then the videos are spread around the globe.

01:22.440 --> 01:26.080
We've had a handful of Cisco switches that we're trying to remove because they're getting

01:26.080 --> 01:34.640
quite old and we replaced them with even the same age Arista ones that are a bit easier

01:34.640 --> 01:35.640
to handle for us.

01:35.640 --> 01:41.040
So we have the first time three new Aristas switches onsite this year, which helped us

01:41.040 --> 01:43.640
a lot with the new setup that we planned.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.000
We had two very old servers.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.200
I think they were last year, they were 13 years.

01:48.200 --> 01:52.240
This year it should be 14 years or so.

01:52.240 --> 01:55.760
We thought about, hey, we should replace them because last year when we powered them up

01:55.760 --> 02:01.000
after the pandemic, the battery packs were depleted and we just saw the K, maybe we should

02:01.000 --> 02:02.680
just replace them.

02:02.680 --> 02:07.840
We found some additional servers that we packed into our rack and then we just spun up a Proxmox

02:07.840 --> 02:11.480
cluster there and started using the first VMs.

02:11.480 --> 02:17.720
And yeah, currently all of the monitoring is done locally here at the infrastructure rack

02:17.720 --> 02:18.720
that we have.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.360
We have a lot of software, Prometheus, Loki and Grafana and it really helps us a lot.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.800
Pain points of the last years, they've all been weeded out in the last year.

02:27.800 --> 02:32.280
So this year it was quite smooth run of the whole network setup.

02:32.280 --> 02:38.280
We were able to dig into problems that have come over the last year quite efficient and

02:38.280 --> 02:42.640
didn't spend a lot of time on working on bigger problems.

02:42.640 --> 02:48.040
We have also data for the public dashboards that we have on the internet that we send

02:48.040 --> 02:52.760
out and just persisted on a machine that's not running here on the campus in case of the

02:52.760 --> 02:54.840
campuses.

02:54.840 --> 02:59.920
Not available anymore to us because we need to get rid of the rack in the room but Richie

02:59.920 --> 03:04.880
will tell you something about the room conditions later.

03:04.880 --> 03:08.760
So first start with the video system that we have here.

03:08.760 --> 03:13.040
I don't know if any one of you has been running into or wanted to get into a room that said

03:13.040 --> 03:17.120
it's full but you can still watch it as a live stream.

03:17.120 --> 03:22.120
We have those beautiful live streaming devices that you can maybe see from the background.

03:22.120 --> 03:26.680
There's a laptop attached and there's a camera over there and there's also a laptop attached.

03:26.680 --> 03:32.480
And we're capturing all the video data with these video boxes that are handmade by the

03:32.480 --> 03:36.160
FOSDOM volunteers or the FOSDOM staff guys.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.920
And we've put that all on GitHub.

03:37.920 --> 03:42.760
You can if you want to see it you can just download everything from GitHub and those

03:42.760 --> 03:47.440
little boxes they sent basically all the streams to our render farm which we'll see

03:47.440 --> 03:52.200
later and then get processed there and sent to the internet.

03:52.200 --> 03:59.480
We have the most of the streams for the live streaming are sent to Hetzner cloud where we

03:59.480 --> 04:06.400
have a lot of storage there where we just send all the raw data and then it's been processed,

04:06.400 --> 04:11.960
cut into pieces and people like me can just go and edit it and say okay there was a blip

04:11.960 --> 04:14.280
that I just want to cut out.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.840
This is all not done here.

04:15.840 --> 04:20.720
It's in Hetzner but for next year this will all be going to the onsite so we don't need

04:20.720 --> 04:26.360
to push data out of the building that never should leave the building because we currently

04:26.360 --> 04:31.560
have some processing here at the ULB some at Hetzner so we're constantly pushing data

04:31.560 --> 04:37.200
in and out which is obviously not really great use of bandwidth.

04:37.200 --> 04:42.760
They were using a semi-autorated review process that some folks of that might be familiar

04:42.760 --> 04:43.760
with it.

04:43.760 --> 04:44.760
It's called S review.

04:44.760 --> 04:50.800
This is the thing that will move into ULB next year once our clusters are production

04:50.800 --> 04:54.760
grade because currently we have some issues with them.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.680
The video boxes I don't know who we have been to foster them before.

04:58.680 --> 05:04.640
They looked like this for years and years and years and they had some minor problems.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.000
I don't know if you can see it.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.680
It's this device.

05:08.680 --> 05:12.520
It's not open source and since we're an open source conference we try to replace everything

05:12.520 --> 05:17.960
with open source components and the other problem was this LCD part.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.280
They're not available anymore.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.200
You can't get them there out of production.

05:23.200 --> 05:29.040
So that's why the decision was made to get rid of them and before we had a new box we

05:29.040 --> 05:35.200
took everything apart to just burn the ships and so we needed to move.

05:35.200 --> 05:40.240
This was the first idea we came up with where you basically, you can see it up here, the

05:40.240 --> 05:47.480
box, just have an HDMI grabber card that is then sent to a small device that puts it

05:47.480 --> 05:53.680
out as a video stream and we have a network switch as well.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.680
We found out that most of the laptops that we use here are not really compatible with

05:57.680 --> 06:01.240
that so we had another version.

06:01.240 --> 06:08.600
It's here which is way, way better from a compatibility view because it just puts out

06:08.600 --> 06:18.200
as a normal, what's it called, video device for the next and we just put a standard, let

06:18.200 --> 06:19.200
me see.

06:19.200 --> 06:20.200
I should have this here.

06:20.520 --> 06:26.480
USB adapter, yeah, just open it up.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.480
That's why I brought it.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.280
Just standard USB adapter like everyone has it in the suitcase.

06:30.280 --> 06:35.720
It's just working and that's how the video boxes are now made.

06:35.720 --> 06:41.000
The data and the firmware for those devices, it's known to us.

06:41.000 --> 06:46.600
It's not yet completely available as I was being told but we should have something that's

06:46.600 --> 06:56.000
not relying on copyrighted, protected things from Blackmagic Design that we used before.

06:56.000 --> 07:01.440
The video setup for those who might be interested in it is quite complicated because we need

07:01.440 --> 07:02.600
to run a lot of wires.

07:02.600 --> 07:08.240
As you can see here, they're running the networking wires and we have all the networking infrastructure

07:08.240 --> 07:10.280
built into those video boxes.

07:10.280 --> 07:15.400
Our volunteers that are building up the whole conference, they get detailed instructions

07:15.400 --> 07:16.960
on how to wire up everything.

07:16.960 --> 07:22.080
It looks a bit messy here but you can look at those up there on GitHub, on our GitHub

07:22.080 --> 07:23.080
repo.

07:23.080 --> 07:27.800
We have a detailed instruction on how everything is set up, how the camera has been set up,

07:27.800 --> 07:33.480
what to turn your switches on and how to turn the knobs because as you might know, FOSDM

07:33.480 --> 07:34.480
is run by volunteers.

07:34.480 --> 07:41.640
We don't do it on a daily basis so we have quite good documentation on that.

07:41.640 --> 07:46.200
This is how video looks like from our video control center.

07:46.200 --> 07:53.600
We have a big overview where we can actually see audio levels from the room.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.900
So hopefully when I'm now speaking, I should be somewhere in the green area.

07:57.900 --> 08:02.600
We see how the slides are, how the speaker is and how the final mix that's going to the

08:02.600 --> 08:03.600
internet.

08:03.600 --> 08:09.200
So we have that in our control room and in every building, there's a per building view

08:09.200 --> 08:15.520
so we can instantly react on problems like the problem and that's why I chose this.

08:15.520 --> 08:20.280
In K1105, you see that it's lighting up in orange.

08:20.280 --> 08:22.000
There seems to be a problem with the audio.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.880
You can see the audio is not constant and spiking and that's what's raising issues

08:26.880 --> 08:31.760
so we can react on the video.

08:31.760 --> 08:36.560
Video rendering, this is how it looked like 2023.

08:36.560 --> 08:41.360
This is how our rack looked like in 2023.

08:41.360 --> 08:46.200
Looked like spaghetti and it was spaghetti but we completely rebuilt it this year.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.040
We emptied the whole rack.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.360
We now have a vacuum cleaner.

08:50.360 --> 08:56.480
A big one to suck in all of this stuff.

08:56.480 --> 09:03.840
For how it's been running in 2024, I like to head over to Riggi Hartman.

09:03.840 --> 09:07.120
Thank you.

09:07.120 --> 09:15.760
So 2024 is cleaner and we forgot to put in the photo of the nice rack but maybe you saw

09:15.760 --> 09:16.760
the mustard on already.

09:16.760 --> 09:20.320
We can also put this into the ones we upload.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.880
Maybe one point on the laptops.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.680
Just on the scale, we have three laptops per room.

09:26.680 --> 09:28.560
One is here in the rendering farm.

09:28.560 --> 09:33.520
One is at the back with one of the video boxes and with the camera.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.520
One is here.

09:34.520 --> 09:35.600
This is basically how we do this.

09:35.600 --> 09:40.280
This says for anyone who wants to copy this and maybe on the copying, part of why we talk

09:40.280 --> 09:44.640
about this and why all of this is in Git and why we try to document it well is we want

09:44.640 --> 09:45.640
you to copy this.

09:45.640 --> 09:50.280
We want you to be able to run your own stuff with tested software so you can focus more

09:50.280 --> 09:54.240
on running things and not reinventing the wheel all the time.

09:54.240 --> 09:57.560
So the great advantage here is you have a built-in UPS.

09:57.560 --> 10:03.960
You have a built-in mouse keyboard and display in all of those machines and there are strong

10:03.960 --> 10:07.560
enough to basically handle all tasks these days.

10:07.560 --> 10:10.000
So highly recommend to just split this out this way.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.400
Yes, Kubernetes containers, whatever is nice but this just works and if it's stupid but

10:14.400 --> 10:16.360
it works, it's not stupid.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.360
Really highly recommend it.

10:17.360 --> 10:22.360
Also, as you can see on the floor, I think I've been staffed for like 15 years or something

10:22.360 --> 10:23.360
now.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.080
We did not clean this room since and no one else did.

10:25.080 --> 10:35.320
So finally tonight we are going to clean this for the first time.

10:35.320 --> 10:38.760
Maybe this gives you also a little bit of an indication of what level of maturity we

10:38.760 --> 10:41.440
reached because we are largely done with the fires.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.920
We can actually do the optional bus night stuff.

10:44.920 --> 10:52.360
We had massive water leakage like this box was halfway full by the time we removed it.

10:52.360 --> 10:58.520
Turns out a lot of you breathe and we kept the doors open because it smells really bad

10:58.520 --> 11:02.040
back there, like really really bad.

11:02.040 --> 11:06.880
I don't know, mold or whatever but anyway the point is we tried to get the bad air out

11:06.880 --> 11:11.320
but we let a lot of moist air in and at the end we literally had this dripping constantly.

11:11.320 --> 11:15.480
It was not fully a stream coming down from the ceiling but it's still dripping.

11:15.480 --> 11:19.280
Like unknown unknowns of running such a thing.

11:19.280 --> 11:24.800
Another thing for the ones who witnessed the power outage in K while trying to debug

11:24.800 --> 11:28.360
this, at first we had this ladder but then I just took a broom and just kept putting

11:28.360 --> 11:31.240
the breaker back in.

11:31.240 --> 11:38.160
While we disconnected bits and pieces, point here is yes, A this is fun but B those are

11:38.160 --> 11:41.840
the things which you just can't plan for and you just have to deal with them and roll with

11:41.840 --> 11:42.840
them.

11:42.840 --> 11:46.520
It doesn't matter, get stuff done, keep the conference going.

11:46.520 --> 11:50.400
So some stats.

11:50.400 --> 11:56.120
As per usual, if you've seen this before, you've seen me talk about those stats repeatedly

11:56.120 --> 12:02.920
over the years and there is some method to this.

12:02.920 --> 12:07.680
I really just want to be honest and transparent about the good and the bad which we encounter

12:07.680 --> 12:09.320
because sometimes it takes us longer.

12:09.320 --> 12:13.840
This time we thought we would be quicker but we weren't.

12:13.840 --> 12:19.160
We are doing ourselves honest in your direction as well but as you can see, we are doing pretty

12:19.160 --> 12:20.160
good.

12:20.160 --> 12:25.880
We were actually done with the network, second quickest ever in the history of FOSSTEM since

12:25.880 --> 12:28.720
at least I took over that part.

12:28.720 --> 12:36.160
So this is, yeah, the point is, I'm making a mess of this, the point is try and build

12:36.160 --> 12:40.440
on your success because previous editions of FOSSTEM were run on throwing away everything

12:40.440 --> 12:43.280
and reinventing the wheel every single time.

12:43.800 --> 12:48.200
It wasted endless amounts of staff hours.

12:48.200 --> 12:52.600
Documenting stuff for yourself and keeping stuff running where you can and actually having

12:52.600 --> 12:59.480
automation, everything really, really will save your own bacon and you get to sleep earlier.

12:59.480 --> 13:02.400
Other numbers, the monitoring was immediate.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.880
We do plan to have even more stuff running under the year and basically take it out of

13:06.880 --> 13:13.200
the box, water it and it's done.

13:14.120 --> 13:20.800
For the 2024 redo, we had big plans when we talked 2020 about what we would do differently

13:20.800 --> 13:22.360
in 2021.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.080
Great.

13:24.080 --> 13:31.800
Last year was mainly about trying to find our footing again and not just like not having

13:31.800 --> 13:34.560
a conference as it were.

13:34.560 --> 13:39.280
So basically all the stuff which we already wanted to do half a decade ago have become

13:39.280 --> 13:41.280
even more pressing.

13:41.280 --> 13:46.040
To some extent some price points shifted and such so it was even cheaper to do it but also

13:46.040 --> 13:51.840
it just was even more work and even more lost muscle memory and everything.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.360
Also full transparency, we thought we would be done with the server migration by now and

13:55.360 --> 13:56.360
we are not.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.720
We still have five servers running, not three.

13:59.720 --> 14:04.800
Also just again like you as the visitors did not notice this and this is how it should

14:04.800 --> 14:05.800
be.

14:05.800 --> 14:12.400
Here if we have one or 20 servers and if 19 of them are on fire, you care about the

14:12.400 --> 14:15.320
product which you are consuming as in the conference.

14:15.320 --> 14:20.960
So for the ones who want to run those things yourself, always think from the user-consumer

14:20.960 --> 14:25.480
customer or whatever perspective first, everything else comes second.

14:25.480 --> 14:31.640
So we will clean this up over the next probably half year because we don't want to touch anything

14:31.640 --> 14:32.640
after this.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.240
Like we have the post-mortem two weeks and then we don't want to see each other for

14:36.240 --> 14:40.120
half a year and then we restart.

14:40.120 --> 14:44.800
Anyway we have massively upgraded our backbone.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.920
As you saw earlier we have a total of three heirs just now.

14:47.920 --> 14:54.160
Two of them are in an MC leg and give us full 10 gig between everything, like multiple

14:54.160 --> 14:55.520
redundant.

14:55.520 --> 14:59.640
So we can actually run a local storage array and don't have to rely on local disks anymore

14:59.640 --> 15:01.720
which obviously means it's quite nice.

15:01.720 --> 15:05.600
If something breaks you can actually just flip over the virtual machine or the container

15:05.600 --> 15:11.120
and we don't need to spin up something from more or less nothing.

15:11.120 --> 15:16.800
Also the new switches which we have, they are literally more than a decade old but it's

15:16.800 --> 15:18.080
nice thing about it.

15:18.080 --> 15:24.560
We don't need much more so we could just get away with buying stuff for 350 euro refurbished.

15:24.560 --> 15:34.080
Yes 350 with SFP cages and 640 for the one with copper ports.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.720
Those used to cost 50k each.

15:37.720 --> 15:44.480
So I implore you if you have old stuff running around in your own lab or whatever look on

15:44.480 --> 15:49.560
eBay or with other refurbished suppliers you can get really nice high-performance hardware

15:49.560 --> 15:55.680
which doesn't even spin up the fence a lot so you can even run this in your own room.

15:55.680 --> 16:00.320
It's really nice and it's just like get on eBay and get the old stuff because the old

16:00.320 --> 16:02.320
enterprise stuff is really really good.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.120
We have the Arista 750.

16:05.120 --> 16:09.360
Out of support forever but it works and it's really really stable.

16:09.360 --> 16:11.400
We got rid of spanning tree and the network is in here.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.240
Know why we hate spanning tree.

16:13.240 --> 16:17.280
Also for the ones who don't know what Arista does, MC leg is basically you pretend you

16:17.280 --> 16:19.360
are a stack on layer 2.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.560
But if you have layer 3 you act as if you had separate devices.

16:23.560 --> 16:27.480
So you do away with all the pain of layer 2 and spanning tree and other and all the

16:27.480 --> 16:34.640
icky stuff and you get all the power of dynamic and of static routing on layer 3 and above

16:34.640 --> 16:43.560
while not having the massive pain of lacking introspection into a stacked halfway magic

16:43.560 --> 16:47.920
layer 3 stack and also not having to deal with a split layer 2.

16:47.920 --> 16:53.480
So anyone who needs some redundancy look at all the rest of us get on with MC leg.

16:53.480 --> 16:57.720
It's going to make your life so much easier and more pleasant you can't even begin to

16:57.720 --> 17:00.520
imagine.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.840
Uplink we have two uplinks now.

17:02.840 --> 17:08.720
Cold gave us a line which is fully protected so they built a ring and gave us a 10 gig

17:08.720 --> 17:14.800
from there but even if we were to cut one of the fibers which run 2D will be premises

17:14.880 --> 17:21.880
we would still have the full 10 gig just running in the other direction and also we have 10

17:21.880 --> 17:23.680
gig through destiny.

17:23.680 --> 17:28.760
There's also talks with others who might be willing to give us even more redundant upstream

17:28.760 --> 17:35.400
so we don't have this thing in the back of our head anymore that maybe something will

17:35.400 --> 17:38.080
break and we are going to be completely offline.

17:38.080 --> 17:44.000
Next year we will also hopefully have a second routing instance so even if the main router

17:44.000 --> 17:49.760
died because at the moment if I pull the plug everything is got down from your perspective.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.520
Hopefully this is also not going to be a single point of failure next year and hopefully

17:53.520 --> 17:59.040
it's going to be on open source and hopefully we will keep running on this new primary we'll

17:59.040 --> 18:00.040
see.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.240
There's plans.

18:02.240 --> 18:06.040
Hopefully the next one the next infrastructure review can go in depth on this because this

18:06.040 --> 18:12.640
again makes it even easier for you to replicate our conference without having to pay I don't

18:13.200 --> 18:16.920
know low five figures for a router.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.360
Clone our stuff.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.760
Main one is here.

18:19.760 --> 18:24.280
You can also find us a matrix you can send email blah blah blah the usual but use our

18:24.280 --> 18:29.920
stuff we don't just do this and put it out for us because we feel vanity we do this so

18:29.920 --> 18:33.840
people can copy this.

18:33.840 --> 18:37.160
We have a few minutes for questions I might need to run at some point to the highlight

18:37.160 --> 18:39.880
thing but I'll leave this one here if I do.

18:39.880 --> 18:52.800
So any questions.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.240
Just shout and I'm going to repeat.

18:56.240 --> 19:02.640
Just shout the question.

19:02.640 --> 19:08.000
The question was how many people are there you mean at foster.

19:08.000 --> 19:15.520
We don't know exactly the last time we had any good guess it was above 12 K but with

19:15.520 --> 19:21.360
privacy extensions we can't really count devices anymore so we did the thing where we counted

19:21.360 --> 19:25.840
rooms and we saw how many people at the laptops out and how many have cell phones blah blah

19:25.840 --> 19:30.680
and did the estimations from there but with privacy extensions we can't do this anymore

19:30.680 --> 19:34.640
unless we started to sell tickets control the entrance whatever and we don't want to

19:34.640 --> 19:47.240
and we can't even so way above 10 K yes yes I have this in the closing talk slides I don't

19:47.240 --> 19:52.200
have the numbers it's it's probably hundreds or it is three figures how many exactly we

19:52.200 --> 20:02.320
don't know how many volunteers was the question.

20:02.320 --> 20:07.040
And on the last year's we had those video boxes that had the small display mainly those

20:07.040 --> 20:13.440
those laptops here for displaying the information so the volunteers that are running the room

20:13.440 --> 20:18.080
they can see like what I can tell you it's the host named the uptime if everything is

20:18.080 --> 20:23.480
working and get a preview and that's what's all built into the old box and to the small

20:23.480 --> 20:29.400
display which is kind of hard to read and in this case the laptop is taking over the

20:29.400 --> 20:36.160
part of the bigger box when it comes to processing the video signal is here processed and sent

20:36.160 --> 20:42.200
as I think is a stream to the rendering farm I don't know what kind of stream they they

20:42.200 --> 20:51.320
chose for for intermediate I think it was mpk now H264 and what we do live streaming

20:51.320 --> 21:07.040
and encoded there will be AV1 and H264 I think for this year's edition.

21:07.040 --> 21:11.440
So the question was what access points do you use we use the access points that are installed

21:11.440 --> 21:17.600
by the ULB by the university here and most of the buildings these are Cisco access points

21:17.600 --> 21:23.720
that are hooked up to a Cisco WLC wireless line controller and some of the newer buildings

21:23.720 --> 21:29.560
or in some buildings they have been replaced with extreme and extreme switches switches

21:29.560 --> 21:35.560
and access points will be the way to go for ULB that's at least that's what we heard and

21:35.560 --> 21:40.920
we use their infrastructure there are two rooms the big one Jean-Saint where we bring

21:40.920 --> 21:50.000
our own Wi-Fi access points that are just connected to the to the backbone of the university

21:50.000 --> 21:57.040
the Wi-Fi controller knows those and adopts them and then just uses them for the additional

21:57.040 --> 22:02.240
amount of people that we bring in because we need more more client or higher density

22:02.240 --> 22:22.560
there.

22:22.560 --> 22:28.640
So the question was that on the main Wi-Fi network we are IPv6 only and how if we document

22:28.640 --> 22:34.480
the experiences with that yes we do that for our post-mortem because there were some glitches

22:34.480 --> 22:43.600
with we mainly we do DNS64 and NAT64 for getting you access to the old internet and we had

22:43.600 --> 22:48.880
some some problems today I think it was packages Mozilla org that we have problems because no

22:48.880 --> 22:55.360
today it was today as well and we're documenting these and everything that's get reported to us

22:55.520 --> 23:00.400
we then dive into that we have one one one of our staff members that's working at Cisco he helps us

23:00.400 --> 23:05.920
with the debugging on this side and we then checking that and also adding that to our post-mortem

23:05.920 --> 23:11.560
to see what's wrong or what has been wrong and try to fix this for the next year like content

23:11.560 --> 23:16.400
constant evolution that but also to be very blunt about this point the reason why we do this and

23:16.400 --> 23:22.480
why we've been doing this for like over half a decade by now is this is an open-source conference a

23:22.480 --> 23:26.800
lot of people who work on the Linux kernel on network management all the components are here

23:27.920 --> 23:33.200
we want to break stuff and we don't want to plaster stuff over we want the others to fix

23:33.200 --> 23:38.560
their stuff because now we have the actual engineers who can drive chains change through the

23:38.560 --> 23:44.080
companies through the projects through the whatever from the ground up and this works really really well

23:53.440 --> 24:02.080
as soon as we don't know but if you send to video at so the question was what the what the lag is

24:02.080 --> 24:06.880
in our in our pipeline how long does it take until we have to stream out at the viewers

24:07.920 --> 24:13.680
send email to video at foster morgue or join or just ask in the in the matrix somewhere we'll pick

24:13.680 --> 24:21.360
it up but it might take two weeks but I think speaking in youtube terms I think we're still

24:21.360 --> 24:28.960
allowed to to call it a live stream if you know if you mean by that it's hundreds of milliseconds

24:28.960 --> 24:40.080
top I think you were first the question was do we have statistics how many people use ipv6 versus

24:40.080 --> 24:47.200
ipv4 before no we don't because we due to privacy extensions we we can't know but we can tell you is

24:47.200 --> 24:54.480
that in the early days most people were in foster do foster dual stack and these days most people

24:54.480 --> 24:58.640
are in foster and I honestly think most of them don't even realize it's ipv6 only

25:05.600 --> 25:11.600
so the question was if we have if we are planning to change the dual stack name to legacy next year

25:11.600 --> 25:16.960
no we had this initially so when I made the whole change and everything I named the I named

25:17.680 --> 25:23.360
I named them foster and foster legacy and I switched this over after like three or four years because

25:25.440 --> 25:32.640
a the technically precise and correct term is dual stack and b there is no huge use in

25:32.640 --> 25:36.720
shaming people for something and also we had some issues with people not using it because they

25:36.720 --> 25:43.040
thought it might be 2.4g and like all kinds of weird stuff but in the end there is no use in

25:43.040 --> 25:49.760
shaming people for this if people use foster as the main thing and most do perfect and they're

25:49.760 --> 25:55.440
going to fix stuff as they go hopefully okay I need to leave to our next thing but I'm going to leave

25:55.440 --> 26:08.560
foster here thank you see you so I'm happy to take any more questions if you just leave leave quietly

26:13.520 --> 26:14.800
yeah please

26:26.400 --> 26:33.360
say so the question is what would I tell folks that are organizing conferences like this but

26:33.360 --> 26:40.080
using proprietary software I would just show them how we run it and what our learnings are from that

26:40.080 --> 26:45.920
and how we engage with the community for example for next year with with the routing thing we've

26:45.920 --> 26:50.960
we've been I don't know who of you has been to the networking dev room they're amazing guys there

26:51.760 --> 26:56.160
and we talked about them how can we replace this routing engine hardware routing engine can we do

26:56.160 --> 27:01.840
something in in in software and yes there is a solution that we found here with the colleagues

27:01.840 --> 27:07.600
and maybe we can show them how they if this is some sort of conference where where it's about

27:07.600 --> 27:14.000
programming or or networking or whatever maybe we can show them yes that can be done all open

27:14.000 --> 27:20.720
source and you get the features that you don't have yet you might get them when you just talk to

27:20.720 --> 27:35.040
the people and and encourage them to work with you yeah yes they're up there

27:44.000 --> 27:55.120
so if I understood it correctly is what's the use for the servers that we have and what is running

27:55.120 --> 28:05.600
there or so I can tell you what's currently running there this is mostly the monitoring

28:05.600 --> 28:13.840
stuff that we do monitoring alerting we have some sort of storage there that we just can have backup

28:13.920 --> 28:22.080
of the the data that that is produced from the laptops here we do the dns 64 things in software

28:22.080 --> 28:27.760
on those machines and these are the main use cases and also hosting our dns infrastructure from here

28:27.760 --> 28:34.000
where we can then just push out our dns the author name service for the conference are in this room

28:34.000 --> 28:40.640
and this is basically the the services that the service need to need to do things like dhcp for

28:40.720 --> 28:46.800
printers yes we have printers and for the payment terminals and things like that this is the the

28:46.800 --> 28:53.040
sort of traffic order what they need to do when they on those machines hope that answers a question

28:53.680 --> 28:54.000
okay

28:57.440 --> 28:59.120
so yes you again

29:11.360 --> 29:23.120
okay

29:29.120 --> 29:36.400
it's a bit it's a bit low on the audio level I can maybe we can just walk here and then I can

29:36.400 --> 29:40.160
understand your your question yeah okay that's fine

29:46.400 --> 29:46.560
yes

30:07.120 --> 30:08.560
or

30:12.000 --> 30:17.440
okay so the question is that we tear down stuff over the year or after the the conference and

30:17.440 --> 30:24.240
what's staying at the ulb and whatnot and everything that's inside the rooms that are not the room

30:24.240 --> 30:31.040
where the server is sitting will be removed from from the from the from the buildings and the service

30:31.120 --> 30:36.160
will be kept there the routers will be kept there one of the switches that you saw earlier on one

30:36.160 --> 30:42.720
of the slides they he will be removed as well but he would just goes to the to the to the the rack

30:42.720 --> 30:48.400
because we have this switch we need to clean up the the the rendering farm and then this

30:48.400 --> 30:54.000
switch will just be moved to the rack where it's sitting without power and but the rest will stay

30:54.000 --> 31:06.160
here over the year currently

31:10.400 --> 31:17.360
the years before we hadn't that that big team that could take care of that stuff over the years and

31:17.360 --> 31:23.680
I've just been taking that over last year and from what I've heard and what I what others told me that

31:24.000 --> 31:30.320
this wreck wasn't there permanently we just had it since six years or so and since then we can

31:30.320 --> 31:36.640
actually host stuff through the year here and the years before they were just piling it up in the

31:36.640 --> 31:43.120
room and and building building a tower of hardware and then just taking it back after the conference

31:43.120 --> 31:49.120
and since we have this wreck and it's also it has locks so we can just lock it and no one can can

31:49.920 --> 31:55.520
to crazy stuff with it since then we are trying to to have it sitting here

31:56.800 --> 32:02.560
running it most of the time most of the stuff will be turned off to to it's not necessary to have

32:02.560 --> 32:08.640
all the servers running and waste energy so the plan is also for the next year is to keep it like

32:08.640 --> 32:14.640
that remove the two servers to save some energy and just have it here and what has been done before

32:14.640 --> 32:20.240
like ripping it out and building it from scratch this is one of the things that we don't want to

32:20.240 --> 32:31.920
do anymore because we have a stable setup now and it's working yeah thanks thanks okay for everyone

32:31.920 --> 32:38.000
who's leaving the room I think we can start you can take the cables with you or can we start tearing

32:38.000 --> 32:48.000
it down or that work excellent okay okay

32:51.760 --> 32:58.000
there will be some more talks in the Jean Saint building like the closing talk if you want to go

32:58.000 --> 33:04.080
just down the hallway and there's a secret passage at the end of the hallway we just turn right on

33:04.080 --> 33:12.080
the last door and then you're in Chanson enjoy foster
