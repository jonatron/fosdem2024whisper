WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.360
Welcome folks, we're on the final leg of Faust tomorrow, so hopefully we keep you awake.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.200
So I'm delighted here to be chatting today with a good friend of mine, Phyllisys, around

00:16.200 --> 00:22.000
something that we're both quite passionate about.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.920
I suppose from our experiences out in the open source, you know, when we first got involved

00:26.920 --> 00:32.200
and we got through it as we go along, and then, you know, just working with the community,

00:32.200 --> 00:37.680
collaborating with folks, and then seeing, realizing how we can bring that into our

00:37.680 --> 00:43.880
companies and bring that culture to help, you know, things get done better for one

00:43.880 --> 00:45.400
to a better world.

00:45.400 --> 00:55.200
Okay, so, so I'm Arton and I work over, I'm a developer over at IBM, and for the last

00:55.200 --> 00:59.400
about eight to ten years I've been in the cloud native space, and I've later started

00:59.400 --> 01:01.880
getting involved in AI as well.

01:01.880 --> 01:09.440
Yeah, and I'm Phyll, also a long time, we're both old guys now, a long time working as

01:09.440 --> 01:15.520
software developers, but, you know, done a lot in the, again, cloud native space, that's

01:15.520 --> 01:19.280
even though Martin and I worked at IBM together, that's really where we're connected over

01:19.280 --> 01:20.280
open source.

01:20.600 --> 01:26.520
Now I'm at AWS, still focused on open source, and we thought we'd start with really just

01:26.520 --> 01:28.520
kind of how we got our start.

01:28.520 --> 01:33.400
Again, we started our careers a very long time ago, we're not involved in open source for

01:33.400 --> 01:37.160
a good long part of our careers doing software development.

01:37.160 --> 01:45.440
For me, it was around 2014 that I had joined a new group in IBM that was focused more on

01:45.520 --> 01:50.720
open source, doing some work in OpenStack and Cloud Foundry, and this new thing called

01:50.720 --> 01:56.440
Docker came out, and I was asked to go check out this new technology, see if we could get

01:56.440 --> 02:00.480
involved, I became a contributor, and in essence I got hooked.

02:00.480 --> 02:05.080
I loved open source, I'd been a long time Linux user, but this was really my first experience

02:05.080 --> 02:12.400
contributing, making pull requests, reviewing code, helping others in the community, and

02:12.480 --> 02:18.960
that's led to the last 10 years of working in the OCI and CNCF and the Container D project

02:18.960 --> 02:20.520
where I'm a maintainer as well.

02:21.880 --> 02:28.160
So yeah, similar to Phil, I was working on Cloud Orchestration product that built on top

02:28.160 --> 02:34.800
of OpenStack about 2013, so we were downstream, we were building on it, and then I got an

02:34.800 --> 02:41.280
opportunity to say, okay, can we extend Horizon, which was the desktop at the time for OpenStack,

02:41.360 --> 02:46.560
it probably still is, and I remember the first conference I went to was over in Atlanta,

02:46.560 --> 02:50.400
I think someone fell off the bus, to be honest, because my manager came to me on a Friday

02:50.400 --> 02:55.880
evening of a long weekend to say, do you want to go to Atlanta to a conference the following

02:55.880 --> 02:57.840
weekend, do you know what to head over?

02:57.840 --> 03:02.920
So I went, and I was just blown away, and I think it was the whole collaboration of folks

03:02.920 --> 03:08.480
and all that, and then as I went into the community and I started then contributing into the Neutron,

03:08.560 --> 03:15.560
which was networking, and if you've ever worked with networking folks, they really are into

03:15.560 --> 03:20.280
the black arts, and they really take networking seriously, and I always felt like I'm going

03:20.280 --> 03:27.040
to get funged out here, because I don't care about IP4 or IP6, I just record, but it was

03:27.040 --> 03:31.920
a great experience, and they really made me feel welcome, I remember we had a meet-up,

03:31.920 --> 03:36.600
there was meet-ups at the time over in Rochester, Minnesota, and the work I worked on, they

03:36.720 --> 03:39.720
came up to me a lot and they maintained the same, we really liked what you've done, we

03:39.720 --> 03:43.520
really liked the fact that you took it on the chain when responses came back to you,

03:43.520 --> 03:47.480
you didn't get upset, you just moved on, you made the changes and go again, and then going

03:47.480 --> 03:52.080
to Hallways forward a few years then on to getting involved in Kubernetes and in the

03:52.080 --> 03:56.280
Helm community, and being really welcomed in there, being part of the Helm Tree release

03:56.280 --> 04:00.120
going out, and then becoming a maintainer in the community, and getting to actually talk

04:00.120 --> 04:07.120
at San Diego, which was a fabulous experience, so yeah, it's been great, you know.

04:10.800 --> 04:12.800
This is where his fancy clicker does the work.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.800
Yeah, a clicker's being unresponsive, sorry.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.300
Use the buttons.

04:18.300 --> 04:25.300
So why do companies need to cultivate a culture of open source?

04:26.300 --> 04:32.300
And I suppose the key one here is, and you get lost a lot of the time, I know we bang

04:32.940 --> 04:39.940
on about it in the community the whole lot is that, you know, nearly every company today

04:39.940 --> 04:46.940
producing software is, or are probably built on top of an open source stack, so if you're

04:47.380 --> 04:53.740
consuming it, you know, you're really involved in communities, sorry, you're involved in

04:53.740 --> 04:59.740
using communities, but you need to look at, you know, how do you feed that back into the

04:59.740 --> 05:04.020
community as well, because if you're using the stacks, if something goes wrong in the

05:04.020 --> 05:08.940
stack and you haven't been helping in those communities, then you don't really have a

05:08.940 --> 05:12.100
leg to fall back on.

05:12.100 --> 05:18.300
The other part of that is the amount of, when you're building on these stacks, you're building

05:18.300 --> 05:23.260
on the shoulders of people who put in hundreds and hundreds of hours.

05:23.260 --> 05:27.980
So you're getting a real lot of value here to build your product on top of it, where

05:27.980 --> 05:33.300
you can concentrate on your product, where you can drive it forward and that you may

05:33.300 --> 05:37.820
not have all the people in the community to do the good work for you like you're getting

05:37.820 --> 05:42.100
from the community.

05:42.100 --> 05:48.100
As you can see up here, there is so much open source out there, and that's coming from Linux,

05:48.820 --> 05:53.060
over the last 100 years, definitely from the Linux community, because maybe prior to that

05:53.060 --> 05:56.060
in the 90s, there's a bit more niche, the amount of people that were involved in open

05:56.060 --> 06:01.820
source, but definitely the Linux foundation community, up along through open stack, up

06:01.820 --> 06:07.460
along, it has really opened the door for people to contribute into communities, and it's

06:07.460 --> 06:14.460
created a real momentum and shift that, you know, if anything we, I suppose, that came

06:14.780 --> 06:21.780
out of log4j was that we realized that it's open source software is in every product around

06:22.620 --> 06:25.220
there, and we need to be aware of that.

06:25.220 --> 06:31.740
The final one then is, and this is very important for your customers, is most customers don't

06:31.740 --> 06:37.580
want vendor locking anymore, and open telemetry is a great example of that. It took a long

06:37.580 --> 06:43.300
time to come up with, there's been multiple standards in the telemetry space, but open

06:43.340 --> 06:48.380
telemetry has been probably the fourth standard where the different vendors have bought in

06:48.380 --> 06:55.380
and decided to work together, and a lot of clients know they want to be able to write

06:57.260 --> 07:03.300
their telemetry metric generations, their telemetry generations, or sorry, their generation

07:03.300 --> 07:09.300
of data once and use whatever back in they want. They don't want to be coming back again,

07:09.300 --> 07:14.820
having to change code and so forth to look to do observability and maintainability. They

07:14.820 --> 07:20.340
want to be able to have that, path finger Newton, and then use the particular back in

07:20.340 --> 07:22.060
they want after that.

07:22.060 --> 07:27.140
Yeah, so it's coming into the community dev room, it feels maybe like we're preaching

07:27.140 --> 07:32.540
to the choir, many of you here, you know, fully agree with the why, you know, why do we do

07:32.540 --> 07:36.820
open source, why do companies need to do open source, but I thought one extra data point

07:36.860 --> 07:42.060
on top of what Martin was just talking about is a report that just came out a year and

07:42.060 --> 07:49.060
a half ago that had this amazing stat that 82% of companies are looking for a vendor

07:49.740 --> 07:56.140
who's not just like Martin said, and like we all know, everyone's consuming open source,

07:56.140 --> 08:01.420
but 82% said they'd like to select a vendor who's actually participating upstream in an

08:01.460 --> 08:06.380
open source community. And then there were a bunch of responses about why, you know,

08:06.380 --> 08:11.780
oh, because, you know, they're familiar with open source processes or they're helping sustain

08:11.780 --> 08:17.740
a community of something that I'm depending on. And we definitely have experienced that,

08:17.740 --> 08:23.300
you know, working on container D for myself that was used in IBM's Kubernetes engine.

08:23.300 --> 08:29.980
It's used in several AWS container compute offerings. And AWS and IBM wants people who

08:30.020 --> 08:34.140
are active in that community so that we can fix problems so that, you know, like this

08:34.140 --> 08:40.140
last response from vendors, 46% said, I'm choosing a vendor that contributes because

08:40.140 --> 08:45.020
I know when I hit a problem, I can depend on that vendor because they have people in

08:45.020 --> 08:48.700
the open source community. And I think Martin, you had an example of that.

08:48.700 --> 08:51.620
Yeah, I have a little example, I can touch them because I didn't want to go near the

08:51.620 --> 08:57.500
stats that I feel was thrown out there because was it 46% of people didn't want it or they

08:57.540 --> 09:02.780
did want it. Sorry, I was a bit confused. No, on a serious note, the final point there

09:02.780 --> 09:08.100
is very telling about a year and a half ago, I was working with a partner and they were

09:08.100 --> 09:11.780
getting involved with us at the time. And they were really, really technical. They knew

09:11.780 --> 09:16.620
their stuff and they were a dream to work with being a technical person where, you know,

09:16.620 --> 09:20.900
they told us they told me what they were looking for. I had them alone. But one evening anyway,

09:20.900 --> 09:27.500
they were using the operator SDK from the operator framework, which is in the CNCF.

09:27.500 --> 09:35.260
And they found the bulk. And before the engineer and that engineer was on North American time,

09:35.260 --> 09:40.020
so he'd gone home to bed. He raised the issue and then he came up along. So I came in the

09:40.020 --> 09:43.820
next morning and was one of those lovely mornings, I didn't even have the coffee and he was like,

09:43.820 --> 09:49.460
oh my God, I'm doing this, you know, but I thought he was brilliant. They put it out there to say,

09:49.500 --> 09:54.780
that's great. All I went, I worked away and he took me on maybe two days to narrow down the

09:54.780 --> 10:01.340
bog, get the fix in. But for that partner that I was able to jump out there, make a fix. It wasn't

10:01.340 --> 10:05.060
a big issue. The big issue was just finding where the thing was as always. Once you find this,

10:05.060 --> 10:09.740
usually the solution isn't so bad. And then just working with the community getting in. And I think

10:09.740 --> 10:15.900
they really appreciated that fact. And you know, most of our customers out there and clients and

10:15.940 --> 10:19.860
so forth, they're very, very technical. They know their stuff. So they're not going to be hoodwinked.

10:19.860 --> 10:27.860
Yep. So yeah, Martin, you're going to take, you know, we've talked a little about companies,

10:27.860 --> 10:34.420
but why do employees care about involvement in open source? And this is, this is a lovely thing.

10:34.420 --> 10:39.500
And it's from my experiences. And when I talk in a while, we've a jumpstart program to help people

10:39.500 --> 10:48.540
get involved in open source is it's an amazing kind of, you know, I hate to use the word organic

10:48.540 --> 10:55.900
and just throw it around there, but it's a great way for somebody to get opportunities that they

10:55.900 --> 11:00.140
may not get within their own company. Because sometimes, you know, in companies or in teams and

11:00.140 --> 11:05.540
stuff, you know, things are rigid or certain ways or maybe, you know, sometimes it's like a public

11:05.580 --> 11:10.100
service for one do a better work where they know I've been there 10 years, so I'm entitled to do this or

11:10.100 --> 11:17.540
whatever. But for me, I just the ability to get opportunities either to speak at conferences, to

11:17.540 --> 11:22.060
meet people on different topics, to suddenly be involved in conversations that, you know, you

11:22.060 --> 11:28.180
taught were for, you know, somebody who is way more experiencing you is just amazing. It also gives

11:28.180 --> 11:33.020
people that ability to work on, you know, you may work in certain technology in your company, but

11:33.060 --> 11:36.740
then all of a sudden you're exposed to these technologies that are out here. And Phil said it

11:36.740 --> 11:41.620
there, like, when we first go out in the communities, you know, everyone's, get up, there's no

11:41.620 --> 11:45.700
problem to that. When you first go to get up, you're playing around with it, or you go out into

11:46.540 --> 11:51.180
USB IRC, but you're open to Slack now, whatever, like, it's a bit, you know, it's a big

11:51.380 --> 11:55.900
challenge when you first start out there and you're trying to engage and so forth. But it really

11:55.900 --> 12:01.900
gives you an opportunity to know how to collaborate with people and work with people, because it's

12:01.900 --> 12:06.540
not always about the technology. It's not always about contributions. It's a collaboration as

12:06.540 --> 12:12.340
well. Because at the end of the day, in your own company, you know, Bob or Mary beside you, they're

12:12.340 --> 12:18.860
paid to, you know, to work with you. When you're on the communities, you know, if, you know, people

12:18.860 --> 12:23.580
will only work with you if you're a decent person to work with. So you get that, you get those

12:23.580 --> 12:27.980
opportunities. And the funny thing I'd say is, just the friendship you made, as Phil said there, we

12:28.020 --> 12:32.900
worked in the same company, we met each other at Open Slack. And over the years, we never worked

12:32.900 --> 12:37.780
together internally, but we'd meet each other at, you know, KubeCon somewhere or some other

12:37.780 --> 12:41.740
conference or like Fosdom here again, and we get a chance to talk together. So I think that's

12:41.740 --> 12:42.100
lovely.

12:42.460 --> 12:42.860
Yep.

12:43.900 --> 12:47.260
And we usually take an old man selfie together. You make me do that.

12:47.580 --> 12:50.260
Yeah, he just wants it because he's got hair still in, I don't.

12:51.260 --> 12:58.100
All right, so we've talked a bit about the why. Just a few points. You know, what does it mean?

12:58.140 --> 13:03.700
What does it mean that a company has an open source culture, some kind of way that they're

13:03.740 --> 13:09.260
they're doing things to encourage open source involvement? One is just the simple fact that

13:09.260 --> 13:14.660
you're contributing back in some way. You know, you have employees who have a pathway. And I know

13:14.700 --> 13:21.580
there's probably a bunch of amazing Ospo leaders here or have been active in this room. You're

13:21.580 --> 13:27.020
making, you know, policies and capabilities, making it possible for people to do that in a sort

13:27.020 --> 13:36.220
of a clear way. You may create open source projects. I've had the pleasure AWS to be involved in

13:36.220 --> 13:40.740
creating two new open source projects that we've shared. We've gotten other people to collaborate.

13:40.780 --> 13:48.140
We're continuing to build those. And then, you know, there's the whole aspect of not just that

13:48.140 --> 13:52.860
you're allowing it, but there's some kind of encouragement. There's some way that employees

13:52.860 --> 13:59.060
who do open source don't feel like they're they're sort of stuck on a different track than

13:59.060 --> 14:03.860
everyone else. Like a promotion is harder because I'm mostly doing open source, and I'm not, you

14:03.860 --> 14:10.260
know, providing for the bottom line. And really that connects that there's some value, some, some

14:10.260 --> 14:16.260
incentive that employees think, you know, choosing to work on open source is just as valuable as,

14:16.260 --> 14:24.820
as, you know, being on a product team or working on a service. And then, you know, I think one of

14:24.820 --> 14:30.700
the cool things I've seen both at IBM, you mentioned the partner story, we have a group of AWS

14:30.700 --> 14:37.260
focused around actually collaborating with other vendors and customers and partners trying to not

14:37.300 --> 14:42.620
just do things between ourselves, but say, hey, join us in this community, and let's work on this

14:42.620 --> 14:48.260
together. And so, you know, these are, again, there's probably a lot more. But really, these are

14:48.260 --> 14:53.380
some of the keys that you would look for is, you know, what does it mean to even have an open

14:53.380 --> 15:00.300
source culture? Just going back in that last night to finish there is, you know, generally,

15:00.300 --> 15:05.500
partners are really, really on the ball technically, and they're really got the air to

15:05.540 --> 15:11.020
ground with their customers. They want to give the customers exactly what they want. And for them,

15:11.020 --> 15:19.820
open source is always that easier path to do and stuff. And it's the way they want to do it. So,

15:19.820 --> 15:28.460
you know, it is in your benefit to be able to engage like that. So how can you do this? So I've

15:28.500 --> 15:35.380
been very lucky in that a number of years ago, two great colleagues, Matt Rizowski and Anne Graham,

15:35.380 --> 15:45.660
came up with the idea for a junk star program. And the idea was that, you know, for early

15:45.660 --> 15:54.500
professionals, we'll get a chance to do a course for about nine weeks where there'd be an intro for

15:54.540 --> 16:00.580
the first two weeks, for so I'll tell them we're open source and how to contribute to open source

16:00.580 --> 16:05.420
and how to use open source and then particular projects and to pick one. And the goal being to

16:05.420 --> 16:10.220
get to push a PR out there. Now, you're probably, you know, if you've been open source, well,

16:10.220 --> 16:15.380
you go PR, but you forgot about the very first time you try to get that PR rate, especially if

16:15.380 --> 16:18.540
you took a while, you're probably looking at your GitHub, you were probably on your phone going,

16:18.540 --> 16:24.140
come on, review it, get it in there, you know. And it is still like we've all had that experience,

16:24.180 --> 16:27.500
I wish that we'd get in there and then you get to a stage and you're like, sure, if they leave it

16:27.500 --> 16:32.740
in, they leave it in, if they don't, I'm okay. But you know, and it's just giving people the

16:32.740 --> 16:40.580
confidence and as I say, we started with early professionals and now we've gone to experience

16:40.580 --> 16:46.340
folks because we realize they want the chance, especially, I don't know, maybe if you're, you

16:46.340 --> 16:53.380
know, as old as I feel there and myself, you know what I mean? You may have got caught in the

16:53.420 --> 16:59.380
rutter work or you might have got opportunities and I've seen people that come and see this and go,

16:59.380 --> 17:03.980
I wish I'd seen this years ago. You know what I mean? You know, they see the potential, they see

17:03.980 --> 17:09.300
the opportunities, they see where, you know what, I can take off here, you know, and it gives people

17:09.300 --> 17:14.700
that go. So the biggest thing is informing your company, tell them about open source and the

17:14.700 --> 17:21.020
benefits of it. The next part then is introducing that into your company, the tools and practices

17:21.060 --> 17:26.300
because things don't work in open source if the practices and the way people work and the tools

17:26.300 --> 17:31.140
are using are chunky or awkward because you have to remember here, it's people all over the world

17:31.140 --> 17:35.900
and all different companies, all right? You know, you have to find a common ground and a common way

17:35.900 --> 17:40.660
of working and a lot of companies know you can hear inner sources coming out all over the piss

17:40.660 --> 17:44.820
and you know, sometimes you hear, you'd swear inner source was something that's started, you know,

17:44.820 --> 17:50.340
that just grew from the sky, whereas to be honest, all you're doing is taking the first word of

17:50.380 --> 17:55.620
open source and changing it. You know what I mean? So the value has been seen here by companies that

17:55.620 --> 18:00.740
it's the collaboration, I think, more than anything. And you know, if your teams have been

18:00.740 --> 18:05.980
struggling or they've been finding a hard to get stuff out the door, that when they really start

18:05.980 --> 18:11.660
buying into this, they realize here, look, you know, one boat lives on. It's not about the individual,

18:11.660 --> 18:17.900
it's about the greater good. So I think that's important. The last two here, educating folks,

18:17.940 --> 18:23.940
okay? And like I said about the jumpstart, we had, look, some people, and I always talk when we do

18:23.940 --> 18:27.540
the jumpstart, you know, we have, we have weekly stand-ups for a half an hour or an hour and I

18:27.540 --> 18:31.860
said to folks, look, this is not like school. If you don't have the stuff done or you haven't made

18:31.860 --> 18:36.180
progress, please attend anyway, and we'll help you on block. But I always make that story. So when

18:36.180 --> 18:41.020
they come in and they'll have a PR push literally in the first week, and someone else is struggling

18:41.020 --> 18:45.940
because, you know, their kids are sick or they're gone on holidays or work has been really busy,

18:46.140 --> 18:50.380
but giving them the opportunity to be able to say right. And I always use the story of the hair

18:50.380 --> 18:55.940
and the tortoise, okay? You know, everyone gets there on their own time. And the last bit then is

18:55.940 --> 19:01.660
around and Phil touch on it. You really need to have a pat in your company that when people

19:01.660 --> 19:04.780
contribute to open source, because they're doing serious work out there. It's not someone out

19:04.780 --> 19:08.580
there having parties, even though people do go to parties, you know, I see John Willicky up there

19:08.700 --> 19:16.500
at the USSF party last night. So but on a serious note, you need to be able to give a

19:16.500 --> 19:22.220
sanctify and say to people you're doing really good work here. Well done. Yeah, and I just one

19:22.220 --> 19:30.460
thing to add to that. You know, Martin talked about the jumpstart program at IBM. We have an

19:30.460 --> 19:35.940
open source talent task force at AWS that just kicked off in the last year. We have an amazing

19:36.180 --> 19:42.260
Ospo and Nithya Ruff, many of you know her. And just trying to think about how to actually

19:42.260 --> 19:46.220
include HR in these discussions about, you know, what does it mean to have open source

19:46.220 --> 19:53.380
maintainers on your staff? How do you treat them differently than, you know, other parts of the

19:53.380 --> 19:58.260
company? How do you incentivize them in the same way that maybe other employees are incentivized?

19:58.260 --> 20:04.540
And then, yeah, just a lot of the practical education parts. Is there a way for open source,

20:05.020 --> 20:10.180
you know, newbies, so to speak, to get mentored to get, you know, and I do a lot of mentoring,

20:10.180 --> 20:16.500
we've built a small container runtime team at AWS, where I mentor some of those younger

20:16.500 --> 20:22.420
engineers. And with them, we've created like an open source hour, actually, I think it's two or

20:22.420 --> 20:29.740
three hours now, where the there's sort of an open, you know, video call, and, you know, the guy

20:29.780 --> 20:36.980
that's three weeks into the, into the job, you know, he's just created his GitHub ID. And he's

20:36.980 --> 20:41.260
like, I don't even know what to do. But he can join this call. And there's others on the team,

20:41.260 --> 20:46.780
who are like, here's an issue, you know, go read the issue. Let's help you figure out, you know,

20:46.780 --> 20:52.140
how to get your get set up and clone the repository. And, and so, you know, these are the practical

20:52.140 --> 20:57.380
sort of nuts and bolts of like how to get people involved, how to get them educated, how to get

20:57.420 --> 21:02.780
them incentivized. And again, I'm sure there's there's ways, you know, your companies are doing

21:02.780 --> 21:08.780
that. And, you know, I think this is an area where I think it'd be awesome to see more sharing of

21:08.780 --> 21:15.100
practices. You know, what are you doing in your company to incentivize and educate for open source?

21:15.100 --> 21:22.140
And just one little thing on that is one size doesn't fit all. So, you know, I'm way a laugh at

21:22.140 --> 21:27.140
that is I saw I know if it wants to fit all or one size fit most, I think is what it said,

21:27.140 --> 21:33.860
but no, I was mentoring a person work a couple of years ago, just one to one. And, you know,

21:33.860 --> 21:37.620
he noticed I was in helm and he said, all right, I want to get involved in him. So the very first

21:37.620 --> 21:40.820
meeting we had, he said, right, I want to get in the helm or whatever. And then I said to him, I

21:40.820 --> 21:45.820
said, do you know what you do? Pick five projects in order of your preference and come back to me.

21:45.820 --> 21:50.980
And I'd say he was a bit stunned. He told me afterwards, he said that was the worst he taught

21:50.980 --> 21:54.980
at the time, the worst mentor and he ever got was he comes in, and I tell him come up with five

21:55.020 --> 22:00.500
things goodbye. I'll meet you next week. So off he went. And he came back with the five things. And

22:00.500 --> 22:05.900
lo and behold, helm was not in the list of five things. He had interest in other stuff. All

22:05.900 --> 22:11.940
right. But I kind of knew that I wanted that person to know what they wanted to get involved in. So

22:11.940 --> 22:17.300
they went away and got involved in tech on. And they made a couple of contributions and they were

22:17.300 --> 22:21.980
doing a bit of work. But as the months went on, I didn't notice him jumping to the committer, you

22:21.980 --> 22:27.500
know, getting more a serial contributor, reviewing more and more. And I eventually said to him about

22:27.500 --> 22:31.060
six, seven months in, I said, look, what's the story? And he said to me, said I was afraid to tell

22:31.060 --> 22:35.780
you, but I don't like tech time. Now that's nothing against tech time. And if you're in tech time,

22:35.780 --> 22:41.300
do not attack me on the way home this evening. All right. But he was honest. And we found out

22:41.300 --> 22:47.300
afterwards he was more interested in K native. And once he got into K native, because he wanted to

22:47.340 --> 22:53.300
do it, he flourished. And he's doing unbelievable well after all. And you know what I mean? Every

22:53.300 --> 22:57.620
known again, he meets me says thanks for helping out. And you know what? That's relatable. Give him

22:57.620 --> 23:04.020
someone to help and listen to him, not telling him what to do. Yeah, Phil, you do it. Sorry. No

23:04.020 --> 23:09.420
problem. Yeah, we got a couple minutes left. We thought we'd connect. You know, we talked about

23:09.420 --> 23:15.020
how we got involved in open source initially. You know, kind of the where are we now? For me, you

23:15.060 --> 23:21.780
know, I've been now 10 years in, you know, almost spending the bulk of my time focused on open

23:21.780 --> 23:29.180
source as a project maintainer as a technical oversight board member in the OCI, a CNCF ambassador,

23:29.780 --> 23:35.540
and then focusing, you know, all the things I've learned trying to help others at AWS similar to

23:35.540 --> 23:41.140
what I did when I was at IBM, being a subject matter expert, helping other teams were figure out,

23:41.380 --> 23:45.460
hey, we have an open source project. We like to launch. Can you help us think through what that

23:45.460 --> 23:51.500
looks like? So it's kind of an exciting point for me to feel like I'm almost more focused on helping

23:51.500 --> 23:56.460
others now than so much, you know, trying to get involved in open source myself.

23:57.700 --> 24:02.140
Yeah, a bit like Phil, I didn't put the specifics in our general digital shows, you know, left hand,

24:02.140 --> 24:08.860
right hand doing different things as we fill it in. But, you know, for me, I think it's been, you

24:08.900 --> 24:13.660
know, people believe in me, helping me in the communities and know a chance to help other folks

24:13.660 --> 24:18.700
do it. That gives me great joy when I when we do the jumpstart and I come in on a Monday and I'm

24:18.700 --> 24:23.260
pissed off for whatever reason, because it's a Monday, maybe, you know, it's just to get the joy of

24:23.260 --> 24:27.740
helping folks and then also being able to help teams internally if they need a hand with open

24:27.740 --> 24:33.820
source. So to just finish out, okay, there are no free dinners in life, my dad, you saw with saying.

24:34.780 --> 24:42.620
And he's right. If you're going to consume something, give back, because it's the best way of driving

24:42.620 --> 24:49.500
things forward and knowing what's going on. What we've learned from working in open sources,

24:50.620 --> 24:55.420
and for me, definitely, is collaboration, the ability to work together, no matter where we're

24:55.420 --> 25:02.220
from, who we are, it doesn't matter. As long as you're a decent person, you're willing to work away,

25:02.300 --> 25:07.500
you know, you will get things done. And that's what team works about. All the best teams, especially

25:07.500 --> 25:11.740
sport teams, I'm going to land at Lorna, don't worry, especially sport teams, all right,

25:12.940 --> 25:18.940
they work the best when everybody is willing to do the job that they need to do, not they don't

25:18.940 --> 25:24.540
have to be the heroes. And finally, it's a great place for people to grow in their careers and

25:24.540 --> 25:29.020
their life. And if you're a senior leader or someone who's in the community that's done really,

25:29.020 --> 25:32.940
really great stuff, please help other people because that's what life is about.

25:33.580 --> 25:45.100
Great, Margot. Awesome, thank you. Q&A, I will run this back and forth. Any other questions?

25:49.660 --> 25:51.580
There'll be a few jelly babies in for you.

25:52.380 --> 25:56.380
Yes.

26:01.260 --> 26:06.540
What is the biggest community lesson you learned from OpenSack and how have you seen that applied

26:06.540 --> 26:10.300
in open source projects that have gotten large since, like for example, Kubernetes?

26:12.300 --> 26:17.340
Well, you're handing that to me. Well, you spent more time in OpenSack than I did. I feel like I didn't.

26:21.660 --> 26:23.100
I actually can't answer that question.

26:25.820 --> 26:33.820
No, no, no, no. I suppose, like from my experience, OpenSack, I had really great experiences from

26:33.820 --> 26:38.460
it. I thought the collaboration was really, really good there. And I think that was brought forward

26:38.460 --> 26:45.020
into the cloud native communities afterwards like Kubernetes, etc. So I think a lot of folks went

26:45.020 --> 26:50.140
and worked in in the Kubernetes communities with new people that came in. But I think the key at

26:50.220 --> 26:56.700
all times was that people understand that collaboration and being decent to each other and

26:56.700 --> 27:01.180
that you're trying to work towards the bigger thing. We don't need heroes in other words.

27:03.020 --> 27:09.660
Thank you. Anyone else?

27:12.540 --> 27:16.140
Can't be good. Either we did really well or people are bored out of their lives.

27:16.140 --> 27:27.100
Yeah, very possible. Okay. Thanks very much. You need folks and thank you.
