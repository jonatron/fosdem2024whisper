WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.200
And I also do believe that with this we can open up the discussion a bit so that we turn

00:12.200 --> 00:13.840
this panel into a fishbowl.

00:13.840 --> 00:17.920
So that's basically the idea and I want to do this together with Karen.

00:17.920 --> 00:22.480
Maybe you first introduce yourself and then we explain a bit what we are trying to achieve.

00:22.480 --> 00:29.960
Hi, I'm Karen and I have been sort of coming to not fuss them, but digital events.

00:29.960 --> 00:35.760
I was saying to Walter I could have worn a t-shirt like his, but a different model, different

00:35.760 --> 00:40.560
size from the CCC.

00:40.560 --> 00:47.520
I got engaged in sort of trying to figure out how tech influences society and then I

00:47.520 --> 00:49.400
got into politics.

00:49.400 --> 00:52.920
And now I'm in the European Parliament for the Liberal Group and was working together

00:52.920 --> 00:59.080
with Jules on ensuring that open source was included into the PLD in some of the last

00:59.080 --> 01:05.240
sort of shadow meetings and trilogues by taking text from the CRA.

01:05.240 --> 01:09.720
And it's quite apt that I'm in a fishbowl because politicians have so much going on

01:09.720 --> 01:13.280
that they're a little bit like goldfish, so you need to remind them and keep telling them

01:13.280 --> 01:16.640
what they need to know.

01:16.640 --> 01:21.160
And with this, so a fishbowl discussion means that normally we have these panel discussions

01:21.160 --> 01:26.000
and then you are happy to ask questions and then panelists address them somehow and basically

01:26.000 --> 01:27.760
we talk about ourselves.

01:27.760 --> 01:32.640
But there's this empty seat here and yeah, and we feel to use it and to take part in

01:32.640 --> 01:37.800
the panel discussion with the panelists and so put your points on the table, but also

01:37.800 --> 01:41.480
discuss with the other panelists, so feel free to join.

01:41.480 --> 01:48.600
First of all, but we also have to say that as this is foster, we would not take the first

01:48.600 --> 01:53.560
ones dropping by, but we will also look a bit for diversity.

01:53.560 --> 01:59.040
And so we highly encourage you if you are not quite male men to also take part in this

01:59.040 --> 02:03.800
discussion here and I think it's in particular important for FOSM to do so.

02:03.800 --> 02:09.440
So please take this empty chair and take part in the discussion.

02:09.440 --> 02:16.520
Yeah, so, okay, anyone else?

02:16.520 --> 02:17.520
Then feel free.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.640
Yeah, sure.

02:19.640 --> 02:25.640
So the only most important thing is, yeah, respect yourself and please with the microphone.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.640
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

02:27.640 --> 02:34.960
It's, yeah, so let's see how it works exactly.

02:34.960 --> 02:35.960
Yeah, yeah.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.960
Can you say something?

02:37.960 --> 02:41.480
Yeah, so and I said it's important to have the microphone for or like.

02:41.480 --> 02:42.480
I understand that.

02:42.480 --> 02:44.760
Yes, and speak loudly regardless.

02:44.760 --> 02:45.760
Good.

02:45.760 --> 02:46.760
And don't worry.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.880
I'm not going to stay here for very long.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.240
I'm going to step out as soon as I can.

02:51.240 --> 02:57.960
Anyways, I'm Jonas and I work for Nokia and responsible for open source things there.

02:57.960 --> 03:03.600
And the kind of like I'm been really excited about the topics of kind of like what has

03:03.600 --> 03:09.520
been going over the what is now called the policy week, starting with the commission

03:09.520 --> 03:15.880
thing on Thursday, then the open forum Europe thing.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.720
And now this the discussions here.

03:18.720 --> 03:25.800
One thing that I noticed that in the in these discussions is that and some of these discussions

03:25.800 --> 03:26.960
I've heard before.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.400
So I have a little bit of a kind of like an dark past.

03:30.400 --> 03:37.480
So I am a recovering standards person and I have a history and internet governance things

03:37.480 --> 03:42.440
and they there's a lot of parallels into the kind of like where we are now as an open source

03:42.440 --> 03:47.200
community where we were in a kind of like Internet community community when it started

03:47.200 --> 03:50.680
in like early 2000s discussions.

03:50.680 --> 03:56.080
So but the good thing sadly that's kind of like that comes with good and bad things and

03:56.080 --> 04:00.520
then the good things is that people now finally understand that open source is actually something

04:00.520 --> 04:02.760
very important for the society.

04:02.760 --> 04:08.400
Bad things is that people get very interested in those things and then good things like

04:08.400 --> 04:12.000
political interests come in involved as well and all of a sudden we need to get organized

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
differently.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.640
So but I think that the good thing is that we've done this in the Internet community

04:17.640 --> 04:23.040
already before and I think we can look at some of the processes and some of the kind

04:23.040 --> 04:26.560
of like things what we did at that time.

04:26.560 --> 04:32.240
And similarly like an open source community, the Internet community was very diverse community.

04:32.240 --> 04:36.240
So we had big companies like me for working for Nokia.

04:36.240 --> 04:42.400
We had small people that were advocates and then the kind of like we had the civil society

04:42.400 --> 04:44.920
and then governments and so on.

04:44.920 --> 04:50.320
And the thing is also that we need to organize ourselves in a little bit of similar fashion.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.480
So and I think that there is a little bit grass roots already happening that that because

04:54.480 --> 05:01.800
for instance for us in there were a lot of people said that the open source community

05:01.800 --> 05:04.800
is not as organized as the industry or something like that.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.320
To be honest in this topic the industry wasn't very well organized.

05:08.320 --> 05:16.040
I started to read about the CRA from actually the NL Labs blog post which was very good

05:16.040 --> 05:21.080
that woke up a little bit, hey what is this and what should we look at that.

05:21.080 --> 05:27.160
And then the kind of like the overall discussion started to go a little bit.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.840
And I agree that even for the kind of like industry we had a lot of luck because we had

05:31.840 --> 05:38.160
a lot of people driving towards the same direction from the open source community as what we

05:38.160 --> 05:41.320
need also as part of the open source community.

05:41.320 --> 05:46.720
The other thing is that what we want to start to work together is kind of like looking at

05:46.720 --> 05:49.800
that we are all part of the community.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.920
We have different views, we have different approaches and stuff like that and we have

05:53.920 --> 06:01.400
to focus on those things that what we are in common and then look at it using the different

06:01.400 --> 06:06.720
strengths and the facts that different people are parts of the community even though they

06:06.720 --> 06:12.120
are not always sharing the same ideas are also present in the different rooms that might

06:12.120 --> 06:16.000
be even difficult to get into by other parts of the community.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.880
And I think that through this we most probably can get into very fruitful conversations and

06:20.880 --> 06:25.400
very fruitful cooperation among the overall open source community.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.400
I hope this helps.

06:27.400 --> 06:41.240
Anyone who wants to react on this?

06:41.240 --> 06:49.240
I think one of the key points when you reach out to institutions is get organized first,

06:49.240 --> 06:54.200
get on time especially because then negotiations can go fast so you have to be there on time

06:54.200 --> 07:02.880
so that we can take on board your inputs on time because then otherwise it is very difficult.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.560
And the last thing is especially if you get organized that we can have one single contact

07:06.560 --> 07:09.920
point for instance which for us is very useful.

07:09.920 --> 07:13.760
And also for your inputs on the institution side again because you also have the campaigning

07:13.760 --> 07:16.840
side but for us what is useful is your expertise.

07:16.840 --> 07:21.460
So we need your expertise and in that case we need your inputs on very specific points

07:21.460 --> 07:25.700
sometimes on the low side, sometimes on the technical side and that is why you need to

07:25.700 --> 07:30.460
get organized so you have diverse teams so that they can provide inputs on low and technical

07:30.460 --> 07:37.220
side which is very important for us.

07:37.220 --> 07:41.220
Well I think as Kieran was saying earlier it is really important to get engaged early

07:41.220 --> 07:43.980
because that is when you will have the most influence.

07:43.980 --> 07:48.980
And then also I think what Walt was saying earlier was that I mean it has kind of been

07:49.340 --> 07:51.540
forgotten what happened in the early 2000s.

07:51.540 --> 07:57.940
You had the software patents, you also had ACTA and you have had the copyright directive

07:57.940 --> 08:04.420
and I mean there is forces that can be mobilized that can actually reach the MEPs and now is

08:04.420 --> 08:10.420
actually the time to influence people and get it because they are running to be elected

08:10.420 --> 08:15.500
so now is when they will be listening.

08:15.540 --> 08:22.220
The problem is since 2005 is that the big companies and society has gotten more engaged

08:22.220 --> 08:26.380
in regulation of technology but not always in the good way.

08:26.380 --> 08:31.140
It is sort of like let's use technology as a magical source to fix our problems.

08:31.140 --> 08:40.140
You have initiatives in the US, you have initiatives in the EU that are not very positive for regulating

08:40.140 --> 08:40.660
technology.

08:40.700 --> 08:47.700
You have safer kids online in the US, in the Congress, you have chat control in the EU

08:47.900 --> 08:50.420
which is probably going to go to the next mandate.

08:50.420 --> 08:57.420
And be aware that people that you think would be obvious to be supporting inclusion and

08:58.620 --> 09:02.940
adapting to open source might not always be so.

09:02.940 --> 09:09.420
We had a lot of pushback from the social democratic group in the parliament against including

09:09.460 --> 09:14.380
provisions for open source in the product liability directive because they were worried

09:14.380 --> 09:16.540
about protecting consumers.

09:16.540 --> 09:22.860
So you need to really be able to explain the digital side to politicians that don't always

09:22.860 --> 09:25.860
get it and want to sort of regulate tech in a bad way.

09:39.420 --> 09:43.420
We don't really need to step into the middle like this is already a circle.

09:43.420 --> 09:47.420
Even better in terms of forum, we don't all look to the same people.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.420
That's pretty true.

09:48.420 --> 09:51.420
Yeah, we'll talk about the next one.

09:53.420 --> 10:04.420
So everybody says get engaged early and there were really good processes for that within

10:04.420 --> 10:09.420
the EU with Green Book, Blue Book, the whole shebang.

10:09.420 --> 10:12.420
And here we skipped a lot of the processes it seemed.

10:12.420 --> 10:13.420
Why did we do that?

10:17.420 --> 10:18.420
Is it not working?

10:25.420 --> 10:31.420
Okay, hi, I'm Jordan, I'm Karen's assistant and I think you've raised perhaps what is

10:31.420 --> 10:33.420
the single most important point.

10:33.420 --> 10:38.420
But I think the reason that we skipped a lot of that is because a lot of people aren't aware that you have this possibility.

10:38.420 --> 10:48.420
It's also exhausting to have to keep an eye on all of the legislative proposals that are coming out of the commission.

10:48.420 --> 10:54.420
I don't know how many they come, but it's a good 30 or 40 proposals every year.

10:54.420 --> 10:58.420
We should, it's important that we keep an eye on this.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.420
It's exhausting for you, what do you think it's like?

11:00.420 --> 11:02.420
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.420
No, no, no, I 100% agree.

11:04.420 --> 11:06.420
I 100% agree.

11:06.420 --> 11:07.420
I'm super sorry.

11:07.420 --> 11:11.420
The thing is we need to keep the microphone for the live stream running.

11:11.420 --> 11:18.420
So please, even repeat when you do these settings or do you want to?

11:18.420 --> 11:20.420
Just quickly.

11:20.420 --> 11:24.420
I'll take some of the tone out.

11:24.420 --> 11:31.420
What I said was in response to the notion that it's busy if you're in parliament to keep track of everything,

11:31.420 --> 11:39.420
we're actually as a community are being told we have to be proactive and track everything and we're just not set up to do it.

11:39.420 --> 11:40.420
And it's...

11:43.420 --> 11:45.420
Speak closer to the microphone.

11:45.420 --> 11:46.420
Interesting.

11:46.420 --> 11:52.420
Okay, so what I was trying to say is if it's exhausting for the people who actually work in parliament to keep track of everything,

11:52.420 --> 11:59.420
imagine how exhausting it is for the people that are just in the open source community dodging bullets as they come down from the sky.

12:04.420 --> 12:09.420
Very briefly, but also very importantly, parliament does not have to write the insinuated legislation.

12:09.420 --> 12:11.420
You're barking up the wrong tree.

12:11.420 --> 12:14.420
It's the commission that has been overwhelming everyone else.

12:14.420 --> 12:19.420
They have a massive tsunami of really crap proposals in the past mandate.

12:25.420 --> 12:29.420
So was that the reason that the normal process was skipped?

12:29.420 --> 12:35.420
Because if we have to be engaged early, for us this process is ideal.

12:35.420 --> 12:40.420
Because you then have one of these books, you can send it to people like,

12:40.420 --> 12:43.420
look what's there and then respond.

12:43.420 --> 12:53.420
And because we skipped that formal process, how can we engage early if we don't see what's happening?

12:53.420 --> 12:55.420
That's probably the problem.

12:55.420 --> 12:59.420
Well, there is an obligation of transparency.

12:59.420 --> 13:02.420
There are processes like impact assessment.

13:02.420 --> 13:09.420
But I know it's something completely foreign from a lot of people.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.420
And here I see a gap personally.

13:11.420 --> 13:14.420
Again, I'm not on the legislation part.

13:14.420 --> 13:15.420
I'm not on the funding part.

13:15.420 --> 13:21.420
But the gap is that we heard that open source is very important.

13:21.420 --> 13:24.420
It's 80% of modern software.

13:25.420 --> 13:31.420
It's a large part of the IT business, an IT stack.

13:31.420 --> 13:34.420
And a lot of players are benefitted from it.

13:34.420 --> 13:39.420
The question is, so it's important, but there is a gap of representation.

13:39.420 --> 13:42.420
It's not in the mind of a policymaker.

13:42.420 --> 13:45.420
So what you describe is a situation where open source comes after.

13:45.420 --> 13:52.420
But if it would come first, it would mean that decision makers have this understanding

13:52.420 --> 13:55.420
that open source is important, and especially in Europe.

13:55.420 --> 14:02.420
So this gap, in my view, is the main reason why we are late in the process.

14:02.420 --> 14:09.420
And to address this gap, it's a question of making decision makers that you guys are important.

14:09.420 --> 14:14.420
So it's a question of having people from the community representing,

14:14.420 --> 14:17.420
okay, we have European organizations that are doing great job,

14:17.420 --> 14:22.420
but we also need the grassroot people and the process to democratically represent them

14:22.420 --> 14:24.420
at the level of decision makers.

14:24.420 --> 14:26.420
That's my impression.

14:33.420 --> 14:34.420
Okay, I got it.

14:34.420 --> 14:38.420
So I was, thank you for all the answers to this.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.420
And I was listening a little bit to what you were saying,

14:40.420 --> 14:43.420
but also to the point that we're made throughout the week

14:43.420 --> 14:47.420
since we had this event from the Commission, the OFE event as well yesterday,

14:47.420 --> 14:49.420
the summit, what they call.

14:49.420 --> 14:52.420
And it reminds me of something I used to work on before.

14:52.420 --> 14:58.420
That's called SME policies, and this principle that is called the Think Small First Principle.

14:58.420 --> 15:01.420
It was developed by an expert group on SMEs.

15:01.420 --> 15:03.420
Hopefully one day the Commission has an expert group on open source

15:03.420 --> 15:06.420
so that we can actually reflect on those principles.

15:06.420 --> 15:09.420
And I was reading through the paper that was written in 2009.

15:09.420 --> 15:12.420
And just if you look at the table of contents,

15:12.420 --> 15:15.420
it starts with the importance of SMEs in the EU economy.

15:15.420 --> 15:17.420
That's exactly what we've proven throughout the week,

15:17.420 --> 15:19.420
the importance of open source for the economy.

15:19.420 --> 15:22.420
The impact on regulations have on SMEs.

15:22.420 --> 15:26.420
We're in the same situation, impact that regulations have on open source.

15:26.420 --> 15:30.420
And then they explain what is the Think Small First Principle.

15:30.420 --> 15:35.420
First, listening to SMEs, listening to open source community.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.420
The second is what they call the SME test.

15:37.420 --> 15:40.420
Why don't we just go for an open source test?

15:40.420 --> 15:43.420
Every time we enter into a digital legislation, we think,

15:43.420 --> 15:47.420
can we apply this to open source? Does it work with open source or not?

15:47.420 --> 15:52.420
And then after that, it's a bunch of stuff that are way too bureaucratic for me to read them through today.

15:52.420 --> 15:58.420
But maybe if we have an expert group one day, we can actually build us the bureaucratic stuff as well,

15:58.420 --> 15:59.420
specifically for open source.

15:59.420 --> 16:06.420
So I'm thinking, we've been discussing the processes, but maybe also the policies could be adapted.

16:07.420 --> 16:09.420
Could you go ahead with the microphone?

16:09.420 --> 16:11.420
We have a great pleasure.

16:17.420 --> 16:20.420
So I have just a practical proposal.

16:20.420 --> 16:26.420
There used to be an application that was called Follow the Law.

16:26.420 --> 16:31.420
And then you could just put in, like, I'm interested in digital legislation,

16:31.420 --> 16:37.420
and then you would be notified at the beginning of the process that a process was happening,

16:37.420 --> 16:41.420
and you could follow all the way through at what point it was,

16:41.420 --> 16:45.420
who you would need to address if you wanted to be part of it.

16:45.420 --> 16:49.420
So maybe this can be remade again.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.420
Unfortunately, it is no longer.

16:53.420 --> 16:59.420
Someone from the panel wants to say on some of these remarks here.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.420
Yes, exactly.

17:02.420 --> 17:06.420
I was hoping someone would step up from the community and said we have a tool to help for this.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.420
So, kudos to you.

17:08.420 --> 17:15.420
Another point we've mentioned that many times in this conference, in the previous conferences,

17:15.420 --> 17:18.420
software is pervasive everywhere.

17:18.420 --> 17:22.420
There will be software in everything as the world goes digital,

17:22.420 --> 17:25.420
and therefore there will be more regulation.

17:25.420 --> 17:30.420
That's unavoidable because software probably will be a commodity,

17:30.420 --> 17:35.420
just like we're regulating our air and our water and our electricity.

17:35.420 --> 17:40.420
So probably my question also to the open source community today is,

17:40.420 --> 17:45.420
what legislation would you like to have to help open source?

17:45.420 --> 17:48.420
I think that would be a valid question as well.

17:56.420 --> 18:02.420
So I would like to respond to the gentleman in the red shirt,

18:02.420 --> 18:12.420
because he said it would be a good idea to check policy against as a me interest of the EU,

18:12.420 --> 18:23.420
and especially open standards can really help bring forward the position of open source within the EU,

18:23.420 --> 18:32.420
and it would help European SMEs a lot if open standards are at the forefront of EU policy,

18:32.420 --> 18:35.420
because that helps our sovereignty.

18:35.420 --> 18:43.420
It helps European companies exist in a landscape with big tech

18:43.420 --> 18:49.420
and really help small companies to compete.

18:49.420 --> 18:55.420
And if local governments are keeping to open standards, that helps a lot for SMEs.

18:55.420 --> 19:01.420
So maybe take it from the standard side, and that will help engage open source as well.

19:10.420 --> 19:12.420
It's a double question.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.420
Yes, I'm Jason Petjo.

19:15.420 --> 19:19.420
I'm a biomedical engineer and I work in Brussels.

19:19.420 --> 19:25.420
Very active in everything regarding fab labs as well, the digitization of the hardware world.

19:25.420 --> 19:29.420
I'm more of a free software guide on the open source,

19:29.420 --> 19:36.420
because I think this question of public European stuff is really about making the citizen more free,

19:36.420 --> 19:39.420
and what I saw in the digital rights stuff is exactly about that.

19:39.420 --> 19:43.420
And so if we talk about open source in the context of political framework,

19:43.420 --> 19:47.420
I think it's important to put the freedom as more core to it.

19:47.420 --> 19:53.420
And what I made me take is about the data of the project that NGI supported.

19:53.420 --> 19:57.420
You said a lot of them follow European politics.

19:57.420 --> 20:01.420
I'm a bit surprised because for me politics follow the will of the people,

20:01.420 --> 20:03.420
and so follow actually the community.

20:03.420 --> 20:07.420
And so this, I mean, should actually, should.

20:07.420 --> 20:14.420
So my question is, aren't those policies following the will of the community

20:14.420 --> 20:19.420
and therefore shouldn't the funding go towards funding the policies?

20:19.420 --> 20:26.420
Like, we are supposed to give, to take all free time to pay for people,

20:26.420 --> 20:30.420
like to pay and to use all free time to defend our opinions.

20:30.420 --> 20:34.420
Why should we be paid to tell the commission what they have to do

20:34.420 --> 20:39.420
and what the government's, well, that's what governments are for somehow.

20:39.420 --> 20:43.420
It's like democracy when you're one.

20:43.420 --> 20:46.420
The European institution is a global source.

20:46.420 --> 20:49.420
It gets paid to the legislature.

20:49.420 --> 20:54.420
So I will start with a question to the audience.

20:54.420 --> 20:58.420
Oh, you know what? I will ask a question to the audience to start.

20:58.420 --> 21:03.420
Oh yeah, so Thomas Dapierre, what I do does not relate to what I do for open source.

21:03.420 --> 21:05.420
My job is not related to that.

21:05.420 --> 21:09.420
You may, some of you may know me because of my blog post a year and a half ago

21:09.420 --> 21:11.420
called I am not a supplier.

21:11.420 --> 21:14.420
I have a question for you and for the audience in general.

21:14.420 --> 21:23.420
Can you raise your hand if you get paid for something linked to your presence to this room today?

21:23.420 --> 21:26.420
Right.

21:26.420 --> 21:32.420
So what you are all telling me is that the people that do the work are not represented in this room.

21:32.420 --> 21:39.420
And what I'm saying is that what we saw is that most of the people doing working on open source

21:39.420 --> 21:42.420
and we have ample data on that are not paid for it.

21:42.420 --> 21:43.420
They do it on their free time.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.420
They are what we call our best.

21:45.420 --> 21:49.420
The other people that cannot do the work you're asking them to do.

21:49.420 --> 21:55.420
My total time for open source and I maintain multiple packages that are niche but fully,

21:55.420 --> 22:01.420
indeed a lot of context on knowledge is this niche, is two hour per month.

22:01.420 --> 22:04.420
Just reading the law is more than that.

22:04.420 --> 22:12.420
I cannot and people that do this cannot participate and the grass with people you're asking to participate in this cannot do that.

22:12.420 --> 22:18.420
To come here, this is my free hobby time for the next three months or four months I have to take.

22:18.420 --> 22:24.420
So I understand all the discussion that happened here around the fact that we need engagement from these people

22:24.420 --> 22:27.420
and we need this engagement to happen.

22:27.420 --> 22:30.420
How do you want us to do it?

22:30.420 --> 22:35.420
This is a part we need to decide as a community and this is a real thing we should probably talk about more

22:35.420 --> 22:41.420
than things like digital right and source which I already have quite a lot of organization working on this.

22:41.420 --> 22:43.420
Thank you.

22:43.420 --> 22:52.420
Yeah, I think that decision makers answer to these policy remarks.

22:52.420 --> 22:56.420
Well, I mean the difficulty in Brussels is actually figuring out what's going on

22:56.420 --> 23:01.420
because once it's public the bulk of the influence has already been made

23:01.420 --> 23:07.420
because once the commission has their proposal out they've already made up their mind on what they want to put in there.

23:07.420 --> 23:13.420
So that's why I'm saying you need to influence the politicians that are trying to get elected before they get into the parliament

23:13.420 --> 23:22.420
and you need to get to know their offices, you need to get to know the policy advisors in the political group delegations

23:22.420 --> 23:27.420
and also like the policy advisors in the groups.

23:27.420 --> 23:37.420
And a lot of companies are trying to influence both the commission and the politicians

23:37.420 --> 23:43.420
and they have the time to do that.

23:43.420 --> 23:53.420
So I think a lot are thinking about that the source code that is also at the basis of commercial code, proprietary code

23:53.420 --> 23:58.420
is actually open source and that is maintained by developers doing it in their free time

23:58.420 --> 24:04.420
and that is actually a message that was really difficult when we were sitting in the negotiation room to get across

24:04.420 --> 24:10.420
and that's why we had to push really hard to actually get that part into the text.

24:10.420 --> 24:19.420
So being here, taking your free time to talk with us and put these things into the room is really important.

24:19.420 --> 24:23.420
I think Edry has been doing a great job on digital rights.

24:23.420 --> 24:29.420
I mean the commission is now talking about digital rights but I don't know if you remember Marie Tishaka that was in the parliament

24:29.420 --> 24:32.420
for about 10 years until the election in 19.

24:32.420 --> 24:37.420
I mean she read out a speech about digital rights and then told the audience afterwards

24:37.420 --> 24:41.420
this is actually from the Communist Party Congress.

24:41.420 --> 24:50.420
So you can have a lot of fine words that sound good but it's how you apply them and implement them and put them into legislation

24:50.420 --> 24:51.420
that's really important.

24:51.420 --> 25:00.420
I mean one of the things that we like was putting our head up against in the negotiation was that the commission has this blue book of definitions

25:00.420 --> 25:05.420
and stuff like that that nobody amongst the co-legislators actually had heard about

25:05.420 --> 25:09.420
and we're like come on this is your own internal standards.

25:09.420 --> 25:12.420
This is not supposed to override legislation.

25:12.420 --> 25:17.420
That's supposed to like follow and be adapted according to the legislation that we're putting in.

25:17.420 --> 25:21.420
So I mean it's difficult for all of us and that's why we need to work together on this.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.420
Sorry for being long again.

25:23.420 --> 25:27.420
Could you maybe hand over to Iqbe as the representative?

25:27.420 --> 25:31.420
Well no I'm not the other representative.

25:31.420 --> 25:36.420
I would say there's no separation between digital rights and open source.

25:36.420 --> 25:40.420
The digital rights movement was started by the open source people.

25:40.420 --> 25:47.420
We have become somewhat unmoored from our roots in that respect but please do re-engage if you feel is not sufficiently represented.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.420
You're deeply disagreeing with that notion I see from Elaine.

25:50.420 --> 25:55.420
I would also respond to the notion and I'm one of the people that's not being paid for this by the way I should mention.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.420
This is not a matter of being paid for this.

25:57.420 --> 26:05.420
You as a citizen if you want to be represented it's too much work for any citizen to get represented properly.

26:05.420 --> 26:11.420
And there are more channels than just your political party if you're a member and please be a member of any political party.

26:11.420 --> 26:20.420
Well maybe not a Nazi party but there are a democratic society that does not function solely through elections.

26:20.420 --> 26:25.420
There has to be permanent engagement through other channels than just the election.

26:25.420 --> 26:27.420
And that's what civil society is for.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.420
Of course it should be.

26:29.420 --> 26:32.420
And lastly democracy is not about the quality of decision making.

26:32.420 --> 26:37.420
It's about the non-violence of the decision making and the non-violence of the transfer of power.

26:37.420 --> 26:40.420
So do not be overly disappointed when the outcome is poor.

26:40.420 --> 26:44.420
At least we're not shooting each others in the trenches of Ferdinand again.

26:44.420 --> 26:45.420
And that's a win.

26:45.420 --> 26:57.420
If I may one comment it's on the question of the representation and the fact that we are professional of the profession.

26:57.420 --> 27:00.420
And we are not representing grassroots to some extent.

27:00.420 --> 27:05.420
I think the question you ask is the question of representation of democracy.

27:05.420 --> 27:06.420
It is not.

27:06.420 --> 27:08.420
Okay well I thought it was.

27:08.420 --> 27:12.420
But the question of money you ask.

27:12.420 --> 27:13.420
Fine.

27:13.420 --> 27:14.420
Time.

27:14.420 --> 27:15.420
Time.

27:15.420 --> 27:16.420
Time.

27:16.420 --> 27:17.420
Yeah well time is money.

27:17.420 --> 27:21.420
Yeah because people who have units choose to pay the time without money.

27:21.420 --> 27:22.420
This is not about money.

27:22.420 --> 27:23.420
It's about time.

27:23.420 --> 27:24.420
What?

27:24.420 --> 27:26.420
I need to keep maintaining the stuff you all used to live.

27:26.420 --> 27:27.420
Exactly.

27:27.420 --> 27:30.420
If I take away from that time to explain to the audience.

27:30.420 --> 27:33.420
I cannot keep the thing that you need to live and to keep alive.

27:33.420 --> 27:34.420
Working.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.420
Exactly.

27:35.420 --> 27:37.420
So well the argument is time is money.

27:37.420 --> 27:48.420
So you need a way to have the right people representing you and that will have the time and will have the money because they will have to be paid for that.

27:48.420 --> 27:55.420
And so they have to represent you and you have to find a way that you find the people that.

27:55.420 --> 27:57.420
So you have European organization.

27:57.420 --> 27:58.420
You have OEF.

27:58.420 --> 28:01.420
I will not mention all of them because there are a lot of them.

28:01.420 --> 28:02.420
Well they are not representing.

28:02.420 --> 28:05.420
They are coordinating and helping whatever.

28:05.420 --> 28:11.420
But what you describe I think is a democratic representation of the grass root people.

28:11.420 --> 28:14.420
And you have to find solutions.

28:14.420 --> 28:15.420
There are examples.

28:15.420 --> 28:16.420
Look at IETF.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.420
IETF is grass root.

28:18.420 --> 28:21.420
IETF is people contributing with their own time.

28:21.420 --> 28:24.420
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:24.420 --> 28:26.420
Not really.

28:26.420 --> 28:27.420
They are big tech.

28:27.420 --> 28:28.420
Okay.

28:28.420 --> 28:30.420
But it's wait, wait.

28:30.420 --> 28:35.420
It's one person one vote if you like.

28:35.420 --> 28:36.420
It's not one.

28:36.420 --> 28:39.420
Well you want to talk about maybe ITU?

28:39.420 --> 28:40.420
No.

28:40.420 --> 28:41.420
Okay.

28:41.420 --> 28:48.420
You can think about organization that organized this representation and maybe take example.

28:48.420 --> 28:49.420
Maybe it's the wrong example.

28:49.420 --> 28:54.420
But my only argument is you have to find ways to get a representation.

28:54.420 --> 28:55.420
That's it.

28:56.420 --> 29:04.420
It's not just open source that has to make time because the people in open source they

29:04.420 --> 29:09.420
contribute with what they can do best and it's mostly writing code.

29:09.420 --> 29:19.420
And there's a thing that people in policy roles have this attitude towards technology

29:19.420 --> 29:23.420
quite often that they say we don't have to understand it.

29:23.420 --> 29:27.420
And there's an educational gap there.

29:27.420 --> 29:35.420
And it's not that the people who write codes have to make time to explain all that.

29:35.420 --> 29:41.420
The people who make policy have to understand technology because it's at the core of our

29:41.420 --> 29:42.420
democracy.

29:42.420 --> 29:49.420
So there are people willing to explain it but don't take them away from writing the

29:49.420 --> 29:52.420
code because that's really important for society.

29:52.420 --> 30:02.420
So it's also an effort from the people in roles that are important for policy making

30:02.420 --> 30:06.420
to learn about technology and try to understand how important it is.

30:12.420 --> 30:13.420
Thank you.

30:13.420 --> 30:14.420
Good morning everyone.

30:14.420 --> 30:18.420
My name is Monique and I'm involved in the NGI community since a few years.

30:18.420 --> 30:21.420
I think this debate is amazing.

30:21.420 --> 30:27.420
I think we cannot pretend that we all speak and understand the same language because we

30:27.420 --> 30:30.420
have different skills and we do different works.

30:30.420 --> 30:35.420
This is a multi-stakeholder community and we have to respect each other and we have to

30:35.420 --> 30:37.420
learn to work with each other.

30:37.420 --> 30:41.420
I think the work that we have been trying to do in the NGI community has been really

30:41.420 --> 30:46.420
to talk different languages to different people and it's very difficult.

30:46.420 --> 30:52.420
At the end of the day my job is to run the NGI outreach office and I can tell you it has

30:52.420 --> 30:57.420
been very difficult to reach out to some of the open source communities but it has also

30:57.420 --> 31:01.420
been very hard to speak to politicians, policymakers.

31:01.420 --> 31:07.420
So the fact is that we speak different languages and we work according to different rules and

31:07.420 --> 31:10.420
to different, we have a different pace.

31:10.420 --> 31:15.420
But I think also that the progress and I've been here the whole week attending all the

31:15.420 --> 31:20.420
events, you know, workshops at the commission, open source forum today, yesterday, here at

31:20.420 --> 31:21.420
FOSTEM.

31:21.420 --> 31:23.420
I think it's amazing what's happening.

31:23.420 --> 31:30.420
We have open source, very high up in the discussions that a few years ago we could have dreamed

31:30.420 --> 31:33.420
of being even mentioned.

31:33.420 --> 31:38.420
So I think there is a cultural change and we all have a different role to play.

31:38.420 --> 31:44.420
So let's not, so I think to go back to the guy from Nokia, I think we really have to

31:44.420 --> 31:50.420
work on the processes and on the ways we can work better together.

31:50.420 --> 31:53.420
I think this should be the core topic of this discussion.

31:53.420 --> 32:03.420
Hello, I am Karim.

32:03.420 --> 32:08.420
I am not paid here to be here.

32:08.420 --> 32:12.420
I have my own company in, I have a background in public administration.

32:12.420 --> 32:18.420
I'm a contributor to RiotOS, my microcontroller operating system.

32:18.420 --> 32:21.420
So thanks, happy to help out on this.

32:21.420 --> 32:28.420
What I was wondering, I heard policy makers speak with a lot of people and groups before

32:28.420 --> 32:32.420
they make the first draft.

32:32.420 --> 32:39.420
Who are those groups, who are those, what kind of institutes are that because that's a procedure

32:39.420 --> 32:41.420
that's already there with whom they talk.

32:41.420 --> 32:48.420
And maybe from that side out, can we then look on what as an open source community can we make

32:48.420 --> 32:57.420
or go into to speak with them.

32:57.420 --> 33:03.420
Okay, I'm already getting feedback from the repertoire of this session and so who will also have the

33:03.420 --> 33:10.420
the honor to summarize what you are saying in the last minute.

33:10.420 --> 33:14.420
And he told me we have a lot of questions but no answers at the moment.

33:14.420 --> 33:21.420
And maybe we should like focus for the next minutes on this and to kick this off I would first of the Simon.

33:21.420 --> 33:23.420
Thank you.

33:23.420 --> 33:26.420
I'm Simon Phipsen just because I'm organizing the room.

33:26.420 --> 33:29.420
It doesn't mean I don't have opinions.

33:29.420 --> 33:32.420
So I work for the open source initiative.

33:32.420 --> 33:36.420
The answer to your question is in the impact assessment of the CRA.

33:36.420 --> 33:45.420
The impact assessment of the CRA explains that the European Commission went out of its way to approach SMEs for input on the CRA

33:45.420 --> 33:52.420
but did not make any attempt at all to consult with the open source community or anybody who is a genuine community member.

33:52.420 --> 34:00.420
And the reason for that is because their societal model is a societal model that has manufacturers or producers,

34:00.420 --> 34:09.420
it has labor force and it has consumers and it has no recognition that for the last 30 years there has been a

34:09.420 --> 34:16.420
there has been commons based peer production and it has no recognition of the fact that there are people engaged in that.

34:16.420 --> 34:22.420
And so the number one thing that needs doing is actually a very difficult thing that needs serious political engagement

34:22.420 --> 34:29.420
which is the Commission as a whole needs to recognize that society is no longer the society of the 1950s

34:29.420 --> 34:38.420
and that people are connected to one another and that as a result of being connected to one another

34:38.420 --> 34:46.420
they are actually doing things that are being harmed by their regulation that believes that unions and MEPs represent the people.

34:46.420 --> 34:54.420
Unions and MEPs do not represent I believe anybody in this room and as a consequence the Commission completely failed.

34:54.420 --> 34:59.420
Maybe there is one Karen, I don't know.

34:59.420 --> 35:10.420
But as a result the Commission has discovered to its surprise that coming to Fozdem, Benjamin last year was quite surprised to discover

35:10.420 --> 35:16.420
he had a thousand new friends who wanted to share their opinions about his legislation in the corridor.

35:16.420 --> 35:22.420
This year he was a lot more positive about it although he did ask me if he was going to be egged by the audience.

35:22.420 --> 35:29.420
So the most positive thing that I've got to contribute is a very difficult thing which is the Commission as a whole

35:29.420 --> 35:35.420
has got to recognize that society is no longer the industrial society of the 1950s.

35:35.420 --> 35:39.420
It is now the digital connected society of the 21st century.

35:39.420 --> 35:44.420
There we are. So we are still looking for answers, right?

35:44.420 --> 35:51.420
Well for the Parliament side I can say that the question was to who did we reach out to for the PLD for instance

35:51.420 --> 35:58.420
we mostly talked to Free Software Foundation, Open Forum Europe and Debian for us and Marcel Scolias team.

35:58.420 --> 36:08.420
So I would think that in our team for instance if you send an email to us we are very sensitive in the Pirates about the Epoenso's community obviously

36:08.420 --> 36:11.420
so if you send an email to us obviously we will answer.

36:11.420 --> 36:16.420
But again that's also the main purpose of the discussion today, you have to be targeted.

36:16.420 --> 36:22.420
If you're not working at all on the topic we might not answer because it's not our topic, we're not working on the file on this specific file.

36:22.420 --> 36:28.420
So I think that's the main thing but on our side definitely we will answer to Open Source community almost every time.

36:29.420 --> 36:35.420
Thank you very much.

36:35.420 --> 36:44.420
I am Pablo Correa from PostmarketOS, a small but very fast growing community to put real Linux into phones.

36:44.420 --> 36:49.420
And there was one thing that caught my attention from your NGI presentation.

36:49.420 --> 36:57.420
You said that out of the millions and millions of euros you gave out you managed to get 80 people

36:57.420 --> 37:03.420
to organize a community or a foundation to establish a legal entity.

37:03.420 --> 37:11.420
And that seems like that's a huge success but that's also way too small for the amount of money.

37:11.420 --> 37:13.420
I am like my feeling.

37:13.420 --> 37:22.420
I am part of this overworked people working their free time trying to grow a community

37:22.420 --> 37:33.420
to create some sort of entities so that we can at some point make this a viable product because we see people, we see consumers wanting this.

37:33.420 --> 37:44.420
We want this, people want this and we are lacking the tools to actually grow into something where we can organize ourselves.

37:44.420 --> 37:50.420
We are lacking, we are all developers and we are lacking people with the background in business.

37:50.420 --> 37:56.420
We are lacking people with the background in law and the funding does not support us on that.

37:56.420 --> 38:00.420
The funding, we don't get or we just say can you please get involved.

38:00.420 --> 38:11.420
It's like well maybe I can get involved in my 25th hour of the day but if we are all working on something else because we can't finance ourselves.

38:11.420 --> 38:22.420
If you can help us like pay advice on free software, there are people from grassroots organizations happy to do that.

38:22.420 --> 38:29.420
We need help and we need funding not only for development, also for development but we need funding for more things.

38:29.420 --> 38:32.420
And if you can provide that, that might actually help us.

38:33.420 --> 38:43.420
Okay, a very quick one and these are also the last words for the panel because then we have to transform for technical reasons with the camera.

38:43.420 --> 38:54.420
Okay, no just very shortly on NGI so we have a new project, NGI Commons and there is a special effort to precisely provide business support

38:54.420 --> 39:08.420
so in terms of what business model could be on top of an open source because you guys are developers so you don't necessarily have the right knowledge in terms of what sort of business model needs to be done.

39:08.420 --> 39:13.420
So this is included in the new project called NGI Commons Fund.

39:15.420 --> 39:18.420
So that's good that we ended the specifics.

39:19.420 --> 39:23.420
Yeah, so with this I'm going to end the panel and the fishbowl discussion.

39:23.420 --> 39:28.420
Thanks for the insight, thanks for all of you taking part in this.
