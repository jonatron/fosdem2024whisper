00:00.000 --> 00:12.680
The aim of this presentation is to show how Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wikimedia Commons, the

00:12.680 --> 00:19.040
Wikimedia project and also OpenStreetMap and other resources can be used as open infrastructure

00:19.040 --> 00:21.040
for research.

00:21.040 --> 00:27.920
We're talking about websites that are based on an open infrastructure, so they're based

00:27.920 --> 00:33.840
on open and free software and of course they have all content that is available openly.

00:33.840 --> 00:39.400
What is also interesting about this ecosystem is that it's incredibly multilingual, so

00:39.400 --> 00:45.000
you have a really wide community of contributors in over 300 languages.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.640
And even more, it's one of the biggest existing online communities and this is obviously a

00:50.640 --> 00:55.680
feature if you want to collaborate with citizens, which is one of the aims of OpenScience,

00:55.680 --> 00:59.840
so working and collaborating among people and institutions.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.360
Also something that is also valuable is the fact that we're talking about resources that

01:05.360 --> 01:07.960
can host different kinds of content.

01:07.960 --> 01:13.640
So it can be data, but it can be also images, audio, documents with also a community that

01:13.640 --> 01:16.840
can contribute in different ways in improving this content.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.960
It can be restoration or improvement of images.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.240
It can be also adding captions.

01:22.240 --> 01:25.760
It can be transcribing documents.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.440
There are many advantages in those projects.

01:28.440 --> 01:30.480
Some of those are very well known.

01:30.480 --> 01:32.440
The visibility is probably one of the biggest.

01:32.440 --> 01:36.840
We're talking about for Wikipedia, 28 billion views per month.

01:36.840 --> 01:43.040
We're talking about the visibility that Wikipedia and the Wikimedia Commons have provided to

01:43.040 --> 01:48.640
collection like the Met collection, the Metropolitan Museum in New York.

01:48.640 --> 01:55.640
It moved from a collection that was viewed two million times to 10 million times.

01:55.640 --> 01:58.680
So the visibility of those projects is very impressive.

01:58.680 --> 02:03.880
But also we're talking about an international community, a community that has also chapters

02:03.880 --> 02:10.560
around the world and the desire of enlarging the community with policies and with funding

02:10.560 --> 02:12.760
that have been created.

02:12.760 --> 02:18.640
Also we're talking about reusable resources, so a resource that really provides content,

02:18.640 --> 02:23.640
information data that are really available also to people that don't have particularly

02:23.640 --> 02:25.240
technical skills.

02:25.240 --> 02:30.240
And also there are other features like the fair data principles that are applied also

02:30.240 --> 02:36.920
on all those resources, but also an attention to new ethical principles, the care principles,

02:36.920 --> 02:43.960
or the synergy with open government and with GLAMS, so with cultural institutions.

02:43.960 --> 02:47.080
So those resources are already used in research.

02:47.080 --> 02:51.160
Wikidata is probably one of the major examples.

02:51.160 --> 02:55.960
And the beautiful project, SCOLIA, is one of the examples that you might access that

02:55.960 --> 03:00.000
provides information about researchers and topics.

03:00.000 --> 03:06.360
But there's been a lot of work related to how to use those resources as a research infrastructure.

03:06.360 --> 03:11.960
And I'm just quoting some of the papers related to this and focusing on Wikidata.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.400
Daniel Michen has done an incredible job in this.

03:15.400 --> 03:20.480
He was also a Wikipedia in residence for the Open Knowledge Foundation.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.800
We just heard a presentation from them.

03:22.800 --> 03:29.480
He was the first Wikipedian in residence and he worked extensively on open access, improving

03:29.480 --> 03:34.840
content also on Wikipedia related to it, improving also the communication of the project among

03:34.840 --> 03:37.080
the open science system.

03:37.080 --> 03:44.000
And in 2015, there was this project in working on Wikidata as a virtual research environment,

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
which is very promising.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.160
It was not financed, but it kind of gives an idea of how the infrastructure can be used

03:50.160 --> 03:53.680
and is already used in this direction.

03:53.680 --> 03:58.560
Furthermore, there are studies that are highlighting how, sorry, I need to breathe.

03:58.560 --> 04:04.800
This is something that I, you all noticed that it's something that I sometimes forget.

04:04.800 --> 04:13.600
So going back to, in 2019, there came up this study about Wikidata.

04:13.600 --> 04:18.760
So it shows how Wikidata is already extensively used, but he also talked about how art and

04:18.760 --> 04:23.960
humanities and social sciences are not very present in the field.

04:23.960 --> 04:30.720
And a research about art and humanities used and it's used in Wikidata show how there

04:30.720 --> 04:35.320
are projects that use the data, but there are a few projects that collaborate using the

04:35.320 --> 04:36.320
data.

04:36.320 --> 04:41.880
So create a community that actually upload the data from research and use the data.

04:41.880 --> 04:47.000
So I'm just going to present to you three positive elements and three challenges that

04:47.000 --> 04:53.000
I encounter in my work related to arts, humanities and social sciences that I think might be

04:53.000 --> 04:55.720
interesting to highlight.

04:55.720 --> 05:02.160
So for the advantages, the large use of all those resources combined together, so not

05:02.160 --> 05:07.280
only using Wikidata, but really take advantage of the different format that those resources

05:07.280 --> 05:09.360
allow to upload.

05:09.360 --> 05:15.320
A second element is the broad interest for a heritage and museum, so the existing and

05:15.320 --> 05:18.960
real attention that are on those projects.

05:18.960 --> 05:24.440
And the last issue is the possibility of visualizing and monitoring content.

05:24.440 --> 05:28.320
I breathe a moment and then get back to you.

05:28.320 --> 05:35.000
So for the challenges, a major one is a copyright and the restriction to public domain, the

05:35.000 --> 05:40.560
difficulties of course of collaborating with a community and also the challenge of scaling

05:40.560 --> 05:45.400
up and working with the different skills.

05:45.400 --> 05:50.440
So the first element, the possibility of using all the infrastructure is particularly interesting

05:50.440 --> 05:56.880
for humanities, arts and social sciences because it allows to really take research,

05:56.880 --> 05:58.640
resource and data.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.720
And in humanities and social science, you have a lot of also qualitative data.

06:02.720 --> 06:09.080
So you have interviews, photos, you have site exploration, you have artworks, you have content

06:09.080 --> 06:11.680
that comes from archives for example.

06:11.680 --> 06:15.880
And you can find on those resources the possibility to upload it.

06:15.880 --> 06:21.120
Also working with OpenStreetMap allows for example to enter data that Wikidata would

06:21.120 --> 06:22.240
not allow.

06:22.240 --> 06:29.560
So the combination of those two really allows you a broader work on those infrastructure.

06:29.560 --> 06:35.960
This is an example that comes from the upload of data from the Ticino region, the region

06:35.960 --> 06:38.320
in Switzerland.

06:38.320 --> 06:43.520
And the upload was done on Wikidata but also OpenStreetMap and with the upload of images

06:43.560 --> 06:48.240
on Wikimedia Commons and the creation of articles also on Wikipedia.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.480
The second issue is related to heritage.

06:50.480 --> 06:56.840
At the moment the 97 nations have participated in this contest called Wikilov's Monuments

06:56.840 --> 07:02.200
and they have uploaded an incredible number of data but also they have worked in creating

07:02.200 --> 07:08.600
one of the most incredible database of heritage sites around the world.

07:08.600 --> 07:18.280
And this content enriches the existing resources but can also be used to evaluate the existence

07:18.280 --> 07:22.960
of images and also the presence of heritage in different countries.

07:22.960 --> 07:28.880
This is a visualization we've been working on that allowed also to create a research

07:28.880 --> 07:37.840
based on the analysis of those data.

07:37.840 --> 07:45.800
Another project, another focus of the community is working on content coming from GLAMS.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.720
So GLAMS stands for Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museum.

07:49.720 --> 07:55.720
So we're talking about the broad network of cultural institutions and institutions.

07:55.720 --> 08:00.920
Consider also that universities have libraries, have collections, have archives.

08:00.920 --> 08:07.320
So it's very strange how sometimes the research institutions perceive separately the GLAMS.

08:07.320 --> 08:12.560
And there is sometimes a great difficulty in Brigida too.

08:12.560 --> 08:18.200
Also a lot of research for humanities and social sciences comes from those sources.

08:18.200 --> 08:23.040
So you work on documents, you work on images, you work on collections and this is really

08:23.040 --> 08:26.640
a center of interest for researchers in those fields.

08:26.640 --> 08:34.440
And the Wikimedia project, particularly after 2006-2008, have really invested a lot of energy

08:34.440 --> 08:40.760
in encouraging institutions to become open access and to upload content on Wikimedia

08:40.760 --> 08:45.440
commons and also with synergies with Wikidata.

08:45.440 --> 08:51.280
And in Italy we did a project in which we contacted all museums.

08:51.280 --> 09:00.960
We created the best existing database of museums existing in Italy.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.880
It was done in collaboration with ICOM Italy.

09:03.880 --> 09:07.560
We uploaded a national statistic about museums.

09:07.560 --> 09:13.400
So on Wikidata you can really access all the available data about museums and museums

09:13.400 --> 09:16.400
in Italy are quite numerous, as you can imagine.

09:16.400 --> 09:23.360
And also they started also collaborating and opening up their content to make sure that

09:23.360 --> 09:29.400
also museums were engaged in checking their data and contributing with authorization.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.000
This is a topic that I will shortly touch.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.400
We created a forum that allowed the museum to upload authorization for the content.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.760
In Italy there are restrictions also on public domain.

09:42.760 --> 09:47.600
And this forum was also developed with Daniela Scasciatratte, who might be here, so one

09:47.600 --> 09:55.680
of the developers, and so to facilitate also the institutional contribution to the project,

09:55.680 --> 09:58.400
which is one of the problems with Wikimedia commons.

09:58.400 --> 10:03.120
You need to be an individual to contribute to Wikimedia project.

10:03.120 --> 10:10.840
So you need an external interface or a system that allows to associate to a user an authorization

10:10.840 --> 10:16.800
that gives the authority to that user to upload content for an institution.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.880
So it is a step that is still missing.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.840
Those data allow to produce research.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.120
So you can monitor museum in a country.

10:24.120 --> 10:30.480
You can view if they have a person in charge of communication, how is their collection,

10:30.480 --> 10:32.840
if it's digitalized or not.

10:32.840 --> 10:41.040
And we enter in this a third positive aspect of the Wikimedia project and OpenStreetMap

10:41.040 --> 10:44.560
is that you can really visualize content in amazing ways.

10:44.560 --> 10:50.920
And visualizing content doesn't simply mean I have a statistic, I see what is there.

10:50.920 --> 10:57.260
It means also to visualize knowledge because what is on Wikipedia and what is in Wikimedia

10:57.260 --> 11:02.680
commons very often provide you information of what is available as knowledge.

11:02.680 --> 11:06.320
For example, images of heritage.

11:06.320 --> 11:12.240
In Italy we had a discussion with the Ministry of Culture because they miss images of certain

11:12.240 --> 11:14.400
areas of Calabria.

11:14.400 --> 11:20.080
So the community actually negotiated with the government, the data, and then they produced

11:20.080 --> 11:23.520
content that is now accessible also for the government.

11:23.520 --> 11:30.000
So monitoring what is available there somehow provides an image of what is actually available

11:30.000 --> 11:33.360
on the internet and to anyone.

11:33.360 --> 11:39.320
So monitoring knowledge is also interesting if you are contributing to it and you're contributing

11:39.320 --> 11:41.120
to modify it.

11:41.120 --> 11:47.120
So if a museum or a researcher is improving content related to the architect Paraviccini

11:47.120 --> 11:51.200
you can really see how you made an impact on that knowledge.

11:51.200 --> 11:56.840
And it's quite incredible to visualize this impact because normally impact on research

11:56.840 --> 11:59.720
is made with completely different criteria.

11:59.720 --> 12:04.680
So this criteria is actually something that is the mission of a museum of course to improve

12:04.680 --> 12:08.920
knowledge otherwise if their mission was to have a lot of visitors they would offer

12:08.920 --> 12:11.960
beer that would make it a bit easier.

12:11.960 --> 12:18.360
But also it's really a way of changing the perspective on how you create a researcher

12:18.360 --> 12:21.640
that is really available and visible.

12:21.640 --> 12:31.640
Now I brief a couple of moments and then I move to the challenges.

12:31.640 --> 12:34.120
Okay the first one is copyright.

12:34.120 --> 12:40.040
This is an issue that is present on all humanities, social science research.

12:40.040 --> 12:43.840
This is obviously a very well-known challenge.

12:43.840 --> 12:48.840
So you would expect that for example you take a photo of a monument and you upload it.

12:48.840 --> 12:53.760
Actually things are a little bit more complicated than this in particular.

12:53.760 --> 12:57.680
The fact that you need to identify what is heritage and what is not.

12:57.680 --> 13:02.160
You need the rights obviously of the photographer but there are other issues related to property

13:02.160 --> 13:07.080
and also to the rights of the author of that building.

13:07.080 --> 13:11.280
If you live in a country that has freedom of panorama you can take photos of everything

13:11.280 --> 13:14.160
that you can see outside so you're fine.

13:14.160 --> 13:20.720
But many many countries do not have freedom of panorama and it's a right that was not unfortunately

13:20.720 --> 13:25.160
made accessible to anyone with European copyright law.

13:25.160 --> 13:30.640
So in those countries you need to ask the authorization of the architect that has not

13:30.640 --> 13:35.400
been dead for more than 70 years or the artist that produced an artwork.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.160
This is a layer of complexity.

13:38.160 --> 13:45.240
Furthermore you have layers of complexity that are added to public domain content.

13:45.240 --> 13:50.160
This is tricky maybe it will change because in theory with the European copyright law

13:50.160 --> 13:52.960
maybe we are moving in the right direction.

13:52.960 --> 14:00.360
But in Italy you need to pay a fee for every commercial use of content in public domain.

14:00.360 --> 14:04.840
And this is obviously a very complex block.

14:04.840 --> 14:09.400
So those restrictions create layers of complexity and makes it more complicated of course to

14:09.400 --> 14:12.680
upload content on the Wikimedia project.

14:12.680 --> 14:18.480
In particular because those projects really want content that is clearly open and accessible.

14:18.480 --> 14:24.960
I still have a lot of time so I should relax.

14:24.960 --> 14:30.080
So I want to make sure that I tell you everything that I might know.

14:30.080 --> 14:38.200
So we did a project to explore the impact of culture on safety in Africa.

14:38.200 --> 14:43.680
We did it in three countries and in particular in Cameroon we worked a lot with authorization.

14:43.680 --> 14:51.560
So we uploaded Cameroon, Duane Cameroon has a great production of public art since 1991.

14:51.560 --> 14:58.800
So there are artworks that are disseminated in 13 neighbourhoods and it's quite an incredible

14:58.800 --> 15:03.400
project because they've been commissioning artwork to international artists, local artists.

15:03.400 --> 15:08.120
You can see the transformation of the city through those artworks.

15:08.120 --> 15:14.200
So what we did, we uploaded images on Wikimedia Commons.

15:14.200 --> 15:19.080
We created data on Wikidata connected of course to the categories.

15:19.080 --> 15:23.640
We created a list of artworks on Wikipedia in English and in French.

15:23.640 --> 15:28.600
And we uploaded text because all the production of the research project was on CC by SA and

15:28.600 --> 15:30.040
with the authorization.

15:30.040 --> 15:35.440
So for every single institution and every single author we created a permission that

15:35.440 --> 15:42.000
was then sent to the system of recording permission of Wikimedia Commons.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.280
And this allowed to create really the possibility of uploading content.

15:48.280 --> 15:52.960
Since it was done in Africa it was a bit more complicated so what we did was we had printed

15:52.960 --> 15:59.400
a form that the artist would sign, we scanned them and send them to the permission system

15:59.400 --> 16:03.000
that recorded them and registered a ticket.

16:03.000 --> 16:08.960
So of course I took an example that is particularly complicated because public art in Africa with

16:08.960 --> 16:15.640
a living artist with no freedom of panorama is probably the worst you can get.

16:15.640 --> 16:20.200
But it's feasible so it's complicated but it's something that is possible to do.

16:20.200 --> 16:26.040
Of course it requires a lot of changes also in procedure and also the need of creating

16:26.040 --> 16:31.720
processes that allows the upload of those authorization and facilitate also this connection

16:31.720 --> 16:37.800
between institution and the rights management.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.640
The second challenge is related to collaborating.

16:40.640 --> 16:49.480
And now I don't know how many of you contributed to Wikipedia.

16:49.480 --> 16:54.560
How many had their content deleted on Wikipedia?

16:54.560 --> 16:58.080
This is something that is an experience that I think everyone...

16:58.080 --> 17:02.040
So contributing to Wikimedia Project is not easy.

17:02.040 --> 17:07.880
It's a little easier sometimes on Wikisource and Wikiquote I would recommend as a first

17:07.880 --> 17:11.360
if you want to go on holiday on those projects is quite fun.

17:11.360 --> 17:14.240
Also no Viki Voyage can be challenging too.

17:14.240 --> 17:20.720
So those projects have a lot of rules, policies and also collaboration is never easy.

17:20.720 --> 17:27.480
So everybody that collaborates know that they are challenging in involving other people

17:27.480 --> 17:30.520
and also creating processes that are transparent.

17:30.520 --> 17:36.160
There are some specific rules of the project that researchers need to take particular attention

17:36.160 --> 17:40.720
to those in particularly of course the no original research which is also an advantage

17:40.720 --> 17:47.160
for a researcher because you quote the work of everyone and you source everything.

17:47.160 --> 17:53.360
Also conflict of interest, the fact of declaring why, how we are contributing, neutral point

17:53.360 --> 17:57.840
of view for the encyclopedia and of course Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.280
So it doesn't provide space for everything.

18:01.280 --> 18:07.120
But it's true that for museums, cultural institutions, for heritage, also for improving

18:07.120 --> 18:12.000
articles related to territories that are very connected to topics related to architecture

18:12.000 --> 18:16.680
and art, this Wikipedia is perfectly suitable.

18:16.680 --> 18:22.120
Also you need to consider that research in humanities and dissemination.

18:22.120 --> 18:28.120
Sometimes the two boundaries are storing information and disseminating information.

18:28.120 --> 18:35.240
Sometimes also scholars would like that the way they store information is beautiful, is

18:35.240 --> 18:39.480
accessible because it's something that might interest a broader public.

18:39.480 --> 18:43.600
So it's sometimes not sufficient to store a folder on Zenodo.

18:43.600 --> 18:47.400
You would like to have an interactive map that allows you to see the building, having

18:47.400 --> 18:49.480
access to all the documents on.

18:49.480 --> 18:53.600
And Wikimedia project can somehow provide this infrastructure.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.240
The last issue is how to make this scalable.

18:57.240 --> 19:03.240
So of course working on licensing, working on CC0 for data is an issue.

19:03.240 --> 19:09.320
But the upload of content on the Wikimedia project requires a certain expertise.

19:09.320 --> 19:15.040
And what I saw in the past is that very often projects worked when there was the community

19:15.040 --> 19:16.040
involved.

19:16.040 --> 19:19.360
So people that were experts already of those projects.

19:19.360 --> 19:26.800
So this joint work and also maybe the model of Wikipedia in residence could be an approach

19:26.800 --> 19:31.320
that can be interesting also on the Wikimedia project and OpenStreetMap.

19:32.320 --> 19:37.320
Finally I wanted to just mention that I'm working on a landscape analysis of research

19:37.320 --> 19:40.960
infrastructure for social sciences and humanities.

19:40.960 --> 19:47.120
So I started on Metawiki, that is where we start, we always say, oh you find the don't

19:47.120 --> 19:49.160
make it Metawiki.

19:49.160 --> 19:55.360
So here you find a list of research infrastructure to make sure that Wikidata has those resources.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.920
But the truth is that at the moment there are two problems.

19:59.920 --> 20:06.600
The first one is that all local infrastructure or collection databases are not connected

20:06.600 --> 20:10.800
and they're not perceived as research infrastructure because they are too small and they don't

20:10.800 --> 20:12.800
have national relevance.

20:12.800 --> 20:17.920
So having the possibility of bridging those resources and maybe Wikidata can really provide

20:17.920 --> 20:21.280
a landscape analysis on this would be very valuable.

20:21.280 --> 20:24.960
Also making sure that we know about those is very useful because those are resources

20:24.960 --> 20:27.840
that can also nourish those websites.

20:27.840 --> 20:33.440
And finally there is the problem that investment by government on research infrastructure normally

20:33.440 --> 20:40.640
they focus on implementing the infrastructure and maintaining the infrastructure while also

20:40.640 --> 20:43.400
populating the infrastructure is another issue.

20:43.400 --> 20:47.480
And there's going to be also a presentation about OpenRefine that is very important and

20:47.480 --> 20:52.080
relevant for this because obviously you need tools that allows really to nourish and to

20:52.080 --> 20:54.600
connect those infrastructure.

20:54.600 --> 20:55.600
I'm done.

20:55.600 --> 20:56.600
Thank you.

20:56.600 --> 21:18.560
So now you land there and take some questions.

21:18.560 --> 21:48.520
I told everybody that I know to not ask questions.

21:48.520 --> 21:56.200
Yes.

21:56.200 --> 22:03.040
One question they asked the question was if we have an idea of how much data from research

22:03.040 --> 22:07.560
feeds Wikidata and is accessible on Wikidata.

22:07.560 --> 22:12.920
I think this research of 2019 might give some insight of it.

22:12.920 --> 22:18.680
I don't think it was more focused the study on models rather than actual data.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.760
It is sourced.

22:19.760 --> 22:23.960
So I presume it's something that is possible to is an information that is possible to view

22:23.960 --> 22:25.080
on Wikidata.

22:25.080 --> 22:26.080
So that would be feasible.

22:26.080 --> 22:32.880
It's true that sometimes the taxonomy of also property so the possibility of actually getting

22:32.880 --> 22:36.040
a full access to the information is not obvious.

22:36.040 --> 22:41.200
Also for research infrastructure one of the challenges that one thing is called the virtual

22:41.200 --> 22:42.200
library.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.200
The other one is a digital library.

22:43.200 --> 22:44.760
The other one is a repository.

22:44.760 --> 22:51.200
So combining all those also broader terms makes it a bit complicated to get a full idea

22:51.200 --> 22:52.200
of it.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.200
Thank you.

22:53.200 --> 22:54.200
Another question.

22:54.200 --> 22:55.200
Thank you.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.200
I enjoyed the talk.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.200
One thing I was wondering is there is a link up talk in the chat here because I enjoyed

22:57.200 --> 22:58.200
any and Chris's talk talking about opening infrastructure finder and now you're talking

22:58.200 --> 22:59.200
about opening infrastructure finder.

22:59.200 --> 23:18.200
I wonder whether there is dialogue or anything at all.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.200
Yes.

23:19.200 --> 23:25.640
So the question was how to connect maybe the if I understood correctly connect the possibility

23:25.640 --> 23:30.480
of finding open repositories and how we can connect with this one.

23:30.480 --> 23:36.200
It is important to notice that a lot of libraries and repositing existing repositories are already

23:36.200 --> 23:37.880
collaborating with Wikidata.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.000
So there is a desire.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.760
Europe Anna which is one of the biggest repository has a very strong collaboration for example

23:44.760 --> 23:47.160
just to mention one of the most well known.

23:47.160 --> 23:51.160
This is a repository of Glam's for open research.

23:51.160 --> 23:56.160
There are lots of connection associated rather to repository that provide information about

23:56.160 --> 23:58.160
researchers or papers.

23:58.160 --> 24:01.880
This is something that is implemented on Wikidata quite nicely.

24:01.880 --> 24:09.160
But it's true that also in general the investment are not on something like Wikidata.

24:09.160 --> 24:17.960
So investment are either repository by topic and at a national level I never saw an investment

24:17.960 --> 24:20.320
that is on Wikidata.

24:20.320 --> 24:23.760
It is rather in maybe creating some interconnection.

24:23.760 --> 24:28.400
So this is something that my but of course I'm also here to actually stress this.

24:28.400 --> 24:33.200
I think we should collaborate more with Wikidata that would be valuable, useful and efficient.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.680
So that's all.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.680
Thanks.

24:35.680 --> 24:40.000
If you have any more questions we can welcome them.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
Thank you.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
Thank you.

24:42.000 --> 24:43.000

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000

24:44.000 --> 24:45.000
Thank you.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.000
Thank you.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
