WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.000
What do I call you, Naiman?

00:13.000 --> 00:19.000
I don't mind. I nickname or real name. Whatever is easier for you to pronounce, because a

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
YAL is a bit difficult sometimes.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
A YAL?

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
Yeah, I mean, a YAL, that's the name. I use Naiman because I live abroad and no one can

00:26.000 --> 00:27.000
pronounce it.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Sorry?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
Yeah.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
Naiman seems a bit easier sometimes.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Peter, see a new audio?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Yeah.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
Unmuted.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
Unmuted?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.000
Right.

00:35.000 --> 00:46.000
Right. Your controls are here. You have 30 minutes to question a loud speaker.

00:46.000 --> 01:01.000
Just join us and welcome to the UNS developer room. This is our final speaker for the day.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
Naiman and he will talk to us about the history of blockchain and naming systems.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Okay. Thank you. Thanks everyone, you know, who stayed till the end. I imagine it was a

01:11.000 --> 01:16.000
great, at least it was for me. I'm going to talk today about the history of, you know,

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
blockchain name systems. I'm Naiman or a YAL. I'm from Israel, but I live in Poland.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
And, oh, that's fast. And I'm a mathematician, but I work on peer-to-peer websites in the

01:30.000 --> 01:35.000
last few years. If you don't know what it is, don't worry, because the main important thing

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
regarding the talk is that those websites use blockchain name systems. So I had a chance

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
to talk with the developers of the main ones, even being engaged a bit in some of them,

01:44.000 --> 01:51.000
and that's why I do this talk. This is some projects, but I did, which use, you know,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
blockchain name systems. Don't focus on that, because, you know, it talks not about me.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.000
I know that blockchain has a bad connotation, especially, I guess, in this thing.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.700
I'm not here to change your mind.

02:05.700 --> 02:07.920
I'm here to tell a story.

02:07.920 --> 02:12.680
And the story begins in 2001, where a guy called

02:12.680 --> 02:18.280
Zuko Wilcox sent a draft to his friends of some article

02:18.280 --> 02:20.560
that he wrote, and it began with the words,

02:20.560 --> 02:23.440
please do not propagate this information widely yet.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.680
I'm still working on it.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.240
Did they respect it?

02:27.240 --> 02:30.120
Absolutely not.

02:30.120 --> 02:34.080
This was propagated so hard that by now there is a Wikipedia

02:34.080 --> 02:38.480
page on it called Zuko's Triangle.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.840
Zuko's Triangle basically says that a name system,

02:41.840 --> 02:44.040
there are three properties that a name system

02:44.040 --> 02:46.240
can have or not have.

02:46.240 --> 02:48.240
One of them is secure.

02:48.240 --> 02:53.560
Secure means that two people cannot register the same name.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.200
The other one is human meaningful,

02:56.200 --> 02:59.160
which basically means you can choose which name you

02:59.160 --> 03:01.440
registers out of the ones which are available.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.080
And hopefully because you're human,

03:03.080 --> 03:05.360
the name would have some meaning.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.840
And the last one is decentralized,

03:07.840 --> 03:10.920
which means that in order to register a name

03:10.920 --> 03:14.960
or to verify a name, you can do it yourself

03:14.960 --> 03:18.240
without needing someone else like a third party.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.880
And Zuko's Triangle says that for any specific name system,

03:22.880 --> 03:25.800
you can have at most two of those properties.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.040
You cannot have the whole three.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.160
Sorry.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.280
Here are some examples.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.720
You know, a name system that I guess everyone here know.

03:34.720 --> 03:35.800
DNS.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.320
DNS has human meaningful, for sure.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.680
It's also safe.

03:40.680 --> 03:45.120
It's not decentralized in the definition of Zuko's Triangle.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.440
Public private key is safe.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.240
Yes, it's secure.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.120
Sorry.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.200
Decentralized, yes.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.400
You can generate yourself.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.520
You can verify someone else on your own.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.320
But it is human meaningless.

03:58.320 --> 04:00.840
Most public keys are a monster.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.480
And my favorite one, the state ID, which is safe.

04:04.480 --> 04:07.120
But otherwise, it is neither decentralized

04:07.120 --> 04:11.400
or human meaningful, which I think it's a shame.

04:11.400 --> 04:18.800
I would love to be able to choose my state ID, but states.

04:18.800 --> 04:22.360
Zuko's Triangle kind of was considered

04:22.360 --> 04:25.400
to be true for the first decade of this millennium.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.600
It was what I had that was not involved well known

04:28.600 --> 04:30.400
within the name systems community.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.400
But you can only have two.

04:31.400 --> 04:35.400
And you shouldn't try to build one that has the whole three.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.120
2009, Bitcoin invented.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.920
And shortly afterwards, a year later,

04:40.920 --> 04:43.320
in some of the Bitcoin IRC chats, people

04:43.320 --> 04:47.640
started to say, hey, can we put name on a blockchain?

04:47.640 --> 04:49.120
Now, this continued in chats.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.480
There was a Bitcoin Talk forum.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.760
At some point, the legendary Aaron Schwartz

04:54.800 --> 04:56.160
heard about it.

04:56.160 --> 05:00.040
And he wrote an article squaring the triangle, which

05:00.040 --> 05:05.320
basically says, if we put names on a blockchain,

05:05.320 --> 05:08.520
we can actually go around Zuko's Triangle

05:08.520 --> 05:10.600
and can have a name system that have the whole three

05:10.600 --> 05:12.400
properties.

05:12.400 --> 05:17.560
This can be, you can argue if a blockchain is really

05:17.560 --> 05:20.920
decentralized or not in the sense that the requirement was

05:20.920 --> 05:23.960
that you can register and verify yourself, not

05:23.960 --> 05:26.520
register and verify with a blockchain.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.440
But for the sake of this talk, we

05:28.440 --> 05:31.600
think about the blockchain as a big dump object.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.600
It's a tool.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.680
It does what you want.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.080
I know it's not.

05:36.080 --> 05:39.440
I know that each blockchain has its own pros and cons.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.480
I'll be happy to argue about each event afterwards

05:42.480 --> 05:44.720
in a beer with that right now.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.600
Big dump object, by the way.

05:46.600 --> 05:47.760
I'm a youth science fiction fan.

05:47.760 --> 05:48.920
It's a term from science fiction.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.200
It's a subgenre of books that have a big dump object.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.120
It does something.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.560
That's a Ringworld by Larry Neven, classic science fiction

05:54.560 --> 05:55.280
book.

05:55.280 --> 05:59.120
If you haven't read it, I read it as a kid.

05:59.120 --> 06:02.040
I hope it's still fun now, but I really loved it.

06:02.040 --> 06:07.360
So 2011, Namecoin was launched.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.040
Namecoin basically did exactly that,

06:09.040 --> 06:11.520
putting names on a blockchain.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.640
Here is some interesting trivia details.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.200
The names that it put on a blockchain

06:16.200 --> 06:17.240
were not actually names.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.560
It was just like 250 bytes on a chain,

06:20.560 --> 06:24.000
so you can put a sequence of 01.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.520
Then if it's a name or not, or how you interpret it

06:26.520 --> 06:31.440
as an ASCII or a Unicode or whatever is up to you,

06:31.440 --> 06:35.040
no one verifies everything besides the fact

06:35.040 --> 06:41.520
that the similar bytes was not put before.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.360
No subdomains, because all you put is bytes.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.400
So there is no subdomains.

06:45.400 --> 06:48.440
It's just names that you register on it.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.880
They did have something which is called namespace.

06:50.880 --> 06:53.760
It was in the software layer, not on the blockchain.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.640
I want to put it out, because they had basically

06:55.640 --> 06:57.400
two that they were promoting, the developers.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.160
One was D, which was for domain names for websites.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.880
But the other one was ID.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.840
And that's important, because this already

07:04.840 --> 07:07.200
shows that the thinking was that those names are not

07:07.200 --> 07:10.640
necessarily for domains of computers that

07:10.640 --> 07:14.240
can be used for identify people.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.680
The cost was 0.1 Namecoin.

07:16.680 --> 07:21.440
NMC was a coin, currency of Namecoin.

07:21.440 --> 07:25.040
To adjust it was very difficult.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.360
I mean, you can raise it in a soft work,

07:27.360 --> 07:30.480
but to reduce it, you need to do a hard fork.

07:30.480 --> 07:34.080
Also to know how much it costs really in fiat money,

07:34.080 --> 07:37.000
depends on the moment that you buy it.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.080
And this didn't go to the developers

07:39.080 --> 07:40.400
or to finance anything.

07:40.400 --> 07:44.880
It was just burnt, because in blockchain economy thinking,

07:44.880 --> 07:46.480
burning money is how you make money.

07:46.520 --> 07:50.560
Lecture a few days ago.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.160
This is the last blocks of Namecoin.

07:52.160 --> 07:54.720
One transaction basically just means the miner.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.520
So which means no one did anything there.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.400
As you see at the moment, I think

08:00.400 --> 08:03.480
that it's a project which is still being maintained,

08:03.480 --> 08:05.800
but not really being used.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.640
And there's a question, why did it fail?

08:08.640 --> 08:10.560
Or at least I think it's failed.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.040
Namecoin people here, I apologize.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.440
And I think that there are two things that they did.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.840
Maybe wrong.

08:18.840 --> 08:22.840
First thing, they really copied Bitcoin's playbook one by one.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.800
But name is not money.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.200
Names are not money.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.000
It's a different animal.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.800
You can believe that 100 coins have value

08:32.800 --> 08:34.200
and it's okay, it's not contradicting.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.280
You can go to a store, one store that accepts in dollar,

08:36.280 --> 08:38.640
you will pay in dollar, another store in euros,

08:38.640 --> 08:39.880
you will pay in euros.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.640
Another one wants Bitcoin, okay,

08:41.640 --> 08:43.720
you will get some Bitcoin.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.600
It's not contradicting,

08:46.600 --> 08:49.040
but no one wants to think

08:49.040 --> 08:51.640
that the same object have two names.

08:51.640 --> 08:52.600
This is not how it goes.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.240
Like historically, if I would think

08:54.240 --> 08:55.720
that some God has one name,

08:55.720 --> 08:58.240
and you will think that the same God has another name,

08:58.240 --> 09:00.200
there's a good chance we will go to a war.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.320
We will not accept each other's belief.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.200
But the other reason, which is maybe more deep,

09:07.200 --> 09:11.600
is that namecoin developers

09:11.680 --> 09:14.040
had a huge challenge of building it.

09:14.040 --> 09:15.200
It was the second blockchain.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.640
It was the first NFT blockchain.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.040
It was the first side chain

09:19.040 --> 09:21.320
that had to invent marriage mining.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.560
And also after it was launched,

09:22.560 --> 09:23.920
it was definitely not scalable,

09:23.920 --> 09:26.360
and also don't think very scalable right now.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.760
And they spent lots of their time

09:28.760 --> 09:30.080
improving the protocol

09:30.080 --> 09:31.840
and handling all those technical details.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.800
And they didn't have time to also think,

09:34.800 --> 09:35.960
how do I make it useful?

09:35.960 --> 09:37.280
What is it good for?

09:37.280 --> 09:39.620
And you know, pushing it to users.

09:41.720 --> 09:46.280
So 2016, as I said, I entered the blockchain ecosystem.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.880
I asked people about namecoin.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.600
I even bought one, I think, just a name,

09:50.600 --> 09:53.520
but I'm not 100% sure what this intended to.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.400
The general feeling was that all the good names are squatted.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.080
There is nothing to do with it.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.960
And the names on a blockchain is nice for playing,

10:00.960 --> 10:02.680
but not really a useful use case.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.600
And in the same year, E&S was announced.

10:07.600 --> 10:12.600
E&S is a very different animal from namecoin

10:13.040 --> 10:15.720
because it is built on top of Ethereum.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.480
And if you don't know anything about blockchain,

10:17.480 --> 10:19.320
you should know that to write an application

10:19.320 --> 10:21.240
on top of Ethereum is much easier

10:21.240 --> 10:23.080
than building a blockchain.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.920
Which means E&S, which is really well written

10:25.920 --> 10:28.280
and a nice engineering feat,

10:28.280 --> 10:31.200
is still easier to write back from namecoin.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.960
So they actually had time to have long discussions

10:33.960 --> 10:36.120
how to get people to use it.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.240
And they did two things.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.440
One of them, they said, okay,

10:40.440 --> 10:42.280
names are going to have an auction.

10:42.280 --> 10:45.240
So it won't be the fastest person who takes a name,

10:45.240 --> 10:47.280
but the one who agrees to pay the most.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.760
It's not necessarily the best solution,

10:48.760 --> 10:51.040
but at least, you know, they try something.

10:51.040 --> 10:53.520
But the other thing that, again, I see is very crucial

10:53.520 --> 10:56.040
is that they had updates.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.280
They could update their system relatively easily

10:59.280 --> 11:00.960
and they were very open about it

11:00.960 --> 11:04.680
because when they launched in May the 4th,

11:05.120 --> 11:09.760
May 2017, they called it E&S Temporary Registrar.

11:09.760 --> 11:12.760
And some of the messages, they even said,

11:12.760 --> 11:14.920
you know, we are not sure how to do it right.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.080
So that's why temporary at some point,

11:17.080 --> 11:19.840
it will be changed, be prepared for it.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.560
At the time, 2017 May, it was before the DAO hack.

11:23.560 --> 11:26.720
So it was not really common in blockchain

11:26.720 --> 11:28.680
to say that you are going to change things.

11:28.680 --> 11:29.920
This was still the time of, you know,

11:29.920 --> 11:32.400
immutable programs and code is low and stuff.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.360
How did it go?

11:36.360 --> 11:40.080
Well, it went in the same way like Namecoin,

11:40.080 --> 11:43.600
quite successful commercially in the beginning.

11:43.600 --> 11:48.120
I think that someone put a bid on the name exchange.eth

11:48.120 --> 11:49.720
of $2.6 million.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.720
So that's quite well.

11:51.720 --> 11:54.240
Like Namecoin, the money did not go to the pockets

11:54.240 --> 11:58.000
of the developers, but instead it was locked.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.760
So it was a deposit and the moment that the name expired,

12:00.760 --> 12:05.400
you got it back, which if you want to fight squatters

12:05.400 --> 12:08.320
or, you know, speculators, it's not necessarily

12:08.320 --> 12:10.520
the best idea because they have nothing to lose.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.120
A year passed and another blockchain name system

12:16.120 --> 12:18.200
was announced, Handshake.

12:18.200 --> 12:21.440
And I like to say that Handshake took one step backwards,

12:21.440 --> 12:23.400
three steps forward.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.800
I think it's kind of represented.

12:25.800 --> 12:29.360
And the step backward was that ENS was built

12:29.360 --> 12:32.680
on top of a blockchain, which could be very flexible.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.760
Namecoin, sorry, Handshake said, well,

12:35.760 --> 12:38.880
we are actually going to build our own blockchain.

12:38.880 --> 12:43.120
It was a very, already in 2018, to have your own proof

12:43.120 --> 12:46.760
of work blockchain without updates was outdated.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.680
And I said, because I remember hearing about it,

12:48.680 --> 12:52.840
and I thought, OK, that's two years, at least too late.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.040
But this thing provided them the ability to do something

12:56.040 --> 12:57.720
that the other name systems didn't do.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.320
And I don't think that anyone else does,

12:59.320 --> 13:02.240
besides them at the moment, because I said that decentralized

13:02.240 --> 13:05.680
is registering a name and verifying a name by yourself.

13:05.680 --> 13:07.600
But actually, to verify something on a blockchain

13:07.600 --> 13:09.160
is very difficult.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.360
In the worst case, you need to have the whole blockchain,

13:11.360 --> 13:12.560
which is huge.

13:12.560 --> 13:16.120
In the better case, you only need to have, like, 30 gigabytes

13:16.120 --> 13:16.560
of a proof.

13:16.560 --> 13:19.000
And that's not very practical for a name system.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.600
And Handshake really made an effort.

13:20.600 --> 13:24.960
The whole white paper is to us to have short proofs.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.640
So of a few kilobytes, that this is the name owner,

13:27.640 --> 13:31.240
and that's what the data that they attached to it.

13:31.240 --> 13:36.120
The other thing that they did is gift economy.

13:36.120 --> 13:38.480
I think I know that this is from Corey Doctorow books,

13:38.480 --> 13:42.200
but at the time, this was very popular among the Bernice.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.400
Handshake actually is the first one that said,

13:44.400 --> 13:45.760
we want to replace ICANN.

13:45.760 --> 13:51.160
We want to be the new root of DNS.

13:51.160 --> 13:54.120
And then people were buying it.

13:54.120 --> 13:57.120
Namecheap bought a Handshake domain for 750K.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.800
There were people who were participating in auctions.

13:59.800 --> 14:00.320
And I checked.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.680
Now people still participate in auctions, not in these amounts,

14:02.680 --> 14:05.320
but it seems to be a thing.

14:05.320 --> 14:06.960
There were some other funny stories

14:06.960 --> 14:11.920
that SiHab joined Handshake and then left two days later,

14:11.920 --> 14:14.200
because they thought they get a domain on the blockchain.

14:14.200 --> 14:16.560
But actually, they got a subdomain on someone

14:16.560 --> 14:17.840
who has a domain on the blockchain.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.080
So there was nothing decentralized about it.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.080
It was a misunderstanding.

14:22.080 --> 14:26.000
But besides those things, I don't

14:26.000 --> 14:32.240
think that there was significant usage of Handshake.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.760
Definitely not at the time.

14:34.760 --> 14:36.240
We'll get back to it towards the end,

14:36.240 --> 14:37.880
just so you know when we speak about what happens nowadays.

14:37.880 --> 14:39.880
But at the time, it was mostly like the other blockchain

14:39.880 --> 14:42.480
systems buying and selling.

14:42.480 --> 14:46.560
So the thing was a bit grim at this point, 2020.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.520
But don't worry.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.880
New decade, things starts to be going to be more happy soon.

14:51.880 --> 14:54.400
We have to go before that one year later,

14:54.400 --> 14:58.280
where ENS permanent registrar was launched.

14:58.280 --> 15:02.560
And they took two years of studying lesson

15:02.560 --> 15:03.840
and actually modified things.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.760
And the first thing that they did is auctions out.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.680
Because for the first few weeks, people

15:08.680 --> 15:11.240
actually participate in auctions for some specific name

15:11.240 --> 15:16.200
like exchange.eth by the time that I wanted to buy ENS domain,

15:16.200 --> 15:17.520
which was Neiman.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.840
No one participate on the auction besides me.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.960
And it was just an annoying process for the user.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.280
So they said auctions are good for the beginning.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.640
Afterwards, you don't need them, which I think

15:25.640 --> 15:27.560
makes lots of sense.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.000
The other thing that they did is that by this point,

15:30.000 --> 15:32.200
they were almost broke.

15:32.200 --> 15:35.400
I mean, they started with a million grants, dollar,

15:35.400 --> 15:36.360
from a few foundation.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.200
I'm not sure if I don't remember if they got anything

15:38.200 --> 15:38.800
else on the way.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.160
But time passes.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.240
You have to pay people's salary.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.040
They were almost broke.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.920
And then they thought, I mean, their idea

15:44.920 --> 15:48.440
was to be a non-profit that gets stuff from donations and grants.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.280
But 2019, the blockchain had a winter.

15:51.280 --> 15:52.440
No one gave them any money.

15:52.440 --> 15:56.080
And then they figured out, well, there is all this locked money.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.360
And why do we actually lock it?

15:57.360 --> 15:58.320
It's not good for anything.

15:58.320 --> 15:59.760
It's not protecting against squatters

15:59.760 --> 16:01.480
because they can try to squat on them.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.840
If they don't manage, they just get the money back.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.160
And they did.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.720
The next step, money goes to ENS organization

16:07.720 --> 16:09.640
with this NGO, which means it's supposed to be

16:09.640 --> 16:12.040
fed into the development.

16:12.040 --> 16:14.240
And overnight, they became from an organization

16:14.240 --> 16:15.960
which is almost broke, the organization that

16:15.960 --> 16:18.440
has millions of dollars.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.560
This was important.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.600
I was already developing for ENS before.

16:23.600 --> 16:25.960
But it was a side project.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.720
And when this happened, you start to think, as a developer,

16:28.720 --> 16:31.120
well, maybe I should take it more seriously

16:31.120 --> 16:34.560
because now they have money that they have to give someone.

16:34.560 --> 16:35.320
They are an NGO.

16:35.320 --> 16:38.640
They are supposed by their declaration legally

16:38.640 --> 16:40.520
to give it to the ecosystem.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.640
They didn't give to anyone.

16:41.640 --> 16:45.040
But they thought, it sits here.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.760
Another thing that they did is that they kind of changed

16:49.760 --> 16:51.520
or defined what their names are for.

16:51.520 --> 16:53.280
And they said, this is a web-free identity,

16:53.280 --> 16:55.720
or more specifically, because a web-free is a marketing term

16:55.720 --> 16:56.840
very annoying.

16:56.840 --> 17:00.240
It's an identity supposed to be used in a pharium ecosystem.

17:00.240 --> 17:01.680
And I think that they managed actually

17:01.680 --> 17:03.040
to do it quite well.

17:03.040 --> 17:08.360
Verdeirector, Brantley Milligan, he did, in my opinion, magic.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.400
He has infinite amount of energy.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.000
I wrote some message in ENS forum.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.320
And immediately he said, hey, let's set a talk and meet.

17:16.320 --> 17:17.840
And he asked, do I want to build for them more?

17:17.840 --> 17:19.400
He had ideas.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.960
He started to do all those things where

17:21.960 --> 17:24.840
he asked people in Twitter to change their name

17:24.840 --> 17:27.040
to their ENS names to show that people actually

17:27.040 --> 17:28.720
use it as identity.

17:28.720 --> 17:30.520
In conferences, people start to use it.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.240
In the firm conferences is their identity, their name,

17:33.240 --> 17:35.200
Naiman.eth.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.320
He was really pushing it well.

17:37.320 --> 17:40.040
And I got to see it all from front seat,

17:40.040 --> 17:42.560
because at the time I was working on this project.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.640
It was a search engine for the Centra's Web for ENS plus

17:45.640 --> 17:47.080
IPFS websites.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.960
So I got to see how every month more and more people

17:49.960 --> 17:51.640
got ENS name.

17:51.640 --> 17:52.560
There was more buzz.

17:52.560 --> 17:55.440
And people actually use it as an ID.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.920
I'm not saying it was a huge thing, but it was a thing.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.400
There was a use case for this thing.

17:59.400 --> 18:03.440
And before, there was none.

18:03.440 --> 18:04.800
But still, when people ask me, hey,

18:04.800 --> 18:07.600
are you going to do something professional with it?

18:07.600 --> 18:10.200
Are you going to build a serious big project or business

18:10.200 --> 18:13.000
on top of it, I was saying that I'm not

18:13.000 --> 18:17.240
sure, because the root of ENS at the time

18:17.240 --> 18:21.560
was held by a multi-seq of, I think, seven people, which

18:21.560 --> 18:23.280
is quite risky.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.280
Forget the centralization.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.280
Not the centralization.

18:25.280 --> 18:26.440
It's just quite risky.

18:26.440 --> 18:30.720
If I'm doing a project which I put a lot of effort and investment

18:30.720 --> 18:32.520
on top of ENS and then something is

18:32.520 --> 18:34.600
hacked with a multi-seq of seven people, which

18:34.600 --> 18:38.720
is very easy to imagine, then what do I do next?

18:38.720 --> 18:39.800
So I was telling everyone.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.960
I also told it to the ENS people.

18:41.960 --> 18:44.240
I'm not sure it's so directly or implied it.

18:44.240 --> 18:48.320
I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who mentioned that.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.920
And then we reached November 2021,

18:50.920 --> 18:53.440
when a very significant thing happened.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.680
ENS DAO was announced.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.320
DAO is a decentralized organization.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.000
If you're not from the blockchain ecosystem,

19:00.000 --> 19:02.200
it's OK if you don't know it.

19:02.200 --> 19:05.080
The idea of a DAO is that instead of out

19:05.080 --> 19:07.440
of the crypto Twitter, I mean, my mom's neighbor who

19:07.480 --> 19:09.360
has nothing to do with blockchain

19:09.360 --> 19:11.360
told me that he bought an ENS thing.

19:11.360 --> 19:12.720
And I was like, oh, I'm working with it.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.920
That's nice.

19:14.920 --> 19:18.640
I think that lots of people who are now active in ENS

19:18.640 --> 19:21.480
joined at this stage, not because there is money,

19:21.480 --> 19:23.440
just because they heard about it.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.520
It's made an impact.

19:24.520 --> 19:30.120
It's a big project that gave control to the community.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.680
It's also a bit if you want to work on blockchain,

19:32.680 --> 19:34.760
but you don't want to get into all the protocols.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.360
And you're not interested in money.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.720
Name system is something which is a bit easier to understand

19:39.720 --> 19:40.280
and clearer.

19:43.640 --> 19:48.040
ENS DAO is very active nowadays.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.120
So I was a member of ENS DAO for the first year.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.720
I was managing a subgroup of decentralized peer-to-peer

19:53.720 --> 19:55.920
websites, which is what I did at the time.

19:55.920 --> 19:57.600
I don't do it anymore.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.960
But I still follow it a bit.

19:58.960 --> 20:00.520
I know lots of people there.

20:00.520 --> 20:01.800
It's super active.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.880
The forum is active.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.040
There are calls every day.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.720
There are votings.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.320
I mean, for the good or for the bad,

20:09.320 --> 20:12.160
very really an active community.

20:12.160 --> 20:16.200
And at some point, I don't remember right now exactly when

20:16.200 --> 20:19.720
they actually transferred the root key ownership to the ENS

20:19.720 --> 20:23.280
DAO, which means now it's owned by ENS.

20:23.280 --> 20:26.720
There is one problem, or maybe two.

20:26.720 --> 20:31.840
And the first one is that ENS voting goes with ENS token.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.360
You can buy the token, which basically

20:34.360 --> 20:37.240
means that someone who is rich enough or motivated enough

20:37.240 --> 20:39.960
can kind of take over the organization.

20:39.960 --> 20:43.320
And if you want it to be critical infrastructure

20:43.320 --> 20:46.080
of the internet, it's very risky.

20:46.080 --> 20:49.480
If at some point it will be, then someone will take over.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.360
I mean, if someone can, then they will.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.520
I mean, the DAO can at some point decide that you get voting

20:56.520 --> 20:57.120
by reputation.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.000
But at the moment, this is the situation.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.440
And the other thing, while handshake have short proofs,

21:02.440 --> 21:05.000
ENS does not have such thing to verify anything

21:05.000 --> 21:06.440
on the Ethereum blockchain.

21:06.440 --> 21:07.640
You need quite a long proof.

21:07.640 --> 21:09.600
It's not very practical for anyone

21:09.600 --> 21:11.960
to do unless it's really your passion, like me.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.680
But even then, it's super difficult.

21:15.680 --> 21:19.280
I don't know what's the technical way to solve it.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.840
If any, right now, everyone compromise on that,

21:21.840 --> 21:24.440
and they actually verify things with other services.

21:25.440 --> 21:29.160
2023, which for me is today, because we

21:29.160 --> 21:31.600
are beginning of 2024.

21:31.600 --> 21:37.240
So the state is at the moment that once ENS DAO went on,

21:37.240 --> 21:39.240
they have a huge market cap.

21:39.240 --> 21:43.400
They were very, even during the crypto winter of blockchain,

21:43.400 --> 21:45.160
they had quite a buzz.

21:45.160 --> 21:48.920
People started to make clubs like the 10K Club of People

21:48.920 --> 21:53.320
owned the name 1.ETH till 9,999.ETH.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.960
There was a website for clubs and stuff like that.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.080
It made an impact, and as a result,

21:58.080 --> 22:01.080
any blockchain now has their own name system,

22:01.080 --> 22:03.480
because it's just easy to make.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.440
And they see that there is people who will pay for it.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.400
I know people that in each of those block systems

22:08.400 --> 22:10.520
buy a few names, because normally they are quite cheap,

22:10.520 --> 22:12.280
and they are like, well, we don't know

22:12.280 --> 22:13.680
which is a good investment.

22:13.680 --> 22:17.080
But articles like the top 10, blockchain domain name systems,

22:17.080 --> 22:19.720
I admit that for a while I was trying to follow that,

22:19.720 --> 22:25.360
but I didn't find any that has technical innovation, which

22:25.360 --> 22:27.760
is what I care about.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.040
And I reached the point of saying,

22:29.040 --> 22:31.160
well, if something will happen, which is technically

22:31.160 --> 22:32.560
innovative, someone will tell me.

22:36.120 --> 22:39.720
ENS itself at the moment is focusing on a few things.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.000
One of them is subdomains.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.400
They want the subdomains to be kind of like domain,

22:43.400 --> 22:47.840
so you make someone a subdomain, and then they own it.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.640
Like it's not dependent on who owns the name.

22:50.640 --> 22:51.760
It's completely independent.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.680
If they had something which is called name wrapper,

22:53.680 --> 22:56.880
it was developed for many years and launched last year.

22:56.880 --> 23:01.640
CCIP is basically cross-chain interoperability,

23:01.640 --> 23:04.720
which means how to communicate with,

23:04.720 --> 23:07.600
from ENS can communicate with other blockchain.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.880
I am not a huge fan of that.

23:08.880 --> 23:11.120
I think it's centralized, a decentralized technology,

23:11.120 --> 23:15.960
but they seem to, lots of people, they like it.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.320
And they really want to join ICANN.

23:18.320 --> 23:21.760
Like they really want to get control of the .eth subdomain,

23:21.760 --> 23:25.040
a TLD, sorry, but the problem is the .eth is there

23:25.040 --> 23:27.440
for Ethiopia.

23:27.440 --> 23:31.000
Nick Johnson, the owner of eth, had a long thread about it

23:31.000 --> 23:32.680
recently, like a month or two ago.

23:32.680 --> 23:35.560
So if you want to read the details and where they held up

23:35.560 --> 23:38.680
to this discussion with ICANN of getting it or not,

23:38.680 --> 23:40.840
you can see it there.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.680
For the other projects, Handshake,

23:43.680 --> 23:45.680
I went and checked just before the lecture what's

23:45.680 --> 23:49.040
going on there, and I got the feeling that's not much change

23:49.040 --> 23:52.880
from the lunch, only that it's less enthusiasm now.

23:52.880 --> 23:57.200
Like people still participate in auctions with less money.

23:57.200 --> 24:01.200
I didn't find any real use case besides that.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.600
If anyone knows and I missed it, let me know.

24:06.240 --> 24:09.000
Another story that happened, and I'm going to wrap it up,

24:09.000 --> 24:09.960
is a stop-all domain.

24:09.960 --> 24:13.480
It's another ENS, another a few blocks name system.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.120
They try to patent some names, and now

24:15.160 --> 24:17.280
they're a legal battle with ENS.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.480
And I thought of maybe speaking of what I think happens

24:19.480 --> 24:22.200
in the future, but time is up, so I will not.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.600
Thank you, everyone.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.600
Thank you.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.600
Thank you.
