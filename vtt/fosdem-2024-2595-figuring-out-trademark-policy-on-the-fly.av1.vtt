WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
All right.

00:05.000 --> 00:13.000
I would like to welcome our next speaker, Peter Eisenthal.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
Please go ahead.

00:30.000 --> 00:43.000
Better now? Yeah, that sounds good. Okay.

00:43.000 --> 00:48.000
This did not come out right. Those were fun flags up there.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
We'll fix that later. It's open source.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.000
So I'm Peter Eisenthal. I'm affiliated with the PostgreSQL project.

00:56.000 --> 01:03.000
I've been coming to FOSDEM since, well, 2003. So, wow.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm in the PostgreSQL project. I'm part of the core team.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
That's the steering committee, you could say.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.000
And I'm also a member of, I think, PGCA, which we'll explain in a minute.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
I've also been involved in the Devian project.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm probably fair to say I'm retired now. This does not sound well,

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
but I'll trust your figure. Yeah. Maybe you can mute that one.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Okay. All right. I'll just keep going.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm retired from Devian, but, you know, if you're in the Devian project,

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
you do learn a lot about the open source policy.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
So that was good training there as well.

01:35.000 --> 01:40.000
I'm involved with SPI a little bit, because that's obviously affiliated with Devian.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
And I've also been involved in, because of these connections,

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
to make PostgreSQL an affiliated project of SPI.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.000
And I'm not a lawyer. That's a cliche, but maybe in this room it should be said.

01:52.000 --> 01:57.000
I have no legal training, but, you know, if you do this for two decades,

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
you absorb a lot of stuff.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
And in effect, the point of this talk is to explain the issues we work through.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
This is not a guide on how to do it, but this is just what we figured out.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Maybe it helps.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.000
So by Postgres, I know like half the room here are Postgres friends.

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
Hopefully most of everybody else kind of knows about Postgres,

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
but just so we're on the same level as database systems, right?

02:25.000 --> 02:31.000
There's a stand across the campus here, and there's a Devroom tomorrow.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
But I like coming to FOSDEM, because, you know, the Devroom, Postgres,

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Devroom is nice, but, you know, I know a lot about Postgres,

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
so that's not too interesting, to be honest.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
But I always go to these other Devrooms,

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
and then sometimes give presentations there, you know,

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
to sort of talk about intersecting and crosscutting issues like this.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
So that's why I'm here.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Postgres has... Postgres came out of the University of California, Berkeley,

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
you know, like BSD and others, and so we always used to say it has a BSD license,

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
and then somebody actually read the license as,

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
this doesn't look like a BSD license, this is actually the...

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
We just talked about this, right? You actually have to read it, right?

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
This looks more like an MIT license, and then we read it again and again,

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
and we realized it's neither, so there's actually...

03:17.000 --> 03:23.000
PostgresGal license is actually a separate license registered with the open source initiative.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.000
So, but the point here is basically we're not too concerned in the Postgres project

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
about copyright enforcement, right?

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
Because there's no obligations, really, other than attribution,

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
so that's not really a thing we're worried about.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
And then there's a fine print down here.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
Postgres, PostgresGal, and this Lonnie logo are trademarks,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
or registered trademarks of the PostgresGal Community Association of Canada

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
and used by their permission.

03:50.000 --> 03:55.000
I didn't actually ask for their permission, maybe that's wrong, but...

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
That's what that is.

03:56.000 --> 04:01.000
And then finally, I want to introduce those of you who don't know, to Slonic, this is Slonic,

04:01.000 --> 04:10.000
this is the logo, and as you just learned, it's a trademark, or a registered trademark, I don't know.

04:10.000 --> 04:21.000
So, the three pillars of intellectual property are copyright patents and trademarks.

04:21.000 --> 04:32.000
And the whole reason why we're here every year is because some of those who came before us

04:32.000 --> 04:36.000
essentially wanted a different arrangement for copyright around software.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
So you can share it and do all these things.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
And this has been very successful, obviously, there's issues that we just talked about,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
but the reason why we've been doing this for, you know,

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
it fosters them for 20 plus years, and the whole thing, 40 plus years and so on,

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
is because this worked out pretty well.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.000
And then some time ago, we had issues with patents,

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
and we've had, you know, in this very event, you know, we just kept getting talked about.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I don't really know what happened to that.

05:05.000 --> 05:11.000
It sort of fizzled out a little bit, but I don't really want to talk about patents here today,

05:11.000 --> 05:16.000
but this was sort of an issue that, you know, patents do exist.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
The question of whether software patents should apply was sort of the question being debated,

05:20.000 --> 05:30.000
and this was partially used to impose additional restrictions on free software use, right?

05:31.000 --> 05:40.000
And in some sense, this was sort of hacked around by putting patent clauses into software license,

05:40.000 --> 05:46.000
like Apache license is a good example of that, so I guess this kind of quieted that down a little bit.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
And then there's trademarks, and that's what I want to talk about.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.000
So why do trademarks even exist in general?

05:56.000 --> 06:03.000
And it's basically to prevent consumer confusion or have a functioning marketplace at all, right?

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
Because otherwise, if everybody could just fill in some brown stuff in a bottle and label it Coca-Cola and sell it,

06:08.000 --> 06:14.000
then nobody could ever go shopping again and just rely on that anything is anything, right?

06:14.000 --> 06:20.000
So that you have to have some protection of names so there's any sanity in the marketplace at all.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So that makes sense.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And then the companies who have these built these names, these brands,

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
they want to protect their reputation or their brand, right, or they could will.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
So that's sort of the general idea, right?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
So that's existed for a long time.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
I think that's pretty well understood.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
Why do we care about trademarks?

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
We specifically in the Postgre's project that I've worked on,

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
but also potentially other, you know, software projects, open-source software projects.

06:48.000 --> 07:00.000
So the thing that one reason why we looked into this is because the domain registrations are in some weird way tied to trademarks.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
So if you have a trademark, you have sort of priority to domain registrations.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
The details of that are very complicated, but this is kind of how some of this got started

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
because anybody can just register a domain that matches your project's name

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
and now there's so many top-level domains you can't really, like, prevent that.

07:18.000 --> 07:23.000
And then they put something up that looks like your website and potentially offers downloads or do whatever

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
and then you have no control over what they were doing.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.000
So by registering a trademark, you have some kind of way to prevent that

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
or have a sort of priority for these domains.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
But also, you know, you want to protect the reputation of your brand, of your project, right?

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
If you have a certain size, then you get imposters and people want to take advantage of that.

07:47.000 --> 07:55.000
And then finally, in a weird way, what we learned is you have to protect your trademark just so you have it

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
because unlike copyright, and we'll get to that in a moment,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
once you lose your trademark, you can't really get it back

08:01.000 --> 08:07.000
and so you might want to just have it for later, in a way, in case, you know, something bad happens.

08:07.000 --> 08:14.000
And so it's a bit of a self-preserving system in some way, but that's what we figured out.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
So here's a way to, again, I'm not going to talk about the patent stuff,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
there could be a third column but that's not what we want to do.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
This is sort of a chart here, what makes dealing with trademarks

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
arguably much more complicated than with copyrights.

08:28.000 --> 08:34.000
Because, you know, I'm sure there's people writing software here in their laptops,

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
like right now in the halls here, right, and they're not thinking about copyright

08:37.000 --> 08:45.000
because the copyright happens automatically, more or less in most commercially relevant jurisdictions, let's say.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
So as soon as you create something that applies to software and anything you create,

08:50.000 --> 08:53.000
you're the copyright owner and if you don't want to share it, that's fine.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
If you want to give it to someone under certain conditions, that's you, or that's up to you.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
But you don't have to do anything about it, you don't have to register it.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
There is copyright registration, that's not really relevant.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
Also the copyright applies internationally more or less automatically.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
Also in the context of software projects, everybody who contributes is sort of a joint owner in some way, right,

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
this kind of protects, there's copyright assignments and some people do,

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
but in general, like at least in our project, everybody sort of owns it together,

09:25.000 --> 09:29.000
that means nobody can just take it away.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
In trademark, this doesn't work that way because you have to register the trademark,

09:33.000 --> 09:38.000
otherwise it doesn't exist. Well, there's unregistered trademarks, but that is very weak,

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
so you do want to register it.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
And so as paperwork is complicated, potentially you have to get legal help,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
or at least it's hard, you know, or somebody has to sit down, you have to pay fees,

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
and you have to renew it, and somebody has to be the owner of that, it can't just be,

09:52.000 --> 10:02.000
oh, you know, us 250, who half of those we don't even know, really in person, right,

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
you can't do that, you have to have someone who actually has it.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
And then, well, to share it, you have licenses, so that's sort of similar,

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
but with copyright we have these public licenses that are just sort of there to take in a way, right,

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
maybe that could exist for trademarks, but at the moment it's not really clear how that would work,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
or at least we haven't figured it out.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
And that's the final point I've already mentioned, right, you have to enforce trademarks,

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
otherwise you lose them.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
Copyright, you don't really have to do it, I don't know, but mostly we don't do that, right,

10:34.000 --> 10:42.000
I mean, of course people do GPL enforcements, but certainly you don't have to literally enforce

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
every single violation, you can sort of go against the big fish and things like that, right.

10:48.000 --> 10:54.000
And so the copyright stuff basically happens by itself, if there's no problems,

10:54.000 --> 11:02.000
you don't have to do anything, you put a license on your project, and if nothing weird happens,

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
that's it, that's new, right, but the trademark, you have to be on the ball all the time, right,

11:06.000 --> 11:14.000
you have to file paperwork, make sure you do it right, and whoever does it actually has to make sure to keep it updated,

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
you have to license it, and you have to go after everyone who violates it.

11:18.000 --> 11:26.000
And that's hard to do for just small-time projects, I guess, right.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.000
So what have we done?

11:29.000 --> 11:38.000
And we came, the title was sort of, we figured this out on the fly, because we, when the project was founded,

11:38.000 --> 11:45.000
we took the, we, I wasn't there, the University of California basically abandoned the software,

11:45.000 --> 11:51.000
and somebody said, like, hey, we'll put it on the server, we'll keep working on it, we'll figure it out, right.

11:51.000 --> 11:58.000
And this was actually, this was in 1996, and I figured this was actually before the term open source even existed.

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
So I went back to the original email messages, and there was no terminology for that, they said,

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
like, hey, let's do a project like free, as free BSD does.

12:09.000 --> 12:16.000
So that was sort of like, there was no term open source, it was just like, let's do it like these guys do, kind of.

12:16.000 --> 12:23.000
Well, that individual, you know, happened to live in Canada, and they had the domain registration in their name,

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
because, you know, somebody has to do it, and then later on also registered trademark,

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
it wasn't, we haven't really quite figured out why that was done initially, but they figured they should do it, so it existed.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.000
And when that individual then sort of wanted to step back and retire from the project,

12:38.000 --> 12:45.000
you know, we wanted to put this under some proper footing, and we were initially thinking just about the domain registration,

12:45.000 --> 12:53.000
and, you know, the trademark kind of came along with it, and so we founded this little tiny nonprofit association in Canada

12:53.000 --> 12:58.000
just to hold those domains and those trademark registrations, and it wasn't really supposed to do anything else,

12:58.000 --> 13:06.000
it was really just like, do a meeting once a year, rubbish them to budgets, and keep these things rolling, and do little else.

13:06.000 --> 13:13.000
You know, we're not running any events or anything like that, it was just a really tiny operation.

13:13.000 --> 13:19.000
The name of Canada has confused people over time, so we kind of dropped this last year from our title.

13:19.000 --> 13:26.000
It kind of worked out because the domain we used for that association, not for the software project,

13:26.000 --> 13:31.000
but for that association is Postgres.ca, so the CA can now stand for Community Association,

13:31.000 --> 13:35.000
which is sort of was a kind of pun we used.

13:35.000 --> 13:40.000
Because people kept coming to us and thought, we're like the Canadian, we, I'm from Germany, right,

13:40.000 --> 13:45.000
so it's just where that organization runs, we're like the Canadian user group or something like that,

13:45.000 --> 13:53.000
and can we run like a Postgres evening in Toronto, but that's not what we were about.

13:53.000 --> 13:59.000
So here's a little bit of a timeline.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
So in about 2018, we started registering trademarks in various jurisdictions, so we had the Canadian one already,

14:04.000 --> 14:11.000
we did the EU one, the funny thing is also once you register trademarks, you start getting spam.

14:11.000 --> 14:16.000
People like monitor these registries and then just want to sell you stuff, like hey, domain registration,

14:16.000 --> 14:22.000
hey, do you want to, hey, we have, we saw somebody registered something similar to you,

14:22.000 --> 14:29.000
do you want to help us figure this out for you, and you know, always kind of weird stuff, so it's kind of fun and annoying.

14:29.000 --> 14:34.000
We have the US registration, but currently on the secondary register, which if anybody knows what that means,

14:34.000 --> 14:39.000
so it's a little bit tricky to, if the name is already out there, then to register a trademark afterwards,

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
so we're kind of backfilling that a little bit.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
And so we, and this is maybe some of you who are not close to the Postgres project might have even seen that

14:48.000 --> 15:00.000
and like the general hacker media in between about 2020 and 23, we had actually various disputes around the trademarks.

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
In a way, a lucky coincidence perhaps that we just got those trademark registrations done shortly before that,

15:07.000 --> 15:14.000
and, but as you, as I just mentioned, it was really supposed to be just a small organization with really no operating budget,

15:14.000 --> 15:21.000
and then all of a sudden we had people go register domains that looked similar to the project,

15:21.000 --> 15:28.000
actually people going out registering trademarks, like Postgres as a trademark in some jurisdictions,

15:28.000 --> 15:36.000
just in their own name without asking anybody, and then putting that on their website and creating sort of a shadow ecosystem,

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
that looks like sort of an official Postgres thing, and then we asked them nicely,

15:41.000 --> 15:45.000
you know, can you please stop doing that, and then they didn't want, and it goes on and on,

15:45.000 --> 15:52.000
and this is sort of, you know, legal cases were filed, and it went to courts and things like that,

15:52.000 --> 16:00.000
so that was extremely expensive, and we had no income stream right, this little organization,

16:00.000 --> 16:05.000
so we were figuring this out, but it's, you know, it's, this is a problem,

16:05.000 --> 16:13.000
if you do want to get into the trademark game, you have to be prepared for this to happen, and it's become very expensive.

16:13.000 --> 16:25.000
How harmful would it be for your trademark, not to pursue all of your legal cases?

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
The question I heard was how harmful would it be if we just didn't pursue those cases?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Yes.

16:32.000 --> 16:40.000
Well, to some degree we don't know that, because we, you know, there's no,

16:40.000 --> 16:45.000
there's no room for trial and error really, because if we say, well, let's not do it,

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
then the next person that we really do want to pursue this dispute with,

16:49.000 --> 16:53.000
can then say in court like, well, you didn't pursue those guys, so your trademark is invalid,

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
can get invalidated, and then it's gone, and then this whole thing is over, right?

16:56.000 --> 17:01.000
So the legal advice that we have been given, the actual legal advice that we have been given,

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
that we should do it that way.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.000
So we have sort of a two-tier, so if you do want to use the trademark,

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
because obviously, you know, people, you go over to the other building,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
you can get hoodies with Postgres on it, right?

17:15.000 --> 17:21.000
So obviously we do want people to talk about Postgres somehow.

17:21.000 --> 17:28.000
So we have a two-tier structure in a way that there's a policy on the website that says what you can do with it.

17:29.000 --> 17:35.000
This has been reviewed by legal aides, lawyers, right?

17:35.000 --> 17:41.000
So what you can do is, what are we already in the law about fair use you can do?

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
So if you just factually talk about Postgres, of course that's allowed.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.000
Any kind of what's in the law about fair use you can do, of course.

17:48.000 --> 17:53.000
You can write logs and books about Postgres and stuff like that.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
People do, right? That seems fair.

17:56.000 --> 18:01.000
People want to make YouTube videos about Postgres short, that's fine too, right?

18:01.000 --> 18:07.000
And then we have, which maybe not obvious, we have a thing also in the Postgres community

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
that we can in a way certify conferences, right?

18:11.000 --> 18:17.000
Because we don't have a central association that controls the whole project.

18:17.000 --> 18:23.000
And so a lot of independent people around the world run like a Postgres conference, for example.

18:23.000 --> 18:33.000
And there is a system that you can self-certify that your Postgres is what we call a community conference.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
It sort of follows certain guidelines.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.000
So it's not just sort of a sham corporate event basically, right?

18:39.000 --> 18:45.000
And so if you self-certify your conference as a community conference, then you can use the trademark.

18:45.000 --> 18:51.000
If you self-certify your user group evening as following these certain guidelines, then you can also use the trademark.

18:51.000 --> 19:02.000
Or if you have a regional NPO, for example, the thing that's happening over there in the other room, the Dev Room,

19:02.000 --> 19:10.000
the Postgres stand over there and the Dev Room is organized by an association called Postgres School Europe,

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
which does these things in Europe.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.000
And there's others like Postgres School US, for example.

19:16.000 --> 19:21.000
So they are recognized NPO's and they can use the trademark.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
Yes, all the way in the back, yes.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
You say no company names on the phone?

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
Yeah, so...

19:26.000 --> 19:32.000
How many... that actually brings in a number of products that are specifically key to Postgres?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Yeah, yeah, we'll get to that, exactly.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
Yeah, yeah, so...

19:35.000 --> 19:39.000
By company names, I should have solved the company once in a focus.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Yeah, yeah.

19:40.000 --> 19:44.000
So the question there, and we'll get to that for the microphone again, like what about company names and stuff.

19:44.000 --> 19:54.000
So what is not allowed by the trademark policy on the website is that you name your company or product as Postgres in the name,

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
or register Postgres.something domain.

20:01.000 --> 20:06.000
Now you can try, but then you get into trouble with this.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.000
If we can be bothered, as previously explained.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.000
But no, if you don't... this is the policy on the website, you can read that, right?

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
So if you fall into any of this, if you want to write a book about Postgres, just go ahead.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
You don't have to do anything.

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
For some additional uses, you can get a license, right?

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
This is something that's still kind of in progress, right?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
So this is... we've only been doing this for a couple years.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.000
Five minutes.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.000
Yeah.

20:30.000 --> 20:39.000
So the first thing we did is to respond to the question, we grandfathered, tried to grandfather everything, and that was already out there.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
So a lot of these, and we tried to track them down.

20:42.000 --> 20:51.000
You know, if you have a company that's well recognized in the Postgres ecosystem, and they somehow have a product or the company name itself that has Postgres in the name,

20:51.000 --> 21:03.000
then we got in touch with them and tried to work out, like, a license that explicitly allows that, but also contains, like, let's not do that again kind of thing, maybe, right?

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
But to some degree, we also provide additional licenses.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.000
For example, and this is kind of the... it leads into some questions I will have at the end.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.000
So this is kind of what we're working toward or what's effectively happening,

21:18.000 --> 21:25.000
but it's, you know, it would be kind of nice to actually have some guidelines and we're not just making that up.

21:25.000 --> 21:32.000
So if you have a Postgres conference that is not self-certified as a community conference, you can still get a license for it.

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
You know, we'll look at what you're doing. If you're not doing a total sham job, then that's probably okay. We'll get a license.

21:38.000 --> 21:45.000
Or if you want to use the logo for a product, you can use this Postgres, you can get a license for that logo.

21:45.000 --> 21:49.000
But that's all manual work at the moment.

21:49.000 --> 21:59.000
So what we generally allow is merchandise sales, except the kind of stuff that's happening there by recognized NPOs,

21:59.000 --> 22:04.000
or any new, ideally any new business names.

22:04.000 --> 22:14.000
And also weirdly, what we generally don't want to license is anything that's not even related to software that wants to use the logo for some reason.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
There's people who want to write like novels about Postgres or use the logo in board games and things like that, which is all interesting,

22:20.000 --> 22:26.000
but we have so far not really wanted to go into that.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
So this is kind of the question I'm asking myself, and this is sort of bothering me, right?

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
We've had just these discussions of overlaying additional restrictions on top of software licenses,

22:37.000 --> 22:42.000
and this has been done with patents extensively, or tried at least.

22:42.000 --> 22:49.000
Just what we talked about a moment ago, what do they call it? Customer agreements that interfere with that.

22:49.000 --> 23:01.000
And remember maybe some of you remember the Ice Weasel fiasco, where Debian had to rename Firefox because of trademark issues, uncertainties with Mozilla.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
And I don't really know.

23:06.000 --> 23:12.000
We're not trying to trick anyone, right?

23:12.000 --> 23:17.000
This is not what we're trying to do. Others could do it maybe, but we're just trying to do the right thing.

23:17.000 --> 23:20.000
But what is the level of things that we shouldn't allow?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
I don't know. This is really hard to find examples about.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
We've looked at some examples. Debian, for example, has a trademark policy.

23:29.000 --> 23:37.000
Linux has this sort of trademarking system, and KDE has something, but there's really nothing sort of consistent that you just copy as a template.

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
It's really, really difficult. So this kind of gets to my asks here to conclude.

23:43.000 --> 23:47.000
It would have been nice to have some any kind of organized information about this.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.000
It doesn't seem to exist.

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
Now you can go to these organizations and there's others.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Sorry if I offend anyone. I know there's some rivalries between some of these.

23:59.000 --> 24:07.000
I don't know. But if you create something, if it's software and say, yeah, I would like to share this somehow, how do I do that?

24:07.000 --> 24:12.000
You can go to OSI and learn everything about open source copyright issues.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.000
Or if you just create or something else, you want to share it somehow.

24:16.000 --> 24:23.000
Creative comments, they have all this information about this is how you can share and this is the kind of public copyright license you can create and so on and so on.

24:23.000 --> 24:30.000
So there's this whole thing out there that you can rely on and it works really well.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
But I've went through all of these things and searched the website.

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
It's like, is there anything here about trademarks? Is there any guidance at all?

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
It's like, no. I don't know.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
I know that they know that this exists because creative comments itself is a trademark and open source itself is a trademark.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
So this obviously exists, but there's nothing to find.

24:49.000 --> 24:53.000
So in some sense, this is sort of my call here.

24:53.000 --> 25:08.000
If anybody has any interest in this at all, it would be nice to share information somehow and build at least some kind of baseline expectations about like how do we create trademark licenses that are compatible with the software freedoms

25:08.000 --> 25:13.000
or the open source definitions or anything like that.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
That's what I would be interested in.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
And of course, if you're out there as a project struggling to work this out, maybe you want to get in touch with the postcards people.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
That's also fine.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
So great to conclude.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.000
So dealing with trademarks is much more complicated than copyright.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
It's not really clear where it's useful.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
So that was the question.

25:34.000 --> 25:42.000
It has in effect been useful for us because we had some bad actors who were trying to do the wrong things.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
This gave us a tool to prevent that.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
So it is in effect useful.

25:47.000 --> 25:53.000
But the way this interacts with software freedoms is unclear and I would like to learn more about that.

25:53.000 --> 26:00.000
I would like to learn more about how others do it or if others want to learn from us, that's also great.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
That's all for me.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
We have time for one question if someone has.

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
I'm sorry, we run out of time for questions.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
No questions.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
That's also fine, but I'll stick around here and if somebody wants to ask, that's fine.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
Thank you.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Thank you, Peter.
