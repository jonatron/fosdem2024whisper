WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.560
All right. So first of all thanks to the organizers for having us here. And I got to say I'm not

00:15.560 --> 00:21.520
Louis Fai-Khann but I'm spontaneously replacing him today. So nevertheless I will introduce

00:21.520 --> 00:28.960
both him and myself. Louis is both a computer scientist and a physician and he founded New

00:28.960 --> 00:37.240
Health a bit more than 15 years ago. And he's specialized in genomics and medical genetics.

00:37.240 --> 00:45.960
And apart from being active in social medicine he's also involved in animal rights. Then

00:45.960 --> 00:52.680
shortly about me I studied computer science in Hanover and there I'm employed since a

00:52.680 --> 00:58.480
bit more than two years. And mainly I'm working on an Ansible deployment of New Health to

00:58.480 --> 01:04.680
ease and improve the installation process but I'm also reporting and fixing bugs or

01:04.680 --> 01:09.520
rewriting the documentation. And last year we also hosted the annual conference of New

01:09.520 --> 01:16.040
Health in Hanover. And it was also together with the Orson conference. Sebastian will

01:16.040 --> 01:23.360
do the following talk about Orson. And the institute I'm working at is called Computational

01:23.360 --> 01:30.120
Health Informatics and even though we are only working inside computer science it's

01:30.120 --> 01:38.800
always related to medicine. So behind New Health there's a non-profit, non-governmental

01:38.800 --> 01:44.740
organization called Ngu Solitario which is working globally and it's focused on social

01:44.740 --> 01:53.040
medicine and New Health. But there's also the Global Exposome Project that aims to investigate

01:53.040 --> 01:58.640
how the environment has an impact on our health and how social problems like pollution

01:58.640 --> 02:05.640
of water or factory farming or wars also impact this environment and consequently our health.

02:05.640 --> 02:14.680
And then again there are also projects about animal rights where it is involved. Ngu Solitario

02:14.680 --> 02:23.480
is spread quite around the globe but when it comes to productive use in hospitals then

02:23.480 --> 02:33.320
we hear the most of projects in Latin America or Africa for example in Argentina or Cameroon.

02:33.320 --> 02:38.840
And then there are many research institutions, hospitals and so on for example in the top

02:38.840 --> 02:44.120
in the middle there's a university in Argentina that is cooperating quite much with New Health.

02:44.120 --> 02:54.600
Okay, so what is New Health actually? In general it is a hospital information system but the

02:54.600 --> 03:01.400
core is a hospital management information system that is often called HMIS node. And

03:01.400 --> 03:08.120
there you have one client-server architecture and it takes the quite realistic approach

03:08.120 --> 03:17.800
compared to other ways of organizing the infrastructure of hospitals. And it is first of all based

03:17.800 --> 03:24.200
on Frighton which is an enterprise resource planning tool so you can overtake the user

03:24.200 --> 03:30.520
management and inventory stock and finances functionality from this. But then we are adding

03:30.520 --> 03:37.720
modules for hospital functionality and putting this on top. And like Frighton it is written

03:37.720 --> 03:43.960
in Python and using the PostgreSQL database back end. Even though Frighton could theoretically

03:43.960 --> 03:50.200
use others we are always taking this to first have a uniform way and then also because there

03:50.840 --> 03:57.640
are many good functionalities for productive use. And then for example you have really many

03:57.640 --> 04:04.120
modules that are part of New Health for example about surgery or the laboratory or genetics and

04:04.120 --> 04:11.000
bioinformatics and as it's used in many precarious reasons, New Health is embedded as also one

04:11.000 --> 04:15.800
subproject which basically means that there are for example images for respiratory pys because

04:15.800 --> 04:24.200
sometimes yeah it's really a matter of resources what to use. And as the name says, New Health is a

04:24.200 --> 04:35.480
GNU package. So the HMIS component as I said is a client server architecture and on the upper

04:35.480 --> 04:43.480
left you can see a screenshot of the client and with this you can generate graphs, you can display

04:43.480 --> 04:49.560
images, there's a calendar you can use yeah and also the electronic health record is part of this.

04:50.040 --> 05:01.640
Then there's a reporting engine coming with Frighton and so all the information you feel

05:01.640 --> 05:08.840
in the database fields can be exported as an ODT. So there's a LibreOffice in the background

05:08.840 --> 05:15.560
and you can yeah generate this and print it or start outside the program.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.800
Yeah.

05:19.320 --> 05:26.200
Besides there's an integration with Orsan which is a DICOM server to support medical imaging

05:27.560 --> 05:36.520
and actually there's no DICOM viewer integrated in New Health and as usually there is the DICOM

05:36.600 --> 05:46.440
format used. It was chosen not to reimplement any DICOM viewer or do all the work Orsan has already

05:46.440 --> 05:53.560
done but to integrate Orsan and so to synchronize patients and studies between the two of them

05:54.200 --> 05:59.880
and to just use Orsan's DICOM viewers that are integrated there already.

06:00.280 --> 06:09.480
Apart from this there are also other components of the New Health ecosystem

06:11.160 --> 06:13.480
for example the Federation and my new health.

06:15.720 --> 06:24.040
So my new health is an app that is that can be used to enter vital data and in the end also

06:24.760 --> 06:34.520
to share that vital data. And last year at the 40th birthday of GNU the second version was released

06:34.520 --> 06:39.480
where all the dependencies outside Python were eliminated because many people don't have

06:40.760 --> 06:47.240
Linux on their phones and we had requirements before they were now eliminated and it was

06:47.240 --> 06:51.640
migrated to Kivi so now the idea is to have something cross-platform.

06:54.520 --> 07:01.160
And then the GNU Health Federation aims to connect multiple of those HMIS nodes

07:02.280 --> 07:10.120
and ideally also make the people, give the people the opportunity to share the vital data they

07:10.120 --> 07:20.440
recorded with the hospitals. And so to give one example the colleagues in Argentina also used

07:20.440 --> 07:29.640
this already in the beginning of the COVID pandemic to trace how much, yeah, just to trace the

07:29.640 --> 07:41.480
situation of COVID. And now, yeah, to come to the topic of the room also,

07:42.280 --> 07:49.880
GNU Health was declared a digital public good which is in the context of the sustainable

07:49.880 --> 07:58.360
development goals of the UN where many goals should be achieved until 2030 and one of them is healthcare

07:59.000 --> 08:09.160
and so, yeah, GNU Health is part of this and also just advertised at the European Commission join up

08:09.160 --> 08:17.000
where, yeah, free software or open source software is, yeah, advertised inside the European Union

08:19.720 --> 08:26.360
and then compared to other software projects, of course there are always bureaucratic barriers

08:26.440 --> 08:37.160
and also certification processes but there are many steps to check if your project is a medical

08:37.160 --> 08:43.800
device software but actually at least the hospital information system itself and the

08:43.800 --> 08:50.440
electronic medical records are not a software or a medical device. Of course then there's

08:50.520 --> 08:55.560
the other stuff for example in Germany would for sure need to have an interface with the

08:55.560 --> 08:59.960
insurances and most of the productive use is somewhere else.

09:05.160 --> 09:11.320
Then, yeah, from our point of view, proprietary software and public healthcare is a contradiction,

09:12.200 --> 09:19.720
yeah, and we think that there should be, yeah, a move to free software and

09:20.920 --> 09:25.480
there's really many barriers and a lack of funding especially for free software projects and,

09:26.520 --> 09:32.440
yeah, there could be really many benefits of putting more resources in communities like this

09:32.440 --> 09:36.280
so that everybody can profit from what people are working on.

09:36.360 --> 09:46.200
This is why we also signed the campaign public money public code. I already saw it in the slides of

09:46.200 --> 09:52.760
the talk before. I guess the most people know it but basically the name already says if there's

09:52.760 --> 09:57.800
public money spent for a project then the code should also be available to the public.

09:57.800 --> 10:02.200
Said quite easy but also not the reality.

10:02.760 --> 10:10.040
Yeah, I'm finishing with a side of that Luis often says which is who has this

10:10.040 --> 10:15.240
a social project with a bit of technology behind, yeah, to highlight that it's not

10:15.240 --> 10:22.760
only about the software but also about the philosophy behind. Yeah, that's it. Thanks for your attention.
