Hello everyone, so my name is Noel and I'm here to talk about Moodle.

00:08.960 --> 00:13.040
Moodle is a learning management system that you can use for your online

00:13.040 --> 00:17.960
learning and teaching and our mission is to empower educators to improve the

00:17.960 --> 00:21.480
world. We want to do this in an accessible way that can be used for

00:21.480 --> 00:27.720
everyone and that can be customized for every use case. We do this through

00:27.720 --> 00:32.800
open source and actually Moodle started more than 20 years ago and the first

00:32.800 --> 00:37.080
commit was actually the same year as the first edition of Forstdom and

00:37.080 --> 00:41.600
preparing this talk I have been looking at the archives and this is actually the

00:41.600 --> 00:46.080
first talk about Moodle. It had been mentioned here and there but this is the

00:46.080 --> 00:50.360
the first talk specific about Moodle so it may be the first time some of you

00:50.360 --> 00:52.280
okay

00:52.840 --> 00:57.400
it may be the first time some of you hear about it so I hope you find it useful

00:58.360 --> 01:03.560
we are a certified B corporation and Moodle is a registered digital public

01:03.560 --> 01:09.240
good and in case you don't know who is using Moodle at the moment more than

01:09.240 --> 01:15.680
400 million users translated to more than 160 languages mostly contributed by

01:15.680 --> 01:20.440
the community the translations and you can find these stats in stats.moodle.org

01:20.440 --> 01:25.360
but I have to mention that since Moodle is open source and can be self-hosted all

01:25.400 --> 01:29.560
this information is only obtained so in reality there's probably more people

01:29.560 --> 01:35.080
using Moodle than this. In this slide maybe there are some logos you

01:35.080 --> 01:39.640
recognize we know that Moodle is used by more than 60% of higher education

01:39.640 --> 01:45.280
institutions it's also used by many education ministries and it's also used

01:45.280 --> 01:51.000
by many governments and NGOs so Moodle is used all around and who is making

01:51.040 --> 01:55.960
Moodle. Well there are some important part of the contribution from the open

01:55.960 --> 02:00.520
source community and other companies but mostly it is done by Moodle HQ which is

02:00.520 --> 02:04.720
the company I work for. We are currently more than 200 team members

02:04.720 --> 02:11.800
distributed in more than 20 countries and we speak more than 26 languages and I

02:11.800 --> 02:15.760
didn't want to leave them without mentioning the text tag so Moodle is

02:15.800 --> 02:21.400
made with Vanilla, PHP and Vanilla JavaScript with an SQL database and the

02:21.400 --> 02:25.800
mobile application which is the team I actually work for is made with Ionic

02:25.800 --> 02:29.920
using Angular so in case you want to learn more you can look in the ad

02:29.920 --> 02:34.960
repositories to look at the code. Also I mentioned that it's very customizable to

02:34.960 --> 02:40.440
different use cases so you can build plugins for Moodle and if there is

02:40.440 --> 02:44.480
something that is not doing already there is likely a plugin already working

02:44.520 --> 02:48.680
for that and if there isn't you can make a plugin yourself. Here you can read the

02:48.680 --> 02:52.960
developer documentation to see how to build it both for the LMS and for the

02:52.960 --> 02:58.800
Moodle app and finally even though the Moodle LMS is at the core of everything

02:58.800 --> 03:02.800
that we do there is also many other things. For example I already mentioned

03:02.800 --> 03:07.240
the Moodle app which is interesting for low resource environments because you

03:07.240 --> 03:13.120
can use it to use offline so you can download the contents and fill the

03:13.160 --> 03:17.880
exercises and everything and it synchronizes when you go back online. We also

03:17.880 --> 03:22.240
have Moodle Cloud so you can self-host Moodle but if you want to get started

03:22.240 --> 03:27.560
we have a software as a service solution which is Moodle Cloud. We also

03:27.560 --> 03:33.120
have MoodleNet and Moodle Academy to share and find learning resources and

03:33.120 --> 03:36.800
if you want to integrate Moodle with your organization we have Moodle

03:36.800 --> 03:40.920
Workplace and Moodle Certified Partners and service providers so there is a

03:40.960 --> 03:45.240
lot more that you can dig in if you want to learn more. So that's it you can

03:45.240 --> 03:49.520
learn more at Moodle.com and if you need to contact me my mail is noel at Moodle.com

03:49.520 --> 03:52.880
and that's it. Thank you.
