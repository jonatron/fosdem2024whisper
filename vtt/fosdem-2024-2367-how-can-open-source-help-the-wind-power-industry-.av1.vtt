00:00.000 --> 00:12.240
Hi everyone. Everybody can hear me well from the back.

00:12.240 --> 00:15.120
Okay. Good.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.660
So, to introduce,

00:17.660 --> 00:23.220
I work for ZF Windpower is not any company doing software.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.360
What we are doing are turbines.

00:25.360 --> 00:31.520
Okay. We produce pieces that go to produce wind power actually.

00:31.520 --> 00:34.040
But I'm part of the digital team.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.320
Why do we have digitalization?

00:36.320 --> 00:39.120
We'll talk about later on.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.480
Okay. Like that.

00:50.480 --> 00:56.320
But to start, let's tell a bit about my story with wind.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.560
I didn't start just working with turbines.

00:59.560 --> 01:06.080
My love for wind dates back much earlier when I used to live in the beautiful Marseille.

01:06.080 --> 01:09.040
Marseille, nice town for who has been.

01:09.040 --> 01:14.160
Less than six hours from Brussels and it has a great resource, wind.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.280
At the time, I used to do sailing.

01:17.280 --> 01:20.800
You come to the Vierpart, city center of Marseille,

01:20.800 --> 01:24.640
have your pasties and you will see beautiful boats.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.520
You go out, the sea is nice.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.400
What has this to do with the energy transition?

01:30.400 --> 01:39.840
Well, historically, Marseille, the main industry was fossil fuels, oil.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.960
Okay. We have a place called Fossilmer.

01:42.960 --> 01:44.560
Great place to sail.

01:44.640 --> 01:51.280
It has great wind and one of the best winds in Europe.

01:51.280 --> 01:56.720
Just in front now of the oil factories, what do we have?

01:56.720 --> 02:06.000
The latest technology of turbines, floating turbines, means devices that you can put on the sea.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.840
Very deep, very recent technology.

02:09.920 --> 02:14.720
Those are, if not the most modern, among the most modern of France.

02:14.720 --> 02:19.680
The power is 8.4 megabatts and now they are three.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.920
They can already power a small city like Martig.

02:23.920 --> 02:27.760
They're just close to it for who is familiar with the area.

02:27.760 --> 02:37.280
So from the love for wind, from sailing, now I can see that this gets to the energy transition.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.720
Right?

02:43.520 --> 02:45.200
Is it only Marseille?

02:45.200 --> 02:48.240
No. What happens in Marseille does not stay in Marseille.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.680
Valid also for energy.

02:54.320 --> 02:59.680
These are graphs that I created myself from data from Kaggle.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.320
So open source data.

03:03.760 --> 03:04.640
What do you see there?

03:05.200 --> 03:13.680
Well, you can see that around the world we have some big production of renewables in general.

03:14.880 --> 03:20.240
And I guess there will be somebody here who has been or is from South America.

03:20.240 --> 03:25.680
South America is a place where you have strong input from hydropower.

03:26.400 --> 03:31.200
But at least to stay here in Europe, wind here is a big deal.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.200
And it's increasing.

03:35.680 --> 03:42.160
If we look at countries like Denmark, we are already almost at half of the energy production.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.320
National energy production of wind.

03:45.200 --> 03:53.360
It's a combination of good wind, because up north is really good, and of politics of wheeling it.

03:54.640 --> 04:00.800
I told about Marseille, there is good wind, but France is not even close to the measure.

04:01.280 --> 04:09.120
That means wind is definitely one energy resource that we will use more and more.

04:09.120 --> 04:09.920
Very important.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.280
And produces at a big scale.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.600
We have already now in Marseille 25 megawatts.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.440
It's huge, only with three turbines.

04:21.920 --> 04:23.200
All good? All great?

04:24.320 --> 04:29.520
Well, we have some problems in general with big installations.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.480
Things can go very wrong.

04:35.280 --> 04:36.080
Very wrong.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.960
And this is not just a matter of changing a small component.

04:41.680 --> 04:48.080
Let's say that a turbine, like even in land, not as big as the one on Marseille, gets faulty.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.280
It has to be stopped.

04:49.280 --> 04:49.920
What happens?

04:52.320 --> 04:53.680
Notification processing.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.360
It has to go, and we need to tell someone.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.440
Two days, then there will be an inspection time.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.520
I get the team to inspect the fault.

05:03.520 --> 05:04.000
Two weeks.

05:05.360 --> 05:10.480
And if I have locally the component, the replacement,

05:11.200 --> 05:15.440
will be six weeks to replace it, but maybe much longer.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.320
Component may be on the other side of the world, even.

05:18.320 --> 05:18.880
We don't know.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.320
And then the repairs, a couple more weeks.

05:23.040 --> 05:29.360
So for a turbine, which is 3.5 megawatts, not the latest technology like I show in Marseille,

05:31.040 --> 05:38.880
the whole intervention, if you are lucky, let's say 10 weeks, is lots of money, 125k, at least.

05:40.080 --> 05:40.560
A lot.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.440
How do we tackle this problem?

05:45.040 --> 05:52.160
By forecasting and by optimization of spare parts, so getting the spare parts already

05:52.240 --> 05:58.800
in-house, and to get it start as quick as possible, faster return to operation.

05:59.680 --> 06:01.520
And this is done by treating data.

06:04.400 --> 06:04.960
What do we do?

06:06.320 --> 06:09.360
Ideally, we monitor and predict.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.960
So there is an alert.

06:10.960 --> 06:12.800
It has to go to the cloud.

06:14.160 --> 06:18.400
I have to classify the failure already in the cloud.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.760
I had to know what is about.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.880
I have to prescribe a solution.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.720
I have to find the spare parts.

06:25.280 --> 06:32.160
And I have to forecast when I need to apply my solution.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.240
What, where, when.

06:35.120 --> 06:42.080
That means alert, data are collected and analyzed, and compared to historical data.

06:42.080 --> 06:47.440
The graph that you see there is like a exponential curve.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.680
I don't get into the Bible modeling.

06:49.680 --> 06:56.080
Here is not the moment of mathematics, but is a model that predicts well when cumulative

06:56.080 --> 07:01.200
failures will occur, subjected to a certain type of failure.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.040
So that's the type.

07:03.760 --> 07:06.000
I don't, as I said, don't get to technical.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.560
This is not the moment, but we can discuss it later on.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.280
How do we do that?

07:11.920 --> 07:16.320
Well, wind turbine data come, production data come.

07:16.320 --> 07:19.200
So this is from us, from people who produce.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
We get it to the cloud and we do prescriptive maintenance.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.680
What means prescriptive?

07:26.960 --> 07:29.200
Well, let's see quickly.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.320
Reactive.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.440
I fix the failure.

07:31.920 --> 07:32.240
Okay.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.760
I have a puncture on my bike.

07:35.760 --> 07:36.320
I change.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.160
Preventive.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.200
I do it regularly, like changing the oil in the car.

07:43.200 --> 07:46.160
That's what is typically done also for bigger installation.

07:47.040 --> 07:47.840
Predictive.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.560
That's what I talked about just now.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.960
Prescript is AI.

07:52.960 --> 07:53.680
Okay.

07:53.680 --> 07:54.880
Familiar with that.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.240
So AI tells you this is going to happen.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.280
Please do this.

08:02.560 --> 08:09.440
Data analysis with open source software allows more and more sophisticated maintenance.

08:09.440 --> 08:15.200
We have just been talking so far about AI, power by Python and so on.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.920
We have seen very good demonstrations earlier on.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.480
And what is our digitalization tech stack?

08:24.480 --> 08:28.560
So to get more specific, I already introduced Python.

08:29.760 --> 08:33.920
Then pandas to treat data frames, to treat data, at least to a small scale.

08:34.960 --> 08:40.160
Lifelines is a package that implements ViBool and is open source.

08:40.160 --> 08:45.440
Myself, I had already my own version where I added some modules.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.480
Docker, Git, of course, we work as a team.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.320
And it goes to Azure DevOps.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.160
Notice, I told about the cloud.

08:58.160 --> 08:59.920
I told about DevOps.

09:00.720 --> 09:05.360
DevOps is not just a technology, it's a way of working.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.560
That's very important.

09:06.560 --> 09:10.160
The technology allows to work us in an agile manner.

09:10.880 --> 09:12.720
And that's how we get results.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.880
So what we want as a result, reduced on time.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.320
We want to shorten.

09:22.960 --> 09:27.040
Instead of six weeks, let's get less or 10 weeks.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.240
Reduce the cost.

09:28.240 --> 09:31.200
So we need to have a proper stock level.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.960
And for that, we need predictions.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.840
Reduce template maintenance.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.960
We don't want the scenario where we have to call the technician.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.440
And the technician has to come from the other side of the world.

09:42.720 --> 09:48.000
And to avoid, of course, the consequential damage by addressing recurring failures.

09:48.000 --> 09:53.840
Okay, if I see that a certain bearing is always failing, let's address that.

09:58.640 --> 09:58.880
So,

09:59.360 --> 09:59.840
why?

10:00.880 --> 10:05.040
How do I know that I'm not just talking hot air?

10:05.040 --> 10:05.520
Okay.

10:07.280 --> 10:08.800
This all sounds great.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.440
Okay, you use AI, you use open source.

10:11.440 --> 10:12.480
Does it work?

10:12.480 --> 10:14.000
Well, what did we do?

10:14.000 --> 10:18.080
Then as producers, as manufacturers, pardon.

10:18.800 --> 10:22.240
We went to one of the customers and we proposed a pilot project.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.000
We apply our techniques.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.800
Let's see.

10:25.600 --> 10:26.400
The results.

10:26.400 --> 10:26.800
Okay.

10:29.200 --> 10:29.760
How did it go?

10:31.120 --> 10:36.480
Well, 50% less of alert processing.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.920
All these alerts.

10:37.920 --> 10:43.600
So, unplanned field inspections, 60% less.

10:45.600 --> 10:51.200
We strongly reduced the lead time to repair because we could forecast and we had the right

10:51.280 --> 10:52.480
parts in stock.

10:52.480 --> 10:58.880
And in general, the annual energy production got up to 0.5% of all the park with also with

10:58.880 --> 10:59.920
all the turbines.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.200
This means lots of money.

11:03.200 --> 11:08.880
Of course, for corporate reasons, I cannot tell too much, but you can figure out.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.680
To conclude, okay?

11:13.920 --> 11:16.800
Without, then we can go more technical if you like, guys.

11:16.800 --> 11:25.840
But take away messages are fragmented value chain affects very badly the wind energy efficiency.

11:26.480 --> 11:29.680
Don't have value chain, which is all dispersed.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.160
Okay.

11:30.160 --> 11:30.800
In general.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.480
But data insights and very good communication from the data.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.080
Has great benefits.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.200
We reduced the alert processing effort.

11:42.480 --> 11:51.040
We have prescriptive maintenance, which allows us to decrease the time to repair and we increase

11:51.040 --> 11:52.480
the overall efficiency.

11:52.480 --> 11:58.000
So, the annual energy production is one of the main KPIs for the public.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
So, we have a lot of data.

12:00.000 --> 12:08.800
So, the annual energy production is one of the main KPIs for wind power, but in general for any energy source.

12:10.160 --> 12:14.480
All these could be achieved with open source software.

12:14.480 --> 12:14.880
Okay.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.920
I sort of saw the full stack.

12:19.200 --> 12:27.920
Finally, it was the devos practice, not only the software that allows us the success of the pilot

12:27.920 --> 12:28.560
project.

12:28.560 --> 12:32.240
And I guess here we have a lot of people who are familiar with devos.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.520
Now, I guess I still have a couple of minutes for questions.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.080
Anyone?

12:40.640 --> 12:40.960
See.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.400
Hi there.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.920
I used to work for Siemens wind power and they had a predictive maintenance team.

12:54.560 --> 13:00.640
I'm just wondering, have you found any other companies as you've put open source kind of using your tools?

13:08.560 --> 13:11.200
Well, I'm not dealing directly with the customers.

13:11.760 --> 13:18.240
In general, with the customers, we just propose our solutions and we exchange the data.

13:18.240 --> 13:24.720
For example, if Siemens Gamesa has failures, we communicate the failures to the dev and we can

13:26.000 --> 13:32.080
suggest a stock amount for a certain component, for a certain turbines.

13:32.080 --> 13:36.240
But it's not that we are like the software company going to sell that.

13:36.240 --> 13:42.720
You see, it's more like the normal customer relationship when you sell parts.

13:42.720 --> 13:46.720
But how can we make, let's say, predictions?

13:46.720 --> 13:47.680
How we can interact?

13:47.680 --> 13:51.600
How we can serve better the customers even as a company?

13:54.240 --> 13:58.400
Good analysis of data and for that we use open source.
