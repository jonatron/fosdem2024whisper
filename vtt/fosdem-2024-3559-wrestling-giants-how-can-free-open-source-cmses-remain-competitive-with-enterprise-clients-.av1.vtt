WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.280
Yet another old friend and open source acquaintance of mine, Owen Lansbury, is with us.

00:11.280 --> 00:16.060
Owen volunteers for the Drupal Association and has been doing open source, I'm sure he's

00:16.060 --> 00:19.320
going to tell you, but for a very long time now.

00:19.320 --> 00:26.600
And touching on some of the topics that Matthias and I opened the day with, like how do we

00:26.600 --> 00:33.120
really compete on a business level with the big proprietary companies and what's the thinking

00:33.120 --> 00:36.080
going on in Owen's head and in Drupalland about that.

00:36.080 --> 00:43.880
And a special round of applause for Owen and his presentation shirt.

00:43.880 --> 00:49.160
So, oh sure, can we do this?

00:49.160 --> 00:55.160
Is that the speakers John Tick?

00:55.160 --> 01:02.680
I wasn't sure whether there'd be five people or five hundred for this talk, so thank you

01:02.680 --> 01:03.680
for having me.

01:03.680 --> 01:08.880
James, given the introduction about what the talk is about, I'm speaking from the Drupal

01:08.880 --> 01:13.360
perspective around the challenges that we're facing.

01:13.360 --> 01:20.160
And I have been involved in the Drupal project since around 2007, I think was my introduction.

01:20.160 --> 01:26.720
And then since then I've run a Drupal agency in Australia called Previous Next and then

01:26.720 --> 01:32.560
I've been volunteering on the Drupal Association Board for about the past five years or so.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.360
While I am representing the Drupal Association here, the content of my talk is mainly my

01:37.360 --> 01:42.920
own opinions, I'm not really reflecting official Drupal Association policy.

01:42.920 --> 01:48.240
However, what I'm going to do is tell you a little bit about Drupal that has been covered

01:48.240 --> 01:52.480
elsewhere, so I'll skip through what's already been talked about.

01:52.480 --> 01:57.560
I wanted to look back on the evolution of free and open source CMSs to understand where

01:57.560 --> 01:59.600
we might be heading with them.

01:59.600 --> 02:05.360
And then I'm going to dive into talking about how we wrestle the giants that we're competing

02:05.360 --> 02:08.160
against in the enterprise sector.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.600
And at the end I'll talk a little bit about how we can help each other as open source

02:11.600 --> 02:17.040
CMSs and then open it up for discussion and questions if you have any.

02:17.040 --> 02:22.920
So quick bit about Drupal, we have a saying in the Drupal world, come fit for the software

02:22.920 --> 02:25.040
and stay for the community.

02:25.040 --> 02:29.840
And that community was founded back in 2001, probably just up the road here in a college

02:29.840 --> 02:33.200
dorm room by Dries Spatets.

02:33.200 --> 02:38.920
And we just had our 23rd birthday as a project only a couple of weeks ago.

02:38.920 --> 02:41.840
We have a very active community.

02:41.840 --> 02:46.880
There's about 8,000 people that actively contribute code to the project, but then there's

02:46.880 --> 02:52.280
probably hundreds of thousands of people that use Drupal every day in their jobs as

02:52.280 --> 02:56.360
content editors, as developers, et cetera.

02:56.360 --> 03:01.720
We're currently at version 10.2.2, is that correct?

03:01.720 --> 03:07.520
And that has almost 8,000 extension modules if you're from the WordPress world, what we

03:07.520 --> 03:10.640
call modules you call plugins.

03:10.640 --> 03:16.440
And if you look at all the versions of Drupal, there's been about 50,000 modules written

03:16.440 --> 03:20.960
for Drupal over the years to extend its functionality.

03:20.960 --> 03:25.760
Importantly unlike other open source projects, we don't have a commercial module ecosystem

03:25.760 --> 03:29.560
or a commercial theme ecosystem.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.920
Everything that you do with Drupal is completely free.

03:32.920 --> 03:38.280
And that was a very conscious decision by Dries Spatets when he started the project.

03:38.280 --> 03:42.520
So I do sit on the Drupal Association Board, whether or not for profit organization that

03:42.520 --> 03:49.760
manages primarily the infrastructure around Drupal.org and then how people actually contribute

03:49.760 --> 03:50.920
code into the project.

03:50.920 --> 03:56.120
So we've had a big project to move to GitLab in the past couple of years, which has been

03:56.120 --> 03:57.560
a huge success for us.

03:57.560 --> 04:04.160
I think our build times have increased tenfold in terms of the speed that we can do that

04:04.160 --> 04:05.960
as a result.

04:05.960 --> 04:11.080
And then historically the Drupal Association has run DrupalCon in North America, which

04:11.080 --> 04:13.960
is our big flagship developer conference.

04:13.960 --> 04:19.480
We've had close involvement with the European event and then various programs that drive

04:19.480 --> 04:21.440
the project forward.

04:21.440 --> 04:26.520
And then outside of the Drupal Association, the community itself is very self-managed

04:26.520 --> 04:28.160
and self-sufficient.

04:28.160 --> 04:34.240
So there's hundreds of camps and meetups and other little country associations or big country

04:34.280 --> 04:39.960
associations in some cases that the Drupal Association has little to no involvement with

04:39.960 --> 04:42.760
in many cases.

04:42.760 --> 04:48.280
Now Drupal has always been at the forefront of open source and the open web.

04:48.280 --> 04:53.080
And this has been brought into focus recently where we have been officially recognized as

04:53.080 --> 04:59.120
a digital public good that in turn supports the United Nations Sustainable Development

04:59.120 --> 05:00.400
Goals.

05:00.680 --> 05:06.920
And as with many open source projects, the Drupal community is highly motivated by being

05:06.920 --> 05:12.000
able to build world-class software that anyone can download and use.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.960
And as has been talked about with Type 03, the impact that that's now having in Africa

05:17.960 --> 05:20.000
is significant.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
And one of my kind of foundation stories with Drupal is having an African come to me and

05:24.000 --> 05:27.920
saying, hey, we're using Drupal in Burkina Faso.

05:27.920 --> 05:28.920
Can you help me?

05:28.920 --> 05:34.600
And I said, well, sure, we've got this prepackaged solution that you can download and use tomorrow.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.320
And here's all the training materials.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.320
Off you go.

05:37.320 --> 05:40.960
So that is a really big driver for us.

05:40.960 --> 05:46.240
And the Drupal Association's mission statement is to drive the innovation and adoption of

05:46.240 --> 05:53.240
Drupal as this high-impact digital public good hand-in-hand with our open source community.

05:53.240 --> 05:58.120
And we recently wrote a manifesto that defines our commitment to the open web.

05:58.120 --> 06:06.000
And I think that's been incorporated into our open web alliance, website alliance.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.280
What are we called again?

06:08.280 --> 06:12.120
So yeah, if you're interested in reading that, have a look.

06:12.120 --> 06:17.040
Now in order to fulfill our mission of supporting the open web, we do need to be successful

06:17.040 --> 06:20.280
as a product in the open market.

06:20.280 --> 06:25.520
And I often don't like showing this slide because what it's implying is that Drupal

06:25.520 --> 06:31.920
used Pete in 2018, and it's been on this kind of downhill slide ever since.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.760
But there is a very different story here.

06:33.760 --> 06:40.480
So in 2015, we released Drupal 8, which was a significant architectural shift away from

06:40.480 --> 06:44.240
Drupal 7 and previous versions of Drupal.

06:44.240 --> 06:48.480
And prior to Drupal 8, Drupal had tried to be all things to all people.

06:48.480 --> 06:53.240
You could build your personal blog with it, or you could run the NASA website.

06:53.240 --> 06:58.640
But what's happened since Drupal 8 is that we've clearly positioned Drupal as being for

06:58.640 --> 07:01.760
ambitious digital experiences.

07:01.760 --> 07:09.720
And these slides are from a keynote that Drees gave back in 2017, where he outlined that

07:09.720 --> 07:15.880
vision of how we're moving away from being suitable for smaller sites and moving into

07:15.880 --> 07:17.560
these larger scale sites.

07:17.560 --> 07:23.040
And of course, larger scale sites typically means enterprise style customers.

07:23.040 --> 07:29.880
Now this coincided with the rise of SAS platforms like Wix and Squarespace and of course WordPress.com.

07:29.880 --> 07:34.680
And as they became more popular, what we've seen is that a lot of smaller sites have moved

07:34.680 --> 07:40.320
off Drupal to platforms like that, or other platforms that are better fit for purpose.

07:40.320 --> 07:46.040
And I think with that previous slide showing the downturn in the number of installs, that's

07:46.040 --> 07:51.720
not really reflecting the true story of what's happening with Drupal.

07:51.720 --> 07:55.000
And so what we've been trying to do in the Drupal Association for the past couple of

07:55.000 --> 08:01.160
years is rather than fixate on the number of installs, it's what's the health of our

08:01.160 --> 08:07.280
ecosystem and our Drupal economy, for lack of a better word.

08:07.280 --> 08:11.720
And if you look at the health of that ecosystem, it does tell a very positive story.

08:11.720 --> 08:17.040
So we have a listing of Drupal services companies on Drupal.org.

08:17.040 --> 08:23.320
With the top 100 of those companies, we estimate their combined annual revenues are about $1.5

08:23.320 --> 08:25.640
billion US dollars.

08:25.640 --> 08:29.560
And then once you've factored in all the other Drupal projects that might be built by internal

08:29.560 --> 08:36.360
teams, other agencies, etc., our guesstimate, that's very much a guesstimate, is that the

08:36.360 --> 08:42.080
total market value annually for Drupal projects is about $3 billion US.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.440
So that is a big pie.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.600
I think Gabor talked about pies.

08:45.600 --> 08:50.000
I'm talking about pies too, because it's a big pie and there's a lot of competition

08:50.000 --> 08:53.120
for a slice of that pie.

08:53.120 --> 08:59.360
Now unlike other open source projects, Drupal doesn't have a single company that's responsible

08:59.360 --> 09:06.720
for the majority of the code contribution or the finances that run through the community.

09:06.720 --> 09:11.440
And the challenge that we've had with the Drupal Association is that our annual budget

09:11.440 --> 09:15.800
has historically been about $3 million, $3.5 million.

09:15.800 --> 09:21.760
So if we're talking about a $3 billion economy around Drupal, the Drupal Association is only

09:21.760 --> 09:28.840
extracting about 0.001% of that market value.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.000
So that has been a big challenge.

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
And prior to COVID, the majority of that revenue came from running DrupalCon events.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.560
And of course, COVID hit, no one could go to in-person events.

09:40.560 --> 09:46.040
And we had to have an abrupt rethink about what the role of the Drupal Association is.

09:46.040 --> 09:51.600
And we had to refocus on how Drupal could be both sustainable and successful into the

09:51.600 --> 09:52.600
future.

09:52.600 --> 09:57.800
And so we've recently launched a new strategy that sees the Drupal Association play a closer

09:57.800 --> 10:05.560
role in both Drupal product innovation and also product marketing, two words that evoke

10:05.640 --> 10:09.360
quite a lot of emotion from people at times.

10:09.360 --> 10:15.280
And you might think, how is the organization that's at the center of this huge economy

10:15.280 --> 10:19.040
not involved in product management and marketing?

10:19.040 --> 10:24.600
But it is a big shift for the Drupal community and a big shift for the Drupal Association

10:24.600 --> 10:25.840
itself.

10:25.840 --> 10:30.880
So as I've often mentioned to people concerned about this change, if our open source product

10:30.880 --> 10:35.440
isn't successful in the open market, the community around that product is going to

10:35.440 --> 10:39.040
shift to where the action is.

10:39.040 --> 10:45.680
And it's definitely a case of if we can sustain a strong product and ensure a strong community,

10:45.680 --> 10:50.440
then we're going to be able to keep fulfilling our goals of providing a digital public good

10:50.440 --> 10:51.640
to the world.

10:51.640 --> 10:55.360
So all of these things are closely interlinked.

10:55.360 --> 11:00.440
So in order to see where we can go in the future, I'm just going to very quickly rewind.

11:00.480 --> 11:04.080
I'm sure most of you know these stories.

11:04.080 --> 11:10.160
But this story goes back 25 years to when Type 03 was released and then in the five or

11:10.160 --> 11:14.600
so years after that, most of the products that we know and love came into being in some

11:14.600 --> 11:16.000
form.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.880
And I don't need to emphasize that a quarter of a century in technology years is like a

11:21.880 --> 11:24.400
millennia.

11:24.400 --> 11:32.120
But any of these projects to still be running successfully is an incredible achievement.

11:32.120 --> 11:37.040
And I think if you rewind to 25 years ago when some of us were actually working in the

11:37.040 --> 11:43.480
industry, we were doing things like building our own custom CMSs and then having to maintain

11:43.480 --> 11:47.160
them ourselves and hope they didn't explode.

11:47.160 --> 11:54.560
And then big clients were only really able to use products like Interwoven or Oracle

11:54.560 --> 11:58.960
CMS, which literally cost millions and millions of dollars to install.

11:58.960 --> 12:04.600
So at the time as our open source CMSs came into that market, they were filling a really

12:04.600 --> 12:12.720
core need for reusable software that could be maintained across a broad network of people

12:12.720 --> 12:16.800
at a very reasonable price.

12:16.800 --> 12:22.240
And so as the mid-naughties turned into the 2010s, that really was a golden age for most

12:22.240 --> 12:23.400
of our projects.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.320
Most of us did very, very well.

12:25.320 --> 12:30.440
But then over the past decade, like I said, we have seen that shift towards SAS platforms.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.280
We've got headless CMSs.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.000
Now we've got static site generators.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.360
There's a lot of options out there.

12:36.360 --> 12:43.240
And I was looking on Builtwith.com for statistics for this talk and they have 242 CMS products

12:43.240 --> 12:47.600
that people are still using right now, which is, oh no, 424.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.600
Sorry, I misread that.

12:50.600 --> 12:54.760
And I think through this past decade, what we've also seen has been the rise of the digital

12:54.760 --> 13:00.000
experience platform, which everyone from Adobe to Sitecore and every other brand has

13:00.000 --> 13:01.520
jumped on board.

13:01.520 --> 13:06.040
And primarily because enterprise customers do want to have one platform that they can

13:06.040 --> 13:10.000
manage all of their content and customer interactions through.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.040
Now I personally consider DXP to be quite a clever marketing term.

13:14.040 --> 13:18.960
Often it's a mishmash of technologies that may or may not work that well together.

13:18.960 --> 13:24.040
But the key thing for those of us who are flying the content management flag is that

13:24.040 --> 13:29.560
we're getting shut out of those conversations when big clients are looking for a solution.

13:29.560 --> 13:34.560
So within the Drupal Association, we've taken that very seriously and we've started trying

13:34.560 --> 13:41.160
to formulate language around Drupal being at the core of an open DXP and however you

13:41.160 --> 13:45.800
kind of structure that open DXP is up to you.

13:45.800 --> 13:49.520
But we still have a huge amount of work to do in that regard.

13:49.520 --> 13:55.480
In the meantime, I think Jam had a slide showing Adobe's push into the government sector in

13:55.480 --> 14:04.120
Australia and they very cleverly marketed a Gov DXP platform to government clients in

14:04.120 --> 14:11.640
direct competition with, as Jam said, a government managed and run Gov CMS platform that's based

14:11.640 --> 14:12.760
on Drupal.

14:12.760 --> 14:16.040
And they're winning huge contracts off the back of that, tens if not hundreds of millions

14:16.040 --> 14:17.800
of dollars.

14:17.800 --> 14:23.400
And this focus on DXP by proprietary companies is just driven by the scale of the opportunities.

14:23.400 --> 14:29.840
So Adobe themselves, they think it's worth $110 billion annually and the amount that they

14:29.840 --> 14:36.760
invest to stay competitive in that market is around $2.7 billion in product development,

14:36.760 --> 14:39.520
sales and marketing every year.

14:39.520 --> 14:42.880
And then they make about $4 billion in total revenue.

14:42.880 --> 14:49.720
So do us as open source CMS have any chance at competing at that scale?

14:49.720 --> 14:53.120
And the good news is we do quite well already.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.120
And WordPress is obviously the elephant in the room.

14:56.120 --> 15:01.880
They run 40% of all websites, not just big websites.

15:01.880 --> 15:08.000
And in this category, this is the top 10,000 websites off BuiltWith.com, they're running

15:08.000 --> 15:10.200
a quarter of all of those sites.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.920
So open source is definitely winning through WordPress there.

15:13.920 --> 15:19.200
But as we go down the list here, you can see we've only got that little 1.4% gap between

15:19.200 --> 15:21.160
Drupal and Adobe.

15:21.160 --> 15:25.520
And I can guarantee you there is whole teams of people of Adobe looking at how they can

15:25.520 --> 15:30.600
kill Drupal to get that leap on the market share there.

15:30.600 --> 15:35.880
And I fully understand why us in the open source world, we often recoil at talk of total

15:35.880 --> 15:39.320
market value and market share.

15:39.320 --> 15:45.680
But when we look at open source from the perspective of its philosophical underpinnings of being

15:45.680 --> 15:52.480
free, we do need to recognize that we still build products and products need to be relevant

15:52.480 --> 15:56.960
in the market because if they're not, there's only one path and that's down.

15:56.960 --> 16:02.840
So in order to maintain a healthy ecosystem for our open source CMSs, enterprise customers

16:02.840 --> 16:07.640
are key because if they're changing your product, it means you're still relevant.

16:07.640 --> 16:12.240
It means that they can see a pathway for the next decade ahead, that your product's going

16:12.240 --> 16:16.040
to evolve and be supported.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.320
And it's a huge stamp of approval.

16:18.320 --> 16:23.440
Because enterprise customers are going to be pushing money through your communities,

16:23.440 --> 16:27.520
they're going to be driving feature requests, and the budgets that they're working with

16:27.520 --> 16:31.560
are just orders of magnitude bigger than anything in any other sector.

16:31.560 --> 16:38.120
So there are $100 million website rebuilds, but even on much smaller scale, that enterprise

16:38.120 --> 16:43.240
investment that flows through to the agency's building, maintaining and hosting these types

16:43.240 --> 16:50.360
of projects, and in turn, that provides consistent, repeat income that ultimately flows into

16:50.360 --> 16:56.000
our open source communities in the form of stable jobs, good salaries, community funding,

16:56.000 --> 16:59.320
and sponsored code contribution.

16:59.320 --> 17:04.720
So with that scene set, I'll jump into the meat of the talk, which is how can we actually

17:04.720 --> 17:11.760
survive and remain competitive when we're dealing with giants like Adobe?

17:12.400 --> 17:17.640
The first thing I want to dive into here is not just a whole lot of bad stock photos,

17:17.640 --> 17:22.600
but the understanding, the buying process that these large organizations go through when

17:22.600 --> 17:25.280
they're selecting new technologies.

17:25.280 --> 17:30.560
As I said in the previous slide, they're often making these decisions for at least a decade

17:30.560 --> 17:33.360
into the future, if not longer.

17:33.360 --> 17:37.960
And you'll often hear that the responsibility for making those decisions is with the CIOs,

17:38.960 --> 17:44.160
and more increasingly the CMOs, the chief marketing officers.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.480
All of these people are very risk averse.

17:46.480 --> 17:50.960
They don't want to make the wrong technology decision that backfires on their multi-billion

17:50.960 --> 17:57.560
dollar company, and they're all quite hard people to influence directly sitting in their

17:57.560 --> 18:01.160
ivory towers.

18:01.160 --> 18:06.200
So these people will probably be the ones that are reading the Gartner and the Forrester

18:06.240 --> 18:07.840
reports.

18:07.840 --> 18:13.840
And as you can see on the slides here, there's only one recognizable open source brand there,

18:13.840 --> 18:16.360
and that's WordPress VIP.

18:16.360 --> 18:22.360
Now, full credits are automatic who run WordPress VIP.

18:22.360 --> 18:25.400
There's a very much for profit service.

18:25.400 --> 18:30.920
So they've worked out that to get listed here, you need to have a single company with a certain

18:30.920 --> 18:35.920
amount of revenue that the researchers can analyze and then do an apples for apples comparison.

18:36.920 --> 18:43.920
And having the WordPress brand in these listings just gives huge legitimacy to WordPress for

18:46.440 --> 18:49.080
anyone that's using it.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.560
Also credit here to Acquia.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.680
So Acquia has been mentioned a few times.

18:52.680 --> 18:57.920
It was the company that was co-founded by Drees that started the Drupal project back

18:57.920 --> 19:00.720
in 2007.

19:01.080 --> 19:08.080
They do talk extensively about Acquia Drupal in the context of their broader DXP offerings.

19:09.440 --> 19:13.840
The Drupal story is kind of getting through there, but again, we don't have the Drupal

19:13.840 --> 19:17.440
brand name there.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.920
Every other product on here is proprietary.

19:19.920 --> 19:24.400
There was Squiz here that started off as a pseudo open source product, but even they're

19:24.400 --> 19:26.880
totally closed source.

19:27.000 --> 19:32.640
While I don't think it's that quantifiable about how important these surveys are, just

19:32.640 --> 19:39.040
not having the Drupal Type-O3 or Jumla brand names in them does hinder their recognition

19:39.040 --> 19:42.080
significantly in this enterprise market.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.640
So I think there is an opportunity here.

19:45.640 --> 19:50.520
It would be a big process to go through to kind of change the thinking of these analysts

19:50.520 --> 19:53.880
to start including open source projects.

19:53.880 --> 19:59.200
But if we have an open website alliance that can lobby them, and it is about lobbying,

19:59.200 --> 20:04.400
then maybe we have an opportunity to make that happen somehow.

20:04.400 --> 20:10.760
Now the other way these C-level decision makers can be targeted is through events.

20:10.760 --> 20:16.440
Unlike Adobe, we probably can't afford to pay Ryan Reynolds to come and do a keynote

20:16.440 --> 20:17.480
as Adobe do.

20:17.480 --> 20:21.440
But in the Drupal world, again, Acquia have done a very good job with their Acquia engage

20:21.480 --> 20:26.920
events where they showcase customer success stories on their DXP platform and through

20:26.920 --> 20:30.240
that the Drupal story gets told.

20:30.240 --> 20:34.600
And the Drupal Association, we have tried to run some C-level decision maker events

20:34.600 --> 20:39.800
at DrupalCon, but we've had mixed results because they're kind of mashed together into

20:39.800 --> 20:42.720
a bigger developer conference.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.920
And why don't C-level people want to be at a developer conference?

20:46.200 --> 20:53.080
It goes against a lot of our open source principles, but they want to have exclusivity, they want

20:53.080 --> 20:57.200
to feel like they're special, they want to be networking with a very select group of

20:57.200 --> 21:02.240
peers and they want to have strategic insights into technology that gives them competitive

21:02.240 --> 21:03.240
advantages.

21:03.240 --> 21:08.600
So like I said, that goes against so many of our principles in the open source world,

21:08.600 --> 21:14.080
but there's a formula there that we can definitely replicate in terms of targeting those types

21:14.080 --> 21:16.520
of people.

21:16.520 --> 21:22.720
And while our not-for-profit organizations that govern our communities might not have

21:22.720 --> 21:28.000
direct relationships with these C-level decision makers, our larger partner agencies definitely

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
do.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.960
So the role that we can play as the community organizations is to give as much assistance

21:34.960 --> 21:41.800
as possible to those agencies to help them win or retain new enterprise clients, just

21:41.840 --> 21:44.000
through playbook-style information.

21:44.000 --> 21:49.400
So does your open source project have a playbook that compares your product against a site

21:49.400 --> 21:56.400
core in Adobe and has a whole range of answers as to why yours is a superior product?

21:57.120 --> 22:03.520
Do you have a pre-package demo that's consistently updated with new features and functionality

22:03.520 --> 22:10.280
that can highlight your technology in the same way that a slick demo from Adobe would?

22:10.280 --> 22:14.520
This is an area we fall very well short within the Drupal world.

22:14.520 --> 22:19.360
Most of our agencies are off replicating effort every single time that they go off and pitch

22:19.360 --> 22:26.360
to a new client, but this is a relatively easy to solve issue if it's given the right

22:27.200 --> 22:28.720
attention.

22:28.720 --> 22:35.640
And something that's related to this is being able to focus on the strength and scale of

22:35.640 --> 22:38.000
our global sales team.

22:38.040 --> 22:43.040
We don't have anyone that's responsible for sales at the Drupal Association, but every

22:43.040 --> 22:48.720
day we've got thousands of people out there pitching new projects to clients, telling

22:48.720 --> 22:53.640
slightly different stories, but selling Drupal to these larger clients.

22:53.640 --> 23:00.320
So as I noted, we can play a role as the association by providing those salespeople with the tools

23:00.320 --> 23:03.000
to help them win those projects.

23:03.000 --> 23:07.520
We have started to address this within the Drupal community with a certified partner

23:07.520 --> 23:14.360
program, and I recognize that other open source projects have similar types of programs.

23:14.360 --> 23:20.000
And what we're doing with that is we're positioning our agency partners using the same language

23:20.000 --> 23:22.480
that a proprietary platform would use.

23:22.480 --> 23:29.000
Again, we're kind of compromising our core values by playing that game, but to play in

23:29.000 --> 23:33.400
the enterprise space, you do need to play a certain type of game.

23:33.400 --> 23:40.480
And then the really core group of people that you need to be convincing are the people

23:40.480 --> 23:45.960
who'll actually be using the products themselves, so the developers, the content editors, the

23:45.960 --> 23:47.680
DevOps engineers, et cetera.

23:47.680 --> 23:56.680
So any C-level person will lean heavily on this group to give them evaluations and recommendations

23:56.680 --> 24:02.640
about what technology they should be moving towards, and where do they get their information

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
from.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.760
They get it from their prior experience of having used different platforms.

24:06.760 --> 24:08.920
They might have used Drupal 7.

24:08.920 --> 24:14.200
What impression do they have about Drupal 7 compared to what it is today?

24:14.200 --> 24:17.480
They talk to their colleagues at other organizations who are using it.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.800
Hey, what's it like having a Drupal site?

24:19.800 --> 24:22.240
Can you find developers for it?

24:22.240 --> 24:24.080
And then, of course, the internet.

24:24.640 --> 24:30.040
There's a whole range of challenges that we could spend an entire presentation on each

24:30.040 --> 24:35.640
issue, but the core of each of them is purely about perception.

24:35.640 --> 24:41.160
So does your 25-year-old open-source product look and function like a temporary piece of

24:41.160 --> 24:43.120
software?

24:43.120 --> 24:49.320
So WordPress, despite the slides that we saw earlier, is often held up as the gold standard

24:49.320 --> 24:54.320
in terms of content editor experience, and we have paid a huge amount of attention to

24:54.320 --> 25:00.560
that within the Drupal community to update our editor experience and our administration

25:00.560 --> 25:02.240
UI.

25:02.240 --> 25:05.880
And we've even got a project at the moment that's looking at integrating the Gutenberg

25:05.880 --> 25:09.520
editor into Drupal that WordPress helped fund.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.720
Thank you.

25:11.720 --> 25:17.120
Another thing would be, is it obvious that your products can fulfill contemporary requirements

25:17.160 --> 25:24.160
like a headless front end or integrating with a popular marketing automation platform?

25:24.600 --> 25:27.880
Like I said, it is easy to find qualified developers.

25:27.880 --> 25:32.480
So this is a much bigger thing that I'll talk about in a moment, but for us as not for profit

25:32.480 --> 25:37.120
associations, we should be at the center of those initiatives, whether it's as simple

25:37.120 --> 25:42.560
as having a job board available or running a full certification program.

25:42.560 --> 25:46.720
Can a developer quickly download and install a demo of your product?

25:46.840 --> 25:52.240
When something we struggle heavily with in the Drupal world, I went on the download Drupal

25:52.240 --> 25:56.520
page the other day and the first thing it said was, you have to install Composer.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.520
I can't do that.

25:57.520 --> 26:02.040
I'm not a developer, so there's these big hurdles that we have to get through.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.560
But first impressions around that are absolutely key.

26:05.560 --> 26:11.720
If it doesn't work the first time, you're probably not going to look at that technology.

26:11.720 --> 26:16.280
And then are there demos, case studies, and white papers that target specific industry

26:16.280 --> 26:21.360
verticals that you can easily collate, put them in a presentation, and then give that

26:21.360 --> 26:24.640
presentation back to your C level?

26:24.640 --> 26:30.160
Decision maker and convince them that your open source product is the best one.

26:30.160 --> 26:33.720
Bearing in mind that any proprietary platform that's talking to that customer, they're going

26:33.720 --> 26:35.560
to be in there with a very slick demo.

26:35.560 --> 26:41.200
They're going to have their global digital partners, our digital agency partners saying

26:41.200 --> 26:45.560
yes to every feature requirement and yes to every question.

26:45.560 --> 26:50.920
So we do need to be playing that game in terms of convincing people, giving them confidence

26:50.920 --> 26:56.000
that moving to open source is the right recommendation.

26:56.000 --> 27:02.520
And then the final group that C level executives will lean on is their incumbent agencies and

27:02.520 --> 27:04.040
consultants.

27:04.040 --> 27:09.320
So are they recommending your open source platform to their big clients?

27:09.320 --> 27:13.640
Now, in the Drupal community, we've always had a core group of companies that both support

27:13.640 --> 27:19.400
the project and champion Drupal to their clients.

27:19.400 --> 27:24.400
And like I said, we've recently launched a certified partner program.

27:24.400 --> 27:31.080
But the key here is with your agency network, how easy is it for new agencies to both upskill

27:31.080 --> 27:35.000
and become part of that certified partner program?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.840
And agencies, they're going to be attracted to technology.

27:37.840 --> 27:41.920
They know that they can sell to new clients and they know that they can build a business

27:41.920 --> 27:44.680
practice around that.

27:44.680 --> 27:50.880
So the key to these big global clients is being able to have big global agencies as

27:50.880 --> 27:53.080
part of those networks.

27:53.080 --> 27:57.640
Again, ArcRear have done very well with that for their own partner network, but it's not

27:57.640 --> 28:03.160
something that we've been able to replicate with the Drupal Association at this point.

28:03.160 --> 28:08.200
And I think it's generally hard for these big global firms to get their heads around

28:08.200 --> 28:09.200
open source.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.720
It just doesn't mesh with how they do business.

28:11.720 --> 28:18.320
And a pattern that we've seen in the Drupal world is clients will demand that their agencies

28:18.320 --> 28:20.200
provide them with Drupal services.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.240
They say, yes, sure, we'll do that.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.920
They'll do a project for them more often than not.

28:24.920 --> 28:34.160
It gets outsourced to someone else, done to varying degrees of success, but they'll quickly

28:34.160 --> 28:42.280
slip back into their comfortable pattern of partnering with big proprietary firms.

28:42.280 --> 28:46.600
The other part of that is that the way that their structure and run projects, their ability

28:46.600 --> 28:51.960
or willingness to contribute back to open source projects in terms of code or have any

28:51.960 --> 28:55.640
connection with the communities is generally quite limited.

28:55.640 --> 28:59.080
So again, this is a hindrance.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.440
It's a solvable problem.

29:00.720 --> 29:05.600
It probably takes a lot of focus to get over that hurdle.

29:05.600 --> 29:09.120
But again, something that we might be able to grapple with.

29:09.120 --> 29:14.120
Now, in terms of where we do clearly win, rapid innovation is something that we do incredibly

29:14.120 --> 29:16.320
well in the open source world.

29:16.320 --> 29:21.400
And I'm sure, like in the Drupal world, ChatGPT gets released.

29:21.400 --> 29:26.160
And then a month later, we've got a working module that you can start integrating that

29:26.160 --> 29:28.040
into your Drupal sites with.

29:28.040 --> 29:32.240
And I'm sure that was a similar case with most other open source CMSs.

29:32.240 --> 29:38.160
But in my question to Gabo's talk, maintaining the speed of that innovation and the scale

29:38.160 --> 29:43.920
of innovation is something that becomes harder and harder as your project gets bigger and

29:43.920 --> 29:49.560
more complex and as both the software and the community have matured.

29:49.560 --> 29:55.200
And so in the Drupal world now, we have this very carefully planned release cycle.

29:55.200 --> 29:58.000
And we need to make sure that each release is rock solid.

29:58.000 --> 30:05.600
We can't be taking risks by putting new functionality in there that may or may not work, especially

30:05.600 --> 30:07.160
with so many big customers.

30:07.160 --> 30:12.320
So there's a certain level of conservatism that we now have to adopt because we do have

30:12.320 --> 30:15.040
these big customers.

30:15.040 --> 30:20.440
And another philosophical hurdle we have is this notion that the Drupal association themselves

30:20.440 --> 30:26.040
should be directing actual budget towards innovation projects when there's this notion

30:26.040 --> 30:29.400
that contribution is free.

30:29.400 --> 30:34.400
But contribution has never been free, no matter how you look at it.

30:34.400 --> 30:38.620
The cost in personal time or wages is always borne by someone, whether it's the individual

30:38.620 --> 30:43.800
contributing their time instead of doing paid work or the agency that's sponsoring their

30:43.800 --> 30:46.920
team to contribute that.

30:46.920 --> 30:52.120
And I think the recognition we have in the Drupal world is that other open source projects

30:52.120 --> 30:54.200
have no issue with that whatsoever.

30:54.200 --> 31:00.160
So the Linux Foundation, they have $160 million that they direct towards strategic projects

31:00.160 --> 31:01.840
each year.

31:01.840 --> 31:05.920
So we've started getting our heads around that in the Drupal world.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.920
We ran this pitchberg contest last year.

31:08.920 --> 31:14.880
It was run at the DrupalCon Pittsburgh, if the name needs an explanation there.

31:14.880 --> 31:21.080
And this was having a competition where we had $100,000 in funding to drive a few strategic

31:21.080 --> 31:22.720
things forward.

31:22.720 --> 31:28.600
And one of those was the Gutenberg projects that WordPress actually contributed some funding

31:28.600 --> 31:29.600
to.

31:29.600 --> 31:33.760
And so as soon as there's some money in the equation, the agencies that are working on

31:33.760 --> 31:38.760
those things can easily prioritize them because, hey, they're getting paid for it.

31:38.760 --> 31:43.600
Now being able to scale that model up is the hard part.

31:43.600 --> 31:49.840
Like I said, with a $3 billion economy around Drupal, how can the Drupal Association capture

31:49.840 --> 31:51.840
some of that value?

31:51.840 --> 31:57.200
And even if we just captured 1%, then that would be a $30 million innovation budget that

31:57.200 --> 31:58.960
we might be able to work with.

31:58.960 --> 32:02.960
And I think someone's doing a talk towards the end of the day about how you've tackled

32:02.960 --> 32:05.880
that in the WordPress world.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.680
Looking forward to hearing about that.

32:08.680 --> 32:13.840
Similarly, the idea that Drupal would be marketed as a product by the Drupal Association has

32:13.840 --> 32:17.960
been this big wall to get over.

32:17.960 --> 32:24.360
And there's a legacy there in terms of being structured as a nonprofit association in the

32:24.360 --> 32:31.720
USA where legally funds that come to the Drupal Association are for the advancement of a charitable

32:31.720 --> 32:32.980
cause.

32:32.980 --> 32:37.520
So there has been a sense that we're not allowed to market Drupal as a commercial product as

32:37.520 --> 32:39.300
a result.

32:39.300 --> 32:44.320
As I noted at the beginning of the talk, our charitable cause in the Drupal is ensuring

32:44.320 --> 32:49.840
that Drupal remains as a digital public good that supports things like the United Nations

32:49.840 --> 32:51.400
Sustainable Development Goals.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.560
So we do have a core underpinning there.

32:54.560 --> 32:59.240
And I think the important thing for us in the Drupal world is that if we don't have

32:59.240 --> 33:04.880
that positive product awareness, then we can't actually fulfill that digital public good

33:04.880 --> 33:06.920
role in the first place.

33:06.920 --> 33:15.640
So whether we call it marketing or advocacy, we do need to drive a positive image of Drupal

33:15.640 --> 33:21.280
as a product in comparison to what's on offer from proprietary platforms.

33:21.280 --> 33:26.360
We've had a volunteer group within the Drupal community called Promote Drupal that's done

33:26.360 --> 33:27.680
a range of initiatives.

33:27.680 --> 33:31.840
But what we're starting to do is bring that inside the Drupal Association.

33:31.840 --> 33:36.960
We've just commissioned a go-to-market strategy for how to position Drupal as a product in

33:36.960 --> 33:38.480
the open market.

33:38.480 --> 33:44.680
And we'll have a range of initiatives that will roll out through 2024.

33:44.680 --> 33:49.080
One initiative that we tried recently, which was a complete experiment, was to have the

33:49.080 --> 33:55.040
very first Drupal product brand at Booth at a big tech conference that was at Web Summit

33:55.040 --> 33:57.040
in Lisbon.

33:57.040 --> 34:02.360
And again, this was like this kind of radical thing that had never been done before.

34:02.360 --> 34:08.640
And it is a very expensive undertaking to do a booth like this at a product, at a conference

34:08.640 --> 34:09.800
like that.

34:09.800 --> 34:14.480
And so we partnered with a range of bigger Drupal services companies who help co-fund

34:14.480 --> 34:15.480
that.

34:15.480 --> 34:20.280
And then, of course, they get leads that come through from having a presence there.

34:20.280 --> 34:26.520
So in the early days, we have good anecdotal results from having tried it and whether we

34:26.520 --> 34:29.040
can kind of replicate that long term.

34:29.040 --> 34:33.360
I think the important thing I said to Boris earlier is that we're actually getting out

34:33.360 --> 34:39.440
of our bubble and we're putting Drupal out there as a product in the open market.

34:39.440 --> 34:44.200
And then likewise, having people tell the Drupal story at non-Drupal events is really

34:44.200 --> 34:48.440
key and something that we've been historically quite bad at.

34:48.440 --> 34:53.680
So this photo is our former Drupal Association chair, Batti Brattat, doing a keynote at Web

34:53.680 --> 34:56.120
Summit off the back of having a booth there.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.960
And there's just so many events around the world that we could be doing that type of

34:58.960 --> 35:02.400
thing at to get the Drupal story out there.

35:02.400 --> 35:06.960
Now, something that doesn't cost a huge amount of money is good press.

35:06.960 --> 35:12.080
So for this talk, I did a Google search on best CMS for enterprise.

35:12.080 --> 35:18.120
And amazingly, on the first page, we had Drupal come up as best for enterprise.

35:18.120 --> 35:22.200
Now was this coordinated by a clever PR person at the Drupal Association?

35:22.200 --> 35:27.080
No, there's no one who has that role at the Drupal Association, but it's something that

35:27.080 --> 35:30.920
we should probably start paying a bit of attention to.

35:30.920 --> 35:35.400
Because for every good review, then there's going to be a negative review about an open

35:35.400 --> 35:41.880
source security vulnerability or someone moaning on a internet forum about how bad the user

35:41.880 --> 35:46.000
experience of Drupal 7 is, even though Drupal 7 came out 15 years ago.

35:46.000 --> 35:51.840
So big firms, big companies, they're really good at managing those narratives.

35:51.840 --> 35:57.160
And there's nothing stopping us from doing the same with the right attention.

35:57.160 --> 36:01.240
And again, I'll just bring this example up.

36:01.240 --> 36:08.360
I think you had a version of this article of the way that Adobe is restoring the playbook

36:08.360 --> 36:13.440
of fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the Australian market at the moment to try and convince big

36:13.440 --> 36:16.040
customers away from open source.

36:16.040 --> 36:21.880
And this article is in Australia's version of the Financial Times, where they just regurgitated

36:21.880 --> 36:23.800
a press release from Adobe.

36:23.800 --> 36:30.960
Adobe had run a global survey, and surprisingly, the MyGov site they talk about here is now

36:30.960 --> 36:38.560
20% better to use because it was built with Adobe Experience Manager.

36:38.560 --> 36:45.840
So us in the open source world, we need to be able to have counter narratives to this.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.640
And again, it's a playbook.

36:48.640 --> 36:52.800
It's a game to know how to play.

36:52.800 --> 36:57.680
Just to kind of finish on here, the biggest strength that we have in our open source communities

36:57.680 --> 37:01.480
is the depth and expertise of our developer pools.

37:01.480 --> 37:06.600
And there's huge value in being able to market that in a way that enterprise customers understand.

37:06.600 --> 37:13.280
I think Jam had a version of this slide in one of his talks a while ago where if you

37:13.280 --> 37:18.480
talk about Adobe, hey, they might have a thousand people working on Adobe Experience

37:18.480 --> 37:23.360
Manager, but in the dribble world, we've got 20,000.

37:23.360 --> 37:32.560
So again, being able to develop that or grow that developer network through robust outreach,

37:32.560 --> 37:40.960
training, mentoring, career pathway programs is something that us as nonprofit organizations

37:40.960 --> 37:42.120
should be at the center of.

37:42.120 --> 37:48.680
It's a big time intensive exercise, but something that's a solvable thing.

37:48.680 --> 37:51.680
I will finish very quickly on a couple of slides.

37:51.680 --> 37:58.280
So as we've talked about a little bit today, us in the open source CMS world, we're really

37:58.360 --> 38:04.440
at the forefront of championing and sustaining the open web.

38:04.440 --> 38:09.120
And it's not just us in the open source world who really care about the open web.

38:09.120 --> 38:14.560
It's something of huge concern to governments around the world and large organizations around

38:14.560 --> 38:15.560
the world.

38:15.560 --> 38:20.400
So whatever we can be doing to collectively maintain the focus on and protect our open

38:20.400 --> 38:23.760
source technologies is incredibly important.

38:23.880 --> 38:28.680
The work that's been done with the cybersecurity act is a good example of that.

38:28.680 --> 38:33.080
And similarly, let's look at ways that we can collectively promote positive open source

38:33.080 --> 38:36.800
and open web narratives in the enterprise market.

38:36.800 --> 38:40.320
And that might be as simple as ensuring that we've got consistent things that we all talk

38:40.320 --> 38:46.960
about or it might be as simple as engaging a PR person to manage those narratives on

38:46.960 --> 38:48.640
our collective behalf.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.800
So I'll leave it there.

38:51.840 --> 38:55.040
If there's questions, I can repeat them.

38:55.040 --> 38:57.040
Thank you so much.

39:02.040 --> 39:06.040
I'll just talk loud and hope that my catch is that one of the things that came out in

39:06.040 --> 39:13.040
Matthias' work around that has come to initial fruition with the open website alliance is

39:13.040 --> 39:21.040
that open source, we have 100,000, a million developers.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.160
We don't know, a huge number.

39:23.160 --> 39:27.240
And all of our lives are touched by it every day and you know someone who works with it.

39:27.240 --> 39:31.800
But you have people who come and say, oh, I tried open source once, it didn't work for

39:31.800 --> 39:34.000
me so I'm never going to do open source.

39:34.000 --> 39:41.000
And we are often worried about Wordpress or Jumla or Drupal or very obscure issues for

39:42.440 --> 39:46.280
people who aren't in our level of experience.

39:46.320 --> 39:53.320
So part of this idea could also be that the mass and the force for good, we don't have

39:53.520 --> 39:57.520
that marketing budget that Apple or Adobe or somebody has but trying to figure out how

39:57.520 --> 40:04.520
to leverage that scale and make these experiences somehow or these values visible at this collective

40:05.680 --> 40:09.960
level seems like a really exciting part of what we're doing here.

40:10.400 --> 40:16.920
And Drupal as having found the key into the enterprise market and into the government

40:16.920 --> 40:21.200
space very effectively is one of those players I think has a lot of really great examples

40:21.200 --> 40:27.560
to follow and I really hope that we can come to each other's conferences and interact more

40:27.560 --> 40:29.400
through channels like this.

40:29.400 --> 40:30.000
Great.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Anyone have any questions for Owen?

40:32.000 --> 40:33.600
No.
