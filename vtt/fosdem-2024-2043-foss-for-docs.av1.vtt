WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.840
We have Dr. Candace McKita Moore with PhosphorDocs.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.040
Thank you.

00:12.040 --> 00:22.040
I'm Candace McKita Moore and I will be giving a presentation about PhosphorDocs.

00:22.040 --> 00:27.920
First I'll tell you a little bit about myself, then I'll tell you what I mean by PhosphorDocs.

00:27.920 --> 00:33.000
Then I will try to convince you to get involved in this or if you're already involved in it,

00:33.000 --> 00:38.040
kind of give you some tips about what you're doing.

00:38.040 --> 00:45.120
And I'll conclude with some deeper insights about how to be successful when you do this.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.600
So about me, I have my bachelor's from Columbia.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.440
I got my MD and Technion.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.520
I went further in my medical training.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.920
I did an internship.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.680
I did further training in emergency and radiology.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.840
Now I'm a research software at the Netherlands, a science center.

01:00.840 --> 01:05.920
So stopping my biography there, you can probably figure out what happened.

01:05.920 --> 01:10.160
I married a really awesome guy and I wanted to get out of the place I was.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.400
So he got a job in Europe.

01:12.400 --> 01:13.600
I said I'd follow.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.720
I've learned Dutch.

01:14.720 --> 01:18.680
You can't really work in the hospital when you speak, don't speak the native language.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.640
So I sort of reverted back to something I did before I went into medicine,

01:21.640 --> 01:24.360
which was software engineering.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.520
These days, like almost three years later, I do speak Dutch and you can find me two days a week now

01:29.520 --> 01:33.920
at Rutter Damoressens Medical Center.

01:33.920 --> 01:39.680
So I think I know a little bit about this because I've helped create a lot of what I call

01:39.680 --> 01:43.840
phosphor docs and by that I mean free open source software meant to help medical staff

01:43.840 --> 01:48.280
accomplish medical research or treatment goals.

01:48.280 --> 01:57.800
So right now I work mostly on CVSL, which is sort of processing arterial spin labeled sequences

01:57.800 --> 02:01.600
and other sequences from brain MRIs.

02:01.600 --> 02:05.160
And that's really typical of what I do.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.680
Usually I'm working with radiological data, but not always.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.880
So an example where I did it is Resurf EMG.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.640
That was a project where I was the lead engineer because my center gave a grant to a group

02:15.040 --> 02:21.160
at U20 to work with Respiratory Surface Electromography.

02:21.160 --> 02:26.480
The grant ended, I guess, about a year ago, but recently I realized that the scientists

02:26.480 --> 02:31.000
and engineers I work with have actually had a couple releases since I left the project,

02:31.000 --> 02:36.480
so it's still going strong across a couple academic medical centers.

02:36.480 --> 02:45.520
So now I want to warn you a little bit if you're new to this area.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.800
If you get into this, you're going to be annoyed.

02:49.800 --> 02:55.920
So one thing I want to warn you about is that in hospitals and health systems, on average,

02:55.920 --> 02:59.920
we don't have the best computer scientists and software engineers.

02:59.920 --> 03:05.080
That is not always true, but maybe you could see that as a positive, right?

03:05.200 --> 03:10.480
Because if you know anything, you're going to come out looking like a hero.

03:10.480 --> 03:15.240
But seriously, I'm here to try and get more people who are really enthusiastic and into

03:15.240 --> 03:19.360
open source to think about doing these kinds of projects.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.840
Unfortunately, when you do this, if you work in a hospital, you're going to be at best

03:22.840 --> 03:25.000
outside of a hierarchy.

03:25.000 --> 03:29.160
At worst, you'll be on the bottom and people will treat you like the gum on their shoe.

03:29.160 --> 03:30.360
Okay?

03:30.360 --> 03:32.200
Just deal with it.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.560
That's part of the culture of medicine.

03:34.560 --> 03:38.640
It's a very strong culture.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.960
One of the things that distinguishes it is the language.

03:41.960 --> 03:46.560
I can tell you from experience, if you're sort of a math nerd like me, nobody's going

03:46.560 --> 03:47.560
to speak your language.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.920
Just as an example, a long time ago, when I started doing quantitative image analysis

03:51.920 --> 03:56.080
on radiological images, I tried to talk to one of my colleagues who was another doctor

03:56.080 --> 03:57.080
about it.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.080
I was just sort of going off about this and the dot product.

04:00.080 --> 04:02.960
He was like, wait, wait, wait.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.000
The matrix is like the matrix of the movie, right?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
He wasn't kidding.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.080
I mean, that's kind of just what you'll have to deal with.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.920
I want to add a couple final warnings.

04:14.920 --> 04:20.560
If you're truly hardcore into FOSS, you will just have to make peace that people in healthcare

04:20.560 --> 04:31.560
systems, they use all of these proprietary products when perfectly good FOSS is available.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.280
Part of that is trash issues.

04:33.280 --> 04:38.600
Part of that I really blame on us as FOSS creators because a lot of FOSS projects that

04:38.600 --> 04:42.160
are actually pretty good if you bother to read the code, just have a lack of swag and

04:42.160 --> 04:43.160
swagger.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.000
What do I mean by that?

04:45.000 --> 04:48.600
I brought an example.

04:48.600 --> 04:56.600
Locos, a little merch, make your thing stick in people's mind.

04:56.600 --> 05:03.240
If you push past all of this and you're creating software, there's a final thing I want to

05:03.240 --> 05:07.080
warn you about if you're working in a hospital system.

05:07.080 --> 05:12.880
Unfortunately, within the hospital bureaucracies and health system bureaucracies, there are

05:12.880 --> 05:18.200
some people with power and some pretty weird ideas about the possibilities and ways to

05:18.200 --> 05:21.000
make wealth through technology.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.400
At some point, like myself, you will run into people who tell you, no, you can't open source

05:26.400 --> 05:29.480
this because otherwise you won't have any money and we won't have any money and that

05:29.480 --> 05:31.400
thing will work.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.000
It's not that they're evil.

05:33.000 --> 05:40.080
It's just that they aren't aware of how these things can actually be viable.

05:40.080 --> 05:46.840
Just as one example, most hospital and health systems have some really kind of wackadoodle

05:46.840 --> 05:52.800
legacy systems that are all kind of joined together in a weird way in the hospital.

05:52.800 --> 05:58.920
If you do something that needs to harvest and move around data, then you can make FOS

05:58.920 --> 06:04.040
and also charge the hospitals just to customize what you made.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.040
This is just one model.

06:05.040 --> 06:10.000
I don't have time to get into all of them, but you have to tell people this because otherwise

06:10.000 --> 06:13.640
you'll just hit a hospital lawyer who says, no, no, no.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.680
You can't open source that.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.520
Now that I've told you about all of these things, I want to tell you why to do this

06:19.520 --> 06:22.480
anyways.

06:22.480 --> 06:27.840
The simple answer is it matters.

06:27.840 --> 06:32.440
I've seen so many bright minds like literal PhDs in physics go to startups where they

06:32.440 --> 06:37.720
do things that in my opinion don't matter as much like use neural nets on fashion on

06:37.720 --> 06:41.840
the internet, whatever.

06:41.840 --> 06:46.960
I tried this in a room of doctors and only one person got one of these.

06:46.960 --> 06:51.640
I'm curious if anyone will even guess I'll give you some merch.

06:51.640 --> 06:55.720
Can anyone identify either of these diseases?

06:55.720 --> 06:57.200
No.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.200
Okay.

06:58.200 --> 07:03.160
I'll give away a merch at random later.

07:03.160 --> 07:09.240
These diseases are diseases that we've had phenomenal success in getting the life expectancy

07:09.240 --> 07:10.240
up on.

07:10.240 --> 07:12.760
It's cystic fibrosis and sickle cell.

07:12.760 --> 07:19.200
Specifically, I can tell you in the case of sickle cell, or both of them obviously, 100

07:19.280 --> 07:22.840
years ago, computers and computer programmers were not part of the story.

07:22.840 --> 07:29.320
Today, especially in sickle cell, that curve is going up and that is powered by software.

07:29.320 --> 07:34.040
I can tell you that because I work with people who work specifically on this.

07:34.040 --> 07:38.200
There's also the international humanitarian angle.

07:38.200 --> 07:44.880
In my first slide, you saw me on the coast of Greece where I was part of an emergency

07:44.880 --> 07:46.520
volunteer crew.

07:46.520 --> 07:49.960
In those efforts, software actually plays a role because we have to do things like

07:49.960 --> 07:56.200
track infectious diseases that are coming from people and going places.

07:56.200 --> 08:01.080
You'll fight a strong culture in medicine, but you can win and you can do great things.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.520
You just need to come prepared.

08:04.520 --> 08:09.080
The three things at the top there, I think, are just non-negotiable.

08:09.080 --> 08:14.400
You might not have the funding to get all sorts of swag immediately, but for crying

08:14.400 --> 08:16.440
out loud, at least get a logo.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.600
I've seen so many beautiful projects that don't have a logo and they don't have the

08:20.600 --> 08:25.600
kind of person on them who will go out and speak about stuff and they don't get any use.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.600
They're going to die.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.160
The second thing is get a medical reader.

08:29.160 --> 08:34.280
Get an MD who doesn't hold that much to read your documentation and give you honest thoughts

08:34.280 --> 08:35.280
about it.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.840
You may end up, like I do, essentially splitting your documentation so there's a side for engineers

08:38.840 --> 08:43.000
and programmers and there's a side for doctors.

08:43.000 --> 08:48.680
The third thing, not as obvious, but probably the most important, is get your legal game

08:48.680 --> 08:50.160
going from day zero.

08:50.160 --> 08:54.920
So, I mean that for everyone, even if you don't touch a piece of patient data.

08:54.920 --> 09:00.440
If you touch patient data in Europe, yeah, GDPR, all of these things will come into play,

09:00.440 --> 09:08.440
but hospitals are large bureaucratic institutions, health systems, anything that touches health.

09:08.440 --> 09:12.240
Things like even getting the right contract may take months.

09:12.240 --> 09:16.280
But if you don't strain this out, you will end up with problems.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.800
So those three things are not optional in my opinion.

09:19.800 --> 09:24.040
As you move forward, get some videos.

09:24.040 --> 09:29.680
This is because, as doctors and other people of this type move higher in the hierarchy,

09:29.680 --> 09:34.000
they get less and less negative feedback and they sort of want to appear in charge of everything

09:34.000 --> 09:37.720
and they're not going to go to a meeting and tell you, I don't understand.

09:37.720 --> 09:41.160
Videos are something they can play in the privacy of their own home and learn what you're

09:41.200 --> 09:43.840
trying to tell them.

09:43.840 --> 09:48.840
Another thing that I think is really important, especially because I do signal processing,

09:48.840 --> 09:52.600
is getting more than one institution on board early.

09:52.600 --> 09:56.360
You will discover that algorithms you might be using at one institution might not work

09:56.360 --> 09:59.960
so well at another and it's better to discover that early.

09:59.960 --> 10:05.640
And of course, it's great if your team has a nice person you can send to meetings.

10:05.640 --> 10:10.200
And finally, once you've really built up what you're doing, please get a no-code interface

10:10.240 --> 10:15.680
because a lot of physicians are not even going to want to do as much as putting into two lines

10:15.680 --> 10:20.400
of command line and you will never convince them otherwise.

10:20.400 --> 10:26.320
So on a deep level, these things I'm talking about, they really have to do with culture.

10:26.320 --> 10:32.880
And when I think about culture, I sort of prefer the metaphor of water to fish, which

10:32.880 --> 10:35.480
I think it was an American writer came up with.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.720
You sort of don't know you're in it until you're out of it.

10:39.000 --> 10:49.080
And there are really different professional cultures between medicine and software engineering.

10:49.080 --> 10:53.320
One tiny example of that is how overloaded the terms are in computer science and software

10:53.320 --> 10:55.320
engineering, like correctness.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.520
I mean, how many things does Docker mean?

10:57.520 --> 11:04.120
I mean, like, this is just painful for me, even though I'm kind of part of both worlds.

11:04.120 --> 11:09.360
In the past year, I've gone to a bunch of things that were about diversity, and I sort

11:09.360 --> 11:19.240
of left annoyed, but they talked about breaking the world up into F-cultures and G-cultures.

11:19.240 --> 11:23.720
And they say F-cultures are hierarchical, conformist.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.920
They emphasize the group, and they're usually non-Western.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.920
These are cultures that, and now there are lines people think of as like exotic.

11:31.720 --> 11:35.120
Yeah, I've worked in the Western medical system for many, many years, and I could tell you

11:35.120 --> 11:36.840
that's medicine, OK?

11:39.040 --> 11:42.480
Now, there is a reason for that.

11:42.480 --> 11:46.600
We can't just all go our own way and do what we want, otherwise patients might start dying.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.280
So you have to learn to sort of navigate our culture.

11:54.280 --> 12:00.440
And unfortunately, you have to learn how to navigate your place in this hierarchy.

12:00.440 --> 12:03.800
So you have to be very respectful of those above you.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.880
You have to not sort of make them feel threatened.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.880
So give them their learning in smaller doses.

12:08.880 --> 12:09.880
I mentioned videos.

12:09.880 --> 12:14.160
The other thing that is super effective is to actually go sit with people.

12:14.160 --> 12:19.800
Even if they are like what we have in the Netherlands, technical physicians, they might

12:19.800 --> 12:21.640
not be so technical.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.520
Those people are supposed to be like halfway between an engineer and a doctor.

12:25.520 --> 12:29.840
You may have to sit with them and show them about something like as simple as command

12:29.840 --> 12:32.720
line that we're all very used to.

12:32.720 --> 12:37.600
But that helps because you get a sense of what they will be capable of dealing with.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.480
And you probably walk away and think, God, I just need to make a gooey because there's

12:41.480 --> 12:42.480
no hope.

12:42.480 --> 12:48.200
But you also get a sense when some of your nomenclature is unsettling for people.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.760
And it will be.

12:50.760 --> 12:55.560
And finally, please, worry about your legal issues.

12:55.560 --> 13:03.320
And make something shiny in the sense that it has a logo and it's well presented.

13:03.320 --> 13:06.640
So some final thoughts.

13:06.640 --> 13:13.920
I want to emphasize that there's a lot of unevenness in how software is sort of spreading

13:13.920 --> 13:14.920
across the world.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.880
And I've worked in places like Haiti.

13:17.880 --> 13:23.440
I've interacted with professionals in several African countries.

13:23.440 --> 13:25.360
Software is spreading.

13:25.360 --> 13:31.920
And unfortunately, it's often proprietary software.

13:31.920 --> 13:37.600
And this is really terrible because what you see is when big companies, just to give an

13:37.600 --> 13:45.880
example like Microsoft, sort of move in, they often set up systems intentionally or not

13:45.880 --> 13:51.680
that make a sort of vendor lock in inevitable that the health data in the system becomes

13:51.680 --> 13:57.640
so fused that the institutions, the hospitals just can't get away from this stuff.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.560
It's like sticky.

14:00.560 --> 14:07.080
So I think it would be great if people who made FOS sort of got there first and get their

14:07.080 --> 14:10.840
shiny in a way that builds trust.

14:10.840 --> 14:21.440
So I hope I've convinced you either to think about this or maybe to sort of up your game

14:21.480 --> 14:23.520
if you're in this area.

14:23.520 --> 14:27.280
And if you have any questions, you can send them to me.

14:27.280 --> 14:33.520
My email at the Science Center is right on the bottom line.

14:33.520 --> 14:34.520
And that's it.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.600
Thank you.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.600
Thank you.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.600
Thank you.
