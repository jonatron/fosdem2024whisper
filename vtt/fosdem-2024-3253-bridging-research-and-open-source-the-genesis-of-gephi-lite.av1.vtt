WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
All right.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
Well, thank you everyone for having us.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
So I am Paul.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
I am from Westware, a company based in North in France,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
together with Alexi and Benoit.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
We have the full team here in front of you.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
And we are going to talk about software,

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
JFE Lite, web applications to analyze network online.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
But we will be more talking about the genesis of this open source project,

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
which is very linked to academia as you will see.

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Okay, let's get started.

00:41.000 --> 00:48.000
So we are going to present the history of how we ended up creating this software.

00:48.000 --> 00:52.000
The first point started in 2007,

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
where in a university, in University of Technologie de Compiência in France,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
a professor called Frank Gitala, who is actually a linguist,

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
started to do research on mapping the web.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
Looking at the web as a space of documents,

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
and I see how we can actually study that.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Together with Mathieu Jacomi, with there,

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
they created a session called Web Atlas to start creating tools

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
and do research on mapping the web.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Mathieu created the first prototype, which is called Graphilte,

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
to depict the network as you can see in the screenshot.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.000
One year after that, still based in academia,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
a research project called TIC Migrations,

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
led by Don Adiminescu, a sociologist.

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
They wanted to study how my immigrants keep a link to their home country using the web.

01:47.000 --> 01:52.000
To be able to do this study, they created the first version of Gefi,

01:52.000 --> 01:55.000
Gefi being a desktop application,

01:55.000 --> 02:03.000
coding Java to actually create maps of nodes connected by edges, a network.

02:03.000 --> 02:10.000
One year later, in 2009, they actually published a paper in the ICWSM,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
which is a big conference of computational social media.

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
This paper, actually, it was a poster, as you can see in the picture.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.000
This is Mathieu Bastion, one of the lead devs of Gefi software.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
This paper actually won the Test of Time Award,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
which is an award for the most cited paper.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
It's not a paper, it's a poster, actually, but still.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
Ten years later, this paper has been very cited a lot.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
Sorry.

02:41.000 --> 02:50.000
Gefi, at that time, was really used a lot to create maps that you could print,

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
or even step on, as you can see in those pictures,

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
because it's a huge map of words, and you can actually explore it with your feet.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Thank you.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
So, at this point, we're in 2010,

03:04.000 --> 03:10.000
and we start to see infographics on the Guardian's website, on the New York Times website,

03:10.000 --> 03:13.000
and it's kind of the beginning of the data-vis online era.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
And researchers and people who use Gefi want to actually share the networks online.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.000
At this point, I'm a student at the University of Technology at Compiègne,

03:25.000 --> 03:31.000
and one of the best solutions to actually do things interactively online is Flash.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.000
So, I start developing solutions for Gefi users to actually share JXF.

03:36.000 --> 03:41.000
JXF is a graph exchange format, actually.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
That's how Gefi exports networks.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And there's various experiments on this,

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
and they're up on Sigma, which means simple graph mapper, actually,

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
though the weird case thing is.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
And in the same time, people from Gefi actually find a pretty good solution to share networks online.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
The idea is to generate a very large, very big picture,

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
and to use C-Dragon, which is a technology at this point that has been replaced later by Open C-Dragon.

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
Basically, it works like in a cartography software.

04:15.000 --> 04:22.000
You can zoom in and see better resolutions images while you zoom, etc.

04:22.000 --> 04:27.000
And this works well, but you have no interactive feature, but at least you can share things online.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
Also, another researcher, Raphael Welt, who is working at Erie in Paris,

04:33.000 --> 04:42.000
develops Geixf.js, which is the first full-featured application to actually zoom in a network online,

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
have the mini-map, a search field, information about the nodes you select, etc.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
And it still works today, which is kind of amazing.

04:53.000 --> 05:01.000
And that's the first step into real, enhanced navigation in graphs online.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
Also, multiple people work on JavaScript graph rendering engines.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
So there's Protovis, which has been replaced by D3.js,

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
which has become a very successful library to render all kinds of graphics online.

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
So I started working on the first version of Sigma in JavaScript.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
And at this point, some people from the Oxford Internet Institute

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
bind all of this together by developing this Sigma.js exporter,

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
which is still kind of used like two or three years ago.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
There were still publications based on that.

05:36.000 --> 05:44.000
And that's it. People can successfully share the networks online after Jaffy, basically.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
So let's move on. So the next step is start in 2013.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
And it's about exploring those networks online.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
This only starts with another research lab, which is the Sciences Po Media Lab,

05:56.000 --> 06:02.000
in which I was part of this team, and Alexi too, actually, for many years.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
And starting in 2013, Alexi joined the team.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
And Sciences Po Media Lab was actually, the mission was actually to help social scientists

06:12.000 --> 06:18.000
to actually use digital methods, either data, but also tools.

06:18.000 --> 06:25.000
And so one of the research we've been conducting in this lab was to try to see

06:25.000 --> 06:32.000
how we can use a network math and analysis by studying pictures.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
As you can see on this picture, we call that the visual network analysis,

06:35.000 --> 06:43.000
where we really think that, like Tufta introduced in the statistics,

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
how we can actually use the picture as a way to analyze your corpus.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
And to do that, we needed to actually go even further in developing ways

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
to produce those pictures and to interact with it online.

06:59.000 --> 07:07.000
So we worked on SigmaJS to publish a V1, which was much more a performance.

07:07.000 --> 07:14.000
And right after, we did integrate this library into another research tool called HIFE,

07:14.000 --> 07:20.000
which is a web caller dedicated for social sciences, kind of.

07:20.000 --> 07:25.000
And as you can see, this tool was really key.

07:25.000 --> 07:33.000
SigmaJS was really key to actually embed the social network analysis right in the tool

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
that we were producing in the lab.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
We also created other lots of different tools, like many lines,

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
which was more rooted into pedagogy issues.

07:46.000 --> 07:50.000
The idea was you could create a slideshow directly with a network on it,

07:50.000 --> 07:56.000
and you could actually, each slide was defined by the way you can filter, zoom in in your network.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
And that was a proof of concept of how you can actually guide your audience through analyzing a network.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
This work has been presented for them, actually.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
So at this point, we have a lot of tooling to rendering graphs online,

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
and the next step is kind of to work more on manipulating graphs online.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
I mean, one of the things that Jeffy does well is computing things,

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
like page rank, centrality, clustering algorithms, and this kind of things.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.000
So the first big step in this direction is from Biomplik in the room as well,

08:33.000 --> 08:37.000
who also started working on Sigma in 2013.

08:37.000 --> 08:43.000
And he develops this JavaScript library that allows handling networks as a data structure.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.000
And within the library, there's lots of standard algorithms.

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
So it's easy in graphology to compute a page rank, to compute various metrics,

08:51.000 --> 08:57.000
but also to render some layout algorithms, so not rendering, sorry, to compute layout algorithms,

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
like the position of the nodes in a graph.

08:59.000 --> 09:08.000
All the things that Jeffy does well, graphology starts to mimic it, basically, in computing side.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.000
And we start thinking of Sigma as just a rendering engine that would be based on graphology,

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
so that we don't have to take care of computing things in a rendering library.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.000
Mathieu develops graph recipes, which is yet another tool to actually generate renderings of graphs online,

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
but this one is a bit different instead of having those applications that look like Jeffy.

09:32.000 --> 09:37.000
Here you actually script, graphology, and get an image output.

09:37.000 --> 09:45.000
And this allows having kind of crazy things like heat maps or...

09:45.000 --> 09:50.000
...area diagrams, I don't know how to call this, or kind of circles around areas, etc.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.000
And this is really a new approach on all those tools.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.000
Also, there's Minivan, which is yet another application online to actually start exploring networks

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
that uses graphology and Sigma, etc.

10:05.000 --> 10:09.000
And yeah, at this point... I forgot this one.

10:09.000 --> 10:21.000
And Guillaume also develops Ipy Sigma, which is a binding to display Sigma networks in Jupyter notebooks.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
And this has been quite popular as well.

10:23.000 --> 10:29.000
So graphology is more and more used, and yeah, at this point, really, we can do lots of things

10:29.000 --> 10:37.000
in well applications on the graph computing and rendering.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
And so our last step in our history starts in 2019.

10:41.000 --> 10:48.000
So as Alex just said, at that point we had a lot of different tools to do lots of different network analyses

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
in lots of different contexts.

10:50.000 --> 10:59.000
But from there, we still don't have a generic graph network editing tool online.

10:59.000 --> 11:08.000
But from 2019 started some convergences to actually go into the directions.

11:08.000 --> 11:17.000
So actually Alex and Mathieu and Eduardo with another dev of Gefi did a presentation here in POSM

11:17.000 --> 11:24.000
trying to explain how contexts of doing network utilization from a Java desktop application

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
or from a JavaScript web browser based one are really two different contexts

11:29.000 --> 11:38.000
where you can't hope to achieve as much precise or scaling memory management in the web browser

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
for many different reasons.

11:41.000 --> 11:49.000
Yet right after some guys from MediaLabsence were still, so Guillaume and also Robert,

11:49.000 --> 11:55.000
did this prototype, a hidden one actually, that you probably never heard of, Nancy,

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
which was actually mimicking Gefi editing tools.

11:58.000 --> 12:05.000
So in that tool, you start having like you load a file, you can render the layout,

12:05.000 --> 12:09.000
you can change the color, you can actually edit your map clearly.

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
So we start this paved way to having a really editing network experience on the web browser.

12:17.000 --> 12:23.000
But at the same time, we three of us actually ended up creating Westwares,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
this company we are in for many different reasons.

12:26.000 --> 12:32.000
I have no time to stay here, but still we ended up creating this place where one of our main skills

12:32.000 --> 12:36.000
of this team is managing networks in web application.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
So we were lucky to have clients paying us to do that, to integrate all those technologies

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
we talked about into custom web application for them.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
While doing so, we just made all those tools much better and better.

12:51.000 --> 12:57.000
And so for instance, still thanks to our friends from Sianxpom Media Lab,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
we published a new version of Sigma.js, for instance, the V2.

13:02.000 --> 13:09.000
And also sometimes to that, another researcher, Thomas Venturini, sociologist,

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
paid us to actually create yet another tool to share with Network Online.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
And we call that one Retina.

13:16.000 --> 13:23.000
It's really like we try to do that with all the features that we wanted to be there

13:23.000 --> 13:30.000
to make it easy to search, to filter, to manipulate a network as a document.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
You don't edit the network here, you share it.

13:33.000 --> 13:42.000
But right after in the same year, we were to this event here, the GIFI Week 2022,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
which was actually organized by Mathieu.

13:44.000 --> 13:50.000
So it's a social event to gather the community of developers around the GIFI community,

13:50.000 --> 13:56.000
and so we joined this week and we proposed the community to bootstrap this project

13:56.000 --> 13:59.000
of mimicking GIFI on the web.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
So what is GIFI Lite?

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
It's kind of GIFI on the web, but lighter.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
So we just like, we put ourselves together and we said, what makes GIFI GIFI?

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
And we picked the main features like we need to be able to actually customize the appearance

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
of my nodes and edges because it's a mapping application basically.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
And we need to be able to actually modify the position of my nodes

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
because this is a mapping application again.

14:31.000 --> 14:39.000
So we picked all of those features and we kind of decided to design simpler versions of them

14:39.000 --> 14:43.000
and versions of them that we could implement in the web applications basically.

14:44.000 --> 14:50.000
And the good thing with the web application part is that it's just a full client web application.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
It's just some JavaScript and HTML file.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
It's very portable.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.000
Once your browser loads it, it just runs inside your browser.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Your browser kind of becomes GIFI Lite.

15:02.000 --> 15:07.000
If you need to have custom features for yourself and fork it, you can just deploy it on your domain.

15:07.000 --> 15:15.000
And people actually already did this in DMI at Amsterdam and Cortex in Paris, both research programs kind of.

15:16.000 --> 15:20.000
And yeah, let's dive just straight into it.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
So this is what GIFI Lite looks like.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
So for people familiar with GIFI, it's kind of the same thing.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.000
I mean, the center of it is a map of my network.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And I will load a network.

15:35.000 --> 15:43.000
This network is actually the network of the people, the tools, the conferences and the institutions that we discussed in this presentation.

15:43.000 --> 15:51.000
So as a GIFI user, I will start by computing things like, yeah, let's see how the nodes do group with each other.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
So this is a community detection algorithm.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
I have a new modularity class attribute in my data.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
So I can render it.

16:01.000 --> 16:07.000
I can go to appearance and say, okay, I want to see the colors of my nodes by modularity class.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Okay, but it's still a bit messy.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
So I'm going to change the position of my nodes.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
I can start by putting them on a circle, for instance.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I don't know.

16:17.000 --> 16:24.000
And then maybe run some physics algorithm that has been fully designed inside GIFI.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
It exists in graphology.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
So we put it back in GIFI Lite.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
Yeah, okay.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
First, I can just stop it.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
It starts to look like a map.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
That's nice.

16:39.000 --> 16:42.000
Also, here, so I see my communities.

16:42.000 --> 16:49.000
There's this purple community, which is about kind of us, actually, westward and Sigma.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
There's this media lab community.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
There's this original GIFI community.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
So, okay, that's nice, but I want to see the type of my nodes, actually.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
So what if I put the type as the color of my nodes?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
Did that work?

17:05.000 --> 17:06.000
Okay, yeah.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
I have all these purple that are softwares, purple nodes.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Blue nodes are papers.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
Okay.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
I see the enterprises, the events.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
That's nice.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
I can also maybe set the color of my nodes.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
Sorry?

17:23.000 --> 17:26.000
Size of my nodes?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Oh, that's big.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.000
So let's put lower things.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
I don't know.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Okay, that works well.

17:32.000 --> 17:40.000
And at the end, since it's GIFI and it aims to actually generate a picture, I'm just going to export the file as a PNG file.

17:40.000 --> 17:45.000
Okay, I won't click on it because it's going to lose the context of the browser.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I prefer to stay in it.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
Also, I can filter.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
That's interesting.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
I can filter on nodes.

17:53.000 --> 18:02.000
The easiest thing would be to actually display the start range and to redo the whole presentation, but here.

18:02.000 --> 18:10.000
So it all starts in 2007 with Web Atlas, Mathieu Jacomi and Fran Guittara.

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
And yeah, one year later, they built this thing called GIFI.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000
And one year later, I start working on weird flash applications.

18:20.000 --> 18:30.000
And then at some point, those two clusters are joined by SigmaJS and the GIFI SigmaExporter and so on and so on.

18:30.000 --> 18:42.000
Also, one interesting thing in this network is if I come here and I search for FOSDEM, I can actually see that if I select all nodes.

18:42.000 --> 18:51.000
There are 10 confrontations in the 12 or 13 past years that have been done in FOSDEM to present all those tools and all this context.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
So yeah, it's been a long run.

19:01.000 --> 19:10.000
Yeah, so as a wrap up, so at the end, what's all of us creating this GIFI Lite software?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
So the first thing is like, we were about to do that.

19:13.000 --> 19:18.000
Thanks to the very vibrant and brilliant community around the GIFI software.

19:18.000 --> 19:39.000
In this community, you can find academic people, you can find developers, some designers too, and also small experiments and prototypes that have been produced along the way helped us actually to make also the ecosystem of libraries and the thing better till we could actually at the end create this tool.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
Also, well, this is what I just said.

19:43.000 --> 19:51.000
Yeah, thanks to Internet Archive, actually, which helped us a lot finding traces of old forgotten prototypes.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
And the web is an amazing platform.

19:54.000 --> 20:05.000
It was easy, really easy for us to actually create this tool to put it online with all the web capabilities of the features we have now.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
And of course, as I said, many of those tools exist.

20:10.000 --> 20:19.000
Actually, all of them mainly exist because they are rooted into academic needs, also design and support.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.000
A lot of money and time come from academic projects in this story.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
We are a company.

20:28.000 --> 20:41.000
And so we have some customers that are from academic but also some which are not from and also customers also hire us to make also ecosystem of tools better and better.

20:41.000 --> 20:46.000
So we also benefited from having our customers paying us to make that happen.

20:47.000 --> 20:57.000
And the last tribute goes to FOSDEM as Alex said before, because this place is very important place actually to share all those ideas.

20:57.000 --> 21:09.000
And new prototypes and just emulate all those energy to all going into developing open research tools.

21:09.000 --> 21:26.000
Because when you are really looking at how we do research, you, well, I've been trained with Bonilla tool, for instance, to understand how crucial are those tools that manipulate knowledge to create or to do research.

21:26.000 --> 21:39.000
And those tools needs to be open to really assure that all the transformation of fact till knowledge is reversible and questionable.

21:39.000 --> 21:47.000
So we are very happy to provide the community with the new tools, the Giffy Light, and we hope that it will meet also needs you might have.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
Thank you.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
So we have time for questions.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.000
Do you have any questions?

22:26.000 --> 22:35.000
I actually added graphs, meaning, you know, connecting information, looking together, like even joint collaborative editing.

22:35.000 --> 22:48.000
Do you have any easier tools to allow people to collaborate online to, you know, do journalistic research or do you have any new medities or things like that?

22:48.000 --> 22:58.000
Yeah, so the question was, we talk about editing networks, but we only talked, we only demode editing the visual aspects of the visualization.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
Actually, this network we showed you has been created inside Giffy Light.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
So we can, you can create nodes.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
You have a graph on the here.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
You can create edges, of course.

23:09.000 --> 23:14.000
So you need to select a source by searching into your networks and targets.

23:15.000 --> 23:23.000
And so we actually, so we have to say that we, we did a new iteration of work on Giffy this week.

23:23.000 --> 23:28.000
And we added, we're making those addition, that addition features much better for this.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
Do you actually want to add a photo of the egg nodes visually and drag edges?

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Yeah, you can drag, you can also drag nodes.

23:34.000 --> 23:37.000
I don't know, you can't create an edge on the stage.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
That could be done.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
But for the second part of the question was, can you also do that collaboratively?

23:43.000 --> 23:48.000
So this is going to be more difficult because since it's all based in the broader,

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
making collaborative features, we'll ask you to have a server and to have WebSocket and everything,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
which is a brand new thing.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
But you could use the interface and fork and see.

23:59.000 --> 24:06.000
We actually worked on one of the biggest projects we've worked on those last years is actually what you're describing.

24:06.000 --> 24:10.000
Like this, but with a backend and collaborative features.

24:10.000 --> 24:14.000
And it's named GraphCommons, but it's not open source.

24:14.000 --> 24:18.000
But a good example for that.

24:18.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah, yeah, no, this collateral, yeah, Giffy Lite is just in the browser right now.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
The one, another question, yeah.

24:29.000 --> 24:33.000
So I really enjoyed the community mapping part of this.

24:33.000 --> 24:39.000
And I'm wondering if you could speak to metrics and measurement.

24:39.000 --> 24:51.000
How have you seen this used to analyze communities and actually pushed community development strategy using Giffy Lite?

24:51.000 --> 24:56.000
So the question was how I tried to rephrase it.

24:56.000 --> 25:03.000
In which extent can you work on community detection and with community statistics inside Giffy Lite?

25:03.000 --> 25:12.000
So the answer is for now, well, here you will find all the algorithm statistics that are available in the Graphology library,

25:12.000 --> 25:19.000
which is JavaScript based library to work on statistics on algorithm on networks.

25:19.000 --> 25:24.000
So far about community detection, we have Louvain only.

25:24.000 --> 25:34.000
But I mean, as long as we develop new algorithm in Graphology, it will be easy to port it inside this tool.

25:34.000 --> 25:41.000
Yeah, it's kind of a modular way to take it.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Yeah.

25:44.000 --> 25:49.000
I was wondering what has been your publication strategy to support this work?

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
Particularly, do you target graph conferences?

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
Is it more successful to target graph conferences or social sciences conferences?

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
That's a good question.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.000
So the question was what was the strategy for communicating around the tool?

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
Actually, we don't have a strategy.

26:08.000 --> 26:14.000
So basically, you see that actually the Giffy desktop software was presented at ICWSM,

26:14.000 --> 26:18.000
which is definitely a social network analysis discipline, kind of.

26:18.000 --> 26:26.000
We are not from academia and for them is one of our place of choice to communicate about what we do.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
But yeah, so I'm a bit short, actually, to answer you.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
Last question?

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
Have you looked at new renderers for Graphology?

26:43.000 --> 26:49.000
And also, in this slide, the addition to all that things like how and the numbers of such,

26:49.000 --> 26:54.000
do you consider including those in the range of them?

26:54.000 --> 26:57.000
You can send the pull request.

26:57.000 --> 27:03.000
There are other developers who have developed other rendering algorithms around Graphology,

27:03.000 --> 27:11.000
outside of Sigma to render more complex things such as hit maps or halos around the nodes, et cetera.

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
Benjamin was asking if we are planning to actually integrate those features inside Jaffy Lite.

27:17.000 --> 27:31.000
One answer is that contrary to Jaffy Lite, which shows that what you see here is actually the preview of the export,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
yet you will do it as an image.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000
So right now, no.

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000
It has to be done in Sigma to be rendered in Jaffy Lite.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
Thank you very much.
