00:00.000 --> 00:06.680
Thanks for coming to this talk.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.600
I know it's the last one of the day in this room,

00:08.600 --> 00:09.680
so I'm sure we're all tired.

00:09.680 --> 00:11.520
I'll get through as quickly as possible.

00:11.520 --> 00:13.600
But yeah, essentially my name is Gabriel.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.280
I am a tech lead on the innovation studios working on

00:16.280 --> 00:18.480
a project called Formuleic,

00:18.480 --> 00:20.960
but more on that later within Mozilla.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.920
This presentation is all about,

00:22.920 --> 00:24.520
yeah, as we just mentioned,

00:24.520 --> 00:26.760
why intelligence is tricky and how to integrate

00:26.760 --> 00:29.480
LLMs in standard code.

00:29.480 --> 00:32.760
So I guess this probably makes sense to start with the definition.

00:32.760 --> 00:34.840
So LLM, probably a term you've heard a lot throughout

00:34.840 --> 00:37.440
this conference, is essentially a large language model,

00:37.440 --> 00:39.840
and that is a program that can

00:39.840 --> 00:44.600
naturally understand human text and do something with it

00:44.600 --> 00:46.800
that a traditional program cannot.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.560
So just to reiterate that,

00:49.560 --> 00:53.000
it's essentially a program that doesn't need a specific syntax,

00:53.000 --> 00:55.200
it just works with natural language,

00:55.320 --> 00:57.080
which is actually pretty interesting when you think about it.

00:57.080 --> 00:58.880
Actually, I had a question for the audience,

00:58.880 --> 01:04.320
who here has played around with chat GPT or other chat bots or LLMs?

01:04.320 --> 01:06.440
Literally everyone has their hand up.

01:06.440 --> 01:08.040
I was the opposite, who didn't?

01:08.040 --> 01:12.040
Yeah, but who found that actually useful?

01:12.040 --> 01:14.520
And just put everyone too, awesome.

01:14.520 --> 01:17.360
Okay, just about, not everybody literally.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.320
Yeah, so just before we get started too deeply,

01:20.320 --> 01:21.840
I just wanted to make mention that there's

01:21.840 --> 01:23.720
a lot of terminology in the space.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.600
Everything has a name, a definition, and lots of weird words.

01:27.600 --> 01:32.440
So apologize in advance if I don't explain every one of those words,

01:32.440 --> 01:34.640
just there's so much going on in such a short talk.

01:34.640 --> 01:39.080
So yeah, so as we all just learned,

01:39.080 --> 01:41.000
everybody thinks it's kind of useful.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.080
I also think LLMs actually have utility and are quite useful.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.440
These are just two random examples I pulled up,

01:47.440 --> 01:50.800
but essentially LLMs can help categorize content,

01:50.800 --> 01:53.160
answer questions, provide summaries,

01:53.160 --> 01:56.200
help create content, and structure unstructured data,

01:56.200 --> 01:57.440
and plenty of other things.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.440
They're essentially the proverbial hammer in the toolbox.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.520
They can kind of do anything you want them to do.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.320
Doesn't mean you should be using them necessarily,

02:04.320 --> 02:07.200
but you can do it.

02:07.200 --> 02:11.000
So I think it'd be appropriate just to have a quick example

02:11.000 --> 02:13.360
of a traditional app that is not intelligent,

02:13.360 --> 02:15.120
and then what it looks like when you add intelligence,

02:15.120 --> 02:18.080
and just how easy it can be once you get things set up.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.760
So in this case, we have a node application,

02:20.760 --> 02:22.920
just takes unstructured text from a user,

02:22.920 --> 02:25.160
and stores it in a database unless you use a retreat.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.520
Nothing special.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.520
But then when we add an LLM, for example,

02:28.520 --> 02:31.480
we can then take this unstructured information,

02:31.480 --> 02:33.000
craft a little prompt for it, a prompt

02:33.000 --> 02:34.840
is just an instruction for the LLM,

02:34.840 --> 02:36.720
and then get the LLMs to return something

02:36.720 --> 02:39.040
quite unique or useful to us.

02:39.040 --> 02:41.800
In this case, the LLM output is a category

02:41.800 --> 02:43.640
of what the node could actually be called,

02:43.640 --> 02:45.400
and that helps with organizational structure

02:45.400 --> 02:47.400
things in the database.

02:47.400 --> 02:51.200
And this is amazing, but let's be real.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.640
There are some issues over this technology.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.080
It is not perfect, unfortunately.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.680
It's also very young, to be fair.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.640
So yeah, so what are some of the issues

03:00.640 --> 03:03.760
that you can see when you interact with this technology?

03:03.760 --> 03:05.520
It includes hallucinations, a.k.a.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.160
it just makes things up.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.600
It likes to lie sometimes.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.120
It's not great.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.920
But also inconsistent format.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.040
So when you're in code, you can imagine

03:14.040 --> 03:17.120
you want to talk to your services, your APIs,

03:17.120 --> 03:20.520
in a structured format, and LLMs like to not necessarily

03:20.520 --> 03:22.120
listen to that format, and they'll reply with,

03:22.120 --> 03:23.560
instead of JSON, it could be marked down,

03:23.560 --> 03:26.880
or broken attributes, or things that just don't make sense.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.720
So that takes a lot of hand-holding and validation.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.080
There's also the performance and cost aspect

03:32.080 --> 03:34.280
of running these services are quite computationally

03:34.280 --> 03:38.760
expensive, and we all know GTs are expensive and scarce.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.920
Fundamentally, there is also text account limitations

03:40.920 --> 03:42.480
that you can only interact with these LLMs

03:42.480 --> 03:44.600
with a certain amount of text before sort of forgetting

03:44.600 --> 03:48.080
what you actually asked it to do, which kind of sucks.

03:48.120 --> 03:52.320
There's also a education and documentation kind of lack

03:52.320 --> 03:54.840
thereof, especially for open models.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.080
So that's something that takes a lot of learning

03:57.080 --> 03:58.800
and trial and error to do.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.720
Lastly, there's friction points that

04:00.720 --> 04:02.240
include bugs and security issues.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.880
So this is, again, a new technology.

04:03.880 --> 04:04.800
Of course, there's going to be bugs,

04:04.800 --> 04:06.960
and of course, there's going to be security implications

04:06.960 --> 04:09.360
that need to be thought of.

04:09.360 --> 04:14.320
And what's particularly crazy is that there is actually

04:14.320 --> 04:18.000
over 50,000 text models on Hugging Face at the moment.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.560
And there's so much choice in so many models out there.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.960
It's actually quite hard to understand

04:21.960 --> 04:25.920
how to gauge which ones are good.

04:25.920 --> 04:30.560
And on top of that, there is also a ton of licensing

04:30.560 --> 04:32.400
across these models, and that also complicates

04:32.400 --> 04:35.520
how you can select and choose which models to actually use.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.240
But there's actually more models, of course.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.120
There are the proprietary and closed models

04:40.120 --> 04:44.240
that are ever so popular as these little diagrams pictures

04:44.240 --> 04:45.320
show.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.840
These models are popular for a reason, though,

04:46.840 --> 04:49.840
because it is exceptionally straightforward and easy

04:49.840 --> 04:52.600
once you add your credit card to get these systems working

04:52.600 --> 04:54.960
without having to think too hard about these models.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.520
And that has some consequences.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.560
The main consequence, though, is it kind of creates

05:01.560 --> 05:03.520
a technical vendor lock-in.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.120
These models all interact with these prompts,

05:06.120 --> 05:07.160
as we just saw.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.400
But those prompts essentially have

05:08.400 --> 05:11.440
to be curated to the model to get the actual value.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.160
So you can imagine you write a bunch of prompts

05:13.160 --> 05:15.000
for one proprietary model, and now you

05:15.040 --> 05:17.560
expect to run those exact same prompts in an open one,

05:17.560 --> 05:19.360
and you don't get the same results.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.880
So this is like a key friction point for open models,

05:21.880 --> 05:23.280
because there's not so many examples.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.480
There's not so much documentation around these what

05:25.480 --> 05:26.960
prompts work and why.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.360
And then when you do run a prompt that you already had,

05:29.360 --> 05:30.080
it doesn't work.

05:30.080 --> 05:32.760
And then you just stop using that model, for example.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.680
So this is just a quick little demo.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.480
Two of these models, one of them is open,

05:36.480 --> 05:37.880
the other one not so much.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.880
They replied with a relatively good answer.

05:40.880 --> 05:43.040
Whereas the other model in the middle just decided

05:43.080 --> 05:43.840
it didn't want to do it.

05:46.840 --> 05:50.760
So the reality is, if you actually tweak the prompts

05:50.760 --> 05:53.120
and you add a little clarity and you write the prompt

05:53.120 --> 05:55.200
to the model, regardless of the model,

05:55.200 --> 05:57.720
you can see that the responses were actually

05:57.720 --> 05:59.840
really consistent and really good.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.760
So it's quite interesting to see how,

06:01.760 --> 06:03.640
with a little bit of effort, a little bit of elbow grease,

06:03.640 --> 06:06.080
if you will, you can get something that's considered,

06:06.080 --> 06:08.880
maybe not the prime model, to still output something

06:08.880 --> 06:09.640
that's still useful.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.240
And that's where my team and project come in.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.600
So Formuleic, today's our public announcement,

06:14.600 --> 06:16.760
if you will, so it's kind of exciting,

06:16.760 --> 06:19.640
is going to help or try to help anyway.

06:19.640 --> 06:24.960
Create a platform for open prompt scripts

06:24.960 --> 06:26.960
that anyone can interact with.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.360
They're open by default.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.360
And we'll help enable the creation, sharing,

06:31.360 --> 06:33.280
and testing of these different prompts

06:33.280 --> 06:34.080
against different models.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.520
And of course, we're still in super active development,

06:37.520 --> 06:40.160
and we would love to get your opinion as we're

06:40.160 --> 06:42.360
building out these repositories here.

06:42.360 --> 06:46.840
So please don't hesitate after this talk to say hello.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.680
Yeah, so that's my super quick talk.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.480
Please find out more about us online.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.480
And yeah, that's it.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.480
I still have like four key steps to do.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.480
So where am I headed to with the questions?

07:00.480 --> 07:02.480
Don't hesitate.

07:02.480 --> 07:03.480
Yes.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.480
Do you have already some plans on how to integrate LLMs

07:14.480 --> 07:15.480
and tides?

07:15.480 --> 07:17.480
Yeah, I think we have a lot of questions.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.480
I think we have a lot of questions.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.480
Do you have already some plans on how to integrate LLMs

07:23.480 --> 07:27.480
and tides, Mozilla tools like Firefox?

07:27.480 --> 07:31.480
So it's a question like, are we thinking about adding LLMs

07:31.480 --> 07:34.480
to Firefox?

07:34.480 --> 07:37.480
Honestly, I'm not too sure what the long term plans are.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.480
I know there are people obviously playing around

07:39.480 --> 07:41.480
with the technology, but I don't think there's anything

07:41.480 --> 07:43.480
officially on the books.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.480
It doesn't mean you can't add it to your own version of Firefox.

07:45.480 --> 07:46.480
So I'm just saying.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.480
Anyone else?

07:51.480 --> 07:53.480
Don't be shy.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.480
We are good then.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.480
You, we are closing.
