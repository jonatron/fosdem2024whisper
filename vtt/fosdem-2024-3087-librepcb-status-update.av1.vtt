00:00.000 --> 00:12.440
Hello everyone, my name is Wurl van Bruin, I'm the founder and main developer of LibrePCB

00:12.440 --> 00:18.840
and today I will give you a short update about the LibrePCB project.

00:18.840 --> 00:25.000
So for those who do not know LibrePCB yet, it's an open source EDI software to draw

00:25.000 --> 00:34.600
schematics and design PCB and the main goal is the same as KitKat but there are some differences

00:34.600 --> 00:42.760
and of course it is a cross-platform, it runs on almost every computer, Windows, Linux, MacOS

00:42.760 --> 00:51.680
and more and its main goal is actually to make creating hardware easy, efficient and more or

00:51.680 --> 00:59.400
less foolproof with an intuitive user interface and powerful architectural concepts.

00:59.400 --> 01:07.240
So while the intuitive UI is especially helpful for beginners to get started easily with PCB design,

01:07.240 --> 01:15.240
it's also intended for professional users, for example who care about things like a same file

01:15.240 --> 01:21.000
format or a command line interface to automate some tasks.

01:22.560 --> 01:31.160
So let's take a look at what happened in the past one or two years because there are some great news.

01:31.160 --> 01:39.760
Especially at the end of 2022, it was an exciting moment because I started to work full-time on LibrePCB,

01:40.000 --> 01:48.760
now doing it for a bit more than a year and of course this leads to a lot more progress than in the many, many years before.

01:50.760 --> 02:00.240
In addition, the LibrePCB project has been approved by the NLNet Foundation to receive funding through the Next Generation Internet Program,

02:00.240 --> 02:04.440
which helps a lot to keep the full-time development ongoing.

02:05.440 --> 02:15.120
Then our fabrication service got PCBWay as a new manufacturing partner, so if you order PCB through LibrePCB Fab,

02:15.120 --> 02:18.120
you can now choose between ASLER and PCBWay.

02:21.120 --> 02:26.960
Also, I'm very proud to have several new sponsors on board from last year,

02:26.960 --> 02:32.120
BitelÃ© Electronics, NextPCB PartStack, PCBGogo and WinZorz.

02:32.800 --> 02:42.800
Last but not least, there are many individuals supporting the LibrePCB project with donations or other kinds of contributions,

02:42.800 --> 02:49.800
for example translations or creating libraries and so on.

02:49.800 --> 02:59.800
So with these sponsorships and the donations, the LibrePCB project raised around $8,000 in 2023.

03:00.480 --> 03:09.480
In my opinion, that's already quite amazing for this relatively still early state of the project.

03:09.480 --> 03:20.480
So at this point, I want to thank all the supporters and contributors and for your trust in the LibrePCB project.

03:20.480 --> 03:27.480
So this really makes me happy and thank you very much for this support.

03:28.160 --> 03:37.160
I take this as a sign that the LibrePCB is on the right way, so I hope it's okay to continue this way.

03:39.160 --> 03:47.160
Nevertheless, it's still a very long way to go until we have a stable funding for the full-time development,

03:47.160 --> 03:52.160
so I hope this support continues many more years.

03:52.840 --> 04:02.840
Other things which happen beside the application development are a completely new website with much more content,

04:02.840 --> 04:17.840
a new documentation system with more documentation and also for a few months now, we also have official video tutorials on YouTube.

04:18.520 --> 04:24.520
Not complete yet, but at least a few ones now.

04:24.520 --> 04:28.520
But now let's take a look at the application.

04:28.520 --> 04:35.520
In September last year, version 1.0 was released, which was a very exciting moment.

04:35.520 --> 04:43.520
And beside many new capabilities in the board editor like thermal relief pads and so on,

04:44.200 --> 04:50.200
this release also added a 3D board viewer with step model import and export,

04:50.200 --> 04:57.200
which is not only fancy, but also a great way to review the design before ordering the PCBs.

04:59.200 --> 05:05.200
But actually, I mean, this is known from the 3D viewer, it's known from many other EDA tools.

05:05.200 --> 05:10.200
Probably every EDA tool is able to show your preview.

05:10.880 --> 05:17.880
I'm actually especially proud of two features which make generating production data really a pleasure.

05:17.880 --> 05:26.880
First of all, we have introduced comprehensive support for assembly variants and manufacturer part number management.

05:26.880 --> 05:34.880
So, MPNs can now be stored in libraries, so you don't need to add them to every new schematic you need them.

05:35.560 --> 05:43.560
In the schematic editor, you can even assign multiple MPNs to one component to export them as second source parts to the BOM.

05:43.560 --> 05:49.560
I mean, who didn't experience any supply chain issues in the last few years?

05:49.560 --> 05:54.560
So, it's nice to actually specify second source parts.

05:54.560 --> 06:00.560
And you can even specify different parts for different assembly variants.

06:01.240 --> 06:08.240
For example, assembly a 10K resistor in one assembly variant and zero-ohm resistor in another assembly variant.

06:11.240 --> 06:18.240
And to actually make generating these BOMs and any other output data, a matter of seconds,

06:18.240 --> 06:23.240
we introduced output jobs as a new unified way to export any data.

06:23.920 --> 06:30.920
So, these output jobs can be configured very flexible and stored within the project.

06:30.920 --> 06:36.920
So, the exactly same output files can be reproduced on a different computer.

06:36.920 --> 06:41.920
You don't need to configure anything again.

06:41.920 --> 06:49.920
So, yeah. And if they provide a command line interface, it's also very easy to fully automate the production data generation.

06:50.600 --> 06:56.600
For example, if you like to use a continuous integration system.

06:57.600 --> 07:04.600
So, now, a short demo is worth more than a thousand words.

07:04.600 --> 07:09.600
So, I would like to quickly show you a few of the features.

07:09.600 --> 07:14.600
I hope this works.

07:15.280 --> 07:22.280
Okay. On my screen, it looks completely different.

07:22.280 --> 07:29.280
But, okay. I think it's, you understand what should be there, I think.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.280
Right?

07:31.280 --> 07:35.280
So, the first is the 3D viewer.

07:35.280 --> 07:42.280
Let's see if it actually, yeah. More or less.

07:42.960 --> 07:48.960
Okay.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.960
Strange.

07:51.960 --> 07:56.960
So, I just want to show you actually that the 3D feature is very, very easy.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.960
Actually, you don't need to care about it.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.960
You just add a resistor or whatever to the schematic.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.960
And our libraries have the 3D models built in.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.960
So, you don't need to care about them.

08:10.640 --> 08:15.640
The part to the board editor, let's say a THD variant.

08:15.640 --> 08:22.640
And it immediately appears in the 3D view with a 3D model.

08:22.640 --> 08:28.640
And, yeah, it's even possible to switch between different footprints, for example.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.640
Different pitch.

08:30.640 --> 08:37.640
And the 3D model is automatically updated to the new footprint.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.320
Or, for example, vertical mounting variant.

08:41.320 --> 08:46.320
So, you actually cannot even do anything which isn't compatible.

08:46.320 --> 08:52.320
It's always assigned to the footprint you choose.

08:52.320 --> 08:58.320
So, yeah. Now, let's take a quick look at MPN management.

08:58.320 --> 09:03.320
I mean, the most simple use cases, you just want to add some component.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
And you have now the option to actually choose a concrete MPN,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
because they are now sorted in the library.

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
So, if you add a component by its MPN, and let's quickly also add it to the board

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
to actually make it appearing in the BOM.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.000
And when you export the BOM then, I think it was LED3,

09:29.000 --> 09:33.000
it immediately appears with the MPN, you're just assigned.

09:33.680 --> 09:38.680
So, it's very easy to generate high-quality production data.

09:38.680 --> 09:43.680
And another use case, for example, I mentioned before,

09:43.680 --> 09:47.680
if you want to add a second source part, you can just choose a different part,

09:47.680 --> 09:50.680
let's say, from a different manufacturer.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.680
Add it to the same component.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.680
It is listed as an alternative part now.

09:56.680 --> 10:02.680
And if you export the BOM now, you have a new column with the second source MPN

10:03.360 --> 10:06.360
and you can generate the BOM.

10:06.360 --> 10:11.360
So, there is no need anymore to manually adjust the BOM

10:11.360 --> 10:15.360
after generating it before sending it to the assembly house.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.360
You can generate it completely finished.

10:18.360 --> 10:21.360
No manual rework needed anymore.

10:21.360 --> 10:27.360
So, then, to actually generate the BOM,

10:27.360 --> 10:32.360
you can use the output jobs feature I just mentioned before.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.040
So, you can also generate these jobs.

10:35.040 --> 10:38.040
Every job means one or more files which are generated.

10:38.040 --> 10:43.040
For example, the Garber files, there is one job to generate Garber files.

10:43.040 --> 10:48.040
And if you, for example, like to send Garber files in a zip file to the manufacturer,

10:48.040 --> 10:54.040
you can just add a zip output job, choose you want to have Garber files in the zip file,

10:54.040 --> 10:58.040
maybe also the assembly PDF within the zip file.

10:58.720 --> 11:05.720
And now the output jobs are stored in the project, so you have to do it only once.

11:05.720 --> 11:09.720
And now you can generate production data, for example, for single jobs.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.720
Just double-click the job, the files generated and opened.

11:13.720 --> 11:16.720
Or you can generate all data at once.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.720
And you get, for example, the zip file you just configured,

11:19.720 --> 11:22.720
containing the Garber files and the assembly PDF,

11:22.720 --> 11:25.720
just like you want to have it to send it to the manufacturer.

11:26.400 --> 11:32.400
Also no manual file editing or archiving needed anymore.

11:32.400 --> 11:39.400
So, if you make any change to the project, one click and you have all files updated.

11:43.400 --> 11:48.400
But of course, not everyone likes to manually generate output files,

11:48.400 --> 11:54.400
even if it's that easy, because there is even a more easy option available.

11:54.400 --> 12:01.400
If you don't like to care about all these things, just start ordering your PCB right within the application.

12:01.400 --> 12:07.400
It's uploaded to our fabrication service website.

12:07.400 --> 12:12.400
You even get ERC warnings if you didn't resolve them in your project yet.

12:12.400 --> 12:19.400
You can choose your manufacturer just forwarded to the manufacturer you like.

12:19.400 --> 12:26.400
And without handling any files manually, you have your project...

12:29.400 --> 12:32.400
Okay, I was too fast.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.400
You have your project ready to be ordered.

12:35.400 --> 12:41.400
Just enter your shipping address, payment information and so on.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.400
That's it.

12:44.400 --> 12:50.400
So, let's switch to the slides.

12:50.400 --> 12:57.400
Okay, so now what's the overall state of the project?

12:57.400 --> 13:04.400
Generally, liver PCBs are fully functional and can be used productively for projects which are not too complex.

13:04.400 --> 13:10.400
Not too complex because hierarchical scheming is a very important factor.

13:10.400 --> 13:14.400
So, what's the overall state of the project?

13:14.400 --> 13:24.400
Generally, liver PCBs are fully functional and can be used productively for projects which are not too complex.

13:25.400 --> 13:30.400
Because hierarchical schematics and bosses are not supported yet.

13:30.400 --> 13:37.400
And also the trace routing tool and actually the board editor in general is still rather rudimentary.

13:37.400 --> 13:42.400
So, from time to time it might be a little bit inefficient.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.400
So, yeah.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.400
And of course, part livers is always a problem.

13:47.400 --> 13:53.400
It's not very comprehensive yet, but at least with liver PCBs, it's very, very easy.

13:53.400 --> 13:59.400
And to create the missing parts by yourself.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.400
So, a quick outlook now.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.400
The upcoming release will contain an EGLE project importer.

14:05.400 --> 14:09.400
So, it can import complete EGLE projects.

14:09.400 --> 14:16.400
And there's also some work ongoing currently to integrate live part information into the application.

14:16.400 --> 14:26.400
When you add a component to the schematic, you immediately should see then the part lifecycle status, stock availability and the price.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.400
So, this will be very useful.

14:28.400 --> 14:31.400
So, I hope we can make it happen.

14:31.400 --> 14:36.400
And yeah, it's clear from time to time.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.400
Some technology updates are needed.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.400
For example, switching to Qt 6.

14:41.400 --> 14:52.400
And yeah, for long term, as I mentioned, the trace routing tool needs some improvements and also hierarchical schematics and bosses.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.400
I think these are a must have.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.400
Yeah.

14:57.400 --> 15:10.400
So, if you like to support my effort on creating an easy and powerful EDA software for everyone, I would be very, very thankful about the donation.

15:10.400 --> 15:15.400
And to keep the full time development ongoing as long as possible.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.400
So, yeah, and there are also many other ways to contribute.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.400
Just check out the link here.

15:21.400 --> 15:26.400
And if there is any Wikipedia article right here, please let me know.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.400
We are looking for some help to publish a Wikipedia article.

15:30.400 --> 15:35.400
And please let us know your feedback on the feedback survey.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.400
So, yeah.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.400
The slides are online.

15:40.400 --> 15:45.400
Here are some links to get easily started with Libre PCB.

15:45.400 --> 15:46.400
That's it.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.400
Thank you very much.

15:48.400 --> 16:00.400
Thank you.

16:00.400 --> 16:03.400
Thank you for the presentation.

16:03.400 --> 16:11.400
I'm using Altium Designer and Qiget, and I work at a shop where Mentor was used.

16:11.400 --> 16:18.400
How is the state of the import of Altium Qiget and Mentor?

16:18.400 --> 16:24.400
It doesn't exist yet.

16:24.400 --> 16:30.400
Do you have plans to implement either of those?

16:30.400 --> 16:34.400
Any plans to implement these imports?

16:34.400 --> 16:38.400
I think Qiget import would be quite obvious.

16:38.400 --> 16:44.400
The other ones, I don't know yet how much effort is needed,

16:44.400 --> 16:50.400
how these file formats are known or not known, how to read them.

16:50.400 --> 17:01.400
So, yeah, yeah.

17:01.400 --> 17:09.400
I think at some day we will look at the imports, but it's of course not a high priority.

17:09.400 --> 17:16.400
So, did you encounter any problems with patents or something during your development?

17:16.400 --> 17:27.400
Because I'm developing a clone of a commercial software where I'm dealing a little bit with some patents that I might violate during that.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.400
Sorry, I didn't understand.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.400
Patents.

17:31.400 --> 17:38.400
Did you have any issues with those, like registered patents of companies of, I don't know?

17:38.400 --> 17:48.400
So far, I didn't have any problems with patents, but yeah, I'm not an expert in this area.

17:48.400 --> 18:07.400
So, I just tried to take care of licenses of things I use to hopefully not doing anything against the license terms.

18:08.400 --> 18:13.400
Any other questions?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.400
Okay, thank you, Urban.
