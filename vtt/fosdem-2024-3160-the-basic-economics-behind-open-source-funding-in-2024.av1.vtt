WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.600
Okay, our next speaker is Amanda Cassini.

00:08.600 --> 00:17.040
We are very fortunate to be able to get a talk in the open hardware dev room on one

00:17.040 --> 00:24.000
of the topics that in the open source community is much more easily addressed in software,

00:24.000 --> 00:26.960
but is harder in hardware as some things are.

00:26.960 --> 00:36.480
So please give a warm welcome to Amanda Cassini.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.960
Thank you so much for inviting me here today and for inviting me to speak.

00:39.960 --> 00:44.560
I'm very excited to talk to all of you about economics and economic modeling, which to

00:44.560 --> 00:47.880
be quite frank is actually not my background, but is something that is very important for

00:47.880 --> 00:50.520
the work I do now.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.160
And so who am I in case you're wondering?

00:53.160 --> 00:55.520
So I'm Amanda Cassari.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.560
I'm a pale white woman with light hair and eyes.

00:57.560 --> 01:01.560
I usually wear glasses, which I should put on now if I want to keep reading things.

01:01.560 --> 01:05.800
I'm a researcher and engineer at Google and I'm currently leading a team focused on research

01:05.800 --> 01:08.960
and education in our open source programs office.

01:08.960 --> 01:14.240
I'm also a co-lead for Project Ocean and Across, which are an external faculty to the

01:14.240 --> 01:18.680
Vermont Complex Systems Center and a co-founder of Open Source Stories with Julia Farrioli.

01:18.680 --> 01:19.680
Who's here today?

01:19.680 --> 01:20.680
Thanks for being here, Julia.

01:20.680 --> 01:24.560
I sit on the board of directors for something called the Computational Democracy Project

01:24.720 --> 01:30.240
and I once wrote a book with Alice Zhang on feature engineering.

01:30.240 --> 01:34.320
I'm also queer, a very proud mom of two smaller humans, a US Navy veteran and lucky enough

01:34.320 --> 01:37.080
to live in the indomitable state of Vermont in the United States.

01:37.080 --> 01:41.360
It's just south of Montreal, which is easier for some people to know.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.440
And if it helps you better to follow along or understand what we're working on right

01:44.440 --> 01:48.400
now or what these slides are, please, there's a bit.ly that you can see all of these slides

01:48.400 --> 01:51.520
and my speaker notes, which will amount to a transcript.

01:51.520 --> 02:00.680
And that's bit.ly backslash e-c-o-n-o-m-i-c-s dash o-f dash o-s-s dash dash f-o-s-d-e-m two

02:00.680 --> 02:04.160
zero two four.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.520
And so I also just want to put in the caveat.

02:06.520 --> 02:11.560
I'm very sorry, but something about listening to things from 1.2 to 1.5 speed means I usually

02:11.560 --> 02:14.640
talk at that speed now as well.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.000
So hopefully if you miss something, you can go back and look at the transcript and speakers

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
later.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.480
And I'll just make sure I'm being at a good accessible rate.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.600
So like I said, when I gave my introduction, you may have noticed I am not an economist.

02:27.600 --> 02:32.880
However, I am a complexity scientist and I try to see the world through a mix of applied

02:32.880 --> 02:35.800
mathematical models and abstractions.

02:35.800 --> 02:39.480
And it's this background that I'll be leaning into as we explore economics of open source

02:39.480 --> 02:43.240
and open hardware that exists right now.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.760
I guess to a little bit more just background, why do I care about this?

02:45.760 --> 02:47.240
So I've been working on this.

02:47.240 --> 02:52.040
In 2019, I was originally working in Google Cloud as a DevRel manager and an amazing team,

02:52.040 --> 02:55.480
but I also had this really nagging feeling that there was something kind of understanding

02:55.480 --> 03:00.000
about the way that technology and open source worked that we were fundamentally missing

03:00.000 --> 03:03.840
out on and we were trying to estimate and understand our work.

03:03.840 --> 03:09.680
And that's how I met actually through Julia, was the half bakery of ideas and discussing

03:09.680 --> 03:10.680
something.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.520
I was like, I have a niggling feeling of something we should be working on.

03:13.520 --> 03:18.640
She agreed and together we were able to pitch an idea for what is called Project Ocean.

03:18.640 --> 03:19.640
And that's a pilot.

03:19.640 --> 03:24.720
It was a pilot, it's continued on now and that's looking at collaboration between academia,

03:24.720 --> 03:29.480
industry and communities to understand open source at a global scale.

03:29.480 --> 03:34.520
We did launch this in early 2020, rough time to start a new project, but we were able to

03:34.520 --> 03:38.120
achieve many of the goals that we had then and that work does continue in partnerships

03:38.120 --> 03:40.040
and collaborations now.

03:40.040 --> 03:44.480
One of the most audacious goals that we had was mapping out the entire open source ecosystem

03:44.480 --> 03:46.800
and then sharing that with everybody.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.920
And it sounded honestly at the time like it was not that audacious because it just sounded

03:50.920 --> 03:54.800
like it was a way of looking at information and then sharing that in a way that everybody

03:54.800 --> 03:58.520
could see, which was something that we all deal normal basis of just making information

03:58.520 --> 04:00.600
transparent.

04:00.600 --> 04:05.160
But one of the barriers that we ran into then and we continue to run into now is just even

04:05.160 --> 04:10.280
defining the problem space of open source with stakeholders and communities as a shared

04:10.280 --> 04:11.280
understanding.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.480
If you've ever done any kind of research, that's always the place you have to start

04:14.480 --> 04:18.200
as being able to actually define the boundaries and the constraints of the problems that you're

04:18.200 --> 04:19.800
working within.

04:19.800 --> 04:24.440
And the reason that this was a challenge wasn't because there wasn't precedence in explanations

04:24.440 --> 04:26.400
of how you could go about that.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.720
It's that we were finding that a lot of the mental models and analogies that were used

04:29.720 --> 04:32.720
were not actually universal or global.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.360
Those models were actually preventing us from having a deeper understanding of the complexity

04:36.360 --> 04:41.240
of what was happening in open source because they were too simplistic or honestly in some

04:41.240 --> 04:46.120
caries is just the analogy that no longer existed today and was not the reality of the

04:46.120 --> 04:48.360
world that we were living in.

04:48.360 --> 04:53.720
So that was really hard for us because all of these models also made an assumption about

04:53.720 --> 04:56.240
the kind of baseline that you're working off of.

04:56.240 --> 04:59.560
So it gave you an understanding of like, well, this is what we should all assume in terms

04:59.560 --> 05:04.520
of the number of people involved, the kind of work that is critical, the amount of money

05:04.520 --> 05:09.800
that is existing and transacting to be able to keep this ecosystem thriving.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.240
And without all of that, this is where problems might be existing.

05:13.240 --> 05:16.960
So if we were looking at this concept of risk and resiliency, you need that baseline to

05:16.960 --> 05:23.520
understand where risk and resiliency either has interruptions or needs additional resourcing.

05:23.520 --> 05:30.080
So we were struggling with this fact mostly because organizationally, as a group and within

05:30.080 --> 05:34.760
this larger company, it was challenging for us to understand how we could move forward

05:34.760 --> 05:39.880
not just effectively but in a way that moved with purpose.

05:39.880 --> 05:44.400
And we can't do that until we start breaking some of those popular over-reductionist models

05:44.400 --> 05:49.280
of how digital structure looks today.

05:49.280 --> 05:50.520
This is a very popular comic.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.400
You have not seen this yet.

05:52.400 --> 05:58.680
This is used a lot to show demonstration of gaps, not only exist in understanding but

05:58.680 --> 06:04.960
also in a collective failure to respond to the challenge that exists for this large global

06:04.960 --> 06:06.640
ecosystem.

06:06.640 --> 06:10.440
So just to describe it briefly, this is the XKCD comic.

06:10.440 --> 06:11.840
There's a bunch of blocks.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.720
There's this idea that this represents all of digital infrastructure.

06:15.720 --> 06:20.480
And at the very bottom in a critical space is a person from Nebraska who has been thanklessly

06:20.480 --> 06:23.760
maintaining something since 2003.

06:23.760 --> 06:28.040
And more often than not, I mean this comic gets thrown around quite a bit, but I've

06:28.040 --> 06:34.200
actually seen this in position papers as a reason for why someone should be getting

06:34.200 --> 06:38.160
billions of dollars to do research or initiatives.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.080
This is their example they're giving.

06:41.080 --> 06:45.480
It's supposed to be demonstrative of the fact that the open source ecosystem is brittle

06:45.480 --> 06:48.080
and that large-scale investment is critical.

06:48.080 --> 06:52.560
But for that very specific purpose that that group wants to get billions of dollars for.

06:52.560 --> 06:57.520
And this is why this is my counter to this comic, is that the reality is that we're already

06:57.520 --> 07:01.560
spending billions of dollars on sustaining open source.

07:01.560 --> 07:06.040
I dislike the term sustaining because you can sustain broken systems.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.120
It doesn't mean it's working or it's working well.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.840
It just means it can keep going.

07:10.840 --> 07:17.680
And so because this has been so effective in centralizing buckets of money and attention,

07:17.680 --> 07:22.520
there are walls that are being built around organizational spaces for collaboration that

07:22.520 --> 07:26.720
we have to break through in order to keep moving forward.

07:26.720 --> 07:30.720
It's not that we're not investing, it's not that investments are happening, but it is

07:30.720 --> 07:36.360
that increasingly we are localizing decisions for investments and support in a way that

07:36.360 --> 07:40.680
is not creating resilient systems.

07:40.680 --> 07:45.320
Which is a problem when the system you're dealing with is not localized, does not have

07:45.320 --> 07:47.160
local optimans.

07:47.160 --> 07:52.280
It's in fact global, decentralized, and it's an equitably resourced.

07:52.280 --> 07:56.880
So to move forward we need new approaches for both challenging the assumptions as well

07:56.880 --> 08:02.400
as providing well at paths as understanding how we can approach this differently.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.200
So this brings us to the impetus behind mapping out these open source ecosystems.

08:06.200 --> 08:11.320
So not just creating this natural understanding, but really what this whole idea was about

08:11.320 --> 08:16.240
is that we were assuming and we still assume that if we have better information and better

08:16.240 --> 08:20.560
ways to understand the world we can make better decisions.

08:20.560 --> 08:24.920
And this is important for my work especially and what I get paid to do because that's

08:24.920 --> 08:28.520
understanding where resources that we have available should go.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.200
And they always have to be in the context of the business.

08:31.200 --> 08:36.160
That's what working for a for-profit company constrains me to.

08:36.160 --> 08:39.640
But we have to know where we are so we can work collectively to understand where we

08:39.640 --> 08:41.760
need to go next.

08:41.760 --> 08:46.120
And one way of knowing where we are is to always look at where we come from.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.560
And I don't want to discourage the idea that history cannot teach us what we should be

08:49.560 --> 08:51.680
working on and where to go next.

08:51.680 --> 08:55.560
However, some of the work we've defined as black swans, these are events that have fun

08:55.560 --> 08:59.840
and minimally changed and impacted how we approach open source today.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.720
They also sometimes get used as a scare tactic.

09:02.720 --> 09:07.640
And again to centralize over centralized resources in an already constrained environment

09:07.640 --> 09:11.600
and sometimes by the very organizations that we are trusting to work in our larger best

09:11.600 --> 09:12.600
interest.

09:12.600 --> 09:17.360
It may be true that there is an intolerable amount of risk that exists not only because

09:17.360 --> 09:21.840
of incidents like these but that we haven't even seen yet.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.320
And it might be that investing in those in a way now will prevent something further in

09:26.320 --> 09:27.320
the future.

09:27.320 --> 09:31.140
It might also be that the next problem that happens like this will also only be visible

09:31.140 --> 09:36.440
through hindsight and no amount of centralization right now will prevent that.

09:36.440 --> 09:39.760
So we can be informed by the past but we shouldn't be scared by it.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.120
So I think that my argument here is that we should be able to move forward with a critical

09:43.120 --> 09:48.720
eye again with like looking at better information, better understanding of what currently exists

09:48.720 --> 09:49.720
now.

09:49.720 --> 09:54.520
I've previously talked about tools and frameworks that organizations like open source programs

09:54.520 --> 10:00.840
offices can use to identify stakeholders and especially in companies as well as how to

10:00.840 --> 10:05.080
define and design metrics for regular reporting.

10:05.080 --> 10:10.640
These are honestly frameworks that are useful for any type of work not just open source

10:10.640 --> 10:14.840
but they do help in moving forward with something that's very large and messy where you don't

10:14.840 --> 10:20.000
have an ability to look at customers coming in and things going out.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.440
And those are building blocks of information for teams who work in an open source to frame

10:23.440 --> 10:27.960
the value of our work for businesses, partners, communities.

10:27.960 --> 10:33.960
This work was not created either randomly or on a whim or in a vacuum.

10:33.960 --> 10:39.840
So our team together had been working towards this very specifically because we were asked

10:39.840 --> 10:47.840
at the time to develop an ROI model of open source that we could use across the board,

10:47.840 --> 10:49.200
across the business.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.920
And this was for all of Google, for all the work that we did, for all the investments

10:52.920 --> 10:53.920
we put in.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.800
How can we describe that using an ROI model?

10:56.800 --> 11:01.040
My problem at the time which still exists and exists now is that I still maintain that

11:01.040 --> 11:06.120
ROI is almost always the wrong economic model to use for open source at scale.

11:06.120 --> 11:12.000
The reason for that is ROI is a very specific economic model that assumes first order inputs

11:12.000 --> 11:13.240
and outputs.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.200
And so those first order inputs and outputs mean you always know what's going in.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.480
You can see those direct effects and it's always an output.

11:18.480 --> 11:23.080
If you are a network scientist, this means you are always looking at a first order system.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.360
Open source is not a first order system.

11:25.360 --> 11:29.800
And so if we try to boil it down and make it a first order system, we are actually either

11:29.840 --> 11:35.160
abstracting away or making an overreductionist model that does not actually serve us.

11:35.160 --> 11:40.120
One example of this is when projects are tried to be measured simply by lines of code.

11:40.120 --> 11:44.000
Lines of code has not actually been shown over time to be something that is an indication

11:44.000 --> 11:47.280
of either productivity or even efficiency.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.760
When it is used to judge productivity and creativity, then we run into large problems

11:50.760 --> 11:52.400
with teams being devalued.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.720
We can't simplify that away.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.000
So what are the abstracts we should be using in taxonomies?

11:58.040 --> 12:01.520
I realize I'm going to go through this fairly quickly.

12:01.520 --> 12:06.240
So all of this is grounded in the idea, by the way, that the current structures and systems

12:06.240 --> 12:09.000
we're working within are the ones we have to work within.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.120
There's more research that goes through these problems and instructions using critical theory.

12:14.120 --> 12:17.280
I'll be taking a pragmatist approach today and just be talking about it in terms of the

12:17.280 --> 12:21.080
world we're currently living in, trying to describe those a little bit better.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.800
So resources.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.360
Resources in this capacity, I'm talking about an abstraction of not just money.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.160
And the reason for that, again, is that we boil things down to money quite a bit when

12:29.160 --> 12:32.840
we want to understand what kind of resources we're looking for and what resources are important

12:32.840 --> 12:33.840
to us.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.360
So there's just a few listed here.

12:35.360 --> 12:36.800
And again, these are somewhat abstract.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.160
This does not even account for things.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.360
Thank you.

12:57.360 --> 12:58.360
Thank you.

12:58.360 --> 12:59.360
Thank you.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.360
Thank you.

13:00.360 --> 13:01.360
Thank you.

13:01.360 --> 13:02.360
Thank you.

13:02.360 --> 13:03.360
Thank you.

13:03.360 --> 13:04.360
Thank you.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.360
Thank you.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.360
Thank you.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.360
Thank you.

13:07.360 --> 13:08.360
Thank you.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.360
Thank you.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.360
Thank you.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.360
Thank you.

13:11.360 --> 13:12.360
Thank you.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.360

14:45.360 --> 14:46.360

14:46.360 --> 14:47.360
Thank you.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.360

14:48.360 --> 14:49.360
Thank you.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.360
Thank you.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.360
Thank you.

14:51.360 --> 14:52.360
Thank you.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.360
Thank you.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.360
Thank you.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.360
Thank you.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.360
Thank you.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.360
Thank you.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.360
Thank you.

14:59.360 --> 15:11.860
For just playing the

15:11.860 --> 15:13.700
call.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.360
This was actually,

15:18.360 --> 15:19.960
I think this was an interesting

15:20.360 --> 15:21.440
achievement though.

15:21.440 --> 15:25.280
It also means that if you were considering these kinds of fundings you should understand

15:51.440 --> 15:53.440
You

16:21.440 --> 16:23.440
You

16:51.440 --> 16:53.440
You

17:09.640 --> 17:15.160
That's called op-ex operational expenses and that changes year-over-year for companies and organizations

17:16.040 --> 17:19.780
Academic institutions always have to take into account some kind of general institutional fee

17:19.780 --> 17:24.660
So if you are working as part of an academic university or an academic project group and they get a grant

17:24.940 --> 17:26.540
You're not going to get all of that money

17:26.540 --> 17:29.080
So there has to be costs associated with it

17:29.080 --> 17:33.020
You need to take that into account again as part of your budgeting and as that being your fiscal host

17:33.700 --> 17:37.380
Another part is there's a lot of government funds and NGO funds that are starting up right now

17:37.540 --> 17:42.780
Those may be restricted only to citizens of that government and then we run into the problem of how do you talk about?

17:43.020 --> 17:45.020
origination and citizens for a global project

17:46.420 --> 17:49.420
All monetary funding requires fiscal hosts we went over that

17:50.060 --> 17:54.580
LLC a nonprofit an organization with a platform and the reason that exists

17:54.860 --> 18:00.420
It may feel like that's blocking you the reason that actually exists is mostly related to anti bribery laws

18:01.580 --> 18:06.140
Organizations and companies can't just hand people money and then have no record of it have no tax record of it

18:07.260 --> 18:11.060
These all basically funded the same kind of guidance as being able to identify and talk about things

18:12.100 --> 18:17.660
Okay, so quickly outputs versus outcomes. So again before talking about these larger modeling structures

18:17.660 --> 18:19.660
I feel like it's important to differentiate these two

18:20.380 --> 18:25.700
Outputs of your project are the very specific units of work which you've identified in your roadmap or plan

18:25.700 --> 18:28.220
This is the how of what you want to achieve

18:29.180 --> 18:33.660
Outcomes are slightly different. They address the so what of your roadmap and your proposals

18:33.740 --> 18:36.620
So this is how you identify the purpose of what you're doing

18:36.620 --> 18:41.940
It allows you to frame the importance of your work in a way that may not be readily available to a general community or the group of

18:41.940 --> 18:43.940
Funders that you're trying to target

18:43.940 --> 18:49.060
So when you were tracking your reporting what comes from your work, you want to be able to address both of these things outcomes and outputs

18:49.980 --> 18:53.780
So very specific for open hardware. I'm so sorry. It took me so long to get here

18:54.340 --> 18:56.340
The original creator of the bomb

18:56.940 --> 19:03.380
Right so part of bills of materials and challenges that comes with funding on bills of materials is this question of centralization and

19:03.620 --> 19:05.620
Decentralization of hardware component availability

19:05.660 --> 19:09.460
So as you're trying to look and plan out and explain your project things along the way

19:09.460 --> 19:13.460
There's a big difference between when you first write your design proposal and then down the line

19:13.460 --> 19:18.100
Maybe when you get funding then when you can act on that and when you have to deliver on outcomes and out

19:18.340 --> 19:24.220
Outcomes and outputs. What is the component availability that you have and has that changed you to other market forces?

19:25.100 --> 19:27.820
high maintainer costs again inequitable

19:28.260 --> 19:30.140
Inequitable availability of parts

19:30.140 --> 19:36.500
It's difficult always to find people who may have the specific skills that you need and when you're operating on these tight timelines

19:36.500 --> 19:40.620
If you do not have a robust group that is working together and you need to do some kinds of swaps

19:40.620 --> 19:45.020
Or you need to be able to have someone who can maintain a changing bomb over time

19:45.220 --> 19:47.220
Then you're gonna have to make sure that you are

19:48.060 --> 19:51.860
Working on those in a way where you're not necessarily going to be able to depend on depend a bot

19:51.900 --> 19:58.820
You may not be aware that something was either obsolete or that was impacted on a timeline that now moves the entire project weeks at a time

19:59.020 --> 20:05.940
So get lead and delivery times also the challenge of one versus ten versus ten thousand when you're trying to order parts

20:05.940 --> 20:11.260
And when you're trying to get things from manufacturers, they have to be able to create and work on those in batches

20:11.580 --> 20:15.300
Also, your household may not be have the size to be able to have

20:15.860 --> 20:18.860
30,000 of one tiny piece in a box that you only need 10 of

20:20.260 --> 20:24.300
So just in terms of funding asking for funding when you're thinking about how to ask for different parts

20:24.300 --> 20:28.700
That's also something you have to consider based on the kinds of project you're building or what other people are building is

20:28.740 --> 20:32.340
Going to be as well that consideration of how do you share resources that are people or time?

20:32.940 --> 20:37.980
Okay, there's no option up not every single kind of development has an open option for all kinds of hardware

20:38.140 --> 20:42.780
So especially working with different kinds of chips different kind of microprocessors sometimes the only

20:43.620 --> 20:47.580
Option that you may have is proprietary software to be able to work with your hardware

20:47.580 --> 20:49.460
You have to be able to budget for that as well

20:49.460 --> 20:54.340
And that's difficult for folks to understand who are used to funding and all of the tool chain

20:54.340 --> 20:57.380
They're working with is an entirely open tool chain that doesn't have a cost

20:58.020 --> 21:02.740
Associated with it licensing fees are absolutely something that you should be including as part of your budget

21:03.300 --> 21:06.860
You have the option to build it yourself, but you may not always have the option to build it yourself

21:06.860 --> 21:10.340
So working with proprietary tools puts an additional cost on your budgets

21:11.660 --> 21:15.460
Working on funding lack of funding. There's a lot of conversations around software funding

21:15.460 --> 21:18.380
There's not as many around hardware funding at least not for specific purposes

21:18.380 --> 21:24.140
So I think in general this is also a challenge when just when working between different kinds of funders and funding

21:24.340 --> 21:26.440
Where is it that you fit that you feel comfortable with?

21:28.060 --> 21:31.580
There's a higher cost of getting it right the first time when you have to order something

21:31.580 --> 21:35.040
Then there's a long lead time and then it shows up and you realize that you've crossed a few of your paths

21:35.040 --> 21:36.220
And now things blow up

21:36.220 --> 21:39.460
But software you can just go through and re-change it and then redeploy it

21:39.460 --> 21:42.100
It doesn't exist the same when you're trying to connect components for hardware

21:42.980 --> 21:44.980
So okay very quickly. I'm so sorry

21:45.620 --> 21:48.020
ROI ROI actually can be used sometimes

21:48.500 --> 21:50.980
So I don't agree with it as a large-scale

21:51.660 --> 21:57.700
Model to work with however if you are working on something like a contract or you're working on a very specific outcome of work

21:57.700 --> 22:00.460
This is a good time to use ROI in your proposals

22:00.500 --> 22:05.500
So being able again those identify those inputs the kinds of work that you're doing that out comes in the outputs

22:05.580 --> 22:08.820
This is something that you can boil down to something like money and time

22:09.340 --> 22:14.140
As long as you're always taking into account things that do have monetary equivalents and direct effects

22:15.700 --> 22:17.580
There's also something called XYZ model

22:17.620 --> 22:19.900
This is basically assuming a black box in the middle

22:19.900 --> 22:22.940
So the red is kind of inputs the blue is outputs you have a feedback loop

22:22.940 --> 22:28.860
What happens in between is a little bit fuzzy, but because you're able to describe it and again from that like kind of outcome perspective

22:28.860 --> 22:31.620
Then it's easier for people to understand what you're doing and why

22:32.980 --> 22:36.620
Another kind this actually recently came and it's a good example of this from

22:37.540 --> 22:41.380
Hoffman at all paper the value of open source they take a supply and demand model

22:41.380 --> 22:46.300
They worked with some very specific people to understand what kind of things they're using within the corporate industry

22:46.340 --> 22:49.140
And that allows them to look at things more from a supply and demand perspective

22:50.260 --> 22:53.420
So there's even more things especially that apply to software and hardware

22:53.420 --> 22:58.220
There's many other microeconomic models that I think that can be applied and have be tried in this case

22:58.660 --> 23:06.100
Again, I think the main takeaway hopefully for this and the challenges that continue to exist is that there's not one that fits all

23:06.100 --> 23:07.540
There's not one that fits every project

23:07.540 --> 23:14.700
But a lot of funding is designed to examine things through one very specific project being clear through as you walk through and

23:14.780 --> 23:20.500
Identifying your needs as well as identifying what resources you have and what the outcomes will be will depend on your project

23:20.940 --> 23:22.860
Don't try to squeeze it into the model

23:22.860 --> 23:29.540
They're asking for if you feel that that's not going to accurately represent the needs that you have all it will do will cause

23:29.540 --> 23:35.220
What's exactly happening to somebody I know right now which is they have a week left and a bent frame with a four week time frame

23:35.220 --> 23:36.980
Or a four week lead time

23:36.980 --> 23:38.820
So they tried to save some money

23:38.820 --> 23:42.700
Didn't work out materially and now they're going to be spending six times as much to get to that outcome

23:43.140 --> 23:48.380
Part of that was through inability to look at resource planning and explaining things in a way that actually helps there

23:48.740 --> 23:53.740
The person who they're working on identify it as something that they should be spending that money up front on

23:55.140 --> 23:59.180
So collectively understand where we're not on the same boat. We're in the same storm

23:59.180 --> 24:01.260
We're not on the same boat, but hopefully our flotilla together

24:01.860 --> 24:06.260
Is a place where we can continue working to support each other and where we want to be

24:07.460 --> 24:09.460
Thank you

24:12.700 --> 24:14.700
You
