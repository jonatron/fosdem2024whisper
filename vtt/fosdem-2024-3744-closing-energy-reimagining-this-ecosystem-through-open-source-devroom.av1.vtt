Just a few words. If you want to just maybe think it won't work.

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
Yeah, we'd like to take just a couple moments to close off the deaf room. Thank you all for being here.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
This was our second year we had the energy deaf room. We started, maybe we can put this off.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.000
Well, we started with half a day last year and we extended it virtually.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Yeah, you were attending the virtual room last year.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.000
Yeah, and we kind of had a feeling that there's going to be more attendance if we have a full day.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
And I think this demonstrated it pretty well.

00:48.000 --> 00:55.000
Like, from the beginning in the morning until like basically now it was only like a few sessions maybe not completely full.

00:55.000 --> 01:00.000
So thank you very much for sticking around and I hope to see you next year.

01:00.000 --> 01:08.000
And maybe if you want to volunteer, you know, please send us an email or hit us up somewhere else.
