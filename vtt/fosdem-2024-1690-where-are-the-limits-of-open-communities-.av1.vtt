WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.680
We're at time.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.000
We're going to get started.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.760
Everybody please welcome Anesca Miro.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.000
Hey there.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.000
Thank you for having me.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.240
It's kind of a big thing for me to stand here because last year was my first foster

00:28.240 --> 00:33.880
and I really enjoyed it as a volunteer here and as an attendee.

00:33.880 --> 00:39.520
So standing here and being able to share some of my work with you, it is kind of like a

00:39.520 --> 00:41.520
big achievement for me.

00:41.520 --> 00:46.840
Oh, thank you.

00:46.840 --> 00:54.880
And I'm active in various open source communities but the reason why I'm here today is being

00:54.880 --> 01:00.200
an community, operations and community builder in Chesco de Gitao which could be translated

01:00.200 --> 01:05.760
as Czechia Digital but I'm going to use the pronunciation Chesco de Gitao because that's

01:05.760 --> 01:09.120
how we, that's why I say it.

01:09.120 --> 01:15.440
And one of my role with the community brought me to this question, where are the limits

01:15.440 --> 01:22.800
of open communities or are there any limits and how can we face that?

01:22.800 --> 01:30.560
So first I need to give you some context of Chesco de Gitao to show you what we do and

01:30.560 --> 01:32.640
how we do it.

01:32.640 --> 01:38.600
Then I'm going to tell you what the word open means for us and what challenges it brought

01:38.600 --> 01:42.800
to us in the last year and years.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.120
And where are we now?

01:44.120 --> 01:49.360
Which is not the end of the journey as we'll see but it's like continuous process.

01:49.480 --> 01:54.640
Hopefully I'll have enough time at the end for the questions and not only for the questions

01:54.640 --> 01:59.200
but I would love to hear your stories because you know, all of you, as it's for them, all

01:59.200 --> 02:05.320
of you are somehow active in open source communities so I'm sure that we all have something to

02:05.320 --> 02:07.680
say to that.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.000
So first start, what Chesco de Gitao is.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.160
It is a small NGO based in Czechia consisting of like 12 people in the core team and we

02:17.160 --> 02:22.840
have like clear mission which is to help other NGOs and public administration in Czechia

02:22.840 --> 02:27.240
to use digital technologies to its full potential.

02:27.240 --> 02:33.120
Basically it means that we guide other NGOs and organizations from public administration

02:33.120 --> 02:40.840
through the process of digital transformation as vague as it sounds it also is because some

02:40.840 --> 02:47.120
of these organizations are on the baseline just needing to learn basic digital skills,

02:47.120 --> 02:53.520
some of them just need to help to create some digital products so we do all of that but

02:53.520 --> 02:56.040
I mentioned 12 of us so we can do it alone.

02:56.040 --> 03:03.120
We have kind of like big community, really diverse consisting of expert volunteers who

03:03.120 --> 03:08.240
are from the field of marketing, product management, project management, software development,

03:08.240 --> 03:12.320
UX designers, all of that you need to succeed in the digital world.

03:12.320 --> 03:18.240
We also have people from NGOs, people from public administration and people from various

03:18.240 --> 03:23.120
businesses who just like our vision and will support us.

03:23.120 --> 03:29.920
And we started in 2019 and since then since that we gathered more than 6,000 people in

03:29.920 --> 03:36.200
our slack which is our main environment and with all those people over those five years

03:36.200 --> 03:42.200
we finished more than 30 projects which impacted more than 4 million people in Czechia.

03:42.240 --> 03:48.600
Czechia has around 10 million people so I guess it's quite an achievement and it's all thanks

03:48.600 --> 03:51.200
to the community we are.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.920
So that's what we do and how we do it.

03:53.920 --> 04:00.080
We consider ourselves being value based organization and value based community.

04:00.080 --> 04:06.520
We have five core values which are not only written, we try to live them day by day in

04:06.520 --> 04:11.480
our day to day work and they are basically the baseline for most of our decisions.

04:11.480 --> 04:16.720
The first of them and the reason I'm here is openness and I'm going to also skip it

04:16.720 --> 04:20.080
for now because I'm going to talk about it later.

04:20.080 --> 04:23.360
But the next of them is professionalism.

04:23.360 --> 04:28.600
We're a really diverse community and when you have people from NGOs and business and

04:28.600 --> 04:35.000
public administration like totally different mindsets, totally different life experience

04:35.040 --> 04:43.040
and we have people from junior, middle, senior level and all of them having different life

04:43.040 --> 04:44.480
experience.

04:44.480 --> 04:50.480
The professionalism is a baseline for having good relationships in the community because

04:50.480 --> 04:57.000
we interact as professionals, we believe that all opinion matters and that we all can learn

04:57.000 --> 05:03.000
from each other and we strongly support collaboration, the next value.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.000
Especially in public administration people tend to build silos and work independently

05:09.000 --> 05:14.880
on other departments and we believe that through collaboration we can achieve more and have

05:14.880 --> 05:15.880
bigger impact.

05:15.880 --> 05:21.800
So that's what we try to teach in our community, to empower in our community and then people

05:21.800 --> 05:26.760
can use it in their day by day work.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.760
And we mostly volunteer based organization.

05:29.760 --> 05:36.040
So efficiency is really important value for us because people give us the most precious

05:36.040 --> 05:40.600
things they have, their free time and their know how and we don't want to waste any of

05:40.600 --> 05:41.600
that.

05:41.600 --> 05:47.440
Also our partners because we're funded from the private sector, we don't want to waste

05:47.440 --> 05:49.520
any of the resources given to us.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.360
So efficiency is really, really crucial.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.480
And then usefulness.

05:55.480 --> 06:02.400
This one is focused mostly on the solutions we built in our organization and our community.

06:02.400 --> 06:10.840
Because when you see digital technologies we may be perceived as a highly technical community

06:10.840 --> 06:17.400
which we are actually not because our target groups are NGOs and public administration

06:17.400 --> 06:23.000
which usually have lower level of technical knowledge or financial resources.

06:23.000 --> 06:28.760
So we have to be able to build solutions which are sustainable for them and which they can

06:28.760 --> 06:30.160
administer by themselves.

06:30.160 --> 06:37.120
So usually 10 to years, no code or low code platforms which are easily manageable for

06:37.120 --> 06:38.600
those organizations.

06:38.600 --> 06:44.080
So usefulness is a core value for building the products or building the solutions to

06:44.080 --> 06:46.240
be useful for the end user.

06:46.240 --> 06:50.280
It's really, really important.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.640
And then back to the openness.

06:52.640 --> 06:55.360
What does it mean in context of Chesco Digital?

06:55.360 --> 07:02.960
Where we have open code, it's a necessary condition for all the products we agree to

07:02.960 --> 07:08.960
work on and all the organization we work with to have open code, to have their repositories

07:08.960 --> 07:14.240
and get up under the least restrictive open source licenses.

07:14.240 --> 07:16.200
We also have open knowledge base.

07:16.200 --> 07:25.240
We have our own Wikipedia where we gather all knowledge we learned over those last five

07:25.240 --> 07:27.920
years.

07:27.920 --> 07:35.320
Also all the examples of where not to go and a lot of guides for, I don't know, how to

07:35.320 --> 07:41.000
create a successful webinar, how to cut videos, how to work with volunteers, how to build

07:41.000 --> 07:43.360
digital projects from scratch.

07:43.360 --> 07:47.320
I like to say that there is everything in our Wikipedia where you know what you're looking

07:47.320 --> 07:48.320
for.

07:48.320 --> 07:52.640
It's built on confluence so it tends to be quite messy and sometimes outdated and sorry

07:52.640 --> 07:57.520
for that, but it's kind of a rich source of information.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.360
We have transparent funding.

07:59.360 --> 08:04.600
We have transparent account when you can find all the financial transactions.

08:04.600 --> 08:10.760
We openly speak about our partners and sponsors, how much money they give us and how we spend

08:10.760 --> 08:12.840
them.

08:12.840 --> 08:17.200
We also speak openly about the money we as a core team get.

08:17.200 --> 08:23.480
You can basically find all aspects of our financial management from our transparent resources

08:23.480 --> 08:28.760
and learn how we are doing it that way.

08:28.760 --> 08:32.160
We strongly empower open communication.

08:32.160 --> 08:39.320
That's the reason why I'm here to share our story with you and that's visible mostly in

08:39.320 --> 08:40.320
our Slack.

08:40.320 --> 08:45.840
I bet that some of you know Slack, most of you know Slack and when you have Slack with

08:45.840 --> 08:51.920
an average 600 people active each month, it's kind of like beehive.

08:51.920 --> 08:58.800
It's really messy sometimes, but we really try to limit private conversations and private

08:58.800 --> 09:04.560
channels so everybody who joins can learn everything as fast as possible.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.760
We have as lowest barrier to join any project on the conversation you want.

09:09.760 --> 09:17.240
There's huge traffic in our Slack, but we have also other communication channels.

09:17.240 --> 09:27.160
Again, this is something we try to teach our target groups because we want to teach people

09:27.160 --> 09:32.440
that through collaboration, through open communication, open feedback and stuff like that, we can

09:32.440 --> 09:36.560
build meaningful relationships and achieve more together.

09:36.560 --> 09:44.120
This is one of our messages for the whole community we work with.

09:44.120 --> 09:48.040
What challenges this approach brings to us?

09:48.040 --> 09:55.960
The first one is actually hidden in the world open itself because it's just a word drive

09:55.960 --> 09:59.000
and we're a really diverse community.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.040
This word has so many different meanings for so many people.

10:05.040 --> 10:13.720
Even in our small core team, 12 people, we were all over the spectrum from being open

10:13.720 --> 10:17.000
no matter what to open by default.

10:17.000 --> 10:24.040
Yeah, have things open, but when there is a really good reason, really valid reason to

10:24.040 --> 10:29.800
have something not shared, let's not share it because it can do some harm.

10:29.800 --> 10:34.760
We needed to balance that not only in our team but in the whole community so they know

10:34.760 --> 10:35.760
what to expect.

10:35.760 --> 10:43.200
I'm going to briefly go through all the challenges and then get to how we handle that.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.360
The word open or the meaning of open.

10:45.360 --> 10:53.320
Then with the communication, I mentioned that our Slack is kind of like has a huge traffic.

10:53.640 --> 11:02.320
Slack is not really good for having big announcements and stuff like that because it's mostly for

11:02.320 --> 11:04.760
project communications, communications in teams.

11:04.760 --> 11:15.040
It's like fast pace, a lot of traffic, things get lost, not really intuitive to search in.

11:15.040 --> 11:20.000
But we used it for quite a long time as a single source of information because we don't

11:20.040 --> 11:26.880
want people to follow many different channels.

11:26.880 --> 11:31.240
We constantly received feedback that people are missing stuff, that we're not sharing

11:31.240 --> 11:32.240
things.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.160
Come on people, that wasn't Slack, it's actually one of our stickers.

11:35.160 --> 11:36.160
It wasn't Slack.

11:36.160 --> 11:43.200
It's why they're popular even in business.

11:43.200 --> 11:47.680
So we tried newsletter, one newsletter, but we do so many stuff in one time that even

11:47.680 --> 11:51.080
in the newsletter, it was so long that people stopped reading it.

11:51.080 --> 11:56.560
So when you want to share stuff, when we want to tell people about what we're doing, how

11:56.560 --> 11:59.320
can we contribute?

11:59.320 --> 12:05.200
But at the same time, to prioritize, when to say something to get the right information

12:05.200 --> 12:10.760
to the right people at the right time, how to keep the communication efficient, that

12:10.760 --> 12:17.160
was the next challenge because you want to share stuff.

12:17.280 --> 12:27.280
And then the one which was kind of like technical interesting was the information security.

12:27.280 --> 12:37.280
They just started in 2019 as a bunch of programmers who knew themselves very well.

12:37.280 --> 12:44.280
And they just started to work on some project for some NGO and then the word spread and

12:44.360 --> 12:45.360
it started growing.

12:45.360 --> 12:51.080
But several months it was just group of people who knew each other.

12:51.080 --> 12:56.800
So there was no need to apply any strict security measures.

12:56.800 --> 13:02.880
But then COVID came and Chesco Dicatal grew quite rapidly from like dozens of people to

13:02.880 --> 13:05.440
several thousands of people.

13:05.440 --> 13:11.720
And there were multiple projects in the same time with different needs for information,

13:11.720 --> 13:16.440
different needs of tool sets, different needs for data and stuff like that.

13:16.440 --> 13:23.440
And then over the journey we kind of lost track on who needs to access what and who

13:24.080 --> 13:26.400
is responsible for which tools and so.

13:26.400 --> 13:33.400
So yeah, we were still able to maintain security somehow, but when you don't have someone responsible,

13:34.400 --> 13:41.400
so the share responsibility in the word of data security doesn't work.

13:42.400 --> 13:48.120
So we needed to take a step back and think about how can we guarantee some security to

13:48.120 --> 13:53.560
our community and still keep this open approach.

13:53.560 --> 13:59.560
And the last one which I picked for you today was the toughest one for me as a community

13:59.560 --> 14:00.880
builder.

14:00.880 --> 14:07.880
Because we at the beginning when we announced our mission, we were so happy that people

14:11.480 --> 14:18.080
are joining Chesco Dicatal and they share the passion to help NGOs and share the urge

14:18.080 --> 14:21.960
to help public administration with digitization.

14:21.960 --> 14:28.960
And they share our journey and they will help us that we wanted to accommodate everyone

14:29.960 --> 14:36.960
and then we started creating opportunities based on the needs of the community.

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
And we really lost track of who we are, what is our position on the map of systemic change

14:44.960 --> 14:47.360
in Czechia.

14:47.360 --> 14:54.360
And we faced the decision about yeah, we still want to be open community, but does it mean

14:54.640 --> 15:01.640
that we need to be open for everybody and to create something for everybody who comes?

15:01.960 --> 15:06.080
And this was the biggest challenge for me.

15:06.080 --> 15:11.080
So what we did about all that, first thing you see there is code of conduct.

15:11.080 --> 15:16.560
Maybe surprising that we didn't have one because it's like the good practice of open

15:16.560 --> 15:19.040
communities to have code of conduct.

15:19.160 --> 15:22.160
But remember we are a value based community.

15:22.160 --> 15:28.160
So we thought that having the values stated is enough.

15:28.160 --> 15:35.160
But then I also mentioned the different meanings of the word open.

15:35.160 --> 15:40.160
I mean five values, five words, so many meanings for those people.

15:40.160 --> 15:47.160
So we felt that we need to set up at least some of the values that we need to set up

15:49.040 --> 15:55.040
and some basic rules or to explain to our community what do we mean by those values.

15:55.040 --> 16:02.040
So we created code of conduct which basically is a translation of our values to like more

16:02.040 --> 16:04.520
words to specify more.

16:04.520 --> 16:09.640
What to expect when you join Czechoslovakia, what we do, how we do it, what we want from

16:09.640 --> 16:16.640
you, what you can expect from us and how can we secure the safe space for our community.

16:17.640 --> 16:20.640
How can we handle troubles and stuff like that.

16:20.640 --> 16:24.640
So six months ago actually we applied code of conduct.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.640
Kind of late but it exists.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.640
Then, yay, new communication channels.

16:30.640 --> 16:34.640
More to that, yeah.

16:34.640 --> 16:42.640
Sounds confusing but for us it meant that we want to use the communication channels for

16:42.640 --> 16:44.640
the best purpose they solve.

16:44.640 --> 16:49.640
So we keep Slack purely for the project communication.

16:49.640 --> 16:56.640
We took the important stuff out of that and for example the long-lasting topics or repeating

16:56.640 --> 17:01.640
questions and stuff like that we built an open discussion forum based on this course.

17:01.640 --> 17:05.640
So we have this one for that which is also more to the open communication because it's

17:05.640 --> 17:08.640
not hidden by the barriers of Slack.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.640
It's open for reading.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.640
You don't have to sign in.

17:13.640 --> 17:20.640
So this is also good for our target groups because most of the NGOs we learned over the

17:20.640 --> 17:27.640
way that they find Slack not very intuitive for them to use so they at the end maybe even

17:27.640 --> 17:29.640
didn't join.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.640
So that's new community forum.

17:32.640 --> 17:36.640
And we're also working on restructuring of our newsletters.

17:36.640 --> 17:43.640
So we have only the important stuff there and we're also building a new app somewhere

17:43.640 --> 17:50.640
between our website and the Slack where we'll have all the information for the community.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.640
So it's not getting lost in Slack.

17:53.640 --> 17:59.640
So it may be like, yeah, we have more channels but single purpose ones which may be easier

17:59.640 --> 18:04.640
to follow because you can pick the one which you want to follow.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.640
And then regarding the security.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.640
We did kind of like security check.

18:09.640 --> 18:14.640
We put together all the data we have, all the tools, all the databases, everything.

18:14.640 --> 18:21.640
We spent several months on going through the accesses and what do we really need?

18:21.640 --> 18:26.640
We can rid of not to store data we don't need.

18:26.640 --> 18:32.640
And for now it is that every person from our team is responsible for specific tools and

18:32.640 --> 18:37.640
specific data and we're doing regular checks on who can access what.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.640
It doesn't mean that we don't want to share.

18:39.640 --> 18:45.640
We just want to know who can access what and manage the accesses.

18:45.640 --> 18:57.640
And then about the open community itself, we spend more than a year defining our needs

18:57.640 --> 19:06.640
and finding our position on the map of how we can help best the public administration

19:06.640 --> 19:10.640
and NGOs in Czech Republic with digital transformation.

19:10.640 --> 19:19.640
And the biggest switch in my head was, yeah, I want to have a community who is thriving.

19:19.640 --> 19:28.640
But actually it doesn't mean that I need, that I have to take everybody's needs to account.

19:28.640 --> 19:36.640
I need to follow the vision of the organization and we need to be clear to say out loud,

19:36.640 --> 19:43.640
like that's what we do, that's our mission, that's how you can help us, that's where we need you.

19:43.640 --> 19:48.640
And you're welcome to join to help us achieve the goal.

19:48.640 --> 19:57.640
And if it means that there isn't room for you, we'll be happy when you follow, when you share what we do, if you like it.

19:57.640 --> 20:05.640
But we can't accommodate everybody's needs because we can't afford to lose focus.

20:05.640 --> 20:11.640
When we want to have a big impact, when we want to change something, we need to stay focused on our mission.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.640
So that's about it.

20:14.640 --> 20:19.640
So that's how we faced the challenges.

20:19.640 --> 20:23.640
As I mentioned at the beginning, it's not the end of the journey, it's still a process.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.640
We're still creating and trying.

20:25.640 --> 20:31.640
We're doing baby steps to achieve our goals and our mission.

20:31.640 --> 20:36.640
But hopefully I touched some points which may be inspiring for you.

20:36.640 --> 20:40.640
And I'd love to hear your stories or questions.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.640
I'm here. Talk to me.

20:42.640 --> 20:53.640
Any questions?

20:53.640 --> 20:57.640
Oh no, there's the saddest thing.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.640
Please share your story.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.640
Okay, I'm coming back at the microphone.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.640
Thank you.

21:04.640 --> 21:12.640
Worst thing that can happen to a speaker, not a different question.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.640
Thank you for the wholesome talk.

21:14.640 --> 21:20.640
I really relate to a lot of things you're talking about when your community grows and communication gets lost

21:20.640 --> 21:24.640
and different people consuming your information differently.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.640
Are you documenting it somewhere?

21:26.640 --> 21:36.640
If we can follow, because it just sounds like you have done a lot of thinking about what this single source of information looks like.

21:36.640 --> 21:44.640
Yeah, we do. But unfortunately, as we oriented on stuff in Czechia, we documented in Czech.

21:44.640 --> 21:54.640
But I'm thinking about, because I'm creating my own website, I'm thinking about translating some of that to some both posts and stuff like that

21:54.640 --> 22:01.640
because actually I did this talk earlier on our journey, so with different topics.

22:01.640 --> 22:06.640
Half a year ago on the Czech conference, Focus on Open Source.

22:06.640 --> 22:12.640
And it was just an experiment if this actually interests anybody.

22:12.640 --> 22:16.640
So I can see it does. So it actually inspires me to translate it in English.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.640
Thank you for the question.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.640
So the question at the back here. Can you just put your hand? Thank you very much.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.640
Do you know who gave my step?

22:25.640 --> 22:27.640
I have to work off the waffles.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.640
I have a question about the needs of the community.

22:36.640 --> 22:45.640
And if you use any tools or how do you stay close to the needs of the community and how do you then answer that?

22:46.640 --> 23:03.640
Yeah, I do regular well-being research, like each quarter, where there are close questions for some metrics, but also plenty of open.

23:03.640 --> 23:17.640
So usually I have 10% of community answering, which is not much, but I'm happy to have at least some, so let's say 60 to 70 responses.

23:17.640 --> 23:21.640
And we're trying to work on every of them. So that's the first one.

23:21.640 --> 23:30.640
And the second, we did kind of like intense research half a year ago with a design agency.

23:30.640 --> 23:47.640
And there were also not only written feedback, but also some deep, sorry, I forgot the word, but deep talking with the people.

23:47.640 --> 23:53.640
And so we're really working hard to get the needs right and do the mapping of our community.

23:53.640 --> 24:00.640
So we know what would be best to pursue. So yeah, we work on that hard.

24:02.640 --> 24:09.640
Hi, I would like to ask if you can give us more details on how do you slice the responsibilities? What was your approach?

24:09.640 --> 24:14.640
Yeah, that's actually the easy one. Thank you for that.

24:14.640 --> 24:22.640
I guess it's 12 members of the core team in just going to tell and each of us different responsibilities.

24:22.640 --> 24:27.640
So we divided the resources based on the group of responsibilities we have.

24:27.640 --> 24:35.640
So for example, when we have a database, which stores data of volunteers, I am the community builder.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.640
So I am responsible for that one.

24:37.640 --> 24:42.640
I have a colleague who's responsible for all the activities we do for NGOs.

24:42.640 --> 24:49.640
So she is responsible for the base where we store data for CRM and tools that's connected to that.

24:49.640 --> 24:58.640
So that was actually the easier job than it sounds because we divided the responsibilities based on the responsibilities we already have.

24:58.640 --> 24:59.640
Thank you.

24:59.640 --> 25:03.640
Hi, thank you very much for this very interesting two questions.

25:03.640 --> 25:07.640
One, what is the tool you use for access management and so on?

25:07.640 --> 25:11.640
And how do you verify that would be very interesting for us to also know what you're using?

25:11.640 --> 25:21.640
A second question. I'm interested in knowing how did you manage to scale up because that is one of the biggest questions that, for example, in my work,

25:21.640 --> 25:27.640
we're trying to figure out how on earth can we go from 20 to a thousand developers, right? Thank you.

25:28.640 --> 25:37.640
First, we have, as Slack is our main environment for now, we have two steps how to get in.

25:37.640 --> 25:45.640
The first is registering in our own base where you fill up the data about yourself, which then allows you to go to Slack.

25:45.640 --> 25:50.640
But now as we are creating the middle layer, we are creating our own.

25:50.640 --> 25:58.640
So we still actually, we have a workshop next week about it, how to find the right tool for where to build your profile on that.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.640
So we'll see about that one.

26:01.640 --> 26:10.640
And about scaling. Well, at first, when it was like several dozens of people, it was just self-organized, let's say.

26:10.640 --> 26:15.640
And then over time, the core team was built. So it's 12 of us right now.

26:15.640 --> 26:25.640
But we work closely with the community. So for example, in my team, I have two buddies and they are contacting on a grow basis.

26:25.640 --> 26:32.640
After five days, you join our Slack. One of them is actively contacting you asking if you have any troubles and so.

26:32.640 --> 26:41.640
So we work closely with volunteer base and we have those who want to be more active with our volunteers.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.640
So that's just how we scale. Thanks to our community.

26:45.640 --> 26:50.640
So I have a question that haunts me for years and related to open communities.

26:50.640 --> 26:58.640
And you have used the word a lot, but the question for me is who is we and how does one become part of that week?

26:58.640 --> 27:08.640
Yeah. Well, I identify as the part of Chiskorigita and how to be part of that.

27:08.640 --> 27:23.640
It's kind of like as I answered regarding the information about the resources, we're focused on the check environment.

27:23.640 --> 27:33.640
So it's mostly for the check speaking people, but through the website Chiskor, the digital, you can find all the information in there.

27:33.640 --> 27:41.640
I believe that no, here not. Sorry. So on the first slide, yeah, there are our social media accounts.

27:41.640 --> 27:47.640
So you can find information about that. And then it's really easy to join. It's easy to join.

27:47.640 --> 27:56.640
It's much tougher to right now to contribute because, you know, in the process, we are in the process of transition as we found ourselves finally.

27:56.640 --> 28:06.640
So we're recreating all the opportunities. So right now we're, yeah, I've figured it out. Thank you for the question.

28:06.640 --> 28:12.640
I have a question, maybe less about the open it, but more about the project that you run.

28:12.640 --> 28:13.640
Sorry, about?

28:13.640 --> 28:21.640
I have about the project that you run because one of your goals is, you know, to transform to like digital kind of way of thinking.

28:21.640 --> 28:31.640
Yes. And curious, how do you ensure and measure the long lasting impact of the work that you do?

28:31.640 --> 28:36.640
Because I guess the work that you do, you want that to be long lasting and kind of outlive you, right?

28:36.640 --> 28:39.640
Yeah, thank you. Great question.

28:39.640 --> 28:47.640
We have quite a tough process of choosing the project we start to cooperate on.

28:48.640 --> 29:00.640
And we have strict and less strict measures of the projects we accept, but the sustainability is one of them.

29:00.640 --> 29:12.640
So when you ask our community for help, we ask you what are your plans, kind of like midterm and long term with the project?

29:12.640 --> 29:17.640
It has to be a crucial part of your operations.

29:17.640 --> 29:35.640
I mean, for example, we cooperated with NGO focused on cancer prevention, and they needed a tool how to reach more people than by talks and conferences.

29:35.640 --> 29:42.640
And together we built a mobile app, and it was core tool for them to continue with their work.

29:42.640 --> 29:47.640
So there's an example of that. So it should be the crucial part for the functioning of the organization.

29:47.640 --> 29:56.640
And you don't have to have funding already, but you should have a plan how to get funding for it and to support it at least several years.

29:56.640 --> 30:02.640
So yeah, several steps during the process of exception of the cooperation to...

30:02.640 --> 30:12.640
You never can guarantee anything, but we try to do our best to choose the projects which aspire to be long term active.

30:12.640 --> 30:18.640
So because we don't want to waste the energy of the community invested to the project. Thank you for the question.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.640
So folks, we're actually at time.

30:20.640 --> 30:21.640
Okay.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.640
So the reason is the question is for the benefit of the public.

30:24.640 --> 30:28.640
Yeah, perfect. Thank you. Thank you very much for having me. Thank you.

30:32.640 --> 30:33.640
Thank you.
