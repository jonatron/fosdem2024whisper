WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
Hi everyone, can you hear me?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Yes.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Hi, thank you so much for joining in.

00:13.000 --> 00:16.000
So my name is Rashi, I'm from the Accessibility Lab.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
And given the time we have, I'm going to do a little overview of accessibility.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.000
I'm not sure if you'll have time for case studies,

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
but try to look at a few aspects of what can strengthen accessibility

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
and of course, I'm going to ask you, and you can also ask me some questions.

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
So we look at promoting the digital rights of accessibility

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
and people who have different disabilities,

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
which we think should be vital to anybody.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
We look at accessibility as an ability to be able to function,

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
someone who can operate the different devices we have,

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
have access to the different versions of browsers,

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
and basically looking at the least part of resistance,

01:05.000 --> 01:11.000
eliminating different obstacles when transmitting, receiving, or understanding information.

01:11.000 --> 01:18.000
We also get, one of the things we also see in the open source conversation

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
and around is a lot of people like to interchange and look at accessibility

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
and usability as one and the same thing.

01:25.000 --> 01:29.000
But they are very different. The way we operate is very different.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
Although usability, we have a lot of allies in the usability space,

01:34.000 --> 01:42.000
but accessibility in hand with usability does strengthen and provide an extra level of security

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
or privacy or any of those factors that people look at.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
We also look at offering users and customers with a good user experience

01:52.000 --> 01:56.000
because accessibility for people who have different abilities

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
fail to consider people with different disabilities,

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
whether you have a motor disability, you can have a visual disability,

02:04.000 --> 02:10.000
you can have a physical disability, and you can also have a disability a lot later on.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.000
I see my parents aging and a lot of them also have disabilities

02:14.000 --> 02:18.000
with a lot of aspects in the visual world.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
We also know someone in our open source space who was visually challenged for a very long time.

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
This is a slide we usually use based on who we are talking to.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
So we talk to private sector, we talk about how it has competitive advantage

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
and how it can help with SEOs and positioning and compatibility.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Also depending on which region you are from, complying with legislation

02:39.000 --> 02:46.000
because some of the legislations are pretty strong if implemented regionally.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
Our accessibility, we look at increasing the number of users

02:50.000 --> 02:55.000
in keeping the ones that we have, whether it's providing accessible online services,

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
providing a sense of autonomy.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
This is a project that I worked with, carries around.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
We are just going to show you some aspects of how people with different visions see it.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.000
This is normal vision, this is someone with humanopoeia,

03:12.000 --> 03:18.000
macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma,

03:18.000 --> 03:23.000
tritinopia, protonopia, acronotoposia.

03:23.000 --> 03:31.000
This is looking at an overview of the different lawsuits that we have seen.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
This is data from 2022 on the lawsuits that have been sued,

03:38.000 --> 03:44.000
plus action lawsuits, so it can be from e-commerce websites where companies

03:44.000 --> 03:52.000
and services have failed to provide basic accessibility or adhere to basic accessibility guidelines.

03:52.000 --> 03:56.000
You can also see food security, you can also see education somewhere

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
but education should also be somewhere here.

03:59.000 --> 04:06.000
Basically people who are challenged, most of them like to enjoy a personal social

04:06.000 --> 04:12.000
life to be able to access things they want given that they have so many challenges for mobility.

04:12.000 --> 04:17.000
Websites have been the primary target.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.000
I know that we live in an app culture but a lot of people with disabilities like using websites.

04:27.000 --> 04:32.000
We also look at understanding different personas.

04:33.000 --> 04:42.000
We work a lot on providing audits for websites or it can be applications.

04:42.000 --> 04:47.000
One of the reasons we were not typically in the open source realm

04:47.000 --> 04:52.000
but the reason why we got into the open source realm because we realized that a lot of open source teams,

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
although they care about a lot of the social conscious aspects of accessibility

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
but they might not have the resources.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
For example, we have a long standing partnership with Open Technology Fund

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
where we provide pro bono services for applications that work on countering surveillance

05:12.000 --> 05:18.000
or enhancing the privacy and security of these tools that look at censorship

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
and look at countering it in an effective way.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
This is a simulator. How many fuel have you heard of?

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Do any of you all use...

05:29.000 --> 05:34.000
Is there anyone who has an experience with accessibility here or is there...

05:34.000 --> 05:40.000
Maybe I'd love to kind of maybe get an on-site view of...

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
Some of the apps in Linux are really inconsistent.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
NVDA for example and they use different...

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
I don't know, it's...

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
No, no, it's absolutely fine. Go ahead.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Is there anyone who uses the screen reader or analyze? Go ahead.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Yes.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Is there a day only in a terminal or just, you know, a situation to server?

06:59.000 --> 07:08.000
And I know there are some current stuff work going on to fix some...

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
I know like an office doing...

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
Working on their...

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
It's not...

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
And such to make things...

07:15.000 --> 07:20.000
To set standards and make that patient call like a...

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
Right, right, right.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
But it's like still not...

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
I think a while.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.000
Are you someone who also works with these tools regularly?

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
Is it something as a part of your employment?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Are you looking to get into it?

07:36.000 --> 07:44.000
Well, I don't use the tools currently because they're not accessible.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
But I definitely don't...

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Okay, thanks so much.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
Is there anyone else?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Just one, we have one last one.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
Anyone who would like to chime in or I can just move on.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
Okay, so these are assistive technologies.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
We have Braille displays and switches.

08:02.000 --> 08:08.000
I don't have any, but we also have a few keyboards that are Braille friendly.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
And of course they're also catering to folks who...

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
People use different switches.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
We might have a disability with the hand.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Just showing you a few visual examples.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
There'll be eye tracking devices.

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
Can I show you a few more?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Yeah, screen readers.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
Google Talkback and VDR Jaws.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
There's anyone who's had experience with that.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
And I'll also move to legislation.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
I know I'm in a tech conference, but I think legislation is also an important aspect

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
when it comes to pushing ways in which...

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
And also improving everyone's information about what's out there and what's really happened.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Yes, we did have the convention, the UN convention on rights for persons with disabilities

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
that acknowledged it in 2005, 2006.

08:58.000 --> 09:04.000
But again, it doesn't necessarily mention anything about web accessibility.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
It talks about how people should uphold the rights of people with disabilities

09:08.000 --> 09:12.000
by providing them with dignity, respect and livelihood.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
But nothing specifically on the web.

09:15.000 --> 09:21.000
But it was still an important aspect which was signed together by different UN countries

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
at the New York headquarters in 2007.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
Yes, the US is...

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
I feel like it's an example where a lot of the aspects have happened in a very reactive measure.

09:41.000 --> 09:49.000
Because there have been reactions of lawsuits and people just suing different people

09:49.000 --> 10:00.000
which is what has led to the ADA Act being so strong when it comes to finding organizations.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
And I'll perhaps go a bit...

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
I'm not going to go into the details of how it came about and what happened,

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
but I can go ahead and talk a little bit about lawsuits.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
And there have been hundreds of them.

10:11.000 --> 10:17.000
Target has been one which had a class action lawsuit damage of 6 million.

10:17.000 --> 10:22.000
You can also see Bed Bath and Beyond, Home Depot, Domino's Pizza.

10:22.000 --> 10:26.000
Surprisingly, a lot of educational institutions as well.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Harvard, Massachusetts and Netflix.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
And for something very basic, for not providing close captioning.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
Even when I fly now, I would still see a lot of the entertainment content.

10:35.000 --> 10:42.000
Only 5 to 10% of them have close captioning or any sort of captioning that makes it disability-friendly.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.000
What I do will know that I do have a local airline that I enjoy flying a lot

10:46.000 --> 10:51.000
which finally had sign language interpretation and translation.

10:51.000 --> 10:56.000
But yeah, there really is a long way to go there.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
We've also had...

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh, okay.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
So I have 5 more minutes.

11:01.000 --> 11:09.000
So yeah, in 2014 FedEx was also sued by a US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

11:09.000 --> 11:16.000
And in 2005, you also had the National Association of Deaf that stepped in and supported it.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
And FedEx actually came back and said that we're so sorry.

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
We don't actually have the money to be able to comply with these aspects.

11:22.000 --> 11:27.000
But then anyways, they had to pay damages in perhaps a few millions.

11:27.000 --> 11:37.000
But I mean the idea, what I'm also trying to get at is that a lot of these companies have the opportunity to be able to make amends but they don't.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
And yeah, so a lot of...

11:40.000 --> 11:44.000
And perhaps a lot of the culture also...

11:44.000 --> 11:48.000
You have a lot of other governments that are following suit.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
You have Canada.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
You can see as an example of the Accessibility Act which they passed.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.000
But it only complies with government or the public sector that has to comply with the basic level of accessibility.

12:01.000 --> 12:09.000
You can also see that in the EU where you have a lot of the accessibility requirements for ICT products and services.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
They specifically...

12:10.000 --> 12:15.000
I do believe they have a provision where they mention certain aspects of accessibility.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I'm just reading the clause.

12:17.000 --> 12:28.000
They do have access of accessibility where they talk about everyone adhering to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 level A for clarification.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
They also talk about...

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
But again, it only applies to public sector bodies.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
So anyone in the non-profit space, civil society or private sector gets by.

12:37.000 --> 12:41.000
But then what are these content accessibility guidelines?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
So they basically...

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Again, when we talk to you, we're not doing anything new.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
We're not reinventing the wheel.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
We're just adhering to things that have always been there.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.000
The World Wide Web Consortium has a Web Accessibility Initiative which anyone can join.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
Anyone can sign up.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
They create content.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
They also create...

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
And they for a very long time...

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 was passed in October.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
So they've been around a long time from the 1980s.

13:11.000 --> 13:24.000
They build curriculum and they build directives and they will guidelines on how things across the world, Web interfaces can be more accessible, understandable.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
So they have...

13:26.000 --> 13:32.000
Currently the guidelines has four principles, 13 guidelines and three levels of accessibility.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
And I can talk about...

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
We won't have time to talk going about into the principles and guidelines,

13:38.000 --> 13:47.000
but then we can move a little bit into examples of what is A-level accessibility, AA accessibility, AAA accessibility.

13:47.000 --> 13:52.000
Most of the public sector government websites across the world,

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
whether it's ADA or whether it's the Canadian legislation,

13:55.000 --> 14:01.000
or even within the EU, they have to adhere to AA guidelines.

14:01.000 --> 14:07.000
And in the US, I think with the ADA and with the implementation of the ADA,

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
the legislation is such that you will get fined until you're able to achieve that specific criteria.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
So one of the...

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
I know this is...

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
I know it's a cheesy example, but this is one of my favorite examples.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
This is the accessibility statement from the White House,

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
which talks about their ongoing accessibility efforts and the criteria that they follow.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
And how people...

14:32.000 --> 14:39.000
And they also mention the different disability aspects, whether it's sensory, cognitive, vision.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I think it's a great example.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
So yeah, I'm going to talk a little bit about...

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
I'm sorry for rushing, but then I just want to ensure that I can also show you some examples.

14:52.000 --> 14:59.000
But yeah, we talk about four tenants under the content accessibility guidelines,

14:59.000 --> 15:06.000
a perceivable where we want our users to be able to perceive and are able to look...

15:06.000 --> 15:11.000
Are able to sense, use one or more of their senses to be able to see the content,

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
whether it's...

15:12.000 --> 15:18.000
And then you talk about operable where users should be able to also control the UI elements,

15:18.000 --> 15:22.000
whether it's buttons or using a keyboard or a mouse.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.000
And robust is the content must be well adopted to the current standards that we have,

15:28.000 --> 15:32.000
whether it's functioning across different browsers and applications.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
And understandable is, of course, the content must be comprehensible to its users.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
So some examples.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
This is alternative text.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
It's a level A example where it's a textual substitute for a non-text in web pages.

15:48.000 --> 15:53.000
It focuses on images, but it also applies to multimedia and other content.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
So it also serves many functions.

15:55.000 --> 16:00.000
It can also be seen with screen readers that announce alternative text in place of images,

16:00.000 --> 16:04.000
helping users with visual cognitive disabilities.

16:04.000 --> 16:13.000
And also in cases of places where you don't have a high quality of service or low bandwidth with internet.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.000
If an image fails to load, then the browser will represent the alternative text visually in search of it.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Okay, I'm going to end.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
So this is an example of alternative text, closed captioning examples.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I'm going to end with this.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Can I play a YouTube video?

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
I wanted to show them an example.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.000
You cannot play audio through the system.

16:36.000 --> 16:40.000
You can try and turn up my laptop audio as high as it will go.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
Okay, can you mind playing this?

16:42.000 --> 16:45.000
Because this is the example of audio descriptions.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.000
Audio description is an example of...

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Audio description, this is again level A.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Maybe you can hear.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
There's no volume though.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
Oh, give me a tissue. It's got my Bluetooth headphones.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Oh, no. It's fine.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.000
I think it's because it's going through the HDMI.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I don't think you're going to get audio.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
No, maybe through this one.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
Yeah, you could maybe play and turn the volume all the way up.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Yeah, one second.

17:21.000 --> 17:26.000
Because it's, you know, in the...

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
How do I...

17:28.000 --> 17:31.000
Oh, no, I get it. I get it.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Okay, enough.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.000
Wait, and this is...

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
Do I just play this and they can see this?

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
I can now, they can hear them.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.000
I will... Okay, ready? Go.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
Okay, go.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Can you hear?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
Hello!

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
He takes a deep sniff.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
The snowman smiles and moves to Walter.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
The hatchet is running on the spot.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
The wind up full-fledged his chin.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
The snowman leaves his arms a clutch.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
The reindeer puddles his front legs.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.000
Head over heels, the snowman pulls the...

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
The reindeer does the breast drop.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.000
The snowman rolls his body with flips onto his back.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
The reindeer's tongue is just to the ice.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
The snowman holds his head, twig on, the reindeer nips,

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
target the carrot.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
The carrot flies off and lands on soft snow.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
The reindeer goes after it with the snowman

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
at his body parts hanging on his tail.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.000
The snowman puts himself back together again

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
and the only point of it is his nose, this state.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.000
The reindeer jams the carrot back in place

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
at hands like a crowd of happy people.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.000
The snowman plans if he sticks the other end

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
then goes to sneeze.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
The carrot is nose with both hands.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
His head shrinks off first.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
That's my turn.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
Okay, and with that, thank you so much.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
I'm just gonna...

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Yes, thank you so much for listening.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
I'm sorry for being a bit rushed,

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
but if anyone has any questions...

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
APPLAUSE

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Also, if you are an open source tool,

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
we'd be happy to do an assessment and audit.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
We even do trainings where we go a little more deep dive

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
into success and fail criteria of what goes on.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Please do reach out to us.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
You have my QR code here.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Hopefully it's easier for you.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
But thank you so much for listening and joining.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
And if there's anyone who has any questions,

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
maybe do we have three minutes?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Anyone at all?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Yes?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I just tried.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
There is no access to the detract.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
For the first time, maybe you or someone

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
in this room may want to organize one next year

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
because as someone said earlier,

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
I think we're presented.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
We are all...

20:10.000 --> 20:14.000
As we get older, we will all get more and more disabilities.

20:14.000 --> 20:18.000
And actually, like most of them have already had one.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Which is pretty obvious.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.000
I couldn't drive the night because of my glasses.

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
So I wonder if next year we could have an accessibility trial.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
That would be really nice.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Yeah, if you have that.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Thank you for that.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
Thank you for the recording.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Just what the question-asker said.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
No, I said we'll be happy to look into it.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
Can you hear that?

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
I said we'll be happy to look into that.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Thank you so much for the suggestion.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
Our idea is that we want to build a culture of accessibility

20:54.000 --> 20:58.000
throughout, especially in the open-source tool space

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
because it's free, it's easily available,

21:00.000 --> 21:04.000
and also abiding by the principles of making it more accessible

21:04.000 --> 21:08.000
for people with different disabilities.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
Yes, please.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Well, this is not true just to your presentation.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.000
Well, in general, since you mentioned that,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
I want to make the open-source community more accessible.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
One thing I noticed is that every single talk that I've been to today

21:24.000 --> 21:29.000
is that I'm not sure, like, I can hear what's going on,

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
but then the slides and the presentations are not, like,

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
loaded ahead of time, so then there's no way I can follow along.

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
I've just played, someone just be like,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
oh, yeah, you can look at this and that,

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
and I'm like, what is this?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
One big issue there.

21:45.000 --> 21:50.000
And I know that they saw the news out there after,

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
but I really don't go back to it to look at this one again.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
We'll be less sloppy next time.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
Thank you.
