WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Okay, so let's go.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Okay, so thank you very much.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
So I'm very happy to be here with you today and I will give an overview about the

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
Alton project. So as far as I'm concerned, I am a professor at the University

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Catholic of Rueval and Heuve, not very far away from here.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.000
And I've been working on this Alton project for a long time.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.000
So before diving into the project, I will talk a bit about how medical imaging

00:35.000 --> 00:41.000
works in hospitals. So everything is built around what is called the DICON standard.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.000
So whenever you are going to do PET scan, CT scan, MRI scan or whatever,

00:47.000 --> 00:53.000
all of your images are captured by the modality and sent to a large database

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
in the hospital that is called the PACS, the picture archiving and communication system.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Then the radiologist comes into play and they write a report about the case they see

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
and then the images are sent back to the patients, to the general practitioners

01:09.000 --> 01:15.000
through web portals typically. And also there can be specialized devices

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
of our applications that connect to the PACS in order to apply for instance

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
artificial intelligence, algorithms and so on. So what is very nice in medical imaging

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000
is that everything is driven according to one open standard that is called the DICON standard.

01:31.000 --> 01:39.000
So DICON rules everything in medical imaging, the imaging devices and the viewers,

01:39.000 --> 01:47.000
but also the PACS server. And you must also know that DICON is not only inside the big imaging

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
but it is also part of the small imaging for instance with mammographies,

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
with ecographies, with CT scans, with radiographs and so on.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
And it is also used in veterinary applications.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.000
And DICON is really two things. It's first, the file formats.

02:07.000 --> 02:14.000
So you can think of it as a kind of a GPEG image with metadata that describes the acquisition

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
of the patients, the physicians and so on. Plus a network protocol.

02:19.000 --> 02:27.000
It may look a bit outdated as a network protocol because it was designed almost 40 years ago,

02:27.000 --> 02:33.000
but still it is commonly used nowadays and it is used to send images between the different

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
modalities, to search the contents of remote modalities, to retrieve data and so on.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
So everything is built around this DICON standard.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
And now what is the Orton project?

02:45.000 --> 02:53.000
Actually the Orton project has its roots in my post doc at the University Hospital of Liège

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
where we wanted to get back in control with our medical imaging workflows.

02:58.000 --> 03:05.000
Because at that time we wanted to treat machine learning applications and we came to the conclusion

03:05.000 --> 03:12.000
that the different modalities that we had inside the hospital were not very easy to use

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
and so we needed to create one new platform that was called Ortonc.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
So the first release of Ortonc was in 2012 and it was released as the first free and open

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
source DICON server that just starts out of the box and that has a REST API.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.000
Now there are other DICON servers in the free software community that also provides such features

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
but ArtOrtonc was one of the first.

03:40.000 --> 03:47.000
So the basic idea behind Ortonc is that we wanted to create a micro service that is available

03:47.000 --> 03:53.000
as free software in order to foster and share the knowledge about DICON.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
And nowadays the main use cases of Ortonc are threefold.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.000
First, Ortonc is a DICON server that can be used as a PAX.

04:03.000 --> 04:11.000
It is commonly used to route images between hospitals and between sites for instance for doing research,

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
for doing the applications of artificial intelligence algorithms and so on.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
And we have also tele-radiology portals.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.000
So here you see the main user interface of Ortonc.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.000
It is translated in different languages, not only in English, French,

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
I think there is also a Spanish translation and a Russian one.

04:32.000 --> 04:39.000
And so the main features of Ortonc are the fact that it is very lightweight.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
You can start very easily an instance of Ortonc on your laptop.

04:43.000 --> 04:52.000
And it is an industrial grade, large-scale project with over 400,000 lines of codes.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.000
We do have tele-radiology solutions that are built inside Ortonc.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
So you can, when you install Ortonc, have many different viewers like those ones.

05:02.000 --> 05:09.000
2D viewers but also 3D volumetrics rendering and also stuff that are very specialized

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
and that are focused on nuclear medicine and radiotherapy.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Ortonc is really deployed in actual hospitals.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
Here for instance you have screenshots of an hospital in Malaysia that runs Ortonc

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
for all of its medical imaging workflows.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
Installing Ortonc is very easy.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.000
You just, if you are using a proprietary ecosystem,

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
you just have to download the installer and it will work.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
But you can also use Docker, Kubernetes and so on.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
Now I will just show you some advanced features because I don't have much time

05:43.000 --> 05:47.000
but if you want you can get in touch with me if you want some demonstration.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
We have support for digital pathologies, images which are very large images

05:53.000 --> 05:57.000
and we want to publish them in a web browser.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
We can automate workflows notably using Python.

06:02.000 --> 06:07.000
So we have the possibility of writing Python scripts like this one

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
that allow to route images between the different modalities inside the hospital.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
I would also like to mention the fact that physicians are nowadays very excited

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
by artificial intelligence, obviously.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
And for them it is something that is very magic and it is very good

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
but from my perspective as a computer scientist I just see a black box.

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
So I'm not very happy with this

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
because now if you ever look at the number of artificial intelligence algorithms

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
for radiology, there are hundreds of them.

06:38.000 --> 06:43.000
But there is no knowledge sharing about those ones.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
So people don't know how to use those artificial intelligence as end users.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
We do have a lot of open source libraries, open source models, open access models and so on

06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
but the general audience cannot deploy and run those algorithms easily on their own computers,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
on their own infrastructure.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
So we are working on this and for instance here you have a research project

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
that was published one year ago where we used WebAssembly in order to run deep learning models

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
directly inside the web browser.

07:17.000 --> 07:23.000
So this means that it is a fully open ecosystem that is secure by design

07:23.000 --> 07:27.000
because everything is run by the laptop of the physician

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
and you don't have to install anything.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Everything comes with Ortonc.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.000
It is a C++ software so you don't have any dependency

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
and it can run even on Microsoft Windows 7.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
So we are very proud of it.

07:42.000 --> 07:49.000
Here you have an instance of Azor, a research project we have with Musea.

07:49.000 --> 07:58.000
So we treat 3D images of bones, of human bones and it is used for cultural heritage.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
So it is one of our research projects nowadays.

08:01.000 --> 08:08.000
We use, as I mentioned earlier, the different viewers in order to do nuclear medicine and radiotherapy.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
So just now to the conclusion, thanks you for the reminding.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
We have here a recognized project with a worldwide community.

08:17.000 --> 08:23.000
As Gérald mentioned, we are very friends with the global community.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
We are a digital public good so with the 3 and 9 goals.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
We have been recognized by the Free Software Foundation

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
and so our mission statement is to freely share the knowledge about medical imaging

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
including about artificial intelligence

08:39.000 --> 08:43.000
because I think it is really something that is very important nowadays.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
So thanks for the attention.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
We share the Q&A session I think.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
We have time for a few questions here for these two speakers

08:56.000 --> 09:00.000
because they got together and merged their two things.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
We have a quick question.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
So we were talking about human health and that you would like to have a European

09:06.000 --> 09:09.000
or questioning how to get a human.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
What do you think is the limiting factor?

09:11.000 --> 09:18.000
Is it big hospitals being afraid of not having a commercial entity delivering it

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
during the support of what is limiting?

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Why don't we have this?

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
I would say just three words, third, fear, uncertainty and doubt.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
People are not comfortable with open source and with Free Software

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
simply because they are not used to use them.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
I am pretty sure that every hospital in all their infrastructure

09:41.000 --> 09:45.000
use Free Software, Postgres, MySQL and so on.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.000
Every hospital in the world already uses Free Software

09:49.000 --> 09:56.000
but they are not aware about the equivalent software for the medical uses.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Yes, there was a question.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
Can you show me the side view so that you can actually pan and zoom in to the map?

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Yes, yes, of course.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
If you want, I can show you.

10:10.000 --> 10:17.000
So the files, you don't have to import large files.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
You can just leave the files where they are and just browse through them, right?

10:21.000 --> 10:27.000
Yes, the question was, is there a need to bring all the entire volume

10:27.000 --> 10:33.000
which is quite a heavy weight volume of data inside your own computer in order to see them?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
So the answer is no.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Actually, not for this viewer.

10:39.000 --> 10:46.000
It is a tele-radiology viewer which means that we only download one to this slide at a time.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
We don't know the full volume.

10:48.000 --> 10:53.000
But here, in this case, we do have to download the full volume.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
Yes.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Yes.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Yes.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Do you have examples?

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
I'm sorry, I have problems with my ears.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
So you're getting started with Docker or some of the windows.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Yes.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.000
Do you also have example images that we can use out of the box to play with it?

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Oh, yes.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
We do have a web server, for instance.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Can you repeat the question?

11:24.000 --> 11:29.000
Sorry, the question was, is there sample images for DICOM?

11:29.000 --> 11:45.000
If you go to the demo website, if I open the web interface, then I have the possibility here to download a zip file.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
And so you can just download the image.

11:48.000 --> 11:54.000
But it is open access images, so you could find them elsewhere.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yes.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm just going to call that the software thing used in the UDT.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Oh, sorry.

12:01.000 --> 12:09.000
When your software is being used for diagnostic purposes, does that mean that you need to have effectively FDA certification or a class 2 medical?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Is that anything that you're thinking of?

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
So, at once, so, S, Gerard, sorry.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.000
Good.

12:16.000 --> 12:26.000
So the question is, do we need an FDA or CE approval in order to use this inside the hospital?

12:26.000 --> 12:29.000
So you already mentioned this.

12:29.000 --> 12:36.000
The answer is you don't necessarily have to have this regulation.

12:36.000 --> 12:42.000
People, physicians can decide to take the risk of using a free software.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
They can always decide this.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
It is up to them to decide.

12:46.000 --> 12:55.000
If they don't want to take the risk, then they want to have someone in the commercial entity to take the risk at their place.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
And that's what, that's the meaning of the regulation, actually.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.000
It is to give the risk to someone else.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
Actually, that's the essence of the certification.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
So, if I can jump onto that.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Yes.

13:11.000 --> 13:20.000
Even the big commercial players do not want to be seen as a medical device because that entails that all your source code needs to be audited.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
So it's not only, it's not that it's a problem for open source.

13:24.000 --> 13:30.000
Even the commercial parties, they do not want to be seen as a medical device and they're actively fighting with them.

13:30.000 --> 13:36.000
And it is also important that Gnuels and Ortonc are not medical devices.

13:36.000 --> 13:44.000
We are not, we are at the class zero, just like Microsoft Windows is a zero class medical software.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
The, oh, I'm sorry.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
We have to repeat what he said.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.000
We can.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.000
Oh.

13:50.000 --> 13:55.000
So we, so the commercial, please do.

13:55.000 --> 14:02.000
So the commercial players also don't have the interest to get classified as medical device.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
That was what he said.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Yes.

14:05.000 --> 14:28.000
And I was telling that you, the, the DICOM viewer, I've, I've shown you this kind of stuff can be considered as medical device at the moment that the physician uses the, uses the software to do some diagnosis or some treatment on the patients.

14:28.000 --> 14:33.000
If it is just to inform a people, there is no regulation needed.

14:33.000 --> 14:38.000
For instance, a web publication portal doesn't need any kind of certification.

14:38.000 --> 14:50.000
But if the web, the tele-radiology portal is used to make a diagnosis, then you come into the class two medical software.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
So, sorry.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
One last question.

14:54.000 --> 15:07.000
Yes.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
Yes, yes.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
We are actually, I have one of my researchers.

15:10.000 --> 15:20.000
So the question is, can we extend this kind of models in order to do explainable AI inside?

15:20.000 --> 15:21.000
So the answer is yes.

15:21.000 --> 15:32.000
And actually I have, for instance, one of my researchers who works on mammography in order to create explainable models that can be run in any computer.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.000
So that's, that's one of our goals in the next few months.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
Thanks.

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
Thank you both, Sebastian and Eira.

15:45.000 --> 15:49.000
We have a session that up until 10 minutes ago wasn't in the schedule.
