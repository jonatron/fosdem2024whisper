WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.040
Thank you.

00:06.040 --> 00:11.200
So well, this is an open source conference and I'm going to talk to you about ads on

00:11.200 --> 00:14.920
Facebook ads of all things and then the Meta API.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.120
So please let me explain.

00:17.120 --> 00:23.760
Well, so I'm Jean-Glennard, I'm working at Viginum and Viginum is a French operational

00:23.760 --> 00:32.640
department, technical department aiming at analyzing foreign digital interference.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.840
So we have three big missions.

00:35.840 --> 00:43.200
The first one is to detect and analyze this foreign information manipulation and interferences

00:43.200 --> 00:46.120
and the social media and online.

00:46.120 --> 00:52.080
Then we also lead and coordinate the French protection mechanism against these attacks.

00:52.080 --> 00:59.200
And finally, we also contribute to international works and in particular European works to

00:59.200 --> 01:03.280
study and understand these foreign digital interferences.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.280
So that's why I'm here today.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.000
And why do we care about ads?

01:08.000 --> 01:12.880
Well, of course, it's hard to talk about ads on Facebook without talking about Cambridge

01:12.880 --> 01:14.400
Analytica.

01:14.400 --> 01:20.360
So it was a micro targeting scandal, very well known because of the involvement in the

01:20.360 --> 01:23.120
Trump campaign in 2016.

01:23.120 --> 01:30.240
And then there was a high suspicion of involvement in Brexit and possibly in other campaigns,

01:30.240 --> 01:31.240
other elections.

01:31.240 --> 01:35.920
And there might be other companies like Cambridge Analytica.

01:35.920 --> 01:41.480
So historically, this is really a big thing in this information world.

01:41.480 --> 01:48.240
But obviously, after these events, Facebook made some steps to provide some transparency

01:48.240 --> 01:51.440
in that advertisement empire.

01:51.440 --> 01:59.240
And they did open a web portal to at least let people know what were the ads that could

01:59.240 --> 02:01.880
target people.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.720
And then we had other operations.

02:04.720 --> 02:10.160
And this is a long running operation, the Doppelganger.

02:10.160 --> 02:17.560
This operation was already fully reported in September 2022 by EU in the fallout.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.320
And it was linked by Meta at the time to Russia.

02:21.320 --> 02:27.720
So this is actually a screenshot at the left of the web portal where you can see the ads.

02:27.720 --> 02:35.440
And those are free fake pages sending the same ad with the aim of polarizing opinion.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.240
And basically trying to manipulate the opinion.

02:40.240 --> 02:45.520
And then the campaign re-suffaced with another shape.

02:45.520 --> 02:50.160
And we made a report on this in June 2023.

02:50.160 --> 02:58.200
And this time, it was like a big network of typosquad websites and media, like big media

02:58.200 --> 03:01.000
in Europe, also governmental sites.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.880
There were like thousands and thousands of Twitter bots and still Facebook ads.

03:07.880 --> 03:11.120
And you see here a screenshot at the top.

03:11.120 --> 03:18.400
And then there was this report in October 2023 by Resets focusing really on the Facebook

03:18.400 --> 03:20.280
ads part of things.

03:20.280 --> 03:26.440
And they found what they estimate to be hundreds of thousands of sleeper pages, pages that

03:26.440 --> 03:31.240
could be mobilized to send fake advertisements to people.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.920
That was in like a few months ago.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.440
So this thing is really going on and on and on.

03:37.480 --> 03:42.880
And this is actually a screenshot from last week when I was making this presentation.

03:42.880 --> 03:50.520
So you see it's always the same thing, disseminating advertisements with the aim to polarize and

03:50.520 --> 03:52.680
provide fake information to people.

03:52.680 --> 03:56.160
So that's why we care about ads.

03:56.160 --> 03:57.160
All right.

03:57.160 --> 04:03.440
So the aim of the talk is to see how open are Facebook ads.

04:03.440 --> 04:11.280
And the first half is about how to, a practical guide, how we can actually access this data.

04:11.280 --> 04:17.680
And then I'm going to show you some analysis of what we can infer from this data.

04:17.680 --> 04:21.560
So there are three official ways to access the data.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.320
The first one is the daily report.

04:24.320 --> 04:31.880
So basically you don't load a CSV file from a website, like there's a screenshot at the

04:32.000 --> 04:34.200
top right here.

04:34.200 --> 04:39.320
And it's very limited because it's only ads that are labeled as political.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.640
So it's really a tiny fraction of the ads.

04:42.640 --> 04:45.440
Then you have the web portal.

04:45.440 --> 04:52.080
On the web portal you can see, you can target like specific country, a specific ad category,

04:52.080 --> 04:56.320
enter some filters, filter by date, and then you see the ads.

04:56.320 --> 04:58.880
And you have to scroll through all the ads.

04:58.880 --> 05:06.800
So it's nice, but it's hard to do data science with this because it's slow and it's finicky.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.560
It's not usable like for real analysis.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.040
You also have the API.

05:12.040 --> 05:18.240
So I'm going to talk a lot about that, where you can actually plug into the data and access

05:18.240 --> 05:19.240
it.

05:19.240 --> 05:23.320
But then it requires registration and coding skills.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.680
And finally, there is this open source project.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.120
And I really wanted to talk about it because it's great.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.680
It's actually an ongoing mirror of the Facebook ad library.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.920
And you will see the code online.

05:36.920 --> 05:41.200
And you can kind of understand how you can access the API just by looking at the code.

05:41.200 --> 05:45.400
And then there are data dumps hosted on Kaggle and other platforms.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.240
So it's really a great project.

05:47.240 --> 05:52.000
It's not official, but it's a great source of information.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
All right.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
So the how to path.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.560
To access the data with the API, you have to verify as a meta developer.

05:59.560 --> 06:04.880
And for that, you need to provide your cell phone or your debit or credit card information.

06:04.880 --> 06:06.960
And then you have to go through another step.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.440
And you have to verify your government ID.

06:10.440 --> 06:14.400
In my case, I had to send both my ID card on my passport.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.360
Because the first one was rejected.

06:17.360 --> 06:21.120
And it's kind of ironic because if you want to just send an ad, they just ask you for

06:21.120 --> 06:22.120
the debit card.

06:22.120 --> 06:24.840
They don't ask you for anything else.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.320
All right.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.680
So now you have access to the API.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.680
What can you do?

06:30.680 --> 06:36.640
Well, there is pretty good documentation, but it doesn't document the most important

06:36.640 --> 06:38.640
thing, which is the wild card.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.120
It's not just wild card thing.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.560
It's double quote, wild card, double quote.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.800
And with this, you don't have to specify a topic of interest.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.880
You can actually get all the ads.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.280
And then you can work on it.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.520
So it's quite interesting.

06:51.520 --> 06:55.440
And then there are two things that I found a bit counterintuitive.

06:55.440 --> 07:03.800
You have somewhat unspecified quota when you're associated with each token that you have.

07:03.800 --> 07:08.040
And it's like a daily refresh of the quota of ads that you can get.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.640
But then you don't have a limit on the number of tokens that you can create.

07:11.640 --> 07:17.040
So you can just create as many tokens as you want and then get all the ads that you want.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.040
That's the first thing.

07:18.040 --> 07:24.080
And the second thing is that when you ask, like in your request for the ads, you have

07:24.080 --> 07:27.080
to specify how many ads you want back.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.360
So there is a pagination system.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.680
And by default, it's something like 20 or 50.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.400
So it's kind of very low.

07:34.400 --> 07:40.920
But if you ask for a pagination that is too high, then you're just going to have an error.

07:40.920 --> 07:45.640
And the error depends on the size of the text of the ads.

07:45.640 --> 07:50.440
So then you have to try again with a different limit.

07:50.440 --> 07:55.240
So actually, it requires coding to really get the data.

07:55.240 --> 07:59.080
So that's two things I wanted to mention.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.280
All right.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.120
So go through the verification process.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.520
You get your code working.

08:06.520 --> 08:11.800
And this is what you see when you look at the ads in French language and targeting friends.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.840
So kind of a limit is called.

08:13.840 --> 08:19.200
One third of the ads are sent on Facebook, one third on Instagram.

08:19.200 --> 08:24.760
And then the remaining ads are split evenly between Messenger and Audient's network.

08:24.760 --> 08:31.680
Audient's network is kind of, they provide some kind of software thingy so that people

08:31.680 --> 08:39.800
creating mobile apps can send ads and build upon meta like ad system.

08:39.800 --> 08:46.320
So yeah, when you open your mobile app and there is some ad on it, it might use this

08:46.320 --> 08:48.720
Audient's network thing.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.880
So most of it is Facebook and Instagram.

08:51.880 --> 08:57.200
And then when you look at the volume of ads through time, well, you see there's almost

08:57.200 --> 09:00.640
nothing up to mid-2023.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.120
And then you have data.

09:03.120 --> 09:09.160
When people see this thing first, they think, oh, Facebook, they removed data.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.640
And actually it's not that simple.

09:11.640 --> 09:13.640
Actually it's the opposite.

09:13.640 --> 09:21.080
They made a change in the API sometimes in July of 2023 and they really started to make

09:21.080 --> 09:22.720
the data available.

09:22.720 --> 09:29.320
Because prior to that point, only the social issues, elections or politics ads were available.

09:29.320 --> 09:36.520
And then starting in July of 2023, you have housing and employment, credit and most importantly,

09:36.520 --> 09:41.280
the bulk of the ads, like more than 95% of the ads is non-labelled.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.520
So it's actually a good thing that happened a bit more than six months ago because now

09:45.520 --> 09:51.040
we have the data to analyze.

09:51.040 --> 09:56.800
And well, so we've been talking a bit more, we have been talking a bit about the social

09:56.800 --> 09:58.880
issues, elections or politics.

09:58.880 --> 10:03.200
I'm going to give you a bit more information on that.

10:03.200 --> 10:07.200
So it's completely self-declared category.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.680
So this is actually a screenshot.

10:08.680 --> 10:15.360
I went through the process to publish an ad and stopped at the last moment.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.920
And you can check the box if you want.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.840
But then there is absolutely no enhancement mechanism if you don't want to check that

10:22.840 --> 10:23.840
box.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.880
So it's purely self-declared category.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.080
Of course, if you check the box, then you're going to probably have your ID, maybe there

10:30.080 --> 10:35.200
will be more scrutiny of your ad, maybe more moderation.

10:35.200 --> 10:39.920
So obviously, people that want to do this information campaign are not going to check

10:39.920 --> 10:43.160
the ad.

10:43.160 --> 10:52.880
But can we make a model that would tell if an ad should actually have checked the box,

10:52.880 --> 10:57.480
should have declared itself as political?

10:57.760 --> 11:03.080
That model could be used to identify the doppelganger ads I've been showing you.

11:03.080 --> 11:09.960
And it could also be used to estimate the volume of ads that should be labeled as social

11:09.960 --> 11:12.920
issues, elections or politics.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.440
So actually, we can.

11:14.440 --> 11:18.560
And I'm going to show you how I built one.

11:18.560 --> 11:23.400
But just at this point, how many French ads we should expect to be social issues, elections

11:23.400 --> 11:24.640
or politics?

11:24.640 --> 11:28.600
We do have some ideas from past work.

11:28.600 --> 11:34.760
So in Brazil, this work, academic work, found 2.2% mislabeling.

11:34.760 --> 11:39.080
So non-labelled ads that should be social issues, elections or politics.

11:39.080 --> 11:46.240
And that other academic work found 2% to 4% mislabeling in the US.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.240
So the same thing.

11:47.240 --> 11:50.680
Non-labelled ads that should have been labelled.

11:51.680 --> 12:00.040
Okay, so to build the model, what we need is some data and then some technical way to

12:00.040 --> 12:01.880
build a classifier.

12:01.880 --> 12:06.000
So the data I used is from this academic paper.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.840
And it's great because it's in French language, but then you have other data sets in English

12:09.840 --> 12:12.800
and in other languages.

12:12.800 --> 12:19.640
So that's my data sets containing real political ads.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.040
And then we also need a classifier.

12:22.040 --> 12:26.680
So I'm using a large language model because everyone is doing that these days.

12:26.680 --> 12:33.400
And I took specifically the Mistro AI 7B model and I optimized it with the Unclosed Library

12:33.400 --> 12:36.640
because it's very fast and it's open source.

12:36.640 --> 12:43.800
And just to give you another magnitude, it takes one hour on a free to use Google collab

12:43.800 --> 12:44.800
instance.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.720
So it's actually quite quick.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.720
Anybody can do it.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.600
Like resources and GPU or whatnot.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.160
All right.

12:54.160 --> 12:56.320
To dig a bit more in the process.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.360
So to be really clear about what was done.

12:59.360 --> 13:04.680
So we have this data set of 4,000 something political ads.

13:04.680 --> 13:10.200
And it was collected in 2022 during the French presidential campaign.

13:10.200 --> 13:16.000
And it actually categorized the data into nine topics.

13:16.000 --> 13:22.040
Could be energy, social issues, these kind of categories.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.480
And then we need some control.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.800
We need to separate political from non-political.

13:27.800 --> 13:35.520
And for the control, I just collected random data in the French scope in late 2023 and

13:35.520 --> 13:37.480
targeting the non-labeled ads.

13:37.480 --> 13:43.000
So I expect some contamination because some of these non-labeled ads should be political.

13:43.000 --> 13:48.120
But I expect it to be kind of marginal, not so important in my data set and it's not going

13:48.120 --> 13:52.200
to kind of prevent the model from learning.

13:52.200 --> 13:56.120
But anyway, I will have a little bit of performance hits.

13:56.120 --> 14:01.960
Then I split into train and test and I finetune my Mistro AI model.

14:01.960 --> 14:10.000
And to finetune the Mistro AI model, I wanted to predict between one of these nine categories

14:10.000 --> 14:12.200
or non-political.

14:12.200 --> 14:19.360
And I do that to get a bit better results than if I just wanted to instruct the model

14:19.360 --> 14:22.520
to predict between political and non-political.

14:22.520 --> 14:28.880
Because then the model has to kind of think a bit harder about why it's political.

14:28.880 --> 14:34.000
So it's kind of to improve the overall accuracy.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.480
And actually, the results were good because I got more than 90% precision.

14:37.480 --> 14:40.160
It was a very good recall as well.

14:40.160 --> 14:42.120
So I was very happy at this point.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.320
And then how can we actually use it?

14:44.320 --> 14:49.600
Well, the first test is on the doppelganger ads.

14:49.600 --> 14:55.080
So that's another example here on the top of the ads, top right.

14:55.080 --> 15:01.560
And I got actually perfect classification on this because the text is so obviously political

15:01.560 --> 15:04.280
that there is no doubt about it.

15:04.280 --> 15:10.040
So all these ads, as I said, are non-labelled by Facebook.

15:10.040 --> 15:14.960
And then the model says that they should all be political with focus on international

15:14.960 --> 15:15.960
affairs.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.720
So yeah, it's working well.

15:17.720 --> 15:21.760
And in case you're interested, that's the prompt that I use.

15:21.760 --> 15:29.280
So prompt in English asking to categorize into one of the nine categories or other.

15:29.280 --> 15:31.040
So non-political.

15:31.040 --> 15:35.440
That's the advertisement text in French.

15:35.440 --> 15:40.560
And you can see that some words actually, they have spaces inside.

15:40.560 --> 15:48.120
So here, chef, it's leader, UE, European Union, there is an underscore.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.880
And negotiate here, there is an underscore.

15:50.880 --> 15:58.600
So it's as if the text is aiming to kind of bypass some keyword detection.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.640
And those ads were not labelled as political.

16:00.640 --> 16:08.000
So maybe this is the kind of moderation, of automatic moderation that Facebook is doing.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.600
Well, I'm happy because my model is able to identify all these ads.

16:12.600 --> 16:18.640
But what if I want to really estimate how many ads beyond those ones should be labelled

16:18.640 --> 16:21.920
as social issues, elections, or politics?

16:21.920 --> 16:30.320
Well, for this, I took a random sample of like general non-labelled ads.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.640
And I ran them through my model.

16:33.640 --> 16:40.120
And then I wanted to really double check that the outcome of the model could be trusted.

16:40.120 --> 16:46.680
So I asked two human annotators trained on MetaGuard lines to really make sure that these

16:46.720 --> 16:52.800
ads should be, according to MetaGuard lines, political, labelled as political.

16:52.800 --> 17:01.520
And I find that at least 1.9% of the non-labelled ads should be labelled as political.

17:01.520 --> 17:08.520
So it's conservative estimate because some political ads might not be flagged by my model.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.680
So it's really at least.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.360
And it's aligned with previous research showing 2 to 4%.

17:13.360 --> 17:15.560
So I'm not so surprised.

17:15.560 --> 17:24.040
It might not seem much, but then if you take 2% of more than 95%, then you see that most

17:24.040 --> 17:26.680
of the political ads are actually non-labelled, right?

17:26.680 --> 17:32.600
Because the labelled political ads is 0.3%, roughly, in the French scope.

17:32.600 --> 17:42.640
So this means that about 15% only of the political ads are labelled as such.

17:42.640 --> 17:43.680
Well, that's about it.

17:43.680 --> 17:52.200
So what we saw is that Facebook gave access to actually data and more and more data.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.200
It can be used.

17:53.200 --> 17:56.520
It's a bit tricky, but at least the data is there.

17:56.520 --> 18:03.440
And here I talked about foreign interference, but this is relevant much more broadly.

18:03.440 --> 18:08.800
Because you see many things in these ads that are not linked to foreign interference at all.

18:08.800 --> 18:13.600
And I think the civil society should kind of look into that.

18:13.600 --> 18:19.200
You have six months of fully open data, and you have this open source mirror that makes

18:19.200 --> 18:25.600
it really easy to at least make sure that you don't miss any ad.

18:25.600 --> 18:31.400
And my belief is that this self-labelling mechanism of social issues, electional politics, is

18:31.400 --> 18:33.240
problematic in itself.

18:33.240 --> 18:39.720
I think for this to work, it needs to be really coupled with a very strong moderation.

18:39.720 --> 18:42.640
And as of now, I don't see this very strong moderation.

18:42.680 --> 18:50.680
So maybe there are other ways that we can really make sure that political ads are not somehow

18:50.680 --> 18:52.480
they don't go unnoticed.

18:52.480 --> 18:53.480
I don't know.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.480
That's about it.

18:55.480 --> 18:58.480
I'm super happy to answer any questions.

18:58.480 --> 18:59.800
Thanks a lot.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.800
Now we can take some questions.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.800
Paul has a question.

19:03.960 --> 19:08.960
The first question is like, you have any idea why this change happened in obvious class

19:08.960 --> 19:09.960
degrees in the NTI?

19:09.960 --> 19:16.960
And the second question is with your model, what do you do with that at the end for the

19:16.960 --> 19:19.960
visionary and the third developer?

19:19.960 --> 19:21.960
When do you use this?

19:21.960 --> 19:22.960
Okay.

19:22.960 --> 19:28.960
So the first question was why didn't Meta kind of gave access to the NTI?

19:28.960 --> 19:35.960
So the first question was why didn't Meta kind of gave access to more data in mid-2023?

19:35.960 --> 19:42.960
And the second part of the question is how do we use it in practice?

19:42.960 --> 19:43.960
Right.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.960
So the first part, I don't know.

19:46.960 --> 19:52.960
It might be linked to the DSA, the Digital Service Act, that is going to come into action

19:52.960 --> 19:53.960
kind of soon.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.960
It might not be linked at all.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.960
I have no insight about that.

19:57.960 --> 20:04.960
And the second part, of course, we try to automatize and to be much more reactive to

20:04.960 --> 20:10.960
really understand more how Facebook ads can be used and easier for these information

20:10.960 --> 20:11.960
purposes.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.960
Any other questions?

20:15.960 --> 20:16.960
Yeah.

20:16.960 --> 20:23.960
Just on the paper you cited there, I can look into it and they use like a more traditional

20:23.960 --> 20:25.960
mass language model.

20:25.960 --> 20:26.960
Yeah.

20:26.960 --> 20:33.960
So why did you choose to use this rather than the probably lighter model?

20:33.960 --> 20:35.960
I don't remember this one.

20:35.960 --> 20:36.960
It was a nice buy.

20:36.960 --> 20:37.960
Sorry.

20:37.960 --> 20:38.960
Yeah.

20:38.960 --> 20:44.960
So the question was, so this paper used a somewhat traditional model, language model, and why

20:44.960 --> 20:46.960
did I use a large language model?

20:46.960 --> 20:48.960
Why go through all those troubles?

20:48.960 --> 20:54.960
If I remember correctly, this one used naive bias, something, or maybe another one.

20:54.960 --> 21:00.960
Well, so for me, large language models are perfect for this task because they embed some

21:00.960 --> 21:02.960
knowledge of the world.

21:02.960 --> 21:12.960
So it's not like it's not thinking only about, oh, in my training dataset, it's all about

21:12.960 --> 21:14.960
Ukraine and Ukraine and Ukraine.

21:14.960 --> 21:19.960
So I'm going to say everything linked to Ukraine is actually political.

21:19.960 --> 21:26.960
It's more broad and it can predict things like this is kind of political and it's about

21:26.960 --> 21:27.960
gender issues.

21:27.960 --> 21:35.960
And then this will be generally valid beyond this or that specific issue that is in the

21:35.960 --> 21:36.960
training set.

21:36.960 --> 21:41.960
So I think the generalization abilities are much better.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.960
I didn't yet.

21:43.960 --> 21:48.960
I tried to do another approach which had other problems.

21:48.960 --> 21:54.960
So I tried an urban approach and with KNN and the data that was also at all.

21:54.960 --> 21:57.960
So I don't have a proper benchmark.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.960
But the results are good.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.960
So why not?

22:01.960 --> 22:03.960
Another question.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.960
After you find a mislabeled X, do you do something about it?

22:06.960 --> 22:08.960
Is there a way to report it?

22:08.960 --> 22:16.960
So the question is if someone finds a mislabeled add, what can they do about it?

22:16.960 --> 22:19.960
Well, it's a bit disappointing.

22:19.960 --> 22:24.960
There is a system and you can click and say this is wrong.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.960
I want to report this add.

22:26.960 --> 22:35.960
But then you have to indicate precisely the law that has been infringed to say why it's

22:35.960 --> 22:36.960
illegal.

22:37.960 --> 22:45.960
So you can easily report something about guns or something outright illegal.

22:45.960 --> 22:50.960
These texts are just information manipulation campaigns.

22:50.960 --> 22:59.960
So I think the reporting mechanism is lacking as of now.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.960
Another question.

23:02.960 --> 23:07.960
If I understood correctly, you are fine training misdraft on text only.

23:07.960 --> 23:12.960
Would it be profitable to use the images because on all your examples there are images.

23:12.960 --> 23:17.960
Can you process that in the future maybe to gain more precise?

23:17.960 --> 23:18.960
Yeah.

23:18.960 --> 23:25.960
So the question is can we also train on the image to have a much better classifier?

23:25.960 --> 23:27.960
Obviously, yes.

23:27.960 --> 23:33.960
Obviously, it's much harder because then you have different other magnitudes of data.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.960
So yeah, we don't do it yet.

23:37.960 --> 23:40.960
I thought it was very interesting.

23:40.960 --> 23:44.960
You mentioned that Facebook needs more moderation.

23:44.960 --> 23:46.960
Where do you foresee that?

23:46.960 --> 23:48.960
What do you see the future of that if it was done well?

23:48.960 --> 23:50.960
Do you see that as something humans do?

23:50.960 --> 23:55.960
Do you see that as something like the models that you've just used or some combination?

23:55.960 --> 23:56.960
All right.

23:56.960 --> 24:03.960
So the question is how could Facebook enhance the moderation?

24:03.960 --> 24:06.960
More hands or more models?

24:06.960 --> 24:07.960
Both.

24:07.960 --> 24:08.960
Both?

24:08.960 --> 24:20.960
Well, both are possible if the hunch is right and if people can really escape moderation just by putting spaces,

24:20.960 --> 24:25.960
then there is obvious improvement in having better models.

24:25.960 --> 24:29.960
Yeah.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.960
It might not be enough.

24:32.960 --> 24:37.960
Can you talk about the content on the propaganda you see?

24:37.960 --> 24:47.960
Can you teach some group that is trying to do some manipulation on people?

24:47.960 --> 24:54.960
So the question is can I go into more details about what was the content of this information?

24:54.960 --> 24:57.960
So I could, but it would take a long time.

24:57.960 --> 25:05.960
I advise you to read all these reports and there is actually a using for lab page where there are at least 10 or so reports

25:05.960 --> 25:07.960
and you will see it's extensive.

25:07.960 --> 25:13.960
It goes in many directions and the information is perfectly available.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.960
I have a question in the back.

25:15.960 --> 25:21.960
From your experience of using the APIs in general,

25:21.960 --> 25:32.960
you know that there is a way to actually associate the ads with the contents that were displayed when they were displayed.

25:32.960 --> 25:33.960
Okay.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.960
So the question is the ad are linked?

25:37.960 --> 25:40.960
I'm not sure I got the question.

25:40.960 --> 25:50.960
Do you have a way with the APIs to actually link the ads that you were studying with the contents that were displayed around the ads?

25:50.960 --> 25:51.960
Oh, okay.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.960
No, no, no.

25:53.960 --> 25:56.960
So the question was can we infer the context?

25:56.960 --> 25:59.960
Why an ad was shown to a user?

25:59.960 --> 26:03.960
Was it because there was calling on some, for example, Ukrainian topic?

26:03.960 --> 26:09.960
Was it something that they did that was not in relationship to Ukraine or whatnot?

26:09.960 --> 26:13.960
No, we don't have this data available at all.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.960
And that would be very precious.

26:15.960 --> 26:20.960
Maybe one last question.

26:20.960 --> 26:34.960
In your experience, from what you've seen, the posts that are displayed for ads are self-contained or they contain links to other platforms.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.960
Yeah, so this report.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.960
So the question was, was it self-contained?

26:39.960 --> 26:47.960
Like was this information only in the ads or was it just a way to have people click and go somewhere else?

26:47.960 --> 26:53.960
So this report in June 2023 really goes in details in what happened.

26:53.960 --> 27:00.960
So actually there was a system of several redirections through different websites.

27:00.960 --> 27:17.960
And then it was JavaScript redirections and then typosquad redirections and then like several layers of redirections to, at the end, bring people to malicious websites where there was more disinformation.

27:17.960 --> 27:18.960
That's the idea.

27:18.960 --> 27:21.960
And technically it was quite interesting to investigate.

27:21.960 --> 27:25.960
So again, if you have time, these reports are fun to read.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.960
Okay, let's thank again Jan.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.960
Thank you.
