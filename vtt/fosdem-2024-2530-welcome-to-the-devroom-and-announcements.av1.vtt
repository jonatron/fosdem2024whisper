Welcome to this year's deaf room on software defined radio and amateur radio.

00:13.080 --> 00:19.040
It's been a bit of, you know, a harsh year for this place.

00:19.040 --> 00:24.160
Actually, we're very happy that we made it here.

00:24.160 --> 00:31.160
Last year, the SCR community didn't have a deaf room at Foster, which was really sad.

00:31.160 --> 00:38.160
And I'm really happy that we didn't have our own deaf room this year, but a deaf room together with the amateur radio community,

00:38.160 --> 00:42.160
which obviously has a lot of overlap.

00:42.160 --> 00:50.160
And so this will be like a slightly more diverse presentation than we might be used to.

00:50.160 --> 00:58.160
This is super nice. I'm Marcus Miller. I'm one of three deaf room organizers.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.160
Do you want to introduce yourself?

01:01.160 --> 01:09.160
I think if I have to, my name is Paul Merr, I'm from Switzerland, obviously.

01:09.160 --> 01:20.160
I'm a software developer and my stuff I do in amateur radio is mostly developing software.

01:20.160 --> 01:30.160
I'm also very happy we're together with the SCR guys here because that's a field of activity for the amateur, so it's very interesting.

01:31.160 --> 01:38.160
Yeah, so obviously, I'm Marcus Miller, maybe known from the radio project.

01:38.160 --> 01:46.160
I'm very happy to work with amateur radio at Jesus because, well, the application follows the tools in other ways.

01:46.160 --> 01:57.160
The third person is, I haven't seen him best year, so I hope he comes in, but we'll start without him.

01:58.160 --> 02:05.160
So a couple of things that I'd like to ask the audience is, of course, clean up after yourself.

02:05.160 --> 02:11.160
So if you leave, look whether you left some bottles or something because otherwise things will get.

02:11.160 --> 02:14.160
Harry, we are not overfilled today, which is a new thing for us.

02:14.160 --> 02:23.160
Usually the SCR deaf room was so packed that we had to arrange for people to stand not in the escape routes.

02:23.160 --> 02:31.160
I'd like to ask you that if you see someone who's blocking an escape route, talk to him.

02:31.160 --> 02:43.160
The other thing I'd like to ask is that if we can find and volunteer to occasionally check the online stream for this room

02:43.160 --> 02:49.160
and check whether there's something in chat that someone writes like, we can't understand the speaker or something.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
Let us know.

02:53.160 --> 02:56.160
So that would be the organizational thing.

02:56.160 --> 02:59.160
So coming to the content of things.

02:59.160 --> 03:00.160
Hi.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.160
You made it.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
So this is best year.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.160
This is a come over here.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.160
I'm a bit late.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.160
I was taking for a fit.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.160
Yeah, come on.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.160
Come on.

03:11.160 --> 03:12.160
Come over.

03:12.160 --> 03:18.160
So for the speakers in the room, the cameras over there, you can see yourself on the small screen there.

03:18.160 --> 03:23.160
So if you're not on, you can't see yourself on the laptop, then you're not on the screen.

03:26.160 --> 03:37.160
Content wise, we got pretty diverse collection of things and we tried during selection and schedule of the talks to make them a bit grouped

03:37.160 --> 03:50.160
so that we're not people who want to go to other death rooms can leave and stay for more than one talk.

03:50.160 --> 04:01.160
So we start off with me, obviously, and I will give a really, really brief introduction to what happened in Noredu since last FOSTEM,

04:01.160 --> 04:09.160
which honestly is going to be a bit opinionated because it's what I think is worth mentioning in this context.

04:09.160 --> 04:20.160
We go over to Sylva, who's going to talk a bit about using GPUs to improve the throughput in SDR computing.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.160
This is very interesting to me.

04:23.160 --> 04:35.160
We go over to Mark, who will then talk about a more modern approach to controlling transceivers than most of the tools that we have today.

04:35.160 --> 04:43.160
Then we go for the radar satellite group of topics.

04:43.160 --> 04:57.160
So we start with Jean-Michel talking about, sorry, lost it, synthetic aperture radar.

04:57.160 --> 05:09.160
We'll follow up on the Qo100 payload and we'll close that part of the satellite things with nanosatellites.

05:09.160 --> 05:13.160
I'm not going to go through all of these, I just realized.

05:13.160 --> 05:24.160
The next topic is basically SDR architectures and SDR application software,

05:24.160 --> 05:30.160
and then we'll go into cellular and radio science.

05:30.160 --> 05:33.160
So this is our rough rundown.

05:33.160 --> 05:36.160
I'm pretty good on time.

05:37.160 --> 05:46.160
I can now start doing my next talk, but I guess we'll take your opportunity to, if there's any questions, ask them now.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.160
Okay, so yes.

05:52.160 --> 05:57.160
If it's loud, then close the door, please.

05:58.160 --> 06:01.160
Yes, of course, yes, he did.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.160
So that's true.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.160
We do have like a schedule switch.

06:05.160 --> 06:15.160
So the second talk, the Tetra talk, I think gets switched with Ang's talk on set-dump, right?

06:15.160 --> 06:18.160
So that is another satellite.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.160
Heavy top, what?

06:20.160 --> 06:22.160
Yeah, should be fine.

06:22.160 --> 06:25.160
And I'm excited that it actually works out.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.160
Yeah.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.160
At the room is the wrong side.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.160
Oh yeah, we should probably do it.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.160
I happen to have like, you're the perfect person.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.160
I have some paper.

06:40.160 --> 06:43.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have paper.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.160
I have paper.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.160
I have paper.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have paper.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.160
And while we're at it.

07:06.160 --> 07:16.160
Then I'll just, I mean, this will probably mess up the video stream afterwards because they're going to cut it by the minute, but that's something that we'll arrange in post.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.160
Um.
