WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
There's quite a few seats down here in the front row.

00:07.360 --> 00:15.320
If you've got, if anybody's looking for seats, right here is four, three.

00:15.320 --> 00:16.680
Okay.

00:16.680 --> 00:28.840
So, let's please give a warm welcome to Wayne Stambaugh.

00:28.840 --> 00:29.840
Thank you.

00:29.840 --> 00:30.840
Thank you.

00:30.840 --> 00:31.840
Thanks.

00:31.840 --> 00:38.080
I'd like to start out by saying thank you for everybody for attending.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.560
It's great to be back at a live Fosdom again.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.640
This is the first time I've been back since 2020 pre-COVID.

00:43.640 --> 00:48.560
So it's great to get out in front of the key CAD user base and get to talk to people.

00:48.560 --> 00:53.320
If you didn't show up at the booth yesterday, it was a lot of fun.

00:53.320 --> 00:58.320
We sold our swag out much faster than we thought we would and all the stickers were going before

00:58.320 --> 00:59.320
lunchtime.

00:59.320 --> 01:03.880
So hopefully next year now we know we'll bring a little bit more with us.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.400
So there's a lot to talk about.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.800
I know some of this is going to be kind of fast.

01:07.800 --> 01:11.560
I'm going to get through it quick, but because there's been quite so many changes that are

01:11.560 --> 01:16.480
going to happen in the upcoming version eight, I'm just going to blow through them.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.000
The talk slides are available online.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.280
There's some animations in them that I'm not going to have time to let play all the

01:22.280 --> 01:23.320
way through.

01:23.320 --> 01:28.400
So if you are curious about how some of the new features work and how you access them,

01:28.400 --> 01:32.440
you can just download my talk and then play through it on your own.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.320
So let's talk about what's going on.

01:34.320 --> 01:37.800
I'm only going to talk about what's happened in the last year because it would be too much

01:37.800 --> 01:40.880
to go all the way back to 2020.

01:40.880 --> 01:45.720
Unfortunately, that first line should have said key CAD date was already released.

01:45.720 --> 01:48.280
Well, we ran into a few issues.

01:48.280 --> 01:52.760
We're going to have to spend an RC3 here probably in the next day or so.

01:52.760 --> 02:01.240
I expect eight to be released with some time in the middle of February at the latest.

02:01.240 --> 02:05.440
Fingers crossed, but I think we're pretty close.

02:05.440 --> 02:10.240
Last year when we ran the version eight end of year campaign, we raised over $200,000

02:10.240 --> 02:13.400
in donations and donation matches from other companies.

02:13.400 --> 02:18.920
So that was really, really a successful donation campaign, and that's allowed us to pay developers

02:18.920 --> 02:20.560
to continue to contribute to key CAD.

02:20.560 --> 02:27.960
So all these new features that are in key CAD and V8 and then moving forward is largely

02:27.960 --> 02:34.800
in part due to those having those funds available to help pay our team to continue to contribute.

02:34.800 --> 02:38.200
That's been really beneficial.

02:38.200 --> 02:43.000
We had our first conference since the original one in 2019 in Chicago.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.120
There was a key con Europe this year in Ocarina, Spain.

02:46.120 --> 02:50.600
For those of you who didn't get to attend, it was a much smaller, more subdued event,

02:50.600 --> 02:55.880
but it was really well done and I think everybody had a good time.

02:55.880 --> 03:01.280
Interestingly enough, spun out of that, there's a company called Watch You Next PCB who is

03:01.280 --> 03:03.720
one of our platinum sponsors.

03:03.720 --> 03:08.920
They also decided to throw a kind of impromptu key con Asia.

03:08.920 --> 03:16.640
And so Seth and I were in Shenzhen in November for the first ever key con Asia.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.800
So what else is going on in the team?

03:18.800 --> 03:22.720
So in the last year, we've added three new lead developers.

03:22.720 --> 03:28.240
Watch You Next PCB who sponsored the key con Asia event.

03:28.240 --> 03:31.560
They actually have hired people to work full time on key CAD.

03:31.560 --> 03:35.040
There's one full time individual now.

03:35.040 --> 03:41.200
Once we release eight, he'll probably be the next member of the lead development team.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.960
They also hired a second person that he's bringing online and getting him used to the

03:44.960 --> 03:46.160
key CAD code.

03:46.160 --> 03:51.520
So now we're going to have some additional resources that help the project.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.840
The biggest improvement though has been in the library team.

03:53.840 --> 03:55.720
So the library team has grown tremendously.

03:55.720 --> 04:01.400
For a long time, we had this huge backlog of symbol footprint 3D model libraries that

04:01.400 --> 04:07.080
kind of were getting stale because the people who were running the library way back either

04:07.080 --> 04:09.800
changed jobs or they had to go do something else.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.600
Life got in the way.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.560
But in the last year, we've added six new members to the library team and there's been

04:15.560 --> 04:16.560
eight now.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.560
Is it eight?

04:17.560 --> 04:19.440
Sorry, I probably didn't update it.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.240
But it's been a huge amount of backlog.

04:23.240 --> 04:29.360
I'll go through the statistics at the end here just to show you how much that's improved.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.640
We actually have a technical writer now.

04:31.640 --> 04:35.600
We have one individual who spends a lot of time just all he does.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.600
He's like our, they always say there's no I in team for Graham.

04:39.600 --> 04:42.440
He is truly a one man team.

04:42.440 --> 04:48.800
So our library docs don't lag or our key CAD documentation does not lag as much as it

04:48.800 --> 04:49.800
used to.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.760
It used to be the documentation always lags quite a bit.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.160
For version eight, it's going to be relatively up to date.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.280
There'll be a few things that are missing.

04:58.280 --> 05:04.000
One of the other things that was interesting is worth electronic out of Germany had contacted

05:04.000 --> 05:10.640
me about providing their footprint and symbol and 3D model libraries to key CAD.

05:10.640 --> 05:14.200
And so they've been slowly starting to online and contribute stuff.

05:14.200 --> 05:21.560
And their goal was to get their entire product line in the stock key CAD libraries.

05:21.560 --> 05:26.360
So at some point it's quite a, that's a big company and it's quite a few parts.

05:26.360 --> 05:31.880
So thank you to them for stepping up and documenting their basically providing their

05:31.880 --> 05:38.040
own symbols and footprint and 3D model libraries for key CAD.

05:38.040 --> 05:44.760
So one of the things that's interesting, we'll talk about, I'll also talk about this

05:44.760 --> 05:51.440
in the statistics part is in US and in Europe we have quite a bit of market share.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.720
We actually have a very large presence.

05:53.720 --> 05:59.000
But in Asia we've kind of lagged behind, but in the last year we're looking at the download

05:59.000 --> 06:02.400
numbers, Asia's really starting to ramp up now.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.000
And you know, that's a really big market.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.640
So it's neat to see key CAD getting in, in making penetration in that market.

06:10.640 --> 06:14.760
And I think one of the main reasons, especially in China, is we now actually have quite a

06:14.760 --> 06:21.480
few people who are full time either translating the application, translating the documentation.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.520
So they have really good native language support for key CAD.

06:25.520 --> 06:28.960
So that's really, I think that's what's helped.

06:28.960 --> 06:33.800
We now have five platinum sponsors and if you're not aware platinum in key CAD is 15,000

06:33.800 --> 06:35.380
a year or more.

06:35.380 --> 06:37.520
So we now have five of those.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.880
And I know it's a little limited right now, but the key CAD stores open.

06:40.880 --> 06:45.960
So if you want to get some key CAD swag, there's not a lot of items there yet, but as time

06:45.960 --> 06:48.640
goes on we will add more and more items to the key CAD store.

06:48.640 --> 06:57.400
So head to store.keycad.org and check out, get your latest key CAD swag.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.400
And of course we always like to give a little love to our platinum sponsors.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.560
I see Felix is around here somewhere.

07:02.560 --> 07:09.560
Eisler, the newest sponsor is DAI and they're a consulting firm.

07:09.560 --> 07:13.360
They are our latest platinum sponsor.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.040
DigiKey and Watchu, Next PCB.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.520
So Watchu is the parent company of Next PCB.

07:18.520 --> 07:19.520
You are familiar with them.

07:19.520 --> 07:24.960
They are a PCB and PCBA manufacturer.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.440
And of course key CAD services corporation whose goal is to continue to support the key

07:28.440 --> 07:34.120
CAD project from the commercial side and everything flows down from there into key CAD proper,

07:34.120 --> 07:37.640
which so we all get to benefit from.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.480
So what would we add in version 8?

07:40.480 --> 07:47.800
So there's a lot of things that happen in version 8 that are not in version 7.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.240
So we made a bunch of SVG exporter improvements.

07:51.240 --> 07:59.160
Some of the primitives used to export as line segments and now it exports as its own primitive.

07:59.160 --> 08:03.240
There's now a startup splash screen, but that's been disabled some more about that later.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.720
But it's there for like rebranding.

08:05.720 --> 08:08.760
If somebody wanted to make their own variant of key CAD and wanted to put their own splash

08:08.760 --> 08:11.240
screen up there, they can do that.

08:11.240 --> 08:16.520
There's now, oh it's slow.

08:16.520 --> 08:19.200
Oh it went too far.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.200
Page up.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.200
Come on laptop.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.680
There we go.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.000
So there's now all the hotkeys.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.200
So here you can see the animation plane.

08:28.200 --> 08:33.320
You can assign multiple hotkeys now to a single action.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.600
We have ARM64 builds.

08:34.600 --> 08:40.480
So for those of you who are running Windows on ARM64s, we now have data binaries for

08:40.480 --> 08:42.760
you guys.

08:42.760 --> 08:51.760
One of the big contributions this year was there's now an easy EDA project importer.

08:51.760 --> 08:57.200
So your easy EDA and easy EDA pro projects will import directly into key CAD.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.920
The whole project schematic, everything.

08:59.920 --> 09:05.840
So that was a nice contribution.

09:05.840 --> 09:10.040
We introduced the command line interface in version 7, but there were bits and pieces

09:10.040 --> 09:11.120
of it we're missing.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.800
So now you can run DRC and ERC from the command line.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.960
So if you want to do like a CI tool, so every time somebody commits a change, you run the

09:17.960 --> 09:20.800
ERC or DRC, make sure it's clean.

09:20.800 --> 09:25.640
And if it's not, you can automatically ping somebody, hey you broke this, you broke that.

09:25.640 --> 09:29.280
So that's going to be in, that'll be available in version 8.

09:29.280 --> 09:32.440
Yeah, we all like those CI tools.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.800
Keep people on their toes.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.440
So here's something that's interesting to happen this year.

09:37.560 --> 09:43.720
So one of our, this is one of the things that key CAD services did was there was a customer

09:43.720 --> 09:51.360
who needed this for their, this was a request, they paid us directly to integrate this into

09:51.360 --> 09:52.360
key CAD.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.120
So everybody gets get support key CAD now.

09:55.120 --> 10:02.000
It's not everything is supported in get, but most of the basic things that you would need

10:02.000 --> 10:09.280
to keep track of version control of your designs is now built into key CAD.

10:09.280 --> 10:15.360
So the property panels on seven, it was only available in the board editor.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.720
It's now available in all editors.

10:16.720 --> 10:20.040
So the schematic and the symbol editor and the footprint editor now have the little panel.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.800
You select the object, you get the, you have the panel up.

10:22.800 --> 10:28.960
You can modify your object properties without having to open and close the dialog.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.760
Here's another, oh come on, you can do it.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.200
There you go.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.840
Here's another one.

10:35.840 --> 10:40.960
So we have customers that do really complex designs and they requested this.

10:40.960 --> 10:48.960
So they have, when you highlight a net, sometimes it's so complicated in order for you to find

10:48.960 --> 10:51.120
where on the design where everything goes.

10:51.120 --> 10:55.000
If you have a deeply nested hierarchy, it's cumbersome because you got to walk down, walk

10:55.000 --> 10:57.360
up and down the hierarchy stack.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.360
There's now a navigator.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.120
When you highlight the net, there's a navigator allowed.

11:01.120 --> 11:05.000
You see all the elements that are connected to that net in the bar on the left.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.560
Click on it, opens the sheet, takes you to that element directly.

11:08.560 --> 11:13.120
So if you do really complex designs, it's a time saver.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.480
That was also paid for by somebody else.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.640
This wasn't something that was even on our radar.

11:17.640 --> 11:23.720
It was just something that a paying customer requested.

11:23.720 --> 11:25.400
They paid for it, goes into key CAD.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
We all win.

11:27.400 --> 11:32.480
So there's now search panels on all the editors.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.360
So there's a global search panel which allows you to search for all kinds of different objects.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.560
You click on it, takes you to that object in the view.

11:39.560 --> 11:42.280
Instead of the old find dialog, this is a lot more convenient.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.120
It's a little bit more useful.

11:44.120 --> 11:49.160
You can see what's available.

11:49.160 --> 11:51.200
So there's now an internal bomb tool.

11:52.160 --> 11:57.000
In version 8, you no longer have to generate your bombs using a script.

11:57.000 --> 12:03.920
In the past, we always scripted it out because everybody would argue about what a good bomb is.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.880
We provided a tool.

12:05.880 --> 12:10.640
It's obviously not as flexible as the scripting is, but if you just want to export a simple

12:10.640 --> 12:16.920
bomb, there's now a tool for that, built into key CAD.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.760
So we also have contextual object grid alignment.

12:19.800 --> 12:24.840
So you know how sometimes you want the pins on 50 mil grids, you want your text to be

12:24.840 --> 12:26.640
on 25 mil grids.

12:26.640 --> 12:31.280
You can set it up contextually and when you're using that object, it will automatically pick

12:31.280 --> 12:32.280
that grid spacing.

12:32.280 --> 12:37.400
So instead of you having to constantly change grids back and forth when you're connecting

12:37.400 --> 12:41.520
pins versus like moving your text around to get them all nice and lined up pretty, there's

12:41.520 --> 12:44.120
a tool that handles that automatically for you.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.320
You don't have to do it.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.120
There's now nested symbol inheritance.

12:48.120 --> 12:53.800
So you can now instead of in version 7, the derivation level was 1.

12:53.800 --> 12:56.320
Now the derivation level is infinite.

12:56.320 --> 13:01.400
So you can create subgroups of subgroups of subgroups and you can stack.

13:01.400 --> 13:05.240
So you don't have to keep redefining the same fields over and over again.

13:05.240 --> 13:10.040
You can define a set of fields and then build something on top of that, the symbol on top

13:10.040 --> 13:11.240
of that, symbol on top of that.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.400
So that's available in v8.

13:16.480 --> 13:17.960
Oh, God.

13:17.960 --> 13:25.560
Yeah, this is a pretty big, there's now a tool to check for diffs so against the library.

13:25.560 --> 13:26.960
So you're working in your schematic.

13:26.960 --> 13:32.640
You don't know if there's a different, you know, it allows you to see a diff.

13:32.640 --> 13:37.640
So you say you run an ERC and you say there's a diff, you get a diff error or a diff warning

13:37.640 --> 13:41.600
that your symbol doesn't match what was in the library.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.560
There's a tool now that will show you what the difference between the two objects were.

13:45.560 --> 13:49.600
So you can decide whether you want to pull in the change from the library or just ignore

13:49.600 --> 13:50.600
it.

13:57.880 --> 14:04.200
Okay, so there's, we now, you can now directly import CAD, Altium, CAD Star and Eagle Symbol

14:04.200 --> 14:08.880
libraries directly into KeyCAD like you could do some, you know, some of the other ones

14:08.880 --> 14:13.520
instead of having to like convert them and then, and then bring them in as KeyCAD libraries.

14:13.520 --> 14:21.480
You now can just bring them in directly.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.480
There's a preview.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.040
Is it going to show up?

14:24.040 --> 14:25.040
Yeah.

14:25.040 --> 14:30.640
So there's now a previewer for the library so as you hover over, mouse hover over them,

14:30.640 --> 14:34.080
instead of having to click it and see it in the editor, you can now just hover and say,

14:34.080 --> 14:36.280
oh, yep, that's the one I want.

14:36.280 --> 14:40.400
Just some handy convenience features.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.600
There's now a library file.

14:42.600 --> 14:44.120
I don't recommend anybody doing this.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.880
This is just for demonstration purposes.

14:45.880 --> 14:53.560
Here on my hand editing, a Symbol library file, and if you watch in the, it's updating,

14:53.560 --> 14:57.960
we now watch all the files in both the Symbol and Footprint libraries.

14:57.960 --> 15:03.440
And if you, if they change, it will tell you so you don't save over top of existing changes

15:03.440 --> 15:07.480
like say somebody, say you got two people working on the same library at the same time.

15:07.480 --> 15:12.480
Some of you is going to get a, hey, you're going to overwrite somebody else's changes.

15:12.480 --> 15:17.600
So we implemented that.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.480
We now have a simple single button now.

15:20.480 --> 15:25.080
Let's say you have a bunch of libraries that you've imported from Altium or Eagle or wherever

15:25.080 --> 15:26.080
with one button.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.120
Now you can just save those as KeyCAD libraries because one thing we can't do is we don't

15:29.120 --> 15:32.480
write anybody's proprietary formats.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.760
So we just, it's a read only library.

15:34.880 --> 15:38.920
But if you want to edit them in KeyCAD, you just save them as KeyCAD libraries and go

15:38.920 --> 15:41.400
on about your work.

15:41.400 --> 15:46.920
We now have differential cursors in the simulation, in the simulator.

15:46.920 --> 15:50.360
There was quite a few changes in the simulators that much improved.

15:50.360 --> 15:56.200
So you, you know, there's a lot of LT spice like features that people are used to having

15:56.200 --> 15:58.520
in a spice simulator.

15:58.520 --> 16:02.400
Oh, come on.

16:02.440 --> 16:06.400
We can now directly import LT spice schematics.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.760
There's a caveat with that.

16:07.760 --> 16:12.120
You have to have LT spice installed because it goes, because it needs to go back into

16:12.120 --> 16:14.960
LT spice installation and get all the LT spice symbols.

16:14.960 --> 16:19.160
So if you want to do this in order for it to work correctly, you do have to have LT spice

16:19.160 --> 16:26.440
installed on your, you just can't take your LT spice circuit and then import it without

16:26.440 --> 16:32.360
being able to import the rest of LT spice because it references its own internal stuff.

16:32.360 --> 16:36.240
So we have to do this ourselves in LT spice and we have to extract all that out to make

16:36.240 --> 16:39.960
a simulation, but it works very well.

16:39.960 --> 16:45.960
I mentioned earlier we got a bunch of spice simulator improvements.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.280
We have FFTs.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.560
This is a really bad oscillator here.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.720
So it's fun to make.

16:51.720 --> 16:55.040
You can see, you should only see that one spike there at the beginning and none of the other

16:55.040 --> 16:56.240
ones and a perfect oscillator.

16:56.240 --> 17:00.120
But I did this one just for fun because I know how to make bad ones.

17:00.120 --> 17:04.000
I've experienced that.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.800
And S parameters and Fourier.

17:05.800 --> 17:10.320
So like most of the features that have been available in NG Spice that we just haven't

17:10.320 --> 17:16.680
extracted out, that information that we haven't extracted out in the simulations is now available.

17:16.680 --> 17:22.320
One of the more requested features, come on, you can do it, there you go, is editable power

17:22.320 --> 17:23.320
symbols.

17:23.320 --> 17:27.280
So before in KeyCat if you wanted to create a custom voltage, you had to go into the symbol

17:27.280 --> 17:30.480
editor, copy it and then change it.

17:30.480 --> 17:35.960
You can now do it on the fly right from the schematic editor without having to create

17:35.960 --> 17:39.480
a new symbol.

17:39.480 --> 17:46.320
We vastly improved the importers for SVG and DXF, or I'm sorry, we now actually have SVG

17:46.320 --> 17:49.240
and DXF importing into this schematic editor.

17:49.240 --> 17:53.560
It was only in the board editor and the footprint editor I think before, but now it's now in

17:53.560 --> 17:57.760
the symbol and schematic editors.

17:57.760 --> 18:02.960
We can export to Cadence Allegro PCB designer, so for those of you who don't want to use

18:02.960 --> 18:08.800
our board layout package, you can now export the net list to Cadence.

18:08.800 --> 18:15.680
And we've switched over, so a long time ago we switched the board editor printing in Cairo,

18:15.680 --> 18:21.120
which can do things like alpha blending, which is kind of more important for the board editor,

18:21.120 --> 18:24.160
but we've also switched over just recently in the schematic editor.

18:24.160 --> 18:30.560
So like if you have bitmaps with alpha instead of being no alpha, they'll be printed with

18:30.560 --> 18:32.560
alpha blending.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.720
Okay, that's it for the schematic editor.

18:35.720 --> 18:39.520
So it got the bulk of the love for version 8, but there were still a lot of changes in

18:39.520 --> 18:41.120
the board editor.

18:41.120 --> 18:46.000
So we have the same tool that we have in the schematic editor, check footprints against

18:46.000 --> 18:47.520
the board in the library.

18:47.520 --> 18:53.960
You can get a visual diff, you get a visual diff just to see what the difference is before

18:53.960 --> 18:56.880
you accept any changes.

18:56.880 --> 19:03.760
You can now import, come on, you can now directly import Altium Footpoint Libraries.

19:03.760 --> 19:10.560
Before we didn't, you had to save the Altium Board Importer would import them and automatically

19:10.560 --> 19:14.440
convert them to key cad formats.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.720
Now you can just import the library as it is.

19:17.720 --> 19:22.720
SOLIDWORKS PCB files, we now do, that wasn't fairly easy because they're basically Altium

19:22.720 --> 19:30.000
PCB files, but we can now import SOLIDWORKS PCB files.

19:30.000 --> 19:38.600
There's a do not position flag, DNP for the board editor now so that when you export your

19:38.600 --> 19:42.960
position files, it won't export those if there are things that you don't want your pick and

19:42.960 --> 19:48.800
place machine to populate.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.560
We now allow connectivity on any random shape.

19:52.560 --> 19:59.040
So you can draw a shape on copper, any shape you want, sign a net to it, it becomes a trace

19:59.040 --> 20:06.280
or another connect or zone, but you can basically draw any arbitrary shape and give it a net

20:06.280 --> 20:08.200
name.

20:08.200 --> 20:15.160
We've added some major improvements to the interactive meander tuning, here's the new

20:15.160 --> 20:18.640
properties dialog that allows you to set the parameters when you're doing your meander

20:18.640 --> 20:20.280
tuning.

20:20.280 --> 20:24.940
There are a bunch of step export improvements, including if you really want to have ridiculously

20:24.940 --> 20:31.120
large step files, you can actually export the pads and the traces and the vias, and

20:31.120 --> 20:34.280
your step files will be gigantic, but you can do it now.

20:34.280 --> 20:38.560
That was a feature that people requested, but be prepared, you're going to have some

20:38.560 --> 20:42.520
big step files.

20:42.520 --> 20:46.240
So property panels again is now in the footprint editor, you can see down there I click on

20:46.240 --> 20:55.420
an object, I get the properties, I can just edit them in the properties editor.

20:55.420 --> 20:59.800
We also have the preview, the hover preview, flyover preview in the footprint editor as

20:59.800 --> 21:01.440
well.

21:01.440 --> 21:05.840
There's a recent, we now export to IPC 2581.

21:05.840 --> 21:12.720
So I know this isn't supported by a lot of manufacturers yet, but we're now in a position

21:12.720 --> 21:19.120
where when it becomes more widely supported, we'll already have it in KeyCAD.

21:19.120 --> 21:23.260
And there was a whole host of 3D viewer improvements, things like visibility panel, so you can

21:23.260 --> 21:28.280
turn layers on and off, and there's a bunch of other stuff in the 3D viewer that were

21:28.280 --> 21:30.920
massively improved.

21:30.920 --> 21:37.920
So I'd like to thank Roberto because I shamelessly stole this from his presentation at KeyCon.

21:37.920 --> 21:43.600
This was a matrix of the changes, and so everything in blue was the importer.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.520
These were the importers for third party tools.

21:46.520 --> 21:50.800
Everything in blue was in seven, the orange is now included in eight.

21:50.800 --> 21:58.920
We have a few gaps, we got Gita, import, and PICAD, but we still need to do the project

21:58.920 --> 22:00.940
support for Altium.

22:00.940 --> 22:08.120
So right now you have to import the schematic, the board, sync them up together so that KeyCAD

22:08.120 --> 22:15.000
is happy, but I think in eight and nine we're going to have project support for Altium.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.040
So here's some fun statistics.

22:17.040 --> 22:24.080
So the source repo, so between now and version seven, the source repo, and it's actually more

22:24.080 --> 22:28.680
than that now, had 4,500 commits by 15 different authors.

22:28.680 --> 22:35.480
Actually KeyCAD sits at 1.63 million lines of code without translations and another 176K

22:35.480 --> 22:36.560
lines of comments.

22:36.560 --> 22:45.280
So we're rapidly approaching 2 million lines of code.

22:45.280 --> 22:52.240
The library team has just been busy, and in the last year we've added 1,207 new symbols

22:52.240 --> 22:54.760
for a total of 20,000 2023.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.280
I'm sure it's more since I've made this.

22:57.280 --> 23:00.400
He's clean, that's not here shaking his head.

23:00.400 --> 23:06.160
Footprint library, we added 713 for a total of 13,454.

23:06.160 --> 23:10.240
And just to give you an idea how significant that number is, I was informed this morning

23:10.240 --> 23:21.320
that one large, well-known component distributor doesn't have that many footprints.

23:21.320 --> 23:25.120
We actually supply more footprints than some of the distributors do.

23:25.120 --> 23:30.480
So I don't think I have the permission to say who it is, so I'm just going to say just

23:30.480 --> 23:35.040
throw that out there, but it just shows you how massively improved the KeyCAD libraries

23:35.040 --> 23:36.040
are.

23:36.040 --> 23:40.320
We added 238 3D models for a total of 6,700.

23:40.320 --> 23:45.920
We did slip a little bit in our language translation, so for v7 we had 17 languages that were 99%

23:45.920 --> 23:47.160
translated.

23:47.160 --> 23:52.960
We only have nine for v8 release, but I'm hoping that situation will improve as v8 gets

23:52.960 --> 23:55.000
out there.

23:55.360 --> 24:01.240
We saw, I don't know how many people saw this, but Felix and Eisler posted KeyCAD usage,

24:01.240 --> 24:07.080
and this actually shows the growth from 2020 to now.

24:07.080 --> 24:14.000
In 2020, I think we're roughly in the mid-20% of their orders for KeyCAD, and we've continually

24:14.000 --> 24:18.840
grown to now, we're 42, but I've heard recently somebody say something like 50% in the last

24:18.840 --> 24:20.000
month.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.400
So you see all the other EDA tools going down, KeyCAD's going up.

24:24.760 --> 24:25.760
That's a nice trend.

24:25.760 --> 24:27.360
I like that trend.

24:27.360 --> 24:33.120
And it's an Oshpark also demonstrates similar kind of trends.

24:33.120 --> 24:36.600
They're seeing KeyCAD usage go up from their customers.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.440
Now, that's not universally true.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.640
There's other board vendors, I'm sure, that have different statistics, but most of the

24:41.640 --> 24:46.560
board vendors that we interface with directly, they're seeing those kind of numbers.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
So that's really good.

24:47.560 --> 24:50.480
So I'm going to blow through this quickly.

24:50.560 --> 24:54.360
I apologize for not having a lot more time.

24:54.360 --> 24:57.920
But here's what's coming in V9.

24:57.920 --> 25:02.560
So we're going to have IPC support for internal procedure calls.

25:02.560 --> 25:09.440
So one of the things that KeyCAD has always had an issue with is our Python scripting.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.440
People call it an API.

25:10.440 --> 25:11.880
Technically, it's not an API.

25:11.880 --> 25:14.080
It's a wrapper around the internal KeyCAD API.

25:14.080 --> 25:18.400
So anytime there's something internal changes in KeyCAD, we build the Python scripts, we

25:18.400 --> 25:19.680
break stuff.

25:19.680 --> 25:26.800
We are in the process now of working on an IPC interface that will act as a go-between

25:26.800 --> 25:33.720
between any high-level language, including Python, and a running KeyCAD instance.

25:33.720 --> 25:39.080
So one of the things you know is you can actually bring KeyCAD down with a rogue Python script.

25:39.080 --> 25:43.320
So we're going to try to fix that in NINE as best we can.

25:43.320 --> 25:49.200
And at some point in the future, we'll deprecate the scripting stuff and make everything built

25:49.200 --> 25:53.600
on top of the API just to eliminate those kind of issues.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.080
And so you'll have a stable interface.

25:55.080 --> 26:00.000
So when you write a Python script using the API, it's not going to break the next time

26:00.000 --> 26:05.080
you compile and rebuild KeyCAD.

26:05.080 --> 26:10.240
We want to do, one of the things that's requested is customizable interface, including toolbar

26:10.240 --> 26:11.240
layouts.

26:11.240 --> 26:14.080
We're going to try to get that done in NINE.

26:14.080 --> 26:17.200
There's some talk about doing a visual diff merge tool for Git.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.920
So you look at the difference between, so you'll see the visual difference between the

26:20.920 --> 26:24.880
schematic or the board before you change or merge.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.200
So you have a merge conflict with somebody else.

26:27.200 --> 26:32.440
You can look at the diff and say, oh, yeah, I want mine or I want theirs.

26:32.440 --> 26:36.440
We've been getting requests for embedding licenses and project and library files.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.560
So we'll implement that.

26:38.560 --> 26:43.800
Support for barcodes, multi-user editing is something we've been discussing, whether

26:43.800 --> 26:45.880
or not that happens or not.

26:46.400 --> 26:49.560
That's a big one, but it's something that we're looking at.

26:49.560 --> 26:53.920
And of course, I talked about the pads and the guita importers.

26:53.920 --> 26:57.960
We've also been taught, one of the things that people have asked us about is being able

26:57.960 --> 26:59.480
to save the old file formats.

26:59.480 --> 27:03.360
Historically, KeyCAD has not allowed that, but we're actually in the process of thinking

27:03.360 --> 27:05.120
about that.

27:05.120 --> 27:13.320
And also, forward file compatibility, we were just open a file, an older file or newer file,

27:13.320 --> 27:15.480
and KeyCAD just says, well, I don't know what to do with that.

27:15.480 --> 27:18.360
So it just doesn't do anything with it.

27:18.360 --> 27:22.040
But if you save it, you're going to overwrite and lose your anything that the old version

27:22.040 --> 27:24.320
of KeyCAD, you'll still be able to open it.

27:24.320 --> 27:27.200
It's just some of the things won't work.

27:27.200 --> 27:32.640
A lot of other applications do similar things.

27:32.640 --> 27:39.160
For the schematic editor, there's actually a merge request now for a tool that synchronizes

27:39.160 --> 27:43.120
sheet pins and hierarchical labels in the schematic that it references.

27:43.120 --> 27:49.000
So you can do this bi-directional updating in both directions.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.320
We're going to replace this.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.000
So right now, we allow sharing of schematics between projects.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.880
We're going to stop that and go with a reusable design block because that particular thing

27:57.880 --> 28:07.160
causes us so much grief that we decided it wasn't smart to continue to support it.

28:07.160 --> 28:09.400
That will give us the design blocks.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.240
We're going to do variants for schematics in nine.

28:12.240 --> 28:17.080
I don't know if we'll get the board variants, but at least we'll get the schematic variants.

28:17.080 --> 28:18.680
Bezier curve editing tool.

28:18.680 --> 28:23.720
People who know there's a Bezier curve support in KeyCAD, but there's no tool to edit them

28:23.720 --> 28:24.720
in KeyCAD.

28:24.720 --> 28:28.200
So we're going to do that.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.120
The board editor, there's also now a zone manager.

28:31.120 --> 28:35.120
That's also a merge request that's ready to go as soon as we release eight.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.880
It allows you to edit all your zones in a single interface.

28:37.880 --> 28:44.560
Instead of having to open each zone individually in one dialogue at a time, now there's a zone

28:44.560 --> 28:47.160
manager for all of them.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.840
Multi-channel designs, that's in progress.

28:49.840 --> 28:50.840
Pad stacks.

28:50.840 --> 28:54.600
We're really hoping that one gets in because that's one of the feature parity issues that

28:54.600 --> 28:55.800
we have.

28:55.800 --> 29:01.240
Like so when we try to import from other tools that support pad stacks, we can't import them.

29:01.240 --> 29:06.520
We have to make an assumption based on a best guess and you get the pad stack that KeyCAD

29:06.520 --> 29:07.520
could support.

29:07.520 --> 29:11.160
So we're going to do pad stacks.

29:11.160 --> 29:15.040
Guard rings, that's a feature for those of you who do high-end piece stuff and you want

29:15.040 --> 29:18.880
to guard your high-end piece circuits so you don't have to leak each current.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.160
Those are useful.

29:20.160 --> 29:27.200
Right now our router doesn't really make it easy for you to design a guard ring.

29:27.200 --> 29:33.200
And also we're going to do the Bezier curve editing tool in the board editors.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.560
Somebody's working on a table tool right now.

29:35.560 --> 29:38.200
That'll be in the schematic and maybe the board editor.

29:38.200 --> 29:41.400
I don't know whether that's actually going to happen but hopefully it does.

29:41.400 --> 29:48.040
So it'll just be a table like any table in your favorite document editor.

29:48.040 --> 29:51.400
They'll just be native table support.

29:51.400 --> 29:57.160
We want to embed 3D models into the footprint so you don't have to have your 3D models.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.040
3D models are external to the board.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.560
They'll just be embedded in the board and you take the whole board with you.

30:01.560 --> 30:03.360
You've got all your 3D models.

30:03.360 --> 30:08.760
ODB++ export, this one's already also in progress.

30:08.760 --> 30:14.760
Our friends at WatchUnextPCB are working on that because their infrastructure uses ODB++

30:14.760 --> 30:19.240
since they, you know, that's what they use when you order boards.

30:19.240 --> 30:25.000
They prefer it over Gerber so they're going to provide ODB++ support so if your favorite

30:25.000 --> 30:31.160
board manufacturer is an ODB++ only shop, you'll be able to export that.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.760
Okay, that's it.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.800
Just a quick wrap up here.

30:35.800 --> 30:42.920
I can't, I mean I get to stand out in front of the team as the project lead but it's an

30:42.920 --> 30:46.960
incredible amount of time and I always want to say thanks to all our developers who contribute

30:46.960 --> 30:47.960
to KeyCat.

30:47.960 --> 30:52.160
It's really gotten impressive the last, you know, the amount of contributions just keep

30:52.160 --> 30:53.160
going up.

30:53.360 --> 30:59.640
I'm really, really encouraging and it's fun for me as a project leader to see that happen.

30:59.640 --> 31:04.040
Thanks to all our sponsors and donors if you've contributed to the KeyCat donations.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.040
Thank you very much.

31:05.040 --> 31:08.800
That continues the sustained growth of KeyCat.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.560
Thank you for your continued support of the KeyCat project so everybody who uses KeyCat

31:12.560 --> 31:13.560
thanks.

31:13.560 --> 31:20.560
We really like the fact that you use KeyCat and we hope we can continue to support your

31:20.560 --> 31:22.160
needs as a project.

31:23.160 --> 31:28.560
So anybody who's ever organized a dev room or anything like this knows it's not a nontrivial

31:28.560 --> 31:29.560
amount of work.

31:29.560 --> 31:32.160
Thanks to Seth for organizing this.

31:32.160 --> 31:35.160
It doesn't happen by itself.

31:35.160 --> 31:39.960
And hope I get to see everybody here next year and I hope I get to see everybody at

31:39.960 --> 31:42.760
least at one of the KeyCons this year.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.840
So keep an eye out.

31:44.840 --> 31:48.160
The one in Europe this year is going to be in Germany.

31:48.160 --> 31:51.080
We don't have a date yet or a venue.

31:51.080 --> 31:55.080
We have people on the ground who are working on it.

31:55.080 --> 31:59.200
And as soon as we have that information we'll put it up on the KeyCat website and on the

31:59.200 --> 32:05.320
forum and you'll be able to keep your eyes open and then hopefully you guys, hopefully

32:05.320 --> 32:08.880
we can see as many of you there as possible.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.760
Early September in Bohem.

32:10.760 --> 32:11.760
Is that when it is?

32:11.760 --> 32:12.760
Early September?

32:12.760 --> 32:13.760
Okay.

32:13.760 --> 32:19.120
And I'm not 100% sure we're going to have a Shenzhen and Asia one this year but I suspect

32:19.120 --> 32:20.120
we will.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.880
Has Hubert committed to that?

32:21.880 --> 32:23.840
We are going to have KeyCon Asia.

32:23.840 --> 32:28.800
It is just waiting for the time we coordinate with Maker Faire Shenzhen.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.520
So we're going to be on the same weekend as Maker Faire Shenzhen.

32:31.520 --> 32:35.840
So yeah, if you want to go, that's a great dual hit because if you've never been to Shenzhen

32:35.840 --> 32:37.440
Maker Faire it's really impressive.

32:37.440 --> 32:39.440
You should go if you get a chance.

32:39.440 --> 32:42.120
So okay, I'm open for questions.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.120
If anybody has any questions, no.

32:45.120 --> 32:47.120
Thank you.

32:54.120 --> 33:01.120
I had a question about the libraries.

33:02.120 --> 33:11.120
Are there plans to move the libraries in a...

33:11.120 --> 33:13.120
In a...

33:13.120 --> 33:17.120
This deep...

33:17.120 --> 33:19.120
Po.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.120
Are there plans to...

33:21.120 --> 33:30.120
So that a project could import the libraries directly from...

33:30.120 --> 33:31.120
Yes.

33:31.120 --> 33:36.120
Not right now?

33:36.120 --> 33:44.120
So the question is, are there plans to allow importing library objects directly from a Git repo?

33:44.120 --> 33:49.120
Because all our stuff is basically saved in a Git repo because we design it.

33:49.120 --> 33:53.120
You can import the project libraries, not the globals.

33:53.120 --> 33:55.120
Yes, not the globals.

33:56.120 --> 34:03.120
So yeah, because the Git support, obviously, the libraries that are already in your project will be part of your Git project.

34:03.120 --> 34:07.120
But externally, no, we don't have anything at the moment for that.

34:07.120 --> 34:11.120
But I mean, if somebody wanted to spin up a Git plug-in, that wouldn't be the...

34:11.120 --> 34:19.120
No, but I wouldn't turn you down because I think other people would probably like similar things.

34:19.120 --> 34:25.120
Do you have any plans to integrate some sort of mixed signal, real-time interactive simulation into...

34:25.120 --> 34:28.120
Kind of like Muldi's in, basically Muldi's in.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.120
Well, okay, there's...

34:30.120 --> 34:33.120
So on the simulator front, we've had a lot of fits and starts.

34:33.120 --> 34:38.120
I wish I had a better, a more rosy outlook to give you on that.

34:38.120 --> 34:48.120
We had some people working on EM simulations, so we were going to take the board, break it down into its 3D representation,

34:48.120 --> 34:51.120
and then do like EM and maybe a power solver.

34:51.120 --> 34:55.120
But the people... There's several things on that front that make it difficult.

34:55.120 --> 35:02.120
The most difficult thing is finding the manpower to do that because that's pretty specific kind of...

35:02.120 --> 35:05.120
You have to have a pretty good knowledge of how to do that.

35:05.120 --> 35:12.120
The other problem that's kind of been problematic is a lot of the libraries that do that in the open-source world,

35:12.120 --> 35:17.120
because we are an open-source project, obviously, we're not going to use like MathLab.

35:17.120 --> 35:24.120
They don't necessarily build well, they don't play well on all platforms.

35:24.120 --> 35:26.120
And so KeyCat, one of the...

35:26.120 --> 35:31.120
If you're not familiar with it, one of the things that KeyCat doesn't do is make second-class citizens.

35:31.120 --> 35:34.120
All the major platforms are considered equal.

35:34.120 --> 35:40.120
So if I can't provide a feature on Linux or on Mac OS, I'm not going to do it on Windows.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.120
It's got to work on all three.

35:42.120 --> 35:46.120
So that's kind of been a little bit of a... We've had a little resistance there.

35:46.120 --> 35:51.120
I don't think that problem is over... Oh, not solvable, I think it is.

35:51.120 --> 35:56.120
So the person who's implementing that's not only got to do the end part, like the solvers,

35:56.120 --> 36:02.120
they also got to get all the libraries to build all the dependencies that they need to integrate into KeyCat

36:02.120 --> 36:04.120
to build on all three platforms.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.120
And that's a bit of a load.

36:06.120 --> 36:10.120
So I do think it's going to happen at some time.

36:10.120 --> 36:13.120
Obviously, it's never going to be as fast as I want it to,

36:13.120 --> 36:20.120
but we do have in our big wish list of things we want to do, it is there.

36:20.120 --> 36:24.120
It's just whether we get the manpower to do it.

36:24.120 --> 36:27.120
Any other questions? Am I done?

36:27.120 --> 36:29.120
One more.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.120
Yes.

36:31.120 --> 36:32.120
Go ahead.

36:32.120 --> 36:37.120
Okay. Congratulations for all the amazing work.

36:37.120 --> 36:38.120
Thank you.

36:38.120 --> 36:40.120
Contributors and maintainers.

36:40.120 --> 36:47.120
And I want to ask about one of the planned features for the next release you talked about,

36:47.120 --> 36:51.120
GiveDiffMerch tool.

36:51.120 --> 36:58.120
I think it would be amazing if the command line tool could export a GIF animation.

36:58.120 --> 36:59.120
So you could...

36:59.120 --> 37:03.120
Export? You mean what the command line told you to export the Diff?

37:03.120 --> 37:07.120
Yeah. So, like, I don't know, GIF animation, something like that.

37:07.120 --> 37:11.120
So when somebody comes with a pull request, you could see, okay,

37:11.120 --> 37:15.120
what's changing without needing to download or open?

37:15.120 --> 37:17.120
I mean, just an idea.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.120
That's not a bad idea.

37:19.120 --> 37:22.120
I mean, what, like a ping?

37:22.120 --> 37:25.120
We'll put an issue for it and we'll see about that.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.120
Yeah.

37:26.120 --> 37:28.120
So any more questions, please follow.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.120
Wayne will be out in the hallway to answer any questions.

37:31.120 --> 37:33.120
So thank you once again, Wayne.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.120
Thank you.

37:37.120 --> 37:39.120
Thank you.
