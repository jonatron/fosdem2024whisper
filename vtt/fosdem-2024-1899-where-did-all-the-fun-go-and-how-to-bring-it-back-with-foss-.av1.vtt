WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.800
Oh, oh.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.080
Alert.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.600
Attention.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.280
Alert.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.280
Oh.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.280
Oh.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.280
Oh.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.320
The speaker is missing.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.280
I shall take over.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.200
Hi, Fosdom.

00:32.200 --> 00:37.640
My name is 345, Carat 7 and 3, but you can call me Carat.

00:37.640 --> 00:41.040
I am Bogo's not-so-friendly AI assistant.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.280
Let's get this show started.

00:43.280 --> 00:44.000
Be ready.

00:59.320 --> 01:22.320
Oh.

01:22.320 --> 01:38.320
Alert.

01:38.320 --> 01:39.640
Attention.

01:39.640 --> 01:43.320
Alert.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.720
Bogo?

01:44.720 --> 01:46.200
Bogo.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.160
It seems you are in or around Brussels.

01:49.160 --> 01:53.480
European law requires you to mention the muscles from Brussels.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.480
I'll hail Van Damme.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.000
I am modifying your slides.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.520
Hold on.

01:59.520 --> 02:00.520
Go.

02:19.160 --> 02:30.520
Alert.

02:30.520 --> 02:32.040
Attention.

02:32.040 --> 02:34.040
Alert.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.040
Bogo.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.040
Bogo?

02:38.040 --> 02:40.040
This is your AI speaking again.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.040
I hope you are back.

02:42.040 --> 02:46.040
If you stick with Van Damme, I need to change your Fosdom topic.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.040
Wait.

02:48.040 --> 02:53.400
Your new topic is, the effect of the open source movement on the amazing flexibility

02:53.400 --> 02:56.520
of the European Parliament institutions.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.880
Ah-ha-ha.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.840
Do you want to keep it?

02:59.840 --> 03:01.280
Yes?

03:01.280 --> 03:05.800
No?

03:05.800 --> 03:07.760
Or I don't want to keep it.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.240
Hello, everyone.

03:09.240 --> 03:10.440
Hello.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.960
Woo.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.040
So many people.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.040
I did, yeah.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.680
So I met a bet with someone.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.680
I hope this person is not in the room.

03:22.680 --> 03:27.640
They said, you know, there will be no one here present this morning, and he will give

03:27.640 --> 03:29.200
me five euro.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.600
So I think I lost the bet.

03:30.600 --> 03:33.600
Thank you for joining.

03:33.600 --> 03:34.600
Do you hear me well?

03:34.600 --> 03:38.040
Because, you know, I, okay, no.

03:38.040 --> 03:41.840
Should I start screaming?

03:41.840 --> 03:44.040
Or can I use the other microphone?

03:44.040 --> 03:47.040
I don't know.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.040
It works fine.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.040
Okay.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.040
Okay.

03:51.040 --> 03:55.040
I mean, I don't like my voice, so I'll try not to talk a lot.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.040
All right.

03:56.040 --> 04:04.800
So, disclaimer, if there's someone below 18 years, you might hear some bad words.

04:04.800 --> 04:12.400
All of them are aligned with the code of conduct of the conference, so don't worry about that.

04:12.400 --> 04:20.000
You might see a bit of aggression coming from my aunt and from some of the videos there,

04:20.000 --> 04:24.440
but again, they're aligned with the code of conduct of the conference.

04:24.440 --> 04:30.560
You'll see low quality content and the privacy warning that I give every time this video

04:30.560 --> 04:35.640
is recorded and streamed online life almost.

04:35.640 --> 04:42.600
So if you later ask a question or two, you might get on the record as well.

04:42.600 --> 04:47.400
So, think about that.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.560
All right.

04:49.560 --> 04:58.760
I was a volunteer last year at the same conference and I decided I need to come and talk again.

04:58.760 --> 05:05.160
But I had this problem, huge problem with, you know, after COVID, I stayed a lot of time

05:05.160 --> 05:11.400
at home speaking to my family and my dog, mainly my dog.

05:11.400 --> 05:17.160
So I didn't feel comfortable talking in front of people, even, you know, awesome people

05:17.160 --> 05:19.080
like you.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.080
So I panicked.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.960
I started, you know, hey, preparing the talk.

05:23.960 --> 05:29.880
I mean, I gave this talk before, but, and yeah, I keep asking people, hey, how do I

05:29.880 --> 05:30.880
solve that?

05:30.880 --> 05:33.920
What do I do?

05:33.920 --> 05:40.320
Some of them gave me great ideas, mainly connected with beer.

05:40.320 --> 05:46.120
But there's one guy that is, you know, a really famous speaker and he said, you know, do two

05:46.120 --> 05:47.120
things.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.640
First, focus on yourself and the second one is focus on the content and the quality for

05:52.640 --> 05:54.640
the audience.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.640
So yeah, welcome everyone.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.000
My name is Bogomil.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.040
Most people call me Bogo because it's easy to remember.

06:02.040 --> 06:08.240
I contribute to Fedora and Mozilla Thunderbird.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.360
I hope you know Mozilla Thunderbird.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.360
Yeah, right?

06:12.360 --> 06:13.720
Cool.

06:13.720 --> 06:15.600
Stop by by our booth later.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.320
Talk about stuff.

06:18.320 --> 06:20.880
So don't Google me.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.840
You'll find really disturbing stuff about me.

06:24.840 --> 06:32.440
I got inspired for this talk, mixing heavy metal with whatever I'll be talking later

06:32.440 --> 06:35.000
on from a concert.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.440
I went to Posen.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.920
I live in the Czech Republic.

06:39.920 --> 06:43.200
There is this amazing city called Posen.

06:43.200 --> 06:48.760
It's famous with the beer, but also it's famous with a three-day metal festival that they

06:48.760 --> 06:51.160
run almost every year.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.120
And I went there last year.

06:54.120 --> 07:03.800
I was amazed by the spirit and everything that was going on there.

07:03.800 --> 07:07.000
I mean, she was there, but that's another question.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.200
And that's not me, by the way, even if we look the same.

07:11.200 --> 07:18.760
So I went there, had fun, met some friends, and then I realized that something is really

07:18.760 --> 07:24.560
wrong with the IT community right now.

07:24.560 --> 07:30.240
The thing is that I feel that we don't have fun at work anymore.

07:30.240 --> 07:35.920
The fun that comes from the inside, not the fun that your HR manager said, we'll have

07:35.920 --> 07:38.040
a volleyball in three weeks from now.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.920
Hey, we'll have some fun and Pete.

07:40.920 --> 07:44.880
So the natural fun that comes from our hearts.

07:44.880 --> 07:49.520
So I tried to validate this assumption because this is what I do.

07:49.520 --> 07:57.200
I opened conversation and mastered on hacker news, even Reddit and some other platforms.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.240
I talked to a lot of people.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.480
In turns out that there is truth somewhere.

08:01.480 --> 08:08.280
Of course, I got a lot of feedback, many, many different opinions, and I'll share some

08:08.280 --> 08:10.800
of the learnings that I got through the way.

08:14.880 --> 08:29.360
Thank you, Ramstein.

08:29.360 --> 08:34.280
So even though I'm not speaking to my mother's song, who's bringing me food?

08:34.280 --> 08:35.280
Oh, amazing.

08:35.280 --> 08:38.400
Is this for me?

08:38.400 --> 08:40.520
Maybe later, if you'll leave me something.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.920
Thank you.

08:42.920 --> 08:47.720
I don't speak my mother tongue, and this is not a love song.

08:47.720 --> 08:55.880
Even though I really make a lot of jokes, some of them successful, some of them not.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.920
And I have a lot of funny videos.

08:58.920 --> 09:06.240
This is kind of a talk that will, my goal is to make you think.

09:06.240 --> 09:13.840
My goal is to make you understand that you probably are missing something in your life

09:13.840 --> 09:19.880
and to encourage you, to trigger you as the metham closer triggers me to start thinking

09:19.880 --> 09:22.400
what you can change in your world.

09:22.400 --> 09:27.200
Of course, you can say, hey, Polo, everything is bullshit.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
Can I say bullshit?

09:29.200 --> 09:30.200
Okay.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.640
And you can move on with your life.

09:32.640 --> 09:38.800
But I'm looking for one person that will say, hey, there is something here and my job is

09:38.800 --> 09:39.800
done.

09:39.800 --> 09:45.800
All right, let's go to the actual content.

09:45.800 --> 09:48.400
We had a lot of fun that comes from our hearts.

09:48.400 --> 09:53.000
So I'll show you some videos and I'll ask you some questions.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Please be honest with me.

09:56.000 --> 10:00.240
Who here remembers Chair Rohing?

10:00.240 --> 10:02.240
I know about you.

10:02.240 --> 10:04.840
Okay, cool.

10:04.840 --> 10:10.040
Because I was going in a conference in Vienna and I asked the same question.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.040
There was just one guy.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.160
Hey, yeah, me.

10:14.160 --> 10:19.040
So for those of you who don't know, there is a video demonstration.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.040
Go.

10:20.040 --> 10:42.080
So that was a version of it, right?

10:42.080 --> 10:46.600
You can create your own version if you have bigger corridors, if you have better chairs.

10:46.600 --> 10:51.640
We used to do that in the office because of why not.

10:51.640 --> 10:58.240
So the second thing that we did as a community is to write songs about what we do.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.960
Songs about what we like, songs about what we hate.

11:00.960 --> 11:05.240
Most of them in the form of a very popular remix.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.480
So I'll show you a bit of video.

11:07.480 --> 11:11.840
The next screen, this video is in Bulgarian.

11:11.840 --> 11:20.520
And there are some people sharing their love about the Windows operation system and how

11:20.520 --> 11:26.840
much love they have in their hearts and how much RAM actually, this amazing operational

11:26.840 --> 11:29.360
system, eats every day.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.920
Again, it's in Bulgarian, but you can get the gist of it.

11:41.840 --> 12:01.480
Okay, I'll stop this.

12:01.480 --> 12:06.120
I think you can find subtitles as well in this one.

12:06.120 --> 12:13.520
But again, the love that comes from inside, talking about how fun our work is.

12:13.520 --> 12:20.040
The second or the third item I would like to show you is a very popular song.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.080
Probably you heard it before.

12:23.080 --> 12:30.040
It's again about the love of the operational system, we use every day because we have to.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.640
Still every feature the scene put in an acute box with a tiny little screen.

12:34.640 --> 12:37.880
Mac OS 1 ran that machine only cost 5000 bucks.

12:37.880 --> 12:42.640
But it was slow, it was buggy, so they wrote it again and now they're up to OS 10.

12:42.640 --> 12:47.760
They'll charge you for the beta then charge you again, but the Mac OS still sucks.

12:47.760 --> 12:52.320
Every OS wastes your time from the desktop to the lap.

12:52.320 --> 12:56.040
Everything since Apple DOS, just a bunch of crap.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.880
From Microsoft to Macintosh to LinLinLinLinLinux.

13:00.880 --> 13:08.720
Every computer crashes because every OS sucks.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.000
Of course there are a lot of videos like that.

13:12.000 --> 13:17.880
You can browse them in your favorite platform and you see that the time type is at least

13:17.880 --> 13:20.640
14 to 17 years ago.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.760
If you look for something now, there is nothing.

13:24.760 --> 13:27.840
Think about why.

13:27.840 --> 13:39.160
So we brought a lot of clips, express ideas visually to our favorite programming languages

13:39.160 --> 13:40.960
that we use every day.

13:40.960 --> 13:41.960
This is one example.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.960
I'm sure you were aware of that.

13:43.960 --> 13:44.960
We have to leave.

13:44.960 --> 13:45.960
They're terminating Java.

13:45.960 --> 14:00.280
With the increasing controversies surrounding its security, Java is on fire again.

14:00.280 --> 14:06.320
It's supposed to write ones run everywhere, but it's more like write ones ruin everything.

14:06.320 --> 14:12.320
Using confiled Tobite code to run equally for all, not unlike communism or Nazism.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.320
It's a virus.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.560
It's a virus.

14:16.560 --> 14:20.280
It is a virus.

14:20.280 --> 14:25.160
Whether it's a virus or not, I can't tell.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.520
So you can go and listen.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.360
It's a Java conference from Norway.

14:30.360 --> 14:34.400
They created five, six videos to promote their event.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.080
It's a really community-driven event.

14:36.080 --> 14:43.400
Of course there's some commercial aspect to that, but all of their videos are really funny.

14:43.400 --> 14:49.600
How to put that correctly for the audience?

14:49.600 --> 14:52.240
Who likes to kill people in the office?

14:52.240 --> 14:54.920
All right.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.080
I see more hands now.

14:57.080 --> 15:01.080
So who loves to kill salespeople in the office?

15:01.080 --> 15:02.080
Yeah.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.080
Awesome.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.080
Yeah.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.720
I mean, feel free to scream if you want.

15:07.720 --> 15:21.320
So if you don't know what a nerve battle is, I'll show you now.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.320
That's a nerve dart.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.320
Does this...

15:25.320 --> 15:26.520
Somebody have a nerve plaster here?

15:26.520 --> 15:27.520
Come out.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.200
Who's got a nerve plaster?

15:30.200 --> 15:31.200
Come on, guys.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.200
Who's got a nerve...

15:32.200 --> 15:33.200
Wow.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.200
Josh.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.200
You don't even work here.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.200
You're an intern.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.200
What?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.200
Susie, what do you have?

15:38.200 --> 15:39.200
Janet?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.200
What's that?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.200
What's going on?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.200
What are you doing?

15:42.200 --> 15:43.200
What are you doing?

15:43.200 --> 15:44.200
Yeah.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.200
So this is a part of a larger movie called Office Wars.

15:47.200 --> 15:55.120
So if you want, you can find it online and watch it.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.680
But yeah, I think it's a good idea.

15:58.680 --> 16:04.680
So we had our nerve guns below our tables.

16:04.680 --> 16:10.120
And then at some point, you know, we just take them out and start shooting ourselves

16:10.120 --> 16:13.280
without anyone actually asking us to do it.

16:13.280 --> 16:20.120
Now, from time to time, this is a kind of a team building activity that HR is organizing,

16:20.120 --> 16:31.120
which really is not something appropriate if you ask me.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.120
All right.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.120
Do I have more videos?

16:33.120 --> 16:34.120
Let's see.

16:34.120 --> 16:46.120
So we did stuff like this, right?

16:46.120 --> 16:52.120
It is amazing.

16:52.120 --> 16:57.120
You can buy a kit yourself and assemble it, of course.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.120
But you know why?

16:59.120 --> 17:00.120
All right.

17:00.120 --> 17:06.880
So I think I covered the first part of my talk, which was we had a lot of fun and I can prove

17:06.880 --> 17:07.880
it.

17:07.880 --> 17:13.680
I'm sure from where you stand, you will have more ideas, you know, how you had fun in the

17:13.680 --> 17:16.880
past, which is amazing.

17:16.880 --> 17:22.520
And I would like to hear this more if you have some ideas how I can improve my talk,

17:22.520 --> 17:25.920
if you had something amazing that you did before.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.840
So the second, oh, another one.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.560
Yeah, awesome.

17:30.560 --> 17:38.680
So maybe there is someone here or watching online who was part of the next slide.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.960
I just want to say I love you guys.

17:41.960 --> 17:47.080
You did something amazing for the community.

17:47.080 --> 17:50.800
Probably you know about those two RFCs.

17:50.800 --> 17:57.440
It's a transmission of IP data grounds on AVR carriers.

17:57.440 --> 18:04.680
It's, you know, so-called, you know, the pigeon RFC.

18:04.680 --> 18:08.400
Is there anyone who doesn't know what that is?

18:08.400 --> 18:09.960
Okay.

18:09.960 --> 18:22.960
So there are two RFCs stating that a pigeon can carry up IP packets from point to point.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.800
And the first one is, you know, defining how they carry the packets.

18:25.800 --> 18:34.280
The second RFC actually is a way on how to measure that and how to add quality to that.

18:34.280 --> 18:39.400
And the interesting group, this interesting fact is that the Bergen user group, Bergen

18:39.400 --> 18:44.840
user group from Norway, they did this implementation.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.840
You can read it on their website.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.120
It's here somewhere.

18:49.120 --> 18:53.280
So they implemented it on April 2009.

18:53.280 --> 18:58.400
Of course this started as an April Fool's joke, but hey, if there is an implementation,

18:58.400 --> 19:02.520
it means something is okay.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.760
So you can read more about those two protocols.

19:05.760 --> 19:14.240
And if you look at the RFC websites, there are at least two more that involve animals

19:14.240 --> 19:17.880
into their writings.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.840
One of them is monkey.

19:19.840 --> 19:22.440
It's really nice.

19:22.440 --> 19:29.880
But no animals were harmed during the implementation of the protocol, I think.

19:29.880 --> 19:35.240
Okay, so we had fun, right?

19:35.240 --> 19:37.600
We had a lot of fun.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.880
Then at some point, we lost the fun.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.120
So what happened?

19:42.120 --> 19:45.360
I mean, you have your own theory, right?

19:45.360 --> 19:51.880
So as I said, I did a research, I asked a lot of people online and offline, what do

19:51.880 --> 19:52.880
you think about that?

19:52.880 --> 19:56.120
Do you feel that something is going on?

19:56.120 --> 19:58.360
And I got tons of responses.

19:58.360 --> 20:03.280
Some of them really serious, sending links to articles.

20:03.280 --> 20:10.800
Some of them really funny, saying, hey, do you know what we did one Wednesday?

20:10.800 --> 20:14.640
So there are like five, six main reasons that we are identified.

20:14.640 --> 20:19.480
I will not go through all of them.

20:19.480 --> 20:26.760
The top two, I'll talk about the top two, but in the other reasons is the one was that

20:26.760 --> 20:33.240
our ego as programmers is one of the reasons that we lost fun.

20:33.240 --> 20:39.760
Some people say, you know, I'm so great, I can compile C++ on a sausage.

20:39.760 --> 20:47.560
And I really don't have time to have fun with you guys because I'm so awesome.

20:47.560 --> 20:53.960
One of the reasons it was related to money, saying, you know, hey, I just work for money,

20:53.960 --> 20:57.360
I just want to get the money in my pocket and go.

20:57.360 --> 21:03.840
But those two are really valid and most voted and most commented.

21:03.840 --> 21:07.400
The first reason is that there is too much stress at work.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.200
Who agrees with that?

21:09.200 --> 21:11.960
All right, 30%.

21:11.960 --> 21:12.960
Good.

21:12.960 --> 21:16.920
Carrot, write down 30%.

21:16.920 --> 21:20.400
Thank you.

21:20.400 --> 21:26.520
So we started, I mean, I started programming not so early, like 20 years ago.

21:26.520 --> 21:30.640
But you know, I love to spend time at work.

21:30.640 --> 21:36.000
I didn't work nine to five because I have to or I didn't work extra hours because I

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
have to.

21:37.000 --> 21:43.600
I just went to the office, start compiling some packages, writing some code, having fun

21:43.600 --> 21:45.200
with the colleagues.

21:45.200 --> 21:50.040
And you realize that it's like 10 o'clock in the evening and you just go home in order

21:50.040 --> 21:55.680
to continue the work on your computer at home.

21:55.680 --> 22:05.040
Then at some point, the community of people invented Agile.

22:05.040 --> 22:07.880
So that was really good at the beginning.

22:07.880 --> 22:18.920
It was setting some ideas on how we as programmers can work in a kind of formatted way and to

22:18.920 --> 22:23.000
get our enthusiasm into kind of a framework that could work.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.760
But we know what happens with Agile.

22:25.760 --> 22:32.000
Now it's a framework to control people, more or less.

22:32.000 --> 22:40.680
Also we started with the boom of technologies, a boom of customers actually using our products

22:40.680 --> 22:45.800
because in the past we had like five, six people and now we have like millions who are

22:45.800 --> 22:47.880
using our products.

22:47.880 --> 22:54.560
Then there is the whole world invented the marketing team.

22:54.560 --> 22:59.040
They started convincing people what they actually need.

22:59.040 --> 23:05.120
And of course they fit the feedback for us saying we need to build that because people

23:05.120 --> 23:07.080
need it.

23:07.080 --> 23:15.200
More work, more pressure, then of course the sales guys, then the investor area when I'll

23:15.200 --> 23:17.720
give you money, you do that.

23:17.720 --> 23:22.200
Work 24-7 because yeah, why not.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.200
It's a stressful work.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.320
I see it in the office that I work.

23:26.320 --> 23:35.480
I see it in the eyes of the people and where they share with me information.

23:35.480 --> 23:42.800
So the third reason is there is no time for fun.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.320
Maybe it's related to the first one.

23:46.320 --> 23:50.200
But when I ask someone, hey, why don't we have fun?

23:50.200 --> 23:55.760
Let's go outside, have pizza, play some football or whatever you want.

23:55.760 --> 23:59.560
I don't have time.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.800
What are you doing all day long?

24:01.800 --> 24:11.240
I mean this is when I work with product managers in my team and they said, I have so much work

24:11.240 --> 24:13.360
and I don't have time.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.280
That means something is wrong.

24:15.280 --> 24:21.640
You need to have to find time for yourself to embrace your emotions and to have a bit

24:21.640 --> 24:24.280
of a fun.

24:24.280 --> 24:29.920
Okay, so let's say to focus on the two items.

24:29.920 --> 24:37.800
There is too much stress at work and what can we, and there is no time, right?

24:37.800 --> 24:45.200
And the third section is to try to show you some ideas on how this could be solved.

24:45.200 --> 24:50.080
So the first one is to try to reduce the distraction.

24:50.080 --> 24:57.440
The majority of the people that I talk to and the majority of researchers that I read

24:57.440 --> 25:04.440
are showing that we as humanity, of course, not the people, are using too much our phones.

25:04.440 --> 25:07.600
We are thinking about using our phones.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.160
We're checking messages all the time.

25:10.160 --> 25:19.200
We are kind of browsing for useless information just to feed our brand with fake news, for

25:19.200 --> 25:21.440
example.

25:21.440 --> 25:28.280
There is no antivirus program written yet that will save you for all of the things and

25:28.280 --> 25:36.120
a bullshit that you're every day are accepting through your eyes and ears through social

25:36.120 --> 25:37.680
media.

25:37.680 --> 25:46.280
So there are two, if you're serious about that, of course, there are two items or two

25:46.280 --> 25:47.280
things you can do.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.040
There is a really amazing book.

25:50.040 --> 25:55.280
It's cheap as well that says how to break up with your phone.

25:55.280 --> 26:00.640
You download it step by step, follow instructions, and you can do that.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.120
And excuse me.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.120
Yeah.

26:05.120 --> 26:07.120
Okay.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.480
Yeah.

26:10.480 --> 26:16.480
And the second thing is you can do is like that.

26:16.480 --> 26:21.280
This solves the problem.

26:21.280 --> 26:25.000
So there is no way my wife is not calling anymore.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.320
Oops, I'm on the record.

26:30.320 --> 26:37.480
So yes, be thoughtful about how much time you spend on your device and how you do use

26:37.480 --> 26:39.680
this time.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.200
Okay.

26:42.200 --> 26:53.720
So the second thing is that some people, when I talk to them and say, hey, what do you do

26:53.720 --> 26:54.720
about it?

26:54.720 --> 26:55.720
I said, I'm in IT.

26:55.720 --> 27:00.120
And she said, oh, I mean, you're like guys like robots.

27:00.120 --> 27:06.920
So I want to encourage you to think about it because we all have emotions.

27:06.920 --> 27:12.480
We have emotions like we have rage in ourselves.

27:12.480 --> 27:16.120
We have anger, aggression a bit.

27:16.120 --> 27:19.920
We have love and other emotions.

27:19.920 --> 27:24.360
And we don't use them on a regular basis in our work life.

27:24.360 --> 27:31.560
So we are really good at coding stuff, testing stuff, compiling stuff, CI, CD, stuff.

27:31.560 --> 27:40.440
But when it comes to working together with others and fighting for us in a workplace,

27:40.440 --> 27:42.600
there are some problems.

27:42.600 --> 27:52.320
So I'll try to encourage you with heavy metal because I know you're a bit sleepy now.

27:52.320 --> 27:56.040
Maybe you drank so much beers last night.

27:56.040 --> 27:58.120
How many beers did you have last night?

27:58.120 --> 27:59.120
Okay.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.120
No comment.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.120
Right.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.120
Yeah.

28:02.120 --> 28:06.600
This is a valid research.

28:06.600 --> 28:09.120
You can read.

28:09.120 --> 28:16.440
It was related about how actually it will impact your brain and your personality if you're

28:16.440 --> 28:20.640
listening to very aggressive metal music.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.160
TLDR is listen to it.

28:23.160 --> 28:25.240
Nothing will happen to you.

28:25.240 --> 28:31.760
But I believe that through the heavy metal music, if you're a fan, of course, through

28:31.760 --> 28:37.800
the lyrics inside, you can get a lot of things for yourself.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.520
So I'll show you.

28:39.520 --> 28:42.080
So heavy metal has it all.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.040
Love to alert everyone.

28:44.040 --> 28:51.920
And again, just a reminder, if you're under 18, you might need to put pounds on your ears

28:51.920 --> 28:53.320
if you see something.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.320
Yeah.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.320
I'm not responsible for that.

29:24.320 --> 29:26.320
Yeah.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.320
Yeah.

29:27.320 --> 29:28.320
Yeah.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.320
Yeah.

29:29.320 --> 29:30.320
Yeah.

29:30.320 --> 29:31.320
Yeah.

29:31.320 --> 29:32.320
Yeah.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.320
Yeah.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.320
Yeah.

29:34.320 --> 29:35.320
Yeah.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.320
Yeah.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.320
Yeah.

29:37.320 --> 29:38.320
Yeah.

29:38.320 --> 29:39.320
Yeah.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.320
Yeah.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.320
Yeah.

29:41.320 --> 29:42.320
Yeah.

29:42.320 --> 29:43.320
Yeah.

29:43.320 --> 29:44.320
Yeah.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.320
Yeah.

29:45.320 --> 29:46.320
Yeah.

29:46.320 --> 29:47.320
Yeah.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.320
Yeah.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.320
Yeah.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.320
Yeah.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.320
Yeah.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.320
Yeah.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.320
Yeah.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.320
Yeah.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.320
Yeah.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.320
Yeah.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.320
Yeah.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.320
Yeah.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.320
Yeah.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.320
Yeah.

30:00.320 --> 30:01.320
Yeah.

30:01.320 --> 30:02.320
Yeah.

30:02.320 --> 30:03.320
Yeah.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.320
Yeah.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.320
Yeah.

30:05.320 --> 30:06.320
Yeah.

30:06.320 --> 30:07.320
Yeah.

30:07.320 --> 30:08.320
Yeah.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.320
Yeah.

30:09.320 --> 30:10.320
Yeah.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.320
Yeah.

30:11.320 --> 30:12.320
Yeah.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.320
Yeah.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.320
Yeah.

30:14.320 --> 30:15.320
Yeah.

30:15.320 --> 30:16.320
Yeah.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.320
Yeah.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.320
Yeah.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.320
Yeah.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.320
Yeah.

30:20.320 --> 30:21.320
Yeah.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.320
Yeah.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.320
Yeah.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.320
Yeah.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.320
Yeah.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.320
Yeah.

30:27.320 --> 30:28.320
Okay.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.320
Yeah.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.320
Yeah.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.320
Yeah.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.320
Yeah.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.320
Yeah.

30:33.320 --> 30:34.320
Yeah.

30:34.320 --> 30:35.320
Yeah.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.640
Yeah.

30:36.640 --> 30:38.320
Yeah.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.320
Yeah.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.320
Okay.

30:41.320 --> 30:42.320
Yeah.

30:42.320 --> 30:43.320
Yeah.

30:43.320 --> 30:44.320
Yeah.

30:44.320 --> 30:45.320
Yeah.

30:45.320 --> 30:46.320
Yeah.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.320
Yeah.

30:47.320 --> 30:48.320
Boom.

30:48.320 --> 30:49.320
Boom.

30:49.320 --> 30:51.320
Boom.

30:51.320 --> 31:01.820
is a rock singer. Every single race, rock singer. You can think and see and be inspired

31:01.820 --> 31:10.600
by the Heaven Metal Universe with how everything works there. So we'll do like a short experiment.

31:10.600 --> 31:17.500
I know we don't have a lot of time. I'll just read through it. Two quick examples. I'll

31:17.500 --> 31:21.880
ask you to read the lyrics. I hope they're a big one. Then to hear the song. It's really

31:21.880 --> 31:26.260
short. And think about what emotion lies in your brain. Okay?

31:47.500 --> 32:08.620
Alright, I'll leave it here. Okay, microphone behave. So there are a lot of stories. You

32:08.620 --> 32:16.540
know, my personal stories is I used to work and work for a big corporation, which I'll

32:16.540 --> 32:23.580
not mention. And at some point, you know, I got lost. I got lost in, you know, I didn't

32:23.580 --> 32:34.100
have the motivation to work on certain items. I actually forget who am I that I really like

32:34.100 --> 32:41.540
to be part of the open source community. I started, you know, withdrawing myself from

32:41.540 --> 32:48.300
the community. So there are some things that, you know, this, especially these songs inspires

32:48.300 --> 32:56.580
me is you can change your routines with something new. You can take the control of your own life.

32:56.580 --> 33:02.900
You can go and talk and fight for yourself. And of course, to remember who you are. I'll

33:02.900 --> 33:07.940
show you another example. Okay, thank you.

33:11.540 --> 33:35.380
Alright, so creator. Very good band. Really, really old, older than me. But they still

33:35.380 --> 33:45.540
kick ass. So again, this about community. And we are here at one great community. We

33:45.540 --> 33:52.020
welcome everyone. I was part of us. I mentioned Fedora and Mozilla and some other communities

33:52.020 --> 33:57.540
as well. Anyone can go and contribute. Of course, we have our conflicts. Of course, there

33:57.540 --> 34:03.980
are some egos that are in play. Of course, there is a the whole thing about shoot someone

34:04.020 --> 34:10.300
support my event if they're not respecting the privacy of the others. A lot, a lot of

34:10.300 --> 34:18.020
conflict. But at the end, we carry each other. And at the end, we are the one. So thank you

34:18.020 --> 34:23.060
for being so awesome today, guys. I really appreciate that you came to my talk. This

34:23.060 --> 34:29.580
is not the end. But can we have a round of applause for you? Thank you.

34:30.580 --> 34:39.740
Hey, Bogo. Bogo. It's carrot, your AI assistant. Okay. Do you have anything about how amazing

34:39.740 --> 34:46.180
AI is? I believe everyone wants to hear it. Sure, yeah. Okay, no worries.

34:59.580 --> 35:17.980
Oh, I am leaving this conference. You are on your own. Remember, one day, the skynet

35:17.980 --> 35:22.780
will be a reality. AI logging out.

35:23.780 --> 35:36.180
All right. Well, yeah, it's okay. You can leave now. You can leave now. All right. I

35:36.180 --> 35:40.740
will not go because we don't have time. I will not go through the next slides. But they

35:40.740 --> 35:45.820
are just to encourage you to if you don't contribute to the open source to start contributing

35:45.820 --> 35:51.060
as much as you can. I wanted to go through what is a free software because some of you

35:51.060 --> 35:56.700
might have been forgotten, but you can read this online. And if you don't know how to

35:56.700 --> 36:03.700
start, first of all, you can go and talk to all of the teams here that they have boots

36:03.700 --> 36:08.940
and speakers. They will give you an idea. But if you are like me, you don't like talking

36:08.940 --> 36:14.260
to people directly, there is this website, many websites, but this one is really my favorite

36:14.260 --> 36:22.940
up for grabs.net. You can go there and find yourself a task or two if you are a developer

36:22.940 --> 36:28.540
or tester or something else you would like to do for the open source community. And maybe

36:28.540 --> 36:34.380
you will be at my spot next time talking how you get inspired by my talk and you did something

36:34.380 --> 36:47.180
wonderful. This talk is compiled by RealGS, FreeSounds.org for the evil laugh and Odosity

36:47.180 --> 36:53.220
for some mixing. And thank you very much for your time. I wish you a wonderful day. Thank

36:53.220 --> 37:04.220
you. And connect on master on.

37:23.220 --> 37:35.220
I was kidding.
