00:00.000 --> 00:10.120
I'd like to hand over to the chair of the first panel, which is Martin Erz and Martin

00:10.120 --> 00:19.160
Erz from MLNet Labs, and is going to lead what we do next, Martin.

00:19.160 --> 00:22.360
Thank you, Simon.

00:22.360 --> 00:27.520
So welcome to the first block of the day, which is about CRA and PLD.

00:27.520 --> 00:32.480
I just heard from Simon how the structure generally works.

00:32.480 --> 00:37.040
I will say a couple of works about how this block will work right now.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.000
So an important person during this session will be our rapporteur, who will be writing

00:41.000 --> 00:45.720
down all the things that the speakers say, but also perhaps the things that you will

00:45.720 --> 00:49.840
bring in, because the idea of these sessions is to actually have some interaction.

00:49.840 --> 00:53.480
So for this session, that will be Merco.

00:53.480 --> 01:01.480
Merco will be our rapporteur, and at the end of the block, he will summarize what he learned today.

01:01.480 --> 01:06.360
So for the agenda of this particular block, we will have two lightning talks.

01:06.360 --> 01:11.800
We will have a panel, a workshop bit where you can actually do something yourself, if

01:11.800 --> 01:14.240
you haven't already, by asking questions.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.160
We will have a third lightning talk, and then we will close with a rapporteur's summary.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.640
So that's our agenda until about 11.15.
