00:00.000 --> 00:13.040
So, hello everyone and thank you for your patience.

00:13.040 --> 00:18.720
So I am Tuto, I'm a project manager and expert contributor with an IT for PT.

00:18.720 --> 00:25.120
I'm based in Paris and why I'm here today is because I do believe that the tools, the

00:25.440 --> 00:31.760
data that we generate should be used to build communities and inclusion.

00:32.480 --> 00:37.360
You have below a couple of languages that you can ask me questions into

00:38.960 --> 00:42.960
try not Japanese because then no one will understand in the room. Thank you.

00:43.760 --> 00:50.240
So, IT for PT who we are, we are a non-profit association and what we do originally we

00:50.320 --> 00:57.360
actually come from onboard units where we created a standard for open architecture and data

00:57.360 --> 01:04.400
accessibility and interoperability which means that basically the bus, the trains, the trams,

01:04.400 --> 01:10.720
the rolling stock would all be standardized talking together from the actual wiring of the vehicle.

01:10.720 --> 01:16.640
So making sure everyone for example use the same internet connection into tapping into the same

01:17.280 --> 01:24.560
feedback loop to the back office. So we are a membership based association. We have over 160

01:24.560 --> 01:32.240
members in 28 countries that will have railway operators, public transport agencies and other

01:32.240 --> 01:39.680
associations. So as I said what we do really is to build this architecture for interoperability

01:39.680 --> 01:48.160
first and foremost. We also gather together a community of open source developers, aficionados

01:48.160 --> 01:55.040
and passionate people so that's why we're here and we also have at the end a label for compliance

01:55.040 --> 02:00.240
making sure that when people use standards they're not alone and they can actually check that all

02:00.240 --> 02:06.480
their different units are compliant with the standard so then from the buyer perspective you

02:06.480 --> 02:11.200
know that it fits the norms that exist and I'm happy to have Breder with me.

02:13.680 --> 02:23.360
Yeah officially I'm a public product owner for a small team in Norway with 10 people

02:24.240 --> 02:29.440
representing and tour company owned by the Ministry of Transport. We are a non-profit.

02:30.400 --> 02:40.800
We work building open source tools. We are using public funded money in our development and we want

02:40.800 --> 02:48.400
to give as much as possible to back to the society both with open data and open sources

02:48.400 --> 02:55.280
collaborating with stakeholders in Europe, Norway and internationally.

02:55.440 --> 03:08.720
What we say we do is building an open infrastructure platform. The road authority builds roads,

03:09.520 --> 03:18.480
someone builds the harbors, airports, electricity, water supplies. We build an infrastructure

03:18.480 --> 03:28.320
platform for mobility data. Open source all the way for my part of the tour and advocate for that

03:28.320 --> 03:43.840
for also the rest. This is. So on this one we wanted to show you a little bit what exists today

03:43.840 --> 03:51.280
when we talk about data that relates to transport and public transport and also railway

03:52.160 --> 03:56.640
knowing that there are different types of standards and specifications that exist.

03:56.640 --> 04:03.120
So if you take the European context you will have this gigantic European norm that is called

04:03.120 --> 04:10.000
Transmodal that is really to be viewed as a data dictionary and a grammar. So it's not

04:10.800 --> 04:16.560
a standard. It's really a reference for you to cross check concepts, how they integrate one with

04:16.560 --> 04:22.560
another, how they are articulated, how actually they are defined and because it's a European norm

04:22.560 --> 04:28.720
it is also translated in most European languages so it also makes it easier to implement.

04:29.360 --> 04:35.600
Obviously a data dictionary, a data model is nothing if a data exchange format is not created.

04:35.600 --> 04:42.480
So there were two and way more open standards that were created based on Transmodal. One is

04:42.480 --> 04:50.160
netx that is timetable information that is everything that is known in advance to describe

04:50.160 --> 04:59.920
transport network, schedule, the fares and so on. You have Siri for real-time information or anything

04:59.920 --> 05:06.320
that is not known in advance that you will have real-time updates, vehicle monitoring,

05:07.120 --> 05:13.520
situation exchange for example if you need to close railway or public transport services

05:13.520 --> 05:19.760
and one that is upcoming that we will start working on defining very soon is OPRA which is

05:19.760 --> 05:25.200
more to run statistics, performance, so public transport agencies and authorities can compare

05:26.000 --> 05:33.920
one operator from the other. You also have in the screen shown GTFS schedule and GTFS real-time

05:33.920 --> 05:41.840
which are probably the most used today across the world to describe real actually timetables and

05:41.840 --> 05:47.920
real-time information based on the on these schedules so if you use any trip planning app

05:48.880 --> 05:54.880
a good chance is that it's actually based on GTFS data because we're here in the room I would also

05:54.880 --> 05:59.920
like to thank a couple of colleagues including Stefan because right now what we're doing is

05:59.920 --> 06:06.800
actually bridging what was first created for urban public transport with the rail domain through

06:06.800 --> 06:14.640
European project. So as I said I wanted to place a little bit everything that is open standard

06:14.640 --> 06:21.200
and open source within railway and open transport and basically is just to show you that everything

06:21.200 --> 06:28.160
is linked so as a customer you usually just see the trip planning part which is on the top right

06:29.120 --> 06:36.480
where you actually want to go from A to B so you'll get your train schedule your timetable and so on

06:36.480 --> 06:42.880
and also real-time information the train is cancelled services disrupted one is late and so on and

06:42.880 --> 06:48.880
so on or just the tram is arriving at the station all of that is thanks to the data that is issued

06:49.440 --> 06:54.560
from the back office that a lot of times especially for real-time data is actually

06:54.560 --> 07:02.720
based on vehicle data where the IT4PT specification exists so as you see we really try to map out

07:02.720 --> 07:08.800
all the different standards and specifications that exist to build all of that but that's really

07:08.800 --> 07:14.880
the backbone it was more for me to give you an indication that all the data you work on has been

07:14.960 --> 07:19.200
standardized and standards are open for you to participate in.

07:22.800 --> 07:32.400
Let's go back I will focus in my next minutes talk about the upper right corner

07:33.520 --> 07:39.360
IT4PT standards from the vehicle to the back office system that produce real-time data in Norway

07:40.160 --> 07:46.160
is more and more based on the IT4PT standards but I will not cover that in my presentation because

07:47.600 --> 07:57.120
we are in the upright corner from the inside and we will have demand for finalized data that we can

07:57.120 --> 08:08.640
use so the IT4PT stuff is done by the operators. This is a overview of our all components that my

08:08.640 --> 08:17.440
team is responsible for you can split it into two which is the input side and output side all of this

08:17.440 --> 08:29.680
is open source open at github someone in the room Hannes is part of the team so we are more here to

08:29.680 --> 08:38.480
ask other technical questions it's possible and one French company has downloaded this on github

08:38.480 --> 08:49.040
and one atender and serves a region in Paris. We seek collaboration with everyone don't reinvent

08:49.040 --> 08:57.120
the wheel again in this audience how many produce data or want to produce data for the mobility sector

09:00.000 --> 09:04.800
10? Stevan, raise your hand

09:09.600 --> 09:14.080
you want the right way to produce data and make it open yeah

09:16.720 --> 09:19.920
and the rest of you you want to use data

09:20.400 --> 09:22.400
yeah

09:25.520 --> 09:29.680
yesterday in the middle of this week I was in another meeting

09:31.760 --> 09:38.240
where the EU country talked and showed what they have done with open data

09:38.240 --> 09:47.280
regarding netx and Siri the last year nine country showed up and all of them has a lot of work to do

09:48.160 --> 09:59.680
so let's go just briefly into what we have done in Attenture we have focused on high quality data

10:00.480 --> 10:08.160
we need that to produce good information to the travelers so the operator and authorities in

10:08.160 --> 10:15.440
Norway are responsible for three things we have a national stop-lapse registry so they

10:15.440 --> 10:24.480
manually update that they produce planned time travel data in Norway we say note the

10:24.480 --> 10:31.920
conversional data so they produce native netx from the start in this context netx is similar to

10:31.920 --> 10:41.440
gtfs but have a lot of more data support more into operational data can be transferred to the data

10:41.680 --> 10:49.760
and we use Siri protocols for real-time updates that is very similar to gtfs real-time

10:53.280 --> 10:58.720
we develop OpenTrip planner open source component we do that in collaboration with

11:00.480 --> 11:01.280
that project

11:01.440 --> 11:11.200
it's a successful collaboration supports both netx and gtfs

11:12.880 --> 11:15.440
supports high quality data in

11:17.760 --> 11:26.720
Attenture we reached in January one billion requests in a month in a country with five and a half million

11:26.720 --> 11:37.840
people so you want to travel a lot the API from OpenTrip planner is openly available

11:37.840 --> 11:45.840
you don't need to register but if you do you can have more access to it and we support mostly the

11:45.840 --> 11:52.160
main travel apps in Norway to use that API so we are getting the same information everywhere

11:52.800 --> 11:59.280
the API should be relevant for different users so it's flexible so the client can decide what

12:00.080 --> 12:08.000
is important for my users to show so the Ministry of Transport wants an tour to be a neutral one

12:09.760 --> 12:20.400
the national the biggest railway operator they want to show their offering first so they show

12:20.480 --> 12:27.600
their offerings and not the competing ones in the same way and other other regions based apps

12:28.400 --> 12:34.000
show only their local area and not enough and all of them are using the same API

12:34.720 --> 12:39.600
getting the same correct information everywhere we have one place to correct if it's wrong

12:41.040 --> 12:42.400
on the left side at the source

12:42.640 --> 12:49.920
we also share data in national access point which is a requirement in Europe

12:52.400 --> 12:56.320
there we share the API I talked about we share net text and stereo raw data files

12:56.960 --> 13:05.040
and we share gtfs and gtfs as well all of this is open available and what we say to the

13:05.040 --> 13:11.760
Norwegian data producers you have three responsibilities stop places the netx data

13:11.760 --> 13:18.800
and the return data and we from an tour can take care of the data is correct in all the apps

13:19.600 --> 13:27.200
and all the international apps also so we say to them deliver data to us and we can secure that

13:27.200 --> 13:40.400
it is correct as Google which is important for them we also see that the data producers want to use

13:40.480 --> 13:45.760
the data they have delivered to us that we have merged together with other data

13:46.640 --> 13:54.000
and we have quality validation tools so they want to use it themselves to do that they want

13:54.000 --> 14:00.080
they need to have more data than we need for public information they need operational data

14:01.200 --> 14:09.200
so we have added that into our data pipeline that is supported in netx and it's not supported in

14:09.200 --> 14:19.840
gtfs so that's the benefit of using netx in regards to gtfs and they starting now to use the data

14:19.840 --> 14:25.120
opens up giving them the possibility to get out of lock-in situations which is

14:27.360 --> 14:32.560
something that is usual in the public transport sector they have a big important

14:32.800 --> 14:39.680
software provider had it for many years and it's hard to shift and get out of it

14:41.520 --> 14:48.080
by going into the netx and doing that correct it's possible to break that circle

14:49.680 --> 14:59.280
to handle the extra data we do that with one validation in the previous slide

15:00.240 --> 15:03.120
but in open data we remove all the data that is

15:05.440 --> 15:14.320
for sensitive for operational part and we give them access to that in a different data set

15:17.280 --> 15:21.040
and it's this is worked works pretty nice today

15:23.680 --> 15:24.560
open source tools

15:25.440 --> 15:28.240
open tri- I can take open tri-planer

15:30.320 --> 15:33.520
I'm a man leading that

15:36.800 --> 15:42.320
open tri-planer is an open source tool started back in the US 13 14 years ago

15:43.680 --> 15:44.560
thanks Hemsner

15:44.800 --> 15:55.520
that's it was a successful tri-planning from the beginning increased usage worldwide

15:57.440 --> 16:02.400
added a lot of functionality and after 10 years when we started to use it

16:03.760 --> 16:13.520
we saw that it was built for big cities when we entered a graph with all the data from Norway

16:14.640 --> 16:16.480
the latency wasn't that

16:19.280 --> 16:21.920
usable from Oslo to Bergen

16:23.760 --> 16:28.640
10 seconds we shut the stop the search give one answer

16:32.000 --> 16:34.960
we decided to get away the community to build a new version

16:36.240 --> 16:41.920
so and to took that lead on that development the two first years we did the development alone

16:42.880 --> 16:48.880
we had meetings with the collaboration so we secured that we was on the same path

16:51.360 --> 16:58.960
today we are around 10 to 15 companies actively develop on it

17:00.240 --> 17:07.520
we do that together in the same master branch we have regular product owner meetings to discuss

17:08.320 --> 17:12.560
the direction on it and we share resources

17:15.680 --> 17:20.080
the open tri-planer is a multimodal tri-planer supports all kinds of modes

17:21.040 --> 17:27.840
we are still not finalized with it but it works and we can collaborate even more

17:28.720 --> 17:33.440
and it supports the standards we talked about today netx and syria and gtfs and gtfs

17:33.680 --> 17:41.600
and it's supported in the same instance so you can use those standards together

17:46.720 --> 17:52.720
and then we're getting to the part that might interest you the most is we wanted to present to you

17:52.720 --> 17:59.360
today all the open source tools that exist and others that need to be built and hopefully

17:59.360 --> 18:04.880
some of you will raise their hand and help us build them in the sense that it is

18:05.840 --> 18:11.920
a good good for the ecosystem so what exists is mostly thanks to the amazing work done at N2

18:11.920 --> 18:20.320
because everything is open source so they have as red said an open registry for a stop place

18:20.320 --> 18:28.400
registry so all the stop points in europe pushed by the european delegation we have

18:28.960 --> 18:35.520
a national access point so it's kind of like open data platform for every single of the 27 plus

18:35.520 --> 18:42.640
three european countries where you can find a lot of data sets and not only just public transport

18:43.280 --> 18:49.680
some of them for example in france you can have the registry of all the places where you have

18:49.680 --> 18:57.440
cal pooling you can also have description of bicycle lane and so on if some of them need

18:57.440 --> 19:04.240
for you to create a login a user and a password it's mostly to try and keep up

19:05.040 --> 19:10.080
in the kpi of how many people actually use the data and you have a lot of other open source

19:10.080 --> 19:14.800
data libraries you used to have transit feeds now it's called a mobility database you have the

19:14.800 --> 19:21.920
mobility hub for gbfs and so on in n-tool you also have a data creation tool that is called n plan

19:21.920 --> 19:31.920
so to really create your schedule and your data in netx and we have four netx two validation tools

19:31.920 --> 19:38.320
that are fully open source and two developed by n-tool and green light developed through the european

19:38.320 --> 19:46.560
project data for pt which is basically to check if your netx feed is correct against the xsd scheme

19:47.440 --> 19:55.360
and then you have a lot of other smaller open source tools such as the one created by dg transit

19:55.360 --> 20:03.040
alkadis abi and so on but what we wanted to show is those are the tools that people created a lot

20:03.680 --> 20:08.080
within their companies within european projects within their initiatives because it replied to

20:08.080 --> 20:14.560
specific needs however now that we get more and more data that is open we need to create more tools

20:14.560 --> 20:19.600
so ideas we had discussing with a lot of people but happy to hear your thoughts are graphical

20:19.600 --> 20:27.120
representations of netx and serif feeds for example conversion tools from netx to merits that is more

20:27.120 --> 20:34.320
on the railway or bridging the different open source validation tools that exist or analytical tools

20:34.320 --> 20:40.400
so that's it for our presentation and most of it we want to hear from you if you have questions on

20:41.120 --> 20:49.360
either some tools we could develop or how to actually extend gtfs or gbfs or netx or seri how

20:49.360 --> 20:56.080
do we work with the railway industry and osdm which is also one that we did not have time to present

20:56.080 --> 21:05.760
today so the floor is yours actually

21:06.320 --> 21:14.160
i know the question about netx because it was kind of small on the slide that it's the Nordic

21:14.160 --> 21:19.760
profile that's the interviewers what are the difference between profiles or what does that mean

21:20.320 --> 21:26.480
compatibility with other countries so your question is on the compatibilities of the

21:26.480 --> 21:33.040
different profiles i was asked to repeat the question for the live stream so perfect

21:36.640 --> 21:39.040
no

21:45.600 --> 21:56.240
netx is a huge standard made by more or less theoretical parts so almost every use case you

21:56.240 --> 22:03.600
can think of in public transport is supported in the standard it's allowed in within the standard to

22:04.160 --> 22:11.120
model a specific use case in different ways and it's still valid so to make data

22:11.680 --> 22:20.400
interoperable and usable for serpartis we need to have profiles the regulation

22:22.480 --> 22:25.840
came at the same time that netx was

22:26.400 --> 22:30.080
uh

22:30.080 --> 22:36.880
valid yes in the european this is a valid standard and the regulation came but it wasn't

22:36.880 --> 22:49.200
the profiles existing so the uk started with a small profile first then french built a bigger one

22:49.680 --> 22:59.360
and then in 2015 and tour came with our aims that was extremely high we wanted to support

22:59.360 --> 23:05.200
what i showed in in the slides both the information part but also support the operational part for

23:05.200 --> 23:10.560
the rail operators which is complex and also for bus operators and and more

23:11.440 --> 23:19.280
so the french profile was based on the uk we based our profile on the french

23:21.040 --> 23:21.760
added stuff

23:25.040 --> 23:27.600
and a couple of years ago

23:28.240 --> 23:38.080
uh EU profile came which is almost part of the french small differences

23:39.760 --> 23:46.720
yes first supports all of the most important parts of the european profile the norleague

23:46.720 --> 23:54.080
profile but not the operational part is not supported and not needed in the EU profile

23:54.960 --> 24:01.760
but there are this will speak it's just a small

24:04.320 --> 24:08.160
the the differences between the norleague profiles and the EU profile

24:10.000 --> 24:15.280
uh and what we see now in europe is that too many countries build their own profiles

24:16.560 --> 24:22.320
so we started also this one with a norwegian profile but together with a collaboration with

24:22.320 --> 24:28.400
the norweg countries sweden danmark and finland we asked our neighboring countries is our profile

24:28.400 --> 24:37.280
supporting your use cases if yes thumbs up we collaborate if no come to us ask us and we

24:37.280 --> 24:45.840
see what's the difference and they come back they had some uh small things that wasn't supported

24:46.480 --> 24:53.360
so we added that to the profile and they had some ideas this is a better way of solving this use

24:53.360 --> 25:00.720
case and we changed it and that we was in live production development with different stakeholders

25:00.720 --> 25:06.640
producing the data and we changed the profile and it went back to my left side on the previous

25:06.640 --> 25:12.480
presentation you have to change your export oh you're gonna have to give them money no

25:13.280 --> 25:17.200
you're not getting any money you have to change it we stopped the validation you are not allowed to

25:17.200 --> 25:22.080
produce data into our production if you don't change this and then they changed it

25:23.440 --> 25:31.680
so the difference there is uh today we see that it's very hard to use net text data from a different

25:31.680 --> 25:38.880
country into the same system you don't do something so that's what i spent the last week

25:39.280 --> 25:45.360
to highlight yeah we need to solve that as well yeah was that answering your question

25:55.360 --> 25:59.360
yes

26:08.880 --> 26:10.100
you
