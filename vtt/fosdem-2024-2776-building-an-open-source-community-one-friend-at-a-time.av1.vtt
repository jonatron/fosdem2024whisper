WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.920
Okay, great. Thanks for coming to my talk. It's going to be building an open source

00:10.920 --> 00:17.600
community one friend at a time. So we're in the community dev room here, but I've been

00:17.600 --> 00:22.400
in a couple of talks. No one has actually really defined what exactly community is.

00:22.400 --> 00:27.880
So maybe I'll start there. Here's a photos of a couple different communities that I'm

00:27.880 --> 00:33.520
a part of. And as you can see from this, there are many different types of communities.

00:33.520 --> 00:38.040
There's open source communities. There's my biking community. There's my friends. There's

00:38.040 --> 00:44.760
my running club. And there's also my party friends. And these communities all have different

00:44.760 --> 00:50.000
strengths. And one way to look at that would be how often do I see these people? For instance,

00:50.000 --> 00:55.640
I see my bike friends usually on vacation. Open source people is kind of ad hoc. My friends

00:55.640 --> 00:59.520
is daily. My running club is weekly. You know, all these kind of have their own rhythm

00:59.520 --> 01:04.000
and tempo to them. And the other thing about these communities is they're not kind of like

01:04.000 --> 01:09.800
independent, separate groups. A lot of these are overlapping, right? So someone that I

01:09.800 --> 01:13.640
bike with is someone I party with. Someone that I see every day is also someone that

01:13.640 --> 01:18.240
goes to my running club. Right? Community isn't this kind of one thing. It's this amorphous

01:18.240 --> 01:25.480
group of people. And really what I think community is, is it's built on these one-to-one connections

01:25.480 --> 01:31.200
between peoples. So this is kind of a microservices diagram. You can think about all these different

01:31.200 --> 01:34.860
microservices talking to each other. And these connections are kind of what holds the whole

01:34.860 --> 01:38.160
network together. And I would say it's the same thing about community. You have all these

01:38.160 --> 01:43.080
different nodes all overlapping, different strengths communicating to each other in

01:43.080 --> 01:51.320
different ways. And I would really say our community is built on these one-to-one friendships.

01:51.320 --> 01:56.520
So the question I'm trying to answer today is how can we build and strengthen these friendships

01:56.520 --> 02:01.960
to create better communities? And at this point you might be asking why is this guy standing

02:01.960 --> 02:08.160
in front of the room? So a little bit about me. From a large Irish Catholic family, all

02:08.160 --> 02:13.280
of our family gatherings were a lot of people around all the time. And I think that's really

02:13.280 --> 02:19.120
where I started to get some of my community from. And in college, the first thing that

02:19.160 --> 02:27.040
I did was join the student union. And one of the things that they had was kind of a saying.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.880
And it's in Latin, obviously, because it's an old-fashioned society. But what it is, roughly

02:31.880 --> 02:37.400
translated, has really stuck with me. Light increases through human interaction. And I

02:37.400 --> 02:44.520
think that drives a lot of what I do today. So with that, let's actually step out of the

02:44.560 --> 02:50.120
software world for a second. I know we're here at FOSSTEM. But if you take nothing else

02:50.120 --> 02:54.600
away from this talk, I want you to understand that there's a lot of communities in this

02:54.600 --> 03:00.240
world and we can learn a lot from the ones outside of open source. So what other community

03:00.240 --> 03:05.040
am I a part of? I'm a part of Midnight Runners. That's why I'm wearing this t-shirt today.

03:05.040 --> 03:14.120
And what exactly is Midnight Runners? Well, we run together. We work out together. And

03:14.200 --> 03:20.280
we socialize together. And really, this is the ethos that we have together of fitness

03:20.280 --> 03:26.280
plus social. That's what Midnight Runners is. And what we're trying to do is dismantle

03:26.280 --> 03:33.280
the idea that fitness needs to be hard and unenjoyable by combining this social aspect

03:33.280 --> 03:38.520
into it. And this idea has really resonated with a lot of people. Midnight Runners is now

03:38.520 --> 03:43.600
a global community with 17 cities around the world. And not only like, you know, kind

03:43.600 --> 03:47.720
of big scale, but bring this all the way back down to me. Midnight Runners is a community

03:47.720 --> 03:53.640
has given me a lot too. It's given me fitness. It's given me a place I call home. It's given

03:53.640 --> 04:00.080
me my relationship. And it's also given me friends in Berlin and all around the world.

04:00.080 --> 04:06.720
So how do we go about building community at Midnight Runners? I think the first thing

04:06.720 --> 04:12.680
that a lot of communities need to think about is what is your wow factor? For Midnight Runners,

04:12.680 --> 04:17.000
it's this fitness plus social. I remember the first time I went to a Midnight Runners

04:17.000 --> 04:24.080
run. I was a little bit lost in Berlin as a lot of people in Berlin are. I was struggling

04:24.080 --> 04:28.800
about what to do next. I was thinking about moving back to Berlin, sorry, moving back

04:28.800 --> 04:35.440
to the U.S. And I went to this Wednesday run and I was like, this is it. This is so amazing

04:35.480 --> 04:40.080
that the next week I changed my flight so I could come back early just to go again.

04:40.080 --> 04:44.080
So when somebody comes into your community, what is that wow factor that they're going

04:44.080 --> 04:51.520
to say, this is so amazing, I want to come back? And as we're saying, community is all

04:51.520 --> 04:55.840
about the people. And so in Midnight Runners, we have the captains, which we think of as

04:55.840 --> 05:01.600
the pillars of the community. This wow factor starts with the captains because that's the

05:01.600 --> 05:05.560
initial reason that people are going to come back to Midnight Runners, that first experience,

05:05.560 --> 05:09.840
that first interaction. Because at the end of the day, it's about the people, not the

05:09.840 --> 05:15.160
workout. And in any community, it's always about the X. It's about the people, not whatever

05:15.160 --> 05:21.920
else you're doing. And so how do we, its captains, kind of create this experience? We welcome

05:21.920 --> 05:27.680
people, we meet new members, we introduce people to each other, making sure that we join those

05:27.680 --> 05:32.320
different nodes in the network together. During the run, we tell people how it works,

05:32.320 --> 05:37.320
they understand what to do. We engage in the experience that we're part of the participants

05:37.320 --> 05:42.360
too. And we really do create that MR wow so that people are like, this is something new,

05:42.360 --> 05:45.960
this is something different, this is something I need in my life. And then afterwards, we

05:45.960 --> 05:53.240
encourage people to join us socially afterwards and try to remember people every single week.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.560
And there's lots of different types of captains and Midnight Runners. There's the social butterfly

05:56.600 --> 06:00.480
who likes to talk to everyone. There's the caribbean who's trying to be representative

06:00.480 --> 06:05.280
and taking care of our community. There's the party animal who brings that energy, excitement,

06:05.280 --> 06:10.320
that engagement to the community. There's the creative magician who's sparking joy and

06:10.320 --> 06:15.960
making magical moments that people want to come back for. And after the people, how else

06:15.960 --> 06:19.600
do we do it? Well, we do these things called party runs. And these are really creating

06:19.600 --> 06:26.240
memorable moments for people in our community. And that's our boot camp run that ends up

06:26.280 --> 06:30.800
with a party afterwards. And it's themed to increase the sense of community, people like,

06:30.800 --> 06:37.120
I'm part of something. And kind of taking all together what Midnight Runners does is it

06:37.120 --> 06:43.200
gives people a purpose, a fitness plus friends. And that's why people come back every single

06:43.200 --> 06:50.000
week to 17 cities around the globe. So that's kind of the step out of open source. Let's

06:50.080 --> 06:55.080
step back in. How does all of what I've said so far translate into the open source world?

06:55.080 --> 07:00.320
Well, the other thing you should know about me is I work for iSovalent. They're the creators

07:00.320 --> 07:05.120
of Cillium and EBPF. And I'm going to be talking about my experience in both of those communities,

07:05.120 --> 07:09.880
building and growing each of them. And if you're not familiar with us, our kind of ethos is

07:09.880 --> 07:15.000
that EBPF is the future of infrastructure. And it's how things are going to be built for

07:15.000 --> 07:19.440
the cloud native world and beyond. And if you're not familiar with the Cillium project,

07:19.480 --> 07:24.960
it's actually one of the fastest moving projects in the Linux Foundation ecosystem. You can

07:24.960 --> 07:31.400
see it on the graph here behind Linux and Kubernetes. And if you also aren't familiar

07:31.400 --> 07:35.960
with Cillium, it's really become the cloud native networking standard. There's now certifications

07:35.960 --> 07:42.960
around it. Cillium is a CNCF graduated project. People are hiring others with Cillium experience.

07:43.960 --> 07:49.960
And my company actually just got recently acquired by Cisco. And so that's where Cillium comes from.

07:49.960 --> 07:56.960
And what we've created. But how do we actually get there? And how do we create the open source

07:56.960 --> 08:03.960
community around the project? The first thing I'm talking about is the wow effect. What is the

08:03.960 --> 08:10.960
wow effect for us? And for us, that's EBPF. Now, I think I don't believe in Tonex software

08:10.960 --> 08:16.960
engineers. And maybe you don't either. But EBPF really is a Tonex software. It can help you do

08:16.960 --> 08:22.960
things like networking, observability, security, tracing, Tonex better than previous generations of

08:22.960 --> 08:27.960
technologies. These examples, graphs are from different blog posts that people have created in

08:27.960 --> 08:32.960
the community. And when people come in, they say, wow, EBPF really is a different way of building,

08:32.960 --> 08:38.960
creating, running, maintaining software. And that's the wow effect people come for. And now

08:38.960 --> 08:42.960
somebody's interested. They're like, I want to know more about EBPF. I want to know more about

08:42.960 --> 08:47.960
Cillium. So they're coming into your community. What do you do? The first thing you do is say hello.

08:47.960 --> 08:52.960
A simple way to do this is if you have a Slack channel, you know, set up a greet bot. You can say,

08:52.960 --> 08:58.960
hey, welcome, X. We're happy to have you in our community here. This is quite simple to set up and

08:58.960 --> 09:05.960
is an automated way to welcome people into your community. Next thing is document resources to get

09:05.960 --> 09:12.960
people started. You say, these are the jumping off points. Somebody wants to have a path, a couple

09:12.960 --> 09:17.960
stepping stones. They know what the next steps. For midnight runners, I'm going to come back next

09:17.960 --> 09:22.960
Wednesday and do this again. If you're starting in the Cillium ecosystem, it's check out the website,

09:22.960 --> 09:28.960
check out the docs. These are good places to learn about the community and get started. Then I

09:28.960 --> 09:32.960
think this is also nice, give no one point of contact. I actually put my contact info and I say, hey,

09:32.960 --> 09:37.960
if you have any questions, message me on Slack. People feel like there's someone that they can talk to

09:37.960 --> 09:44.960
and they're not alone in this community. Bringing them into the network. The next thing, if you saw

09:44.960 --> 09:50.960
Paris's talk, is give them someone to look up to. We say there's contributors and there's

09:50.960 --> 09:55.960
committers and tainters of the project. Let them know that there's a ladder. There's a way for them to

09:55.960 --> 10:01.960
get involved. It's great for them to know that. Also give them somewhere to look up to. Give them

10:01.960 --> 10:05.960
different roles that they can grow into and grow towards. I think there's been a lot of talk in this room

10:05.960 --> 10:11.960
so far today about giving people job titles, giving people something they can bring back to their work,

10:11.960 --> 10:15.960
something they can bring back to themselves, being say, hey, I'm a part of this. This is what I'm doing for

10:15.960 --> 10:22.960
this community. In Cillium, we have a couple different roles laid out in our governance stocks. When

10:22.960 --> 10:27.960
somebody's into your community and wants to become a part of it, make sure you engage with them. People

10:27.960 --> 10:32.960
want to have that one-to-one connection. This friendship, if you want to do marketing, that's great. It's

10:32.960 --> 10:37.960
one-to-many. If you want to do community, that's great. It's one-to-one. So engage with people one-on-one.

10:37.960 --> 10:43.960
Say, hey, thank you. I really appreciate the work you're doing and that you're part of this with us. Beyond

10:43.960 --> 10:48.960
that one-to-one interaction, you should also recognize the work that people are doing. What I do every

10:48.960 --> 10:53.960
week is I go around the community and see what people have done and do in newsletter. Being like, hey, look at the

10:53.960 --> 11:00.960
great content that people have been creating and call them out by name. Once you kind of do that, you start to

11:00.960 --> 11:05.960
realize that we really have not just our own community. It's what I was saying before. There's all of these

11:05.960 --> 11:11.960
overlapping communities. If you're in the CNC, if you go system, you'll recognize the landscape. Some people would

11:11.960 --> 11:19.960
say overcrowded or a hellscape. But I think what is really great about this is that it shows that there's so

11:19.960 --> 11:25.960
many overlapping communities that we can take advantage of, partner with, and learn and grow from each other.

11:25.960 --> 11:32.960
People aren't a part of a single community and you can bring people into yours. Another way that we do that is

11:32.960 --> 11:39.960
we're having a still-in-meaning EBPF day at KubeCon. Going off back in the strength of the Kubernetes ecosystem to help

11:39.960 --> 11:44.960
grow our own community. In fact, if you think about it, that's exactly what we're doing here at FOSSTEM. All the

11:44.960 --> 11:50.960
different dev rooms, right? Those are all overlapping communities. And probably each person here goes into a different

11:50.960 --> 11:55.960
set of them and goes to a different set of talks. And I think that's great because you're creating the experience

11:55.960 --> 12:02.960
exactly that you want. And we're all building our communities together. The next thing is to spark joy in the

12:02.960 --> 12:09.960
community. Do something that's unique, that's something memorable. So one of our community members created a

12:09.960 --> 12:15.960
Cilium cake. Swag is another common way in open source to do that. We also created trading cards about two of our

12:15.960 --> 12:21.960
maintainers as like a fun thing to do. And beyond these little things, also create really memorable moments for your

12:21.960 --> 12:28.960
community. So for example, we created an EBPF documentary. We created the illustrated children's guide to EBPF. And I

12:28.960 --> 12:34.960
have some copies here if you want to see what that looks like afterwards. And we also created a Lego set for Cilium.

12:34.960 --> 12:41.960
So people would be like, hey, remember when we had the documentary, we had the children's book, here's my Lego. That's what

12:41.960 --> 12:47.960
people are going to look back at, these memorable moments, and you want to give that to them. Because what all of this

12:47.960 --> 12:56.960
does is it gives people an identity that allows them to say, hey, I'm a part of this with these other people. Because at

12:56.960 --> 13:02.960
the end of the day, what people really want to have is something that gives them connections, something that gives them a

13:02.960 --> 13:11.960
purpose. And these friendships are really the building blocks that keep our communities running. Thank you for coming to my talk.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.960
Thank you.

13:42.960 --> 13:52.960
Hey, thank you for your talk. I really liked the tips for getting the people engaged in community. I have one question

13:52.960 --> 14:01.960
regarding welcoming newcomers, because you showed us your grid bot in your Slack, which was kind of like a long block of text

14:02.960 --> 14:11.960
links. I'd like to know if you measure some kind of click through rate into that. And also then you followed with one to one

14:11.960 --> 14:20.960
interactions. But all of those on your slides were connected to some contributions. So I would like to know if there is

14:20.960 --> 14:29.960
something in between, you know, between the grid bot, and then the one to one interactions. If we have some, you know, maybe

14:29.960 --> 14:31.960
Buddy East or something like that. Thank you.

14:31.960 --> 14:40.960
Okay, yeah. So do we have something between the grid bot and getting people further? We don't currently. I think that's

14:40.960 --> 14:47.960
something I'd like to work on. You know, kind of like step one and then how do we get to step two. And I think people kind of

14:47.960 --> 14:52.960
have to find their own way in the community right now. And then once they get to step three, they wrote a blog post,

14:52.960 --> 14:59.960
you know, then I start to get to know them more. I think this is also like a really difficult thing in open source too,

14:59.960 --> 15:06.960
because it's also a lot of people, you know, do like a drive by contribution. And how do you know, and you never know which ones

15:06.960 --> 15:12.960
are going to stay around and which ones aren't. And like, unfortunately, you can't invest everything into every single contributor.

15:12.960 --> 15:20.960
And so this may be extremely controversial, but like maybe that's like a good weeding process is like if they can find

15:20.960 --> 15:27.960
themselves to step three, if you don't always give them step two, I don't know, like, it's always great to have more contributors.

15:27.960 --> 15:33.960
But yeah, so that's my controversial opinion for today. Say what you will.

15:33.960 --> 15:45.960
So I have a question. I find myself as much of an introvert person. So I don't like fitness meetings and big parties.

15:45.960 --> 15:54.960
So if you have any advice for people like that to build communities of like mental people, even open to other people.

15:54.960 --> 16:01.960
Yeah, I would say it's all the same advice. If you actually look at the structure of my deck afterwards, you say you can see the same structure

16:01.960 --> 16:06.960
in Midnight Runners. This applies to the same structure in the open source community. I was just doing the Midnight Runners example,

16:06.960 --> 16:12.960
because that's the one I'm most familiar with. And I really do think like when you're trying to create a community that wow effect is like,

16:12.960 --> 16:20.960
okay, what is this community trying to bring people around? You know, that may be EDPF, it may be running, it may be like we really like playing pool,

16:20.960 --> 16:28.960
we really like, I don't know, going to Quiz Night, right? And like give people a reason like why people want a purpose in their life and see if you can give that to them.

16:28.960 --> 16:34.960
Right, that's why the community initially forms. And you kind of create those next things to build the community around that.

16:34.960 --> 16:38.960
You need to kind of have that core purpose that people are going to come to. And I think that's the most important thing.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.960
And it can be about anything. It doesn't have to be about fitness.

16:43.960 --> 16:51.960
Hi. Hi, Biff. Sorry, didn't you put it to sound that way? I was going to ask you a funny question of why don't we go out for lunch more,

16:51.960 --> 17:02.960
but I actually do have a legitimate question for you about your talk. So one of the things that you said that Isovalent and Cilium do to sort of help create that wow factor is like,

17:03.960 --> 17:16.960
like merch because then it's a sort of physical reminder and a memory that people create. By the way, everyone, Cilium has great merch and EDPF has fantastic merch and you should absolutely find them after.

17:16.960 --> 17:25.960
So my question for you is in our trying economic times of tightening budgets on everything, how do you justify the cost internally?

17:26.960 --> 17:47.960
You get acquired? No, sorry, that's not the right answer. I think there's also like lots of ways to do like stuff that isn't like physical merch and doesn't have to be like doesn't have to cost money.

17:47.960 --> 18:00.960
Like actually, like one of my favorite things is, sorry, is that a lot of people actually like is like the EB Dex. And so we have this repo of all these different bees.

18:00.960 --> 18:10.960
You know, we wrote back stories about each of them. Like this is something that people really like and it didn't cost the cost of a GitHub repo, which is free.

18:10.960 --> 18:21.960
And I know a lot of people like to use these on slides. I think probably the favorite one is or my personal favorite one is Excel BPF here.

18:21.960 --> 18:30.960
There's a great April Fool's article that we wrote last year. I mean, this is another memorable moment, right? Like we wrote like now launching Excel BPF, right?

18:30.960 --> 18:37.960
And it didn't cost any money to write the blog post. I mean, a bit of time, but like that's not something you have to put in a budget line by line item somewhere.

18:37.960 --> 18:42.960
And so I think there's lots of ways to do it without like creating physical stuff too.

18:42.960 --> 18:48.960
We've got time for one more question.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.960
I'm doing my midnight runners.

18:52.960 --> 18:56.960
Every Wednesday at 7 30.

18:56.960 --> 19:06.960
Thank you for the talk. So you mentioned about the wow factor about creating that wow factor. But say now you already have a wow factor.

19:06.960 --> 19:16.960
How do you like market yourself that okay, we are out there. How do you make people aware of your community and they can come and join your community?

19:16.960 --> 19:23.960
Is there any like, you know, some tricks or some some things that we can do to grow the community?

19:24.960 --> 19:30.960
I would say like if you want to form a community and you've decided like here's our wow factor, here's our purpose, whatever.

19:30.960 --> 19:38.960
Know that there's, you know, a million other communities out there. And I think probably the most important thing when you're starting it is like, don't think about your.
