WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.480
I'd like to start the talk by figuring out who some of you are, because I don't always

00:10.480 --> 00:12.480
know what the makeup of the people in the room are.

00:12.480 --> 00:16.400
So we're just going to go one by one and everyone's going to introduce themselves.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.760
So can you stick your hands in the air?

00:17.760 --> 00:21.480
Do you identify primarily as a dev rel person?

00:21.480 --> 00:23.480
Okay.

00:23.480 --> 00:27.080
An engineer?

00:27.080 --> 00:29.080
And another assorted business person?

00:29.080 --> 00:32.440
Oh wow, lots of business in the house.

00:32.440 --> 00:33.440
That's good.

00:33.440 --> 00:37.520
And anyone else want to just randomly shout out a thing that you consider yourself that

00:37.520 --> 00:41.080
I've not put in one of the buckets already?

00:41.080 --> 00:42.080
Infrastructure.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.080
Great.

00:43.080 --> 00:47.400
Thank you for infrastructuring us all.

00:47.400 --> 00:52.280
Yeah so I'm trying to make this talk like a wee bit of a kind of whistle stop tour of

00:52.280 --> 00:59.280
just some stuff that I feel like I've found useful over the years with my forays into open

00:59.280 --> 01:05.040
source land and I'm going to try and do a little bit of hand raising on occasion to see

01:05.040 --> 01:08.040
what you're thinking and if you ever just want to stick up your hand just for no apparent

01:08.040 --> 01:09.640
reason then do that as well.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.680
I've also got, well done.

01:12.680 --> 01:13.680
Someone's listening.

01:13.680 --> 01:14.680
Great.

01:14.680 --> 01:15.680
One person at least.

01:15.680 --> 01:19.600
So at the bottom of the slides as well I have like a little link shortener situation going

01:19.600 --> 01:20.600
on.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.840
But I try to like link to as much stuff as possible.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.600
If anything I say is interesting and you actually want to read more about that but if you don't

01:27.600 --> 01:28.600
please don't.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.600
Save this bandwidth for everyone.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.160
So, right me.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.280
I'm Mike McQuade.

01:34.280 --> 01:38.960
I still kind of identify as an engineer technically I guess I'm like a co-founder of a business

01:38.960 --> 01:39.960
situation right now.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.560
I'll tell you more about that later.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.920
I'm based in Edinburgh in Scotland.

01:43.920 --> 01:48.480
My open source main kind of thing for the last while has been home group.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.240
I've been maintaining that.

01:50.240 --> 01:50.880
Thank you.

01:50.880 --> 01:56.200
I've been maintaining that since 2009 and I'm now the like project leader which means I

01:56.200 --> 01:57.680
stand for election every year.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.160
No one else has ever run.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.600
Please someone in this room run.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.320
It's certainly free.

02:04.320 --> 02:08.120
So we've worked with maintenance and contributors all over the world over this kind of 15 year

02:08.120 --> 02:12.920
period mostly over text sometimes occasional video calls and occasionally in person.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.080
We've started meeting at Fosdown in the last few years as well as a group which is quite

02:16.080 --> 02:17.160
nice.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.880
I was also principal engineer at GitHub for 10 years.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.840
Well, I wasn't principal engineer for all that time but hey resume padding is okay.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.640
I worked for my home in Edinburgh mostly working for teams on the west coast of the

02:27.640 --> 02:33.080
US which taught me lots about that you don't tend to learn in the UK such as talking about

02:33.080 --> 02:36.360
your feelings and avoiding conflict.

02:36.360 --> 02:41.320
I'm now the CTO of a startup called Workbrew which as you might guess from the slightly

02:41.320 --> 02:44.360
convoluted name is somewhat adjacent to Homebrew.

02:44.360 --> 02:49.480
We're trying to do stuff around like big companies who want things from Homebrew that

02:49.480 --> 02:51.080
Homebrew volunteers don't want to do.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.960
We're going to try and commercialize some stuff around that.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.080
I'll talk more about that a little bit later.

02:55.080 --> 02:59.400
With two ex-git hub people who are on the east coast of the US.

02:59.400 --> 03:02.760
So my talk is going to be based on three B's.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.480
The first B I'm going to talk about is boundaries.

03:05.480 --> 03:09.400
So is anyone able to spot what this lovely bit of text is from?

03:09.400 --> 03:13.960
Anyone want to raise their hand and shout out if you're that much of a licensed geek?

03:13.960 --> 03:15.760
No shame here.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.760
So good.

03:16.760 --> 03:17.760
This is the...

03:17.760 --> 03:18.760
Yes, MIT license.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.960
Congratulations, you win nothing.

03:21.960 --> 03:29.000
I'm not a lawyer but my summary of what this part of the license at least says is and don't

03:29.000 --> 03:31.960
worry about reading all my license summary.

03:31.960 --> 03:35.680
Essentially the software you get is the software you get.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.960
If it's buggy, that's your problem.

03:37.960 --> 03:38.960
Tough luck.

03:38.960 --> 03:45.400
Maintainers, don't promise you that the software has ever, does or will ever work for any user

03:45.400 --> 03:49.880
or use case, even the ones that we say that they do.

03:49.880 --> 03:53.400
Maintainers are never responsible for any problems that anyone experiences even if they

03:53.400 --> 03:57.760
cause them deliberately by themselves because they think it will be funny.

03:57.760 --> 04:02.000
And if you disagree with any of this, you're not allowed to use the software.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.240
So I wrote a little post about this a while ago called Open Source Maintainers or You

04:05.240 --> 04:11.440
Nothing, which a lot of people who are maintainers or Open Source adjacent really like the title

04:11.440 --> 04:13.960
and everyone else hated the title.

04:13.960 --> 04:17.960
And you can see some good discussion of that and I'm not actually even joking here.

04:17.960 --> 04:24.480
If you Google for Mike McQuade asshole, there's a variety of people who think that this is

04:24.480 --> 04:27.640
not the correct way to approach Open Source.

04:27.640 --> 04:32.360
But to me, like this is, I mentioned boundaries before, like there's a lot of talk about kind

04:32.360 --> 04:34.800
of burnout, I'll kind of mention that later.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.960
But like a lot of people ask me like how have you been able to do this for 15 years without

04:38.960 --> 04:42.840
going any more mad than I already am?

04:42.840 --> 04:44.760
And for me, it's boundaries, right?

04:44.760 --> 04:47.280
Like I don't do things I don't want to do.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.440
And I think it's a really important thing for anyone in Open Source to internalize that

04:51.440 --> 04:56.520
unless you're getting paid to do it and then even then that doesn't necessarily always apply.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.480
If someone is rude, if someone is mean, you don't have to do what they say.

04:59.480 --> 05:04.240
I will close issues that are legitimate problems because the person who has opened them is

05:04.240 --> 05:06.560
just being nasty.

05:06.560 --> 05:11.200
And people don't like this, but that's how me and other people in Humberoo have actually

05:11.200 --> 05:13.600
stayed involved for a decent amount of time.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.960
Does anyone know who this lovely lady is?

05:15.960 --> 05:16.960
BrenÃ© Brown?

05:16.960 --> 05:19.200
Yes, some enthusiasm in the room.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.200
Good, good.

05:20.200 --> 05:24.120
If anyone who hasn't discovered her, she's social worker, researcher, author, podcaster,

05:24.120 --> 05:27.880
talks a lot about like just generally how to be a better human.

05:27.880 --> 05:34.400
And one of her courses she does, she talks about this kind of braving acronym for like

05:34.400 --> 05:36.520
the seven elements of trust.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.480
So the ones that jumped out to me were when I kind of, we're listening to this and kind

05:40.480 --> 05:44.640
of thinking about how this might apply to my job and Open Source and stuff like that,

05:44.640 --> 05:47.800
or like boundaries, reliability and integrity.

05:47.800 --> 05:53.560
Because if you want to trust people, you cannot be someone who is untrustworthy.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.360
And if you want to be trusted, you need to be trusted by others as well.

05:57.360 --> 06:04.080
So for me, the way I kind of think about this, because I'm primarily an engineer, is by turning

06:04.080 --> 06:06.200
all human problems into computer problems.

06:06.200 --> 06:11.960
So I think about like instead of how I might deal with computers and how I might deal with

06:11.960 --> 06:14.520
humans being separate, like let's try and conflate the two a little bit.

06:14.520 --> 06:19.800
So bad APIs are APIs with inconsistent and unpredictable behavior.

06:19.800 --> 06:24.120
So if you go and repeatedly ask for the same stuff and you get radically different results

06:24.120 --> 06:27.240
back, that generally sucks.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.920
If you are documented that you do one thing and you do something completely different,

06:30.920 --> 06:31.920
that generally sucks.

06:31.920 --> 06:37.040
And an API that every time you call it, it will try and do some overly complex query

06:37.040 --> 06:39.680
and then time out, generally sucks as well.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.240
And a lot of this applies in my experience to human relationships as well.

06:43.240 --> 06:48.360
So humans who are more consistent and predictable in their responses are more pleasant to deal

06:48.360 --> 06:49.360
with.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.880
If you are someone who at work, when your co-workers ask you to do something, if it's your big,

06:53.880 --> 06:57.240
big, big boss, you say it will be done in a day and if it's the person in your team

06:57.240 --> 07:01.880
you don't really like, you say it will take a month, that's not a great API.

07:01.880 --> 07:06.280
If you say to your co-workers or people on your open source project that on holiday I

07:06.280 --> 07:10.440
am not to be disturbed for the next week and then you are on Slack or email every five

07:10.440 --> 07:13.680
minutes answering questions because you feel like you're too important to actually go on

07:13.680 --> 07:18.840
holiday and let other people do their job, that's not a great API.

07:18.840 --> 07:24.960
So to me, your boundaries are what your API are and that helps you figure out how you

07:24.960 --> 07:28.160
should be treating others and how others should be treating you and that consistency makes

07:28.160 --> 07:31.600
it easier for people to understand you and generally probably makes it easier for your

07:31.600 --> 07:32.600
life as well.

07:32.600 --> 07:37.760
A nice experience I had in the past at GitHub is I had a manager who rather worryingly for

07:37.760 --> 07:41.600
me at least start my performance review with, Mike is very strict with his boundaries and

07:41.600 --> 07:45.080
I thought oh no, I'm going to get criticized for the fact that like I insist on having

07:45.080 --> 07:47.640
dinner with my kids like most nights of the week.

07:47.640 --> 07:51.040
But he went on to say that this made it easier to work with me because he knew when he could

07:51.040 --> 07:54.840
ask me to do things and when he couldn't and it modeled that behavior for new parents in

07:54.840 --> 07:57.040
the team that it's okay to do these things.

07:57.040 --> 08:00.960
So I would encourage you as well, those of you who might feel that it's overly indulgent

08:00.960 --> 08:05.640
to exercise your boundaries around these things, that you're not just doing it for yourself

08:05.640 --> 08:09.200
but you're also doing it to help model those around you particularly if you're in a position

08:09.200 --> 08:13.520
of more experience or authority or power or whatever, you can enable it for other people

08:13.560 --> 08:15.720
to do those things.

08:15.720 --> 08:22.080
So I think like I don't want to get too deep on this but I think one of the key things

08:22.080 --> 08:27.800
with setting boundaries is how comfortable you are about saying no to things.

08:27.800 --> 08:32.520
Like I talk about front loading disappointment quite often which is a lot of the times if

08:32.520 --> 08:37.040
you're someone who is very willing and able to say no to things sooner or later, you're

08:37.040 --> 08:41.120
making that person maybe disappointed straight away instead of being disappointed in three

08:41.160 --> 08:44.920
months when you're not able to deliver or do whatever they thought you were going to do.

08:44.920 --> 08:49.120
So if you want to read more about that, there's a little link down there.

08:49.120 --> 08:53.440
And more specifically to open source, there was a big movement a few years ago about trying

08:53.440 --> 08:57.280
to make things really, really easy for first time contributors to projects and I think

08:57.280 --> 09:01.960
that's really valuable from the perspective of like documentation and teaching resources

09:01.960 --> 09:04.720
and smoothing like onboarding floors and stuff like that.

09:04.720 --> 09:09.840
What I don't think scales very well is like hand holding first time contributors through

09:09.880 --> 09:14.640
how they get involved with a project because if someone doesn't know how to use Git for

09:14.640 --> 09:18.360
example and you're having to teach them every command and your project has like tens of

09:18.360 --> 09:20.640
thousands of contributors, you're probably not going to be able to do that for tens of

09:20.640 --> 09:21.640
thousands of people.

09:21.640 --> 09:25.040
But when people kind of express interest and they kind of come back again and again, then

09:25.040 --> 09:30.680
that's often like a nice time to maybe get a little bit more involved and help them out.

09:30.680 --> 09:34.560
So the next B is burnout.

09:34.560 --> 09:39.680
So as I mentioned before, I'm someone who's been lucky enough to not really have ever

09:39.680 --> 09:41.520
felt burnout with open source.

09:41.520 --> 09:46.880
I've definitely had periods of temporary large amounts of irritation.

09:46.880 --> 09:50.880
I'm sure many people who work with me have as well, but I've managed to sort of stay

09:50.880 --> 09:55.520
involved and for me what that's looked like is over the years kind of prioritizing my

09:55.520 --> 09:59.600
own kind of mental and physical health and like as I mentioned before boundaries and stuff

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
like that.

10:01.080 --> 10:05.960
Something I found very helpful personally is seeing a therapist like I started seeing

10:05.960 --> 10:11.240
one during COVID and it has really helped me to figure out kind of how to manage this

10:11.240 --> 10:12.240
stuff.

10:12.240 --> 10:16.960
We probably have a lot more sessions than my therapist expected talking about like a particular

10:16.960 --> 10:22.240
pull request on Homebrew and someone who is trying really hard to be nice and helpful

10:22.240 --> 10:26.320
but are not doing that and actually being deeply unpleasant to a lot of people and how

10:26.320 --> 10:28.600
I handle this and all these types of things.

10:28.600 --> 10:32.120
So if it's something that you've considered or not tried, I would encourage you to.

10:32.120 --> 10:35.960
I've written a little kind of step-by-step guide if you're like how do I even go about

10:35.960 --> 10:37.800
finding one that might be useful to you.

10:37.800 --> 10:42.600
Another thing I found really helpful with kind of avoiding preventing burnout in myself

10:42.600 --> 10:49.160
and others is kind of having like decent relationships like inside, outside work.

10:49.160 --> 10:54.120
But in work or in open source land, I try and have something that looks a little bit like

10:54.120 --> 10:55.120
this.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.200
I guess I call it like the mentorship diamond.

10:57.200 --> 11:01.640
So it's this idea that I used to be religious, I kind of stole it from religion originally,

11:01.640 --> 11:05.120
like I don't know what it was, something like, I can't remember any of the words anymore,

11:05.120 --> 11:07.640
but anyway, I stole this idea, it's not mine.

11:07.640 --> 11:13.240
But this idea that essentially for anyone, it's a good thing to have people above you,

11:13.240 --> 11:16.040
people beside you and people kind of below you who you can speak to.

11:16.040 --> 11:21.880
So if you're in an employment situation, like your mentor might look like someone who has

11:21.880 --> 11:26.160
the job that you would like to have in five or ten years and your peers would be someone

11:26.200 --> 11:29.440
who has like maybe a similar job or someone in your team or whatever and your mentee could

11:29.440 --> 11:30.440
be anyone.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.880
The nice thing about this is I do say like unless you're literally the most experienced

11:33.880 --> 11:39.520
person at literally everything in our entire industry, then you can always find a mentor

11:39.520 --> 11:45.680
and similarly like unless you were literally, unless you were born during this talk, you

11:45.680 --> 11:50.120
can probably find a mentee who you have more experience than them and you can help them

11:50.120 --> 11:51.120
with some stuff.

11:51.720 --> 11:55.720
And I just, I also think the other thing, those of us who have kind of jobs in more

11:55.720 --> 11:59.920
kind of formal corporate environments, often like an org chart looks quite a lot like

11:59.920 --> 12:01.120
it's structured like this.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.160
So you might think, oh, this comes from me automatically, but I think this is something

12:04.160 --> 12:06.960
that's really worth like putting a little bit of effort into to actually like find these

12:06.960 --> 12:12.200
people yourself and not essentially rely on like, wow, my manager can be my mentor and

12:12.200 --> 12:16.000
my mentees can be the people who report to me or whatever because it just makes it a

12:16.000 --> 12:19.880
little bit more fluid and you can help find things a little bit more easily that way.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.640
Another thing I guess I've thought about with kind of avoiding burnout with open sources,

12:25.640 --> 12:27.920
trying to find people who will replace me.

12:28.440 --> 12:30.920
Who's, I don't know if any people have done any sales stuff.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.720
Have people are familiar with sales funnels?

12:33.240 --> 12:34.200
Yeah, like a few people.

12:34.520 --> 12:38.760
So I guess the idea is basically that you generally get lots of people at the top of

12:38.760 --> 12:44.200
the sales funnel, like potential leads who have no interest in you or what you're doing,

12:44.200 --> 12:45.320
but you haven't figured that out yet.

12:45.920 --> 12:50.440
So you send them all about a million emails and then some tiny proportion of them reply

12:50.480 --> 12:52.240
with something other than go away, leave me alone.

12:52.680 --> 12:56.160
And there was Michael Crossbacks because they've shown like some sort of interest and then

12:56.160 --> 12:59.760
some time proportion of them may actually end up paying you money one day and there's

12:59.760 --> 13:00.400
people who are sales.

13:00.760 --> 13:05.000
So in open source, I think we have somewhat a similar thing that I call like the contributor

13:05.000 --> 13:10.040
funnel, which is like generally most projects will have lots more users than they have

13:10.040 --> 13:12.440
contributors and lots more contributors than they have maintainers.

13:13.040 --> 13:17.520
Last time I count the numbers on this for Humbrew, the numbers are roughly like we have

13:17.600 --> 13:23.920
roughly 30 million Humber users, we reckon from my analytics data, got like 12,000 contributors

13:24.000 --> 13:25.360
total in the last 15 years.

13:25.480 --> 13:29.760
And we've got about 30 current Humber maintainers and about 50 lifetime, which is

13:29.760 --> 13:32.400
apparently 0.0015%.

13:33.200 --> 13:37.480
So when you're being yourself up, your project that kind of is used by a few hundred or a

13:37.480 --> 13:41.840
thousand people doesn't have like most of those people wanting to help you contribute or

13:41.880 --> 13:44.480
maintain or whatever, like cut yourself a little bit more slack.

13:44.960 --> 13:49.120
But at the same time, do bear in mind that like, you know, if you could, the more you

13:49.120 --> 13:52.840
can grow this funnel and the more easy you can make it for a user to contribute or

13:52.840 --> 13:56.440
contribute to kind of come and join you as a maintainer, that may well end up taking

13:56.440 --> 13:57.520
some load off you as well.

14:00.040 --> 14:00.360
Right.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.720
So the last thing I'm going to talk about is business.

14:03.240 --> 14:07.560
And don't worry, as despite the emoji, like I'm not a very suit and tie

14:07.600 --> 14:12.480
businessy, businessy person, but I guess like it was a third B and money in open

14:12.520 --> 14:14.960
source feels like a kind of relevant thing for us to be kind of talking about

14:14.960 --> 14:15.400
nowadays.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.880
So homebrews kind of had an interesting like money journey, basically.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.680
So when I joined, it was very much like Humber didn't have any money.

14:24.720 --> 14:25.680
It didn't need any money.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.760
It was just a random project on GitHub.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.040
People submitted PRs.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.880
This is in the days before you've equal to see I when we start with Humber, it

14:32.880 --> 14:33.800
didn't have any C.I.

14:33.800 --> 14:34.120
at all.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.400
It was all just verified on someone's machine.

14:38.320 --> 14:42.120
And the first thing we kind of did when we sort of realized like, Hey, we maybe

14:42.120 --> 14:42.920
need some money here.

14:43.440 --> 14:46.840
We figured we kind of could benefit from having some max, which would like

14:46.840 --> 14:48.320
automatically kind of run some C.I.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.760
I'm poor request from GitHub.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.240
So because it was 2013, the way you went and asked for money on the internet

14:53.240 --> 14:56.760
was a Kickstarter raised the 14,859 pounds.

14:57.480 --> 15:01.600
And that was then used to kind of buy some hardware, which was like physically

15:01.960 --> 15:05.080
taken on a train by me and installed in a data center on by good stuff.

15:06.360 --> 15:10.040
2016, we joined the software free return C, which provides like fiscal

15:10.040 --> 15:10.960
hosting for us.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.200
Does anyone anyone familiar with what fiscal hosting means?

15:15.120 --> 15:15.280
Yeah.

15:15.280 --> 15:20.680
So essentially it's like providing a bank account and like legal services

15:20.680 --> 15:23.200
and someone who can let whole trademarks or anything like that for

15:23.240 --> 15:24.200
European source projects.

15:24.600 --> 15:28.960
So that made us, well, it made us a part of a 501 C three, like a US

15:28.960 --> 15:29.960
nonprofit essentially.

15:29.960 --> 15:34.400
So we could go and like receive tax deductible donations in the US and all

15:34.400 --> 15:36.000
that stuff and give us a bank account.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.920
So then after that, we kind of had somewhere to put our money.

15:38.920 --> 15:41.880
We had somewhere to receive new donations and somewhere like a process

15:41.880 --> 15:43.360
for like paying out stuff like that.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.800
2017, we start using a Patreon to kind of try and get some monthly

15:47.800 --> 15:49.160
donations and stuck that in our read me.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.160
2018, we started asking for donations on Twitter.

15:53.800 --> 15:58.400
But 2019 was the big kind of exciting time when we made humbrew itself.

15:58.640 --> 16:02.400
Like when you first installed it, or if you had had it already installed,

16:02.400 --> 16:05.680
you would see a one time nag message that says essentially homebrew is

16:05.680 --> 16:08.920
run entirely by volunteers, mostly in the spare time.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.240
Please consider donating and then 20,000, one meter collective.

16:12.720 --> 16:16.000
See if you can spot when we added the message to our.

16:17.280 --> 16:17.520
Yeah.

16:17.560 --> 16:23.040
So almost immediately, our kind of incoming money went up by a lot.

16:23.640 --> 16:27.040
So no one has really complained about the message.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.960
You get some people get kind of a little suspicious or paranoid about

16:30.960 --> 16:32.360
asking for money as an open source project.

16:32.360 --> 16:34.800
But I would strongly encourage you if you're an open source project and

16:34.800 --> 16:40.000
you need the money, then do consider like having a one time nag or whatever.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.320
And I also think I've found that people are a lot more responsive to that

16:44.520 --> 16:46.560
often than kind of like advertising and things like that.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.600
Another thing to think about with open source is like, again, I've heard a

16:51.600 --> 16:54.120
lot of people talking about open source economics in the last few years.

16:54.560 --> 16:59.600
So I kind of wrote a blog post about this and sort of spoke to my father in

16:59.600 --> 17:02.480
law, who's a professor of economics, who just because he's a very clever

17:02.480 --> 17:07.720
manager says it depends a lot about like, okay, help me understand like,

17:07.720 --> 17:08.480
what is economics?

17:08.480 --> 17:09.360
How does it define it?

17:09.400 --> 17:10.040
Blah, blah, blah.

17:10.400 --> 17:15.440
So like he sort of said, well, you know, we're mainly capitalist economies here.

17:15.440 --> 17:19.320
So it's the allocation of capital and how that throws through businesses and stuff

17:19.320 --> 17:19.680
like that.

17:20.960 --> 17:25.360
And then I kind of thought, well, whenever I see people talking about open

17:25.360 --> 17:27.440
source economics, they're all talking about money and like how

17:27.440 --> 17:29.520
open source projects get money and spend money and stuff like that.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.920
So is that what it's about?

17:33.000 --> 17:39.640
Well, like if you make everything about money and I guess, you know, no shade

17:39.760 --> 17:44.400
on our lovely American friends in the room, but I often find when I talk to

17:44.400 --> 17:46.680
kind of American folks about open source and European folks about open

17:46.680 --> 17:50.840
source, often I find like, sometimes on the American side, there can be more

17:50.840 --> 17:53.960
of a focus on like, we need to get money, money will solve all the problems.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.560
The lack of money is all the problems more than I do over here.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.840
But like the idea that kind of money fix all the problems, it's like,

18:01.840 --> 18:06.240
Humbrew is kind of an interesting phase right now because we have quite a lot

18:06.240 --> 18:07.040
of money in the bank.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.240
You can go in our open collective and see that we have, you know, six figures

18:10.240 --> 18:15.080
of funding, which is like both far too much money to spend on stickers and also

18:16.880 --> 18:20.960
unless you get really good stickers, like if anyone knows the best stickers,

18:20.960 --> 18:21.520
then let me know.

18:22.040 --> 18:27.040
But also like not enough to like sustainably actually pay like people

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
to work full time on Humbrew.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.200
So in our case, we have quite a lot of money and that doesn't fix all our

18:33.200 --> 18:33.600
problems.

18:34.520 --> 18:37.320
And that's when I guess like told to my father-in-law kind of helped where it's

18:37.320 --> 18:43.240
like, well, actually economic problems are generally like, we generally consider

18:43.240 --> 18:46.000
them to be like allocation of limited resources, which is normally money,

18:46.720 --> 18:48.400
particularly in like capitalist economies, et cetera.

18:48.400 --> 18:51.920
But arguably the open source economic problem is allocation of like limited

18:51.960 --> 18:53.520
maintainers or like people, right?

18:53.520 --> 18:57.280
If you want to have stuff done, there are relatively small number of people who

18:57.280 --> 19:00.880
can do those things and you don't necessarily have enough resources to get

19:00.880 --> 19:01.880
those people to do those things.

19:02.600 --> 19:07.640
And if you have more money, does that somehow automatically add more of that?

19:07.760 --> 19:12.800
Well, I guess not really because for some people they have a full time job and

19:12.800 --> 19:15.560
the amount of money they would need to have to quit their full time job and then

19:15.560 --> 19:19.120
do the open source thing full time is a lot more than your project can have or

19:19.120 --> 19:19.920
guarantee or whatever.

19:20.920 --> 19:22.440
So it's tricky.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.680
But then for me, I think like, again, it feels like a weird thing to kind of

19:26.680 --> 19:30.760
frame in terms of economics, but I think the best economic thing you can do for

19:30.760 --> 19:33.840
your project to kind of maintain the amount of maintainer time you have and

19:33.840 --> 19:36.240
increase it is to make it actually an enjoyable place.

19:36.560 --> 19:40.200
If open source is a place where people want to go, if we come to events like

19:40.200 --> 19:44.720
this, we see each other, we make friends, we make friends on our project, then we

19:44.720 --> 19:47.360
want to work more with those people, we want to help those people out and we're

19:47.360 --> 19:48.000
having a good time.

19:48.240 --> 19:50.760
If open source is like a horrible drudgery place where people on the

19:50.760 --> 19:55.080
internet just shout at you all day, which it also could be, then you're

19:55.080 --> 19:57.280
probably going to want to spend less of your time doing that.

19:57.800 --> 20:02.760
And if you're like me, then you will probably be shocked when on a Saturday

20:02.760 --> 20:05.960
night, you're spending like your time smashing out some code from the

20:05.960 --> 20:08.920
European source project, look completely miserable and your wife's like,

20:08.960 --> 20:11.080
why do you do this again?

20:11.120 --> 20:13.520
Like, are you sure you want to do this?

20:13.960 --> 20:18.320
So yeah, so try and make it an enjoyable space for other people.

20:20.440 --> 20:26.400
Again, final note, like I've seen kind of concerning stuff around AI where, I

20:26.400 --> 20:30.560
guess, including some of the existing talk where there's a worry right now that

20:30.560 --> 20:36.280
we're moving to a world where everything is kind of open source underneath the

20:36.280 --> 20:39.800
hood, but then everything is very proprietary in the front and we maybe

20:39.800 --> 20:42.200
have open source data models or whatever, but you don't have any of the

20:42.200 --> 20:45.160
training data and is this going to mean sort of the death of open source?

20:46.960 --> 20:49.880
But to me, the only thing I've seen that looks close to failing in the last few

20:49.880 --> 20:55.120
years is open source is like a business model where there's a bunch of projects

20:55.160 --> 21:00.920
who have, I'm not going to name any names, but you know who they are, who had

21:00.920 --> 21:05.880
this sort of approach, either they fell into this trap or this was forced upon

21:05.880 --> 21:08.120
them by their maintainers or investors or whatever.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.560
But I would argue, and this is the model I'm trying to take and we'll see

21:12.560 --> 21:16.160
whether it works or not, is that like this is a better model for open source

21:16.160 --> 21:21.200
business, which is instead of trying to have like the open source side and the

21:21.200 --> 21:25.600
financial side in direct competition with each other, you have something where

21:25.600 --> 21:29.360
the business side and the open source side kind of contribute nicely to the

21:29.360 --> 21:33.440
same kind of ecosystem. I remember I had a job and I will name them because they

21:33.440 --> 21:36.080
were a lovely bunch of people, a company called K-Dub a few years ago.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.960
It's my first job kind of working primarily on open source stuff.

21:40.640 --> 21:44.320
I was very excited that I was like, great, I work on K-D, now I work at this

21:44.320 --> 21:47.680
company who has lots of K-D maintainers and I can get paid to work on K-D stuff.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.200
But I found quite quickly that the problems that often open source

21:51.200 --> 21:54.640
consultancy companies are paid to work on are actually in fact not the most

21:54.640 --> 21:58.240
interesting problems, but the most boring problems because people who will do

21:58.240 --> 22:01.200
them for fun don't want to solve those problems, so you have to pay people to

22:01.200 --> 22:05.280
do them. And to me, like this is the, I mean, it's not a very inspiring pitch to

22:05.320 --> 22:09.920
kind of come and work with me, I guess, at the company. But I do think there's a

22:09.920 --> 22:13.280
class of problems where you can't expect volunteers to solve them and you do

22:13.280 --> 22:17.320
want big companies to be involved with them. The big companies, sorry, expect

22:17.320 --> 22:19.680
this stuff to be solved, but the volunteers don't want to do it and

22:19.680 --> 22:23.280
they're, that's where, to me, it feels like a good fit. And very interesting,

22:23.280 --> 22:25.920
what I'm doing with this stuff, then we've got a little website at

22:25.920 --> 22:30.840
workgroup.com and a demo and all this type of stuff. So, in short, quick summary,

22:31.600 --> 22:35.560
boundaries, remember open source maintainers and volunteers or you're

22:35.560 --> 22:39.520
nothing. Remember, you can say no to things and you don't need to mentor

22:39.520 --> 22:43.960
first-time contributors for burnout, considering a therapist if you don't

22:43.960 --> 22:46.760
have one already, or change you one if you hate your current one, which is

22:46.760 --> 22:51.640
also a thing, it seems, consider the kind of mentorship diamond of mentoring

22:51.640 --> 22:55.640
above, below, side by side and that if you can get more users and make

22:55.640 --> 22:59.160
it easier to become contributors, make it easier to become maintainers, then

22:59.280 --> 23:02.920
that might make your life easier. And I talked a bit about making

23:02.920 --> 23:07.520
hungry financial sustainable and how that's about often making maintainers

23:07.520 --> 23:11.560
happy and avoiding them burning out as much as it is about money and what I

23:11.560 --> 23:14.640
thought about open source business. So, feel free to answer any questions

23:14.640 --> 23:17.320
now, but if you don't want to ask in front of the room, then here are my

23:17.320 --> 23:19.880
contact eats and stuff like that. And thank you very much for having me.

23:19.880 --> 23:35.960
Thank you for the talk. Over here. I really like your analogy with the API

23:35.960 --> 23:41.280
in terms of humans and machines and I'm curious if you, like good APIs are

23:41.280 --> 23:45.160
well publicly documented, I guess, and so I wonder if you have taken that

23:45.160 --> 23:49.600
analogy to that point of like having sort of a document, I used to have a

23:49.680 --> 23:53.080
colleague who would have like a Google doc that would be like how to work

23:53.080 --> 23:59.440
with me. Yeah, I actually do. I was polishing it like hopefully my company

23:59.440 --> 24:02.800
have our first employee in the kind of coming month. So I've been taking my

24:02.800 --> 24:06.200
old one from GitHub and I'm repolishing it for the current day. Yeah, for

24:06.200 --> 24:10.320
anyone who hasn't done this before, it's a really nice resource in companies

24:10.320 --> 24:13.000
and I guess it could work in open source as well. It's the way I saw it

24:13.000 --> 24:16.800
framed as like a human user guide where it's like things you might not know

24:16.840 --> 24:21.320
about me, things that I really like, things that when my co-workers do this,

24:21.320 --> 24:23.840
it makes me happy, things when my co-workers do this, it makes me sad.

24:24.200 --> 24:29.440
Like those types of things. Yeah, so I agree with you. Like I think, yeah,

24:29.600 --> 24:33.560
trying to publicly document that or at least internally document that, but

24:33.560 --> 24:36.640
there's nothing mind one that I wouldn't probably want to put on the public

24:36.640 --> 24:40.720
internet just yet. But yeah, I mean, you've inspired me. I might even make

24:40.720 --> 24:44.920
a public version of this. So we can. A follow up question to that. So if you

24:44.960 --> 24:49.640
write such a document, how do you find the boundary between like kind of

24:49.640 --> 24:53.360
being honest and setting, actually setting the boundaries and not coming

24:53.360 --> 24:56.080
across as rude as in setting those boundaries?

24:57.000 --> 25:00.600
Well, so the best way I found to avoid coming across as rude when I worked

25:00.600 --> 25:06.280
with Californians is who had not worked with Scottish people before. It's just

25:06.280 --> 25:08.400
to say, oh, oh, Scottish people are like this.

25:09.120 --> 25:17.240
But yeah, I mean, as pretty much all of my friends and family and co-workers of

25:17.240 --> 25:21.240
all time would tell you, I am not the person to ask on how to avoid coming

25:21.240 --> 25:29.000
across as rude. But I guess I would say like, as a middle ground, I guess,

25:30.440 --> 25:34.640
maybe not quite rudeness, but something I've been dealing with like at work

25:34.680 --> 25:40.400
with like a small start up with kind of, you know, impassioned people is you

25:40.400 --> 25:44.520
quite often end up in situations where someone maybe needs to hear something

25:45.400 --> 25:48.600
and you know it's going to hurt their feelings. And to me, like the two

25:48.600 --> 25:52.600
failure states for that are either you don't tell them what they need to

25:52.600 --> 25:56.600
hear because you're worried it's going to hurt their feelings or you say, well,

25:56.600 --> 26:01.760
it's going to hurt their feelings anyway. So yellow like, and yeah, I guess my

26:01.880 --> 26:05.520
thing is, as long as you're willing to kind of try your hardest to be as nice

26:05.520 --> 26:09.880
as you can and hurt their feelings as little as you can and be willing to

26:09.880 --> 26:13.840
admit you're wrong and apologize and these types of things, then you can get

26:13.840 --> 26:19.160
away with being rude, I guess. Yeah, don't have the us that one.

26:20.560 --> 26:25.760
Thank you. Thank you. Over here. Thank you so much for your talk. I'm Canadian,

26:25.760 --> 26:30.000
so I fall somewhere between American and European philosophies. I think you

26:30.040 --> 26:33.560
alluded to this, but the biggest economic problem for open source projects is

26:33.560 --> 26:38.760
actually the free rider problem where so many people can use software that they

26:38.760 --> 26:43.000
don't end up contributing to or paying for. And I'm wondering if you have any

26:43.000 --> 26:47.200
examples of open source projects that have achieved kind of a hybrid model of

26:47.200 --> 26:51.680
being able to keep things open source and free for people who can't pay, but

26:51.680 --> 26:56.360
for those who can. And we know there are so many large companies that do have

26:56.400 --> 27:01.280
incredible ability to pay for stuff that don't. How do we incentivize them? Yeah,

27:01.280 --> 27:05.760
that's a great question. Thank you. So on the free rider problem, I have maybe a

27:05.760 --> 27:11.000
slightly contentious take, which is that I think if you completely eliminated the

27:11.000 --> 27:15.320
free rider problem, you kill open source because open sources, I mean, I guess

27:15.320 --> 27:18.760
we've seen this in the last few years with the kind of the varying licenses and

27:18.760 --> 27:24.880
I'm maybe a bit more of a purist in terms of, I think, if you say, well, Mike can

27:24.920 --> 27:28.480
use this because he doesn't have lots of money, but Amazon can't because they've

27:28.480 --> 27:33.480
got lots of money. You kind of kill what makes open source what it is. So for me,

27:33.480 --> 27:38.240
it's about kind of thinking about creative ways of solving that. So some of

27:38.240 --> 27:40.680
it, I think it's like you're going to have a certain amount of free riders and

27:40.680 --> 27:45.640
you're going to have. And also, I think what makes open source interesting is,

27:46.040 --> 27:50.560
you know, I include my own projects and work in this as well is that I think if

27:50.560 --> 27:55.160
we end up with a culture where everyone is expected to pay their way to kind of

27:55.400 --> 27:57.720
be involved with open source, I'm not saying that you're saying this, but I

27:57.720 --> 28:03.200
have seen some people who have, then we, why would a company almost like want to

28:03.200 --> 28:06.120
use open source so they can just build everything internally as they were doing

28:06.120 --> 28:12.560
20, 25 years ago? So I don't see like an easy solution to that. I wish I did. But

28:12.560 --> 28:16.640
I guess the solution, as I said, I'm trying to do right now is the idea of

28:17.080 --> 28:21.120
you maybe just don't provide support for free for the things that are massively

28:21.120 --> 28:25.280
six important to big companies. Like, I don't know how many of you have the

28:25.280 --> 28:28.880
misfortune of reading hacker news comments on occasion, but every so often

28:28.880 --> 28:32.400
there's like a manifesto there of like, it's very important that we as an

28:32.400 --> 28:35.560
industry start doing this thing. And I really like those because 50% of them

28:35.560 --> 28:38.080
convinced me to do the exact opposite of what the person is trying to convince

28:38.080 --> 28:42.000
me to do. And there was this website called SSO.tax that essentially talked

28:42.000 --> 28:46.600
about how look at all these companies who are outrageously gouging people who

28:46.600 --> 28:50.920
want to use like single sign on and stuff like that. And I saw that and I

28:50.920 --> 28:54.040
thought that's a really good idea because that's a way to essentially be like,

28:54.040 --> 28:58.120
well, if you're a big organization who has the requirement for this for some

28:58.120 --> 29:03.000
ISO certification or like whatever it may be, then you say, well, we're going to

29:03.000 --> 29:05.800
charge you a lot more. And if you're like an individual user, we're going to

29:05.800 --> 29:09.840
charge you a lot less or nothing. And I wonder if that could work with some

29:09.840 --> 29:13.880
open source models as well that if you have features in your project that you

29:13.960 --> 29:17.000
know are only going to be used by the biggest of the biggest corporations,

29:17.000 --> 29:21.120
then you say, well, that stuff you have to pay us for or it's under a license we

29:21.120 --> 29:24.400
know you don't want to use, but you can pay us to have it under a more liberal

29:24.400 --> 29:28.960
license or I don't know. Lots of ideas, no solutions. Thank you.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.120
We're at time. Thanks folks. Thanks Mike.
