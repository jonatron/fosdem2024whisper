00:00.000 --> 00:09.160
Welcome, my name is Anna and I've been with Next Cloud since 2020.

00:09.160 --> 00:13.840
Anna Focuss primarily in the backend development and I am responsible for the round-cube maintenance

00:13.840 --> 00:15.240
at the moment.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.320
I'm also at the security team with Next Cloud, so a bit about that later.

00:20.320 --> 00:24.520
So first things first, this is the question we have got most in all of the help forum,

00:24.520 --> 00:25.920
blog posts and everywhere.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.720
No we won't merge round-cube and Next Cloud Mail.

00:28.720 --> 00:32.280
Both products will stay independent as they have been and they will receive independent

00:32.280 --> 00:34.440
development and independent loving care.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.240
So don't worry about that one.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.840
Yeah, let's get into the development aspect of things.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.840
So we have hired a specific engineer for round-cube, so that's a person that will be responsible

00:44.840 --> 00:49.560
for the maintenance, for issues on GitHub, for contributions on GitHub.

00:49.560 --> 00:53.080
The thing is it's not gotten that much love the project itself.

00:53.080 --> 00:59.440
There's like 50 open PRs and like 300 issues at the moment which haven't been, I'm not

00:59.440 --> 01:04.640
saying not triage, but it's hard for the community contributors to look into everything, of course.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.520
I mean it's not their main job and we appreciate what they do, so that's what we want to take

01:08.520 --> 01:11.080
care of.

01:11.080 --> 01:15.200
What we also want to do is we want to do regular security and bug fix releases.

01:15.200 --> 01:19.360
This is really, really the main focus at the moment to get us up to date on security stuff,

01:19.360 --> 01:22.480
to get us updates, up to date on bug fix releases.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.480
There is one person who has been doing a lot of development for round-cube, that is Alexander.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.120
He has been doing most of the feature development for round-cube at the moment, but he is not

01:31.120 --> 01:34.120
working for round-cube, he's working for somebody else.

01:34.120 --> 01:39.360
So we want to help him get new features development, feature development done and do like feature

01:39.360 --> 01:41.920
releases and tandem with him.

01:41.920 --> 01:45.480
We really want to make sure that we're not edging out any contributors.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.760
We really, really, really appreciate what they're doing for the project.

01:48.760 --> 01:52.720
So please don't worry if you're a contributor or somebody who wants to contribute, we really,

01:52.720 --> 01:55.720
really would love for you to put more energy into this project.

01:55.720 --> 02:00.400
I know a lot of you love round-cube and have been using round-cube, so let us know what

02:00.400 --> 02:05.120
you think, let us know what features you want to see on GitHub and we promise we will take

02:05.120 --> 02:08.720
care of them and look into them and actually give you a response on GitHub as well and

02:08.720 --> 02:11.120
not just leave it there out in the open.

02:11.120 --> 02:15.960
Yeah, as I said, community-driven development is always appreciated.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.840
As with every open-source project, I'm sure you all have the same kind of thing there.

02:20.840 --> 02:25.200
Yeah, more care, more feature, more love for round-cube because it is an amazing product,

02:25.200 --> 02:31.320
it is really cool and I mean, it's been around forever, so let's keep it going.

02:31.320 --> 02:33.760
Another thing that's changed is how we handle security issues.

02:33.760 --> 02:38.760
Since I'm part of the security team with NextCloud, we already have an existing process for this,

02:38.760 --> 02:41.120
so we're using Hacker One.

02:41.120 --> 02:45.880
We haven't discussed yet if we're going to pay Poundty for this, but it is a possibility

02:45.880 --> 02:52.520
that we will actually pay you to pen-test round-cube and the advisories will be published

02:52.520 --> 02:56.440
on GitHub in the future because right now there is no established mechanism for this,

02:56.440 --> 03:02.840
so you don't really find security issues all in one place with CVs and everything.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.800
Yeah, that's pretty much everything from me for round-cube.

03:05.800 --> 03:10.160
I still have two minutes to go, that is a very short presentation, so yeah, let me tell

03:10.200 --> 03:13.240
you a little bit about how it feels to take over this project.

03:13.240 --> 03:17.720
Actually, it's really scary because I know a lot of people love the project and don't

03:17.720 --> 03:23.480
want to see it in a draw somewhere, not maintained and everything.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.200
As a developer, it's also a challenge to get into a new code base obviously because we

03:27.200 --> 03:31.760
have different coding standards at NextCloud than round-cube has.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.800
There's different expectations from how the community works with us or we work with the

03:35.800 --> 03:37.920
community.

03:38.000 --> 03:42.120
Of course, there's implementing the email standard, which is not easy, as everyone knows.

03:42.120 --> 03:48.240
There's IMAP, which is an old protocol and it has its challenges, but it also has its

03:48.240 --> 03:51.240
cool stuff.

03:51.240 --> 03:56.720
It's a challenge, it's an exciting time, it's a scary time and I'm really looking forward

03:56.720 --> 03:58.960
to working more with the project.

03:58.960 --> 04:03.920
Yeah, let me know your questions.

04:03.920 --> 04:04.920
That's basically it.

04:04.920 --> 04:05.920
That's me done.

04:05.920 --> 04:12.920
I see you have something.

04:12.920 --> 04:20.200
I cannot decide who was first, so I start here because you're just closing, so.

04:20.200 --> 04:25.120
I noticed as the developer of Snappy Mail that more people are integrating Snappy Mail

04:25.120 --> 04:30.520
in NextCloud because of the slowness of the NextCloud Mail app.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.520
They also want round-cube.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.520
Yes, there is a round-cube app.

04:33.520 --> 04:36.680
Will there be better integration with NextCloud?

04:36.680 --> 04:38.400
We haven't discussed it yet.

04:38.400 --> 04:41.760
I really can't tell you that it is for project management to decide.

04:41.760 --> 04:47.040
For me, I personally have worked on the mail app and I am partial to the mail app because

04:47.040 --> 04:52.120
it has seen a lot of blood and tears as well from the developers.

04:52.120 --> 04:57.800
But yeah, there is a round-cube app for NextCloud and with the code base in round-cube improves,

04:57.800 --> 05:01.520
then the probability that the round-cube app for NextCloud is going to be better is very

05:01.520 --> 05:02.520
likely.

05:02.520 --> 05:03.520
Does that answer your question?

05:03.520 --> 05:04.520
Okay.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.520
Okay, so this question we solved here.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.520
Is there any more questions?

05:09.520 --> 05:10.520
Yes?

05:10.520 --> 05:16.920
Sorry, I think that.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.040
Have you already gathered some experience with Hacker One and how is it like?

05:21.040 --> 05:26.520
Yes, I've worked with Hacker One for two years now.

05:26.520 --> 05:31.920
We handle all internal or like NextCloud security issues via Hacker One.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.520
It has produced some good results.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.920
Obviously, it's not always easy because it duplicates and stuff like that.

05:38.920 --> 05:47.000
But for how the reports are structured, how you can evaluate a security issue, it is actually

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
pretty decent.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Yeah.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.320
And it offers an integration with GitHub, so it's not that much work to copy it over

05:52.320 --> 05:54.920
to GitHub and then publish it.

05:54.920 --> 06:00.920
Yeah.

06:00.920 --> 06:06.040
Is there any interest by commercial ISPs in supporting round-cube?

06:06.040 --> 06:09.360
To use it as a webmail app for their own purposes?

06:09.360 --> 06:13.160
As far as I know, Alexander actually works for an ISP.

06:13.160 --> 06:18.640
So I think they might be paying him for that, but you would have to ask him yourself if

06:18.640 --> 06:21.120
that is true or not.

06:21.120 --> 06:25.800
I know that a lot of ISPs have forked round-cube and have their own kind of version of round-cube

06:25.800 --> 06:26.800
that they maintain.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.560
There is, Hans, if you mentioned this project from the French government that has their

06:30.560 --> 06:32.960
own kind of round-cube implementation.

06:32.960 --> 06:36.800
So I'm sure there is interest because it is a powerful tool and it works really well.

06:36.800 --> 06:37.800
People like it.

06:37.800 --> 06:38.800
It's easy to install.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
I've tried it myself.

06:39.800 --> 06:44.800
It was very nice, very easy to do when Docker wasn't doing its thing.

06:44.800 --> 06:45.800
Yeah.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.800
Yeah.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.400
So I hope there will be interest and I hope there will be interest in the community as

06:50.400 --> 06:54.960
well to get the product back and get it a bit more popular again.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.120
Yeah.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.560
That is my goal for this list.

06:58.560 --> 06:59.560
Yeah.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.200
Any more questions?

07:02.200 --> 07:07.080
As a wise, one thing that came to my mind when thinking about, we have seen 4K9, there

07:07.080 --> 07:10.320
is a list of actual features somehow blocking the big renaming.

07:10.320 --> 07:16.880
So I wonder, is there anything you discovered on the roadmap or on the bucket list in round-cube,

07:16.880 --> 07:20.480
which particularly you would like to address in next time?

07:20.480 --> 07:21.480
Not yet, no.

07:21.480 --> 07:26.240
We haven't done any sort of project management evaluation yet because we didn't have the

07:26.240 --> 07:27.240
developer for it.

07:27.240 --> 07:31.040
Now that we have hired a person for this, I'm hoping we can actually get some project

07:31.040 --> 07:32.760
management up on GitHub as well.

07:32.760 --> 07:37.280
So we're using the boards with NextCloud so that would be easy.

07:37.280 --> 07:42.280
We can actually sort issues into swim lanes and then work through them.

07:42.280 --> 07:46.720
Since it's only one person, progress will not be as fast, but on the other hand, I mean,

07:46.720 --> 07:49.440
it's not like nine people can carry a baby in one month.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.320
There's the owner from project management.

07:51.320 --> 07:55.040
So things will hopefully be getting done quicker than now.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.040
I also really hope to get through the backlog of PRs.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.560
We have 49 PRs open.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.160
The first one is from 2015.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.400
So there's some bug fixes in there, but I've also seen some features.

08:06.400 --> 08:13.200
I have seen some left to right and right to left text support so you can change for right

08:13.200 --> 08:14.200
to left languages.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.320
That would actually be a really nice feature because a lot of people have right to left

08:17.320 --> 08:18.520
text.

08:18.600 --> 08:22.520
If that could be merged, that would be great, but there is a problem with the CSS classes

08:22.520 --> 08:24.880
for different team implementations.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.480
So that would need to be thoroughly checked and that is probably something that the developer

08:28.480 --> 08:30.080
should and can do.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.920
It's all different themes, see how well it works.

08:32.920 --> 08:34.960
And yeah, also sync with Alex on this.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.040
She's had some input.

08:36.040 --> 08:39.960
So yeah, maybe you'll see some right to left text support soon.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.960
All right.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.160
No more questions.

08:44.160 --> 08:45.160
So yeah.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.160
Thank you.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.800
Thank you.
