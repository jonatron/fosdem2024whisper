WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.440
Thank you so much.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.520
It is a delight to be here.

00:18.520 --> 00:22.120
I spent years at FOSDA fighting the end of the community room because it was in a tiny

00:22.120 --> 00:26.200
room and you couldn't get in and I was like, well, if I have to speak to get in, I will,

00:26.200 --> 00:28.760
it looks like we have a nice big spot now.

00:28.760 --> 00:32.520
That is much better.

00:32.520 --> 00:38.360
Let's talk about the state of free and open source funding.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.360
I am Cara Soles.

00:39.360 --> 00:40.360
I work with GitHub.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.120
I work with open source maintainers.

00:42.120 --> 00:46.880
It is my role to advocate internally at the company and externally for the needs of maintainers.

00:46.880 --> 00:51.440
I also ran the inaugural cohort this past year of the GitHub accelerator, which I will

00:51.440 --> 00:54.920
speak some about and a bunch of other maintainers seeing activities.

00:54.920 --> 01:00.120
Which means because I am speaking with maintainers a fair amount, money just keeps coming up.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.280
So I am here to talk about money.

01:02.280 --> 01:07.600
I will talk about a number of different ways the money flows through the ecosystem, including

01:07.600 --> 01:12.040
FOSC contributor funds, grant funding, individual sponsorships.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.960
But I want to be extremely clear.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.440
We are just talking about cash today.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.840
As Mike McQuade said in this room earlier, the majority of what projects need is not

01:19.840 --> 01:20.840
money.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.880
You cannot solve your problems by throwing money at it no matter how much I might try.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.840
Most of the things that folks need are not cash.

01:27.840 --> 01:33.360
But we have only got 30 minutes, so we are going to talk just about cash.

01:33.360 --> 01:37.080
There is also big money dollar value in open source.

01:37.080 --> 01:42.480
Here you have the European Commission in 2021 saying companies in the EU invested around

01:42.480 --> 01:47.600
1 billion euros in open source software in 2018, which brought a positive impact on the

01:47.600 --> 01:51.640
European economy of 65 to 95 billion euros.

01:51.640 --> 01:57.840
We predicted an increase of 10% in contributions would annually generate an additional 0.4

01:57.840 --> 01:59.560
to 0.6% GDP.

01:59.560 --> 02:03.240
So there is money going on.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.720
But where is it going to maintainers?

02:05.720 --> 02:12.840
And by what mechanisms does it flow to maintainers?

02:12.840 --> 02:16.840
I do want to briefly say, why do we even care about funding software maintenance?

02:16.840 --> 02:19.360
So we have got 90% of companies are using open source.

02:19.360 --> 02:20.360
That is nice.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.480
That makes me feel good.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.600
FOSC constitutes 70 to 90% of any given piece of modern software solutions.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.600
That is sick.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.600
Love it.

02:29.600 --> 02:34.720
89% of code bases contained open source, more than four years out of date.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.720
That makes me a little nervous.

02:37.720 --> 02:44.040
84% of code bases contained at least one known open source vulnerability.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.600
That is actually even more uncomfortable.

02:45.600 --> 02:49.800
So there is a lot of reasons to fund open source maintenance.

02:49.840 --> 02:51.680
We can hear all day talking about them.

02:51.680 --> 02:56.280
It is the underpinning of everything that we are basically functioning with this society.

02:56.280 --> 02:59.320
But also let's not have it fall apart.

02:59.320 --> 03:03.080
So what do we know about FOSC maintainers and money?

03:03.080 --> 03:07.120
Most of what we know about this comes from tidelifts state of the open source maintainer

03:07.120 --> 03:08.120
report.

03:08.120 --> 03:13.160
Here they find that 60% of maintainers are unpaid hobbyists.

03:13.160 --> 03:18.680
And of that 60%, 77% would prefer to be paid.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.560
I know.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.560
It is pretty wild.

03:22.560 --> 03:27.200
44% are solo maintainers.

03:27.200 --> 03:33.840
So if they won the lottery and moved to remote islands, the dream that we all share, there

03:33.840 --> 03:36.680
is no one to pick up the project and go forward.

03:36.680 --> 03:43.520
A lottery aside, 58% have at least considered quitting a project and 22% have actually quit

03:43.520 --> 03:44.520
maintaining a project.

03:44.840 --> 03:45.840
It is not bad.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.480
You shouldn't have to maintain a project the rest of your life.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.160
Building an open source project does not put you in an eternal prison.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.480
You can never free yourself from it.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.680
Things should end and you should be able to move on.

03:56.680 --> 04:01.120
But as we can see, if we have one maintainer and a lot of things depending on it, this

04:01.120 --> 04:02.520
is kind of an issue.

04:02.520 --> 04:08.720
Fortunately, one of the many paths forward they found is 56% said that earning more money

04:08.720 --> 04:12.040
for maintenance work would actually help keep them from quitting.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.040
So that is good.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.880
So where does this money pass through?

04:14.880 --> 04:17.120
Let's talk about funding platforms.

04:17.120 --> 04:22.200
So places that enable payments to false projects and maintainers.

04:22.200 --> 04:28.960
So they are kind of this middle space that helps the money move.

04:28.960 --> 04:32.280
There is a lot more platforms in the space than there used to be, which is fantastic.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.520
This led to a lot of specialization.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.160
So you have got platforms like Thanks.dev and Stack Aid, which are looking specifically

04:38.160 --> 04:39.720
at dependency funding.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.200
We have got the crowd funding model.

04:41.200 --> 04:46.360
We have got the classic ongoing crowd funding with Patreon, which a lot of software developers

04:46.360 --> 04:47.360
use.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.080
We have got tipping platforms.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.120
We have got ones focused on recurring income.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.760
And of course, we have direct tips.

04:53.760 --> 04:58.240
In this, I am going to mention two platforms that are focused very specifically around

04:58.240 --> 05:01.880
the open source space and that cover a bunch of these different techniques, which is GitHub

05:01.880 --> 05:07.280
sponsors and open source collective, which is a fiscal host under open collective.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.840
There is also a lot more models that people are looking at, which I don't have space for

05:10.840 --> 05:11.840
here.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.280
So there is a subscription model that Tidelift explores.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.400
There is service marketplace like Open Teams.

05:16.400 --> 05:20.360
We have got experiments in quadratic funding with Gitcoin.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.840
We could be here all day, which is good.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.680
We need this kind of diversity.

05:24.680 --> 05:29.320
So in terms of what kind of money is moving through, GitHub sponsors have seen $40 million

05:29.320 --> 05:30.320
come through since 2019.

05:30.320 --> 05:35.600
I know this looks like a copy-paste error, but I just imagine I actually think open source

05:35.600 --> 05:44.640
collective also has had exactly $40 million come since 2019 and saw $10 million in 2023

05:44.640 --> 05:45.640
alone.

05:45.640 --> 05:51.800
So the growth of money coming through spaces like this shows that as we make it easier for

05:51.800 --> 05:56.960
folks to find and support projects that they want to support, we are able to funnel money

05:56.960 --> 05:58.120
through there, which is great.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.600
It lowers the barrier.

06:00.600 --> 06:06.000
One of the main sources of using platforms like this is FOSS contributor funds.

06:06.000 --> 06:11.520
So the way that, indeed, defined this when they kind of set out what a FOSS contributor

06:11.520 --> 06:17.480
fund was was a framework for selecting open source projects that a company supports financially,

06:17.480 --> 06:23.000
specifically designed to encourage open source participation and help companies take an active

06:23.000 --> 06:25.400
role in sustaining the projects they rely on.

06:25.400 --> 06:30.920
So colloquially, a FOSS fund is any instance of a company funding projects, usually they're

06:30.920 --> 06:35.240
dependent, these are like a semi-organized way, at least, without expecting anything concrete

06:35.240 --> 06:37.400
in return.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.200
So that's kind of flowing through here.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.920
Companies have been giving to open source for a long time and certainly much longer than

06:43.920 --> 06:49.600
2019, but the rise of the structured program referred to as a FOSS contributor fund, you

06:49.600 --> 06:53.080
can really trace back to, indeed, and Duane O'Brien in 2019.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.680
And since then, a lot of companies have made public announcements saying not just here's

06:57.680 --> 07:01.960
what money we're going to give to open source directly, but here's how we're going to distribute

07:01.960 --> 07:05.480
that money and involve our own employees in it, which is really cool.

07:05.480 --> 07:10.200
GitHub sponsors found that the average value of an organization sponsorship versus an individual

07:10.200 --> 07:16.360
is 15 times, which is actually reflective of that companies do have a lot more money

07:16.360 --> 07:18.160
than I personally have.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.880
So that makes a lot of sense.

07:21.880 --> 07:26.080
In terms of how much money is actually coming through FOSS funds, though, like my back of

07:26.080 --> 07:34.080
an app can math is based on public announcements and based on what data we can see, maybe $12

07:34.080 --> 07:39.320
million last year, which is life changing for a number of projects and life changing

07:39.320 --> 07:45.720
for a number of maintainers and like paltry, like honestly kind of a pathetic number when

07:45.720 --> 07:49.840
you look at the overall value of open source.

07:49.840 --> 07:54.600
In terms of scale, we see companies like Century and other companies give up to like $500,000,

07:54.600 --> 07:55.600
which is great.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.400
We see a few thousand across the map, which is good.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.080
Here's a few of the patterns that we see in this space.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.600
First of all, this isn't a sustainable model for the ecosystem.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.120
This is a supplementary model.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.360
And it's good, right?

08:08.360 --> 08:13.600
But we can't pretend that we're going to maintain this whole ecosystem in this philanthropic

08:13.600 --> 08:17.480
effort for companies to give back.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.480
It's supplementary.

08:18.480 --> 08:23.720
We also see that FOSS funds are usually not a stable source of income for maintainers.

08:23.720 --> 08:28.360
They're often giving like one time, it's employee voted, which is very positive, but means that

08:28.360 --> 08:32.480
you can't understand when you're going to get that income and you probably aren't necessarily

08:32.480 --> 08:34.040
going to get it again.

08:34.040 --> 08:38.120
We've also found that expecting companies to fund open source for the positive press

08:38.120 --> 08:40.680
is a failed path.

08:40.680 --> 08:43.840
The majority of companies that are giving money directly to open source projects do not

08:43.840 --> 08:45.560
talk about it openly.

08:45.680 --> 08:51.320
They don't get out there and to get their PR department like let's party.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.600
There's a number of reasons for this.

08:52.600 --> 08:58.680
I think one of them is what can seem like an incalculable sum internally to get someone

08:58.680 --> 09:04.200
to sign off on, to give to open source can look pathetic from the outside.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.960
We've all thought for money for stuff and been like, I did it.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.640
I got however much.

09:08.640 --> 09:11.960
But then people look at the total value of the company who are external and they're like,

09:11.960 --> 09:14.560
well, shouldn't the company be given more?

09:14.560 --> 09:19.680
And so I think that's one of the strains there in terms of companies not talking as publicly

09:19.680 --> 09:20.680
about it.

09:20.680 --> 09:27.520
FOSPONs are also particularly vulnerable to real or imaginary macroeconomic conditions.

09:27.520 --> 09:32.800
They took a hit definitely in 2023 and there's stuff that gets cut pretty early when companies

09:32.800 --> 09:34.840
come through and do a little snip, snip.

09:34.840 --> 09:38.480
So that also affects the stability.

09:38.480 --> 09:44.480
A lot of FOSPON stuff is associated with OSPOS, open source programs offices, which are fantastic.

09:45.400 --> 09:49.560
FOSPONs funding is not a focus however for OSPOS.

09:49.560 --> 09:54.760
OSPOS are using their limited resources to get employees engaged with open sourcing at

09:54.760 --> 09:57.560
the company to give back to open source, which is amazing.

09:57.560 --> 10:05.000
FOSPONs are a tool to get employees engaged, not one of the core kind of means to an end.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.240
And I will close this with the companies that have shared their funding structures and talked

10:08.240 --> 10:11.600
about what they're doing in this space has paid off.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.120
This may not be a huge number, but the reason that it's even where it is is because people

10:15.120 --> 10:18.000
went out and said this is how our company is doing it, this is how we're structuring

10:18.000 --> 10:19.720
it and I think you should do it too.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.600
So that is working.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.200
We've got a lot of space for improvement here.

10:23.200 --> 10:27.240
We've got a lot of improvements we can do in data in terms of identifying dependencies

10:27.240 --> 10:32.440
so we don't rely on charisma to choose projects, which is a big problem in this space.

10:32.440 --> 10:36.680
We can improve data around the benefits that funders receive, not individual benefits from

10:36.680 --> 10:42.440
projects, which are hard to juggle, but overall when we pump money into this ecosystem, what

10:42.440 --> 10:43.440
are we doing?

10:43.440 --> 10:44.440
Are we actually making it more secure?

10:44.440 --> 10:45.440
Are we making it more stable?

10:45.440 --> 10:50.240
How do we prove that and thus make this funding less vulnerable to cuts?

10:50.240 --> 10:54.560
I would also encourage you to check out FOSPONs and see if there's stuff that you want to

10:54.560 --> 10:56.520
do around this.

10:56.520 --> 11:01.360
In terms of individuals sending money to open source maintainers, if you give money to an

11:01.360 --> 11:04.120
open source project or a maintainer, nice job.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.480
Awesome.

11:05.480 --> 11:09.040
Thank you.

11:09.040 --> 11:12.160
It's actually having an impact.

11:12.160 --> 11:17.200
One of the really interesting things here is that across funding platforms, individuals

11:17.200 --> 11:22.960
are significantly outperforming FOSPONs in the amount of money that they are given to

11:22.960 --> 11:27.240
independent projects, which is very sad and pathetic from a company perspective, but it's

11:27.240 --> 11:30.280
like pretty badass from a you perspective.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.280
Nice work.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.880
It's interesting because in 2023 we learned that it's more resilient.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.720
When companies cut their budgets back, people didn't cut their budgets the same way, which

11:41.720 --> 11:46.880
is incredible because I don't know about you, but my groceries are 25% more expensive.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.840
Again, super nice work.

11:48.840 --> 11:54.200
It's not something we can structure the ecosystem across, but it shows how much people actually

11:54.200 --> 11:56.800
really care about the software that they use.

11:56.800 --> 12:02.800
We just have to have better mechanisms for that caring to be reflected by larger organizations.

12:03.280 --> 12:07.600
Let's talk about foundations.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.600
Where is the money?

12:08.600 --> 12:10.400
The money is going somewhere.

12:10.400 --> 12:14.360
The most common method of funding open source projects is joining or starting a foundation,

12:14.360 --> 12:19.280
which is an organization that can take care of fundraising, legal needs, corporate relationships,

12:19.280 --> 12:23.640
all this great stuff.

12:23.640 --> 12:30.880
In terms of how much money foundations are bringing in, in 2022 the top 32 software foundations,

12:31.000 --> 12:38.000
if you take out Wikimedia, brought in $304 million, which is pretty cool.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.880
Linux Foundation brought in 58% of that.

12:41.880 --> 12:42.880
It's got to be higher this year.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.800
The numbers aren't out for this year, but given the phenomenal increase in fundraising

12:46.800 --> 12:53.080
that the LF accomplished this past year, I bet that that percentage is even higher.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.480
There's a lot of different approaches across foundations, but I will focus specifically

12:56.480 --> 13:01.480
more so on kind of the Linux Foundation's approach, just because it's so dominant in

13:01.480 --> 13:04.840
the ecosystem.

13:04.840 --> 13:09.600
The way that foundations support projects is through a wide variety of resources, legal,

13:09.600 --> 13:13.760
financial services, project governance, how hosting, all these essential things.

13:13.760 --> 13:19.920
We ask open source maintainers to wear like 15 hats to be an accountant and a lawyer and

13:19.920 --> 13:22.920
a community manager and everything all at once.

13:22.960 --> 13:28.920
Foundations say, well, what if we took like 12 of those hats off and you only had to wear

13:28.920 --> 13:31.480
like three, which is great.

13:31.480 --> 13:34.640
That's something that enables projects to continue.

13:34.640 --> 13:39.720
The hat that foundations do not tend to be doing anything with here is that foundations

13:39.720 --> 13:45.760
are not usually paying money to project maintainers for the purpose of maintaining a project.

13:45.760 --> 13:50.760
That is not the way that foundations really function in general, with some notable exceptions,

13:50.760 --> 13:51.760
but small exceptions.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.720
Instead, they lead into this model of the professional maintainer.

13:55.720 --> 14:01.360
LF research in 2023 found among critical open source projects, the majority of maintainers

14:01.360 --> 14:04.080
and court contributors enjoy full-time employment.

14:04.080 --> 14:08.720
This is our 13% of maintainers that are professional maintainers we see in tidaliff survey, but

14:08.720 --> 14:11.480
they're not paid by foundations.

14:11.480 --> 14:16.160
These are people paid by companies, for-profit companies, to maintain projects that those

14:16.160 --> 14:21.440
companies are dependent on and rely on.

14:22.120 --> 14:26.920
As software foundations aren't paying for project maintenance and they are bringing in these

14:26.920 --> 14:31.040
other resources, part of that also is they have a very tight loop with companies because

14:31.040 --> 14:37.400
they have to be out there advocating for these companies to hire full-time maintainers.

14:37.400 --> 14:41.240
Foundations are helping maintain this whole ecosystem effect, which is really important

14:41.240 --> 14:44.000
in how a lot of these projects are surviving.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.120
They also make donating to open source really easy for companies.

14:47.440 --> 14:52.920
The administrative burden of donating to a ton of different projects is a rough one

14:52.920 --> 14:57.000
and different platforms are trying to address that, but foundations make it really simple.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.840
You give them a big lump sum and they tell you what level you're at and they give you

15:00.840 --> 15:07.960
a nice prize to show your executives and you're like, yeah, your finance team isn't mad at you.

15:07.960 --> 15:11.240
That's something I think that's really important.

15:11.240 --> 15:15.040
I think, here we go, this brings up a couple of questions.

15:15.040 --> 15:20.080
Is there a model where we see more maintainers paid by foundations, especially around maintainers

15:20.080 --> 15:23.320
who don't want to be employed by a large corporation?

15:23.320 --> 15:28.600
Is there an ability to build in more resiliency for when corporate cuts come in and we see

15:28.600 --> 15:31.600
maintainers of top projects cut at companies?

15:31.600 --> 15:34.760
Can we build in resiliency within foundations?

15:34.760 --> 15:40.800
Given that foundations have, for the most part, unlocked the code in terms of getting corporate

15:40.800 --> 15:45.800
giving, are there ways to distribute that benefit to the broader ecosystem that includes

15:45.800 --> 15:48.760
independent projects that aren't within a foundation?

15:48.760 --> 15:52.080
How do we take those learnings and bring them out more broadly?

15:52.080 --> 15:58.080
Let's talk a little bit about grants and government money.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.600
Grant is a one-time funding agreement.

15:59.600 --> 16:04.320
You say, I'm going to do something and then they give you money and then you do it.

16:04.320 --> 16:08.000
They come from two main sources.

16:08.080 --> 16:14.600
We've got philanthropic orgs and we've got them coming through governmental agencies.

16:14.600 --> 16:20.840
My favorite example of government investing in sustainable open sources is the sovereign

16:20.840 --> 16:21.840
tech fund.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.600
This is an initiative out of the German government.

16:24.600 --> 16:28.600
If you haven't read about the work they're doing, I plead with you, please read about

16:28.600 --> 16:29.600
it.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.600
It's fantastic.

16:30.600 --> 16:31.600
They've been talking about it a year at Fosden.

16:31.600 --> 16:37.960
They've been talking about it all week and also all year because they gave 15 million

16:37.960 --> 16:44.800
euros to open source projects and maintainers in the last one year.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.640
I think it's a really important model.

16:48.640 --> 16:52.520
Seeing governments step in to support critical open source software maintenance, I think

16:52.520 --> 16:53.520
it was really key.

16:53.520 --> 16:57.360
Here we see the European Commission in 2022 saying there's a clear need for a European

16:57.360 --> 17:02.200
funding mechanism to help sustain critical open source software communities.

17:02.200 --> 17:07.720
I'm an American so I'm going to say there's a clear need for America to also do that.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.280
Just put your country name in there, I guess.

17:10.280 --> 17:14.560
Or we could all work together, I don't know.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.840
Traditionally the space that we see grants in is the scientific and academic software

17:18.840 --> 17:19.840
funding space.

17:19.840 --> 17:23.680
If you talk to people in the scientific software space, they're like, oh yeah, grants.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.680
I eat grades for breakfast.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.480
If you talk to anybody else, like me, I'm like, what the hell is a grant?

17:29.480 --> 17:30.480
I don't know.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.480
Software gets that.

17:32.480 --> 17:37.480
There really is a limited understanding of grant funding opportunities outside that academic

17:37.480 --> 17:39.480
and scientific space.

17:39.480 --> 17:44.120
But agencies like NSF, NASA are looking to advance software with an academic research

17:44.120 --> 17:45.400
relationship.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.000
That doesn't usually mean maintenance.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.560
That means building something new.

17:49.560 --> 17:54.760
Similarly with these philanthropic orgs, like Moore, Sloan, CZI, they want to see cool

17:54.760 --> 17:55.960
when things happen.

17:55.960 --> 18:00.560
But grants traditionally have not been a way to fund ongoing software maintenance, which

18:00.560 --> 18:03.960
we're seeing this theme come over and over again.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.520
Let's do that theme again.

18:05.520 --> 18:07.200
Who else doesn't fund maintenance?

18:07.200 --> 18:10.400
Let's talk about venture capital.

18:10.400 --> 18:16.880
VC financing is when someone with a lot of money says, I think one day you too could

18:16.880 --> 18:22.520
make a lot of money and I'll bet on it.

18:22.520 --> 18:28.760
That comes in through when there's a related business built on top of a round of project.

18:29.760 --> 18:37.840
OSS Capital, who's best known for doing funding around open core kind of stuff in the space,

18:37.840 --> 18:44.480
said in 2022, the COSS category has grown dramatically over the last decade from $10

18:44.480 --> 18:46.760
billion to $500 billion plus today.

18:46.760 --> 18:51.440
Even so, we are still in the early stages of costs, which we believe will grow into a

18:51.440 --> 18:54.360
$3 trillion category by 2030.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.760
The VCs are hungry and they see there is money.

18:58.760 --> 19:04.520
They are increasingly coming around knocking.

19:04.520 --> 19:08.640
For founders who want to work with VCs, I think one of the things that we really need

19:08.640 --> 19:13.640
here is for folks to make sure they're working with VCs who understand the peculiarities and

19:13.640 --> 19:17.160
strengths of open source.

19:17.160 --> 19:20.600
Then really importantly on the maintainer side, we need more resources to help people

19:20.600 --> 19:27.280
understand if VC funding, if individual investing, is actually right for them and their projects.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.600
Are they a hockey stick project?

19:28.600 --> 19:29.600
Do they want to be?

19:29.600 --> 19:32.000
Do they want to live that life?

19:32.000 --> 19:37.160
We need a lot more resources to prep people for when someone shows up at the door and

19:37.160 --> 19:39.160
says, do you want a lot of money?

19:39.160 --> 19:42.200
Sign this and also you have to do this now.

19:42.200 --> 19:46.840
Are we preparing people to make that decision?

19:46.840 --> 19:50.400
Speaking of which, we thought about this a lot this year.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.840
This was our first time running GitHub's Accelerator.

19:53.880 --> 19:58.240
It was a really exciting experiment and we are doing it again this coming year.

19:58.240 --> 20:02.160
I would look for applications to open up on that soon.

20:02.160 --> 20:08.600
What we did was we ran this Accelerator specifically for open source software maintainers.

20:08.600 --> 20:12.440
That for us meant there was no one size fits all approach.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.880
There's not one answer to this.

20:13.880 --> 20:19.760
We wanted to bring in a diversity of projects and say, how do we help experiment what sustainability

20:19.760 --> 20:21.000
is going to mean to you?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.160
What's financial sustainability?

20:23.480 --> 20:26.440
We want to look at a lot of different models and help you find the right one.

20:26.440 --> 20:33.440
For some of those, they did go on and get nice funding, go into iCombinator.

20:33.440 --> 20:37.400
For many of them, other things that meant starting businesses on top.

20:37.400 --> 20:42.000
If I had time to go through business models on top of open source here, then I would be

20:42.000 --> 20:43.080
going through it right now.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.560
But also, you would be here a lot longer in very uncomfortable chairs listening to the

20:46.560 --> 20:47.560
same person.

20:47.560 --> 20:49.800
That's why they only gave me a half an hour.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.000
Please forgive me.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.320
We need a lot better education on what those paths were, and that's something we're trying

20:55.320 --> 20:56.320
to start tackling.

20:56.320 --> 21:00.240
The way that we did this is we took 20 open source projects.

21:00.240 --> 21:03.440
We gave them $20,000 funding for projects.

21:03.440 --> 21:09.960
We did a 10-week program to say, let's bring in experts who have found ways to be sustainable

21:09.960 --> 21:14.000
with their open source projects to talk about how they did it and give that perspective

21:14.000 --> 21:15.720
and mentorship.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.640
This is the previous year we did a FOSS fund.

21:18.640 --> 21:22.680
We gave $500,000 to open source, 2022, 2023.

21:22.680 --> 21:26.440
We said, how do we take the same amount of money, but give more material support on top

21:26.440 --> 21:32.840
of it?

21:32.840 --> 21:36.760
We found a lot of the same barriers that people find.

21:36.760 --> 21:40.560
None of this is a surprise, but I think some of the key stuff is understanding on pros

21:40.560 --> 21:46.040
and cons of business models, the strains on solo-maintained projects.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.120
There's difficult community perception.

21:48.120 --> 21:54.560
In open source, you're expected to magically do everything for free, for the good of the

21:54.560 --> 21:57.480
world, but I still eat food.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.720
People judge you when you're trying to make money so you can keep doing the thing you

22:00.720 --> 22:02.220
love.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.720
There's really complicated stuff there.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.760
Maybe there's a therapy component next year.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.920
I don't know if I should pitch that.

22:10.920 --> 22:16.000
There's a lack for folks who are outside of foundation structure of legal guidance,

22:16.000 --> 22:20.480
accounting guidance and stuff that's specific to the ecosystem.

22:20.480 --> 22:24.800
We also need more opportunities for mentorship for people who have taken specific paths.

22:24.800 --> 22:28.720
That's something that's really lacking.

22:28.720 --> 22:35.480
There is one experimental method I would like to mention since we don't have a ton of time.

22:35.480 --> 22:39.960
Simon Willison, a data set co-founder of Django, was part of the accelerator.

22:40.000 --> 22:47.080
One of the things that he's really been trying out is this experiment to say, let's have

22:47.080 --> 22:51.000
companies pay maintainers to speak to your team.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.720
We know there's limited money for FOS funds, but there's money sitting around underutilized

22:54.720 --> 22:58.560
in company training budgets and consulting budgets.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.240
We've seen those pools and be like, what do you even spend that on?

23:01.240 --> 23:02.240
Spend it on maintainers.

23:02.240 --> 23:05.160
Bring them in to talk to the team.

23:05.160 --> 23:08.400
The internal team gets to speak to the experts behind the software.

23:08.440 --> 23:12.440
You get a time box commitment for the maintainer, so they're not having a contract where they

23:12.440 --> 23:15.320
have to keep your shit running forever.

23:15.320 --> 23:18.000
They're financially supporting projects.

23:18.000 --> 23:21.000
How do we find some more creative ways to get projects funded like this?

23:21.000 --> 23:27.200
I also think this ties into some of Filippo Volsorta's experiment with retainer agreements.

23:27.200 --> 23:30.960
But again, we can talk about that later.

23:30.960 --> 23:35.000
Let's put it together.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.240
This time I will actually pause if you want to take a picture of this slide.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.480
I know I just ran past it earlier.

23:39.480 --> 23:44.600
There was a single tear coming out of so many people's eyes that they like their phone captured

23:44.600 --> 23:51.240
something else.

23:51.240 --> 23:58.040
We've talked about how money flows to open source maintainers and the many paths that

23:58.040 --> 24:01.280
it takes.

24:01.280 --> 24:05.600
We've talked about that open source is still being funded for only a small portion of its

24:05.600 --> 24:07.280
value.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.480
Most companies are not going to magically step up to fill that hole.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.120
That's not how capitalism works.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.760
While companies rely on open source, little of that funding is trickling down.

24:16.760 --> 24:23.280
Of what funding does trickle down, it's mostly not trickling down for maintainers doing maintenance

24:23.280 --> 24:26.960
work as opposed to new features.

24:26.960 --> 24:30.400
Most maintainers are not able to financially support their work unless companies choose

24:30.400 --> 24:33.560
to hire them for it.

24:33.560 --> 24:37.080
In more limited cases, if they start their own businesses, but that's still kind of the

24:37.080 --> 24:41.680
majority of maintainers are being employed by a company.

24:41.680 --> 24:46.480
Current funding structures, as we said, not focused on maintenance at all.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.800
We need better models to support this.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.760
We need new models.

24:50.760 --> 24:55.080
I personally also really, as you heard, believe government funds aimed at critical suffer

24:55.080 --> 24:59.480
maintenance or promising development, among others.

24:59.480 --> 25:01.000
Some missions for you because you're here.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.120
You get homework.

25:02.120 --> 25:04.120
We're in a university.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.640
We need more data.

25:05.640 --> 25:06.640
What's working?

25:06.640 --> 25:07.640
What's not?

25:07.640 --> 25:08.640
Can your org do a survey?

25:08.640 --> 25:10.880
Can you release trends that you're seeing?

25:10.880 --> 25:12.960
Is there anything you can do there?

25:12.960 --> 25:17.320
We need more companies publicly committing to funding.

25:17.320 --> 25:21.720
Even if we need a bigger model than that, we got to keep stuff going for now.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.720
Can you get out there and actually say, we're going to commit to funding, we're going to

25:24.720 --> 25:27.640
do a FOSS fund, here's what we're doing?

25:27.640 --> 25:29.000
Add yourself on FOSS funders.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.720
Is there something you can do there?

25:30.720 --> 25:34.720
2023 was a reminder that corporate budgets and priorities are fickle.

25:34.720 --> 25:38.160
It was a painful, painful reminder in this.

25:38.160 --> 25:41.120
Any funding planning that we do has to take this into consideration.

25:41.120 --> 25:46.560
How do we make it harder to cut open source funding that we do achieve?

25:46.560 --> 25:54.360
Maintainers need more resources and more mentorship to decide how to sustain their projects.

25:54.360 --> 25:55.440
Do you have experience in this?

25:55.440 --> 25:58.240
Can you help mentor other open source maintainers?

25:58.360 --> 26:04.760
In the past and what has and has not, that just as importantly worked for you.

26:04.760 --> 26:08.240
I think we should do what we can to advocate for government funding, which is something

26:08.240 --> 26:12.800
that has been happening a lot this week across Europe.

26:12.800 --> 26:18.720
And how do we get this conversation out of the echo chamber and into the broader ecosystem?

26:18.720 --> 26:21.520
So a few things to consider.

26:21.600 --> 26:28.200
A special thank you to a lot of people who were very, very wonderful and helpful in this.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.800
That is what I came here to say.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.400
And miraculously, I didn't run over.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.400
So here we are.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.640
I think we have time for about one question.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.120
One question.

26:52.120 --> 26:53.120
Don't mess it up.

26:53.120 --> 26:54.120
Okay.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.120
I'm kidding.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.120
The hand at the back went up first.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.120
So I'm going to go all the way up.

26:59.120 --> 27:02.120
This is more of a question that are a comment than a question, but...

27:11.120 --> 27:14.120
If you have other questions, I put my email up there.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.120
So you can use that.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.600
I'm also pretty easy to find.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.040
I'm not good at hiding.

27:19.040 --> 27:21.040
So this is more of a comment than a question.

27:21.040 --> 27:23.040
I'm kidding.

27:23.040 --> 27:28.520
So you sort of mentioned this a little bit in your talk, but over the last 18 months,

27:28.520 --> 27:33.280
roughly half a million people have been publicly laid off in the tech sector.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.280
Yes.

27:34.280 --> 27:38.080
Along with massively budgeting in private sector technology companies.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.080
Pretty brutal.

27:39.080 --> 27:44.760
A big question, but could you speak towards the impact on open source communities that

27:44.760 --> 27:47.160
this may have had that you've been seeing from your side?

27:47.160 --> 27:49.600
And are there any insights that you can provide here?

27:49.600 --> 27:50.600
Thank you.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.240
That is a very good question.

27:52.240 --> 27:58.120
And for anyone who couldn't hear it, it was around the enormous amount of layoffs and

27:58.120 --> 28:02.440
budget cuts in the last year, like what influence have I been seeing across the ecosystem?

28:02.440 --> 28:07.960
When I started this talk, everyone I talked to, I said, what about 2023?

28:07.960 --> 28:09.680
And do you have any data on 2023?

28:09.680 --> 28:11.840
I was like begging people for data on 2023.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.440
It turns out 2024 just started.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.840
And we don't have the data yet.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.880
Which I was very sad about.

28:18.880 --> 28:27.800
But we know anecdotally a lot of open source program offices had really harsh cuts.

28:27.800 --> 28:34.600
We also know that money is bouncing back very quickly.

28:34.600 --> 28:38.080
That nature is healing, it seems.

28:38.080 --> 28:42.360
But I don't know how fast that actually starts to trickle back down.

28:42.360 --> 28:46.640
And I think that we're going to have the opportunity to look back at 2023.

28:46.640 --> 28:51.240
I think you're asking the right questions and say, what can we learn from this so that

28:51.240 --> 28:58.320
the next time this happens, we shouldn't have to be, but we're more resilient.

28:58.320 --> 29:03.800
Like, we're ready as an ecosystem to brace for fickle corporate budgets.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.800
I wish I had a better answer there.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.800
All right, thanks, Kara.

29:07.800 --> 29:08.800
Yeah.

29:08.800 --> 29:09.800
Thank you.

29:09.800 --> 29:10.800
Thank you.

29:10.800 --> 29:11.800
Thank you.

29:11.800 --> 29:12.800
Thank you.

29:12.800 --> 29:13.800
Thank you.

29:13.800 --> 29:14.800
Thank you.

29:14.800 --> 29:15.800
Thank you.

29:15.800 --> 29:16.800
Thank you.

29:16.800 --> 29:17.800
Thank you.

29:17.800 --> 29:18.800
Thank you.

29:18.800 --> 29:19.800
Thank you.

29:19.800 --> 29:20.800
Thank you.

29:20.800 --> 29:21.800
Thank you.

29:21.800 --> 29:22.800
Thank you.

29:22.800 --> 29:23.800
Thank you.

29:23.800 --> 29:24.800
Thank you.

29:24.800 --> 29:25.800
Thank you.

29:25.800 --> 29:26.800
Thank you.

29:26.800 --> 29:27.800
Thank you.

29:27.800 --> 29:28.800
Thank you.

29:28.800 --> 29:29.800
Thank you.

29:29.800 --> 29:30.800
Thank you.

29:30.800 --> 29:31.800
Thank you.

29:31.800 --> 29:32.800
Thank you.

29:32.800 --> 29:33.800
Thank you.

29:33.800 --> 29:34.800
Thank you.

29:34.800 --> 29:35.800
Thank you.

29:35.800 --> 29:36.800
Thank you.

29:36.800 --> 29:37.800
Thank you.

29:37.800 --> 29:38.800
Thank you.

29:38.800 --> 29:39.800
Thank you.

29:39.800 --> 29:40.800
Thank you.

29:40.800 --> 29:41.800
Thank you.

29:41.800 --> 29:42.800
Thank you.

29:42.800 --> 29:43.800
Thank you.

29:43.800 --> 29:44.800
Thank you.
