WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
All right.

00:05.760 --> 00:12.480
So we've heard from the community, we've heard from policy makers and I think it's time for

00:12.480 --> 00:16.680
you to be able to ask questions because that must have been a bit frustrating to not hear

00:16.680 --> 00:20.240
specifically when I hear your laughter about the specific Apple stuff that I'm not going

00:20.240 --> 00:22.240
to comment specifically.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.240
So it's time for questions.

00:24.240 --> 00:30.600
I'm going to ask a few of them, the dumb one, and I'll let you ask the smart one.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.320
My first question is actually to you, Alex.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.760
Here we have a lot of developers that are developing the app, open source app, they

00:36.760 --> 00:39.520
build their businesses, but sometimes they're hobbyists as well.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.440
They just like to develop apps because they're training themselves because they're curious

00:43.440 --> 00:44.880
because they like it.

00:44.880 --> 00:49.280
So when I hear your presentation about interoperability of messaging services, what I'm dreaming

00:49.280 --> 00:53.920
of is a kid one day or a hobbyist that is just able to build an app that is interoperable

00:53.920 --> 00:56.680
with every single messaging service, it's just for himself.

00:56.680 --> 01:01.680
He's not selling it to anyone, it's not a business, it's just him or her or them and

01:01.680 --> 01:07.040
wants to be able to just interoperate and create something to exchange with his friends.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.560
Do you think that's something that the DMA will be able to create and that's what we're

01:10.560 --> 01:13.440
talking about or it's just impossible?

01:13.440 --> 01:21.400
No, I mean, overall the DMAs of the DMAs to create opportunities.

01:21.400 --> 01:26.560
So if you're a software developer and you see, well, I need, for example, access to

01:26.560 --> 01:31.480
these APIs and all this, then you can go to the obligations of the DMA, you can say,

01:31.480 --> 01:32.840
how can the DMA can help?

01:32.840 --> 01:40.240
And so the idea is to create some room for developers to develop their software.

01:40.240 --> 01:46.080
Now when it comes to the specific question of messaging services, Article 7, if you want

01:46.080 --> 01:50.680
to go and take a look, which is the one that deals with this, is quite specific in the

01:50.680 --> 01:58.640
sense that, for example, it says that the level of security and end-to-end encryption

01:58.640 --> 02:01.520
provided by the gatekeeper has to be preserved.

02:01.520 --> 02:05.000
So I can imagine that if you are a software developer, then you have to, and you're starting

02:05.000 --> 02:09.200
from scratch, somehow you have to work towards that.

02:09.200 --> 02:14.880
So it's not that I do something and that's it and that would work, but you have to make

02:14.880 --> 02:18.840
sure that that level of security and encryption is going to be preserved.

02:18.840 --> 02:22.920
And that I suppose that requires some manpower.

02:22.920 --> 02:30.320
But the idea, anyways, is that as far as you are providing a messaging service that you

02:30.320 --> 02:34.680
intend to provide in the European Union or are already providing in the European Union,

02:34.680 --> 02:37.640
then Article 7 is for you as well.

02:37.640 --> 02:42.440
Does anyone have a question to this or to something else?

02:42.440 --> 02:44.960
Okay, many.

02:44.960 --> 02:48.120
Let's start from you.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.960
So actually I have a question from one of our livestream viewers for the Matrix Channel

02:52.960 --> 02:54.760
for Interoperability.

02:54.760 --> 02:58.400
The Data Act mentions harmonized European standards.

02:58.400 --> 03:02.680
Is there some work underway in that respect now?

03:02.680 --> 03:04.960
Thank you.

03:04.960 --> 03:07.840
I guess that is for you, Lede.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.840
Here you are.

03:09.840 --> 03:10.840
Yeah.

03:10.840 --> 03:15.320
So the work is actually starting now.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.720
So it has not yet started.

03:16.720 --> 03:24.360
We are now starting with the inventory of standards that facilitate interoperability.

03:24.360 --> 03:32.560
And the creation of this, the creation of an inventory with all the different standards

03:32.560 --> 03:38.400
and protocols that would help facilitate this interoperability among the different cloud

03:38.400 --> 03:39.720
services.

03:39.720 --> 03:44.240
So it's not there yet, but it will be hopefully soon.

03:44.240 --> 03:49.600
And if needed, we might need to define our own standards.

03:49.600 --> 03:50.600
Thank you very much.

03:50.600 --> 03:53.320
I have a follow-up question for this.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.920
So here again, I'm going to ask you pretty much the same question I asked, Alex.

03:56.920 --> 04:00.320
What do you think the open source community can do if they leverage that specification

04:00.320 --> 04:03.360
in order to create new solutions that could be open source or other type of solutions?

04:03.360 --> 04:06.960
Do you think that's something that they'd be able to leverage?

04:06.960 --> 04:10.440
Yes, of course.

04:11.440 --> 04:20.240
Also because we want to have open specification, open APIs so that these people can change,

04:20.240 --> 04:23.440
you know, you're not logged in into one service provider, you can change from one service

04:23.440 --> 04:24.560
to another.

04:24.560 --> 04:30.640
And this will open up also new business opportunities, new application developments, etc., etc.,

04:30.640 --> 04:31.760
new cloud services.

04:31.760 --> 04:32.760
Who knows?

04:32.760 --> 04:35.960
So it's also another opportunity for innovation.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.680
Okay, I've seen hands raising.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.480
So I'll let you go for it because you're closing on anyone.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.480
So you've got that for me.

04:44.480 --> 04:45.480
Thank you.

04:45.480 --> 04:49.480
I'm an independent lawyer and political scientist.

04:49.480 --> 04:57.320
Okay, okay, I'm an independent lawyer and political scientist.

04:57.320 --> 05:02.680
So I have three questions here.

05:02.680 --> 05:09.880
First about the DMA with question with Apple how they will integrate or not.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.680
It seems they don't want to.

05:11.680 --> 05:20.600
And the thing is if we look at the Microsoft case that has been opened in 2006 from Commission

05:20.600 --> 05:27.040
against Microsoft, one of the problems was interoperability from the Samba project.

05:27.040 --> 05:35.200
So afterward, as the court ruled that Microsoft should provide for free the documentation for

05:35.200 --> 05:37.560
interoperability, Samba get access.

05:37.560 --> 05:44.480
But there was some problems still about some clause that should still be secret.

05:44.480 --> 05:51.720
So that can end there and maybe Apple would like to do something like that.

05:51.840 --> 05:57.440
Secondly, about the messaging things, about the interoperability messaging.

05:57.440 --> 06:02.920
One of the problems about that is what about the quality of the end users?

06:02.920 --> 06:07.480
What I mean is, for example, if there is a WhatsApp user, one of my friends WhatsApp users,

06:07.480 --> 06:12.440
and for example, I am a signal user, I cannot interpret with them.

06:12.440 --> 06:18.120
But on the question of security and privacy, one of the reasons why I use signal is because

06:18.120 --> 06:20.960
of the privacy and the security concern.

06:20.960 --> 06:27.160
And the problem is if there is interoperability between WhatsApp and signal, does it mean

06:27.160 --> 06:37.600
that my message will go to a lower level of security and privacy because my friend use

06:37.600 --> 06:38.600
WhatsApp?

06:38.600 --> 06:39.600
Do you see the problem?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.760
It's a problem of quality.

06:41.760 --> 06:46.160
We will go down on the quality of privacy and security or we will up it.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.120
It's an open question.

06:48.120 --> 06:56.720
And the third one I forgot, I think it was, it's much more larger question.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.400
It's about the question of anti-competition law.

07:00.400 --> 07:06.760
So how do you see DMA will articulate with anti-competition law that is very useful for

07:06.760 --> 07:11.600
open source community as we've seen in my case and various cases?

07:11.600 --> 07:12.600
Thank you.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.600
Right.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.800
I'd be lying if I'd say that you got the easy questions.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.800
So good luck.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.840
Yeah, now these are very interesting questions.

07:21.840 --> 07:26.200
And I come actually from the field of competition law and I'm glad you're asking this.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.360
It's just my hobby.

07:28.360 --> 07:34.640
So now about the, I'm actually happy that you mentioned the Microsoft cases because those

07:34.640 --> 07:39.600
are quite important in history of antitrust when it comes to applying competition law

07:39.600 --> 07:41.120
to digital cases, right?

07:41.120 --> 07:44.600
And as you say, it's very important for the open source community.

07:44.600 --> 07:50.240
Now one of the, and I think this speaks about the importance of the DMA and how powerful

07:50.240 --> 07:55.520
the DMA is because when it comes to these cases, first of all, they run for a long period

07:55.520 --> 08:00.200
of time because they take time to, you know, first of all, identify what's the issue, what's

08:00.200 --> 08:04.480
the anti-competitive behavior of that company, identify that the company is dominant in the

08:04.480 --> 08:08.600
market and then implement remedies say, okay, that was illegal.

08:08.600 --> 08:12.480
Then you have probably an appeal and then that appeal will go forever.

08:12.480 --> 08:14.160
And then finally you have your solution.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.720
And by that time, then you just gave up.

08:17.720 --> 08:24.760
Now with the DMA, actually enforcement is, it's actually really quick because as I was

08:24.760 --> 08:29.520
saying in the presentation, once you've been designated as a key keeper, all the obligations

08:29.520 --> 08:33.840
that we have in the map, these ones, they apply in six months.

08:33.840 --> 08:38.440
So you have six months to adapt your business and comply with all of them.

08:39.160 --> 08:43.280
Also another difference with competition law cases like these Microsoft cases is that

08:43.280 --> 08:46.560
there is no, there's no like exception.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.880
So for example, when it comes to competition law, you can say, well, I'm doing this because

08:49.880 --> 08:51.920
this is efficient for the market.

08:51.920 --> 08:57.280
And then you have a whole argumentation about how that was good for the market in the end.

08:57.280 --> 09:01.120
And that takes some time also to figure out, right?

09:01.120 --> 09:02.520
In the DMA, there are no exceptions.

09:02.520 --> 09:09.240
So what you have is like in some of these obligations, you have very minor targeted kind of safeguards,

09:09.240 --> 09:14.200
so to speak, where you can say, well, you know, I'm going, I have to, I'm the key keeper,

09:14.200 --> 09:16.560
I have to comply with this obligation.

09:16.560 --> 09:21.600
And what I can do is I can take, I can implement some measures to preserve integrity and security

09:21.600 --> 09:23.640
of for example, the device.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.960
But that doesn't mean that you don't have to comply with the obligation.

09:25.960 --> 09:30.160
That means that you still have to comply and you're allowed to implement just some proportionate

09:30.160 --> 09:35.480
justified measures to ensure that the device will keep that integrity.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.600
But that will be it.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.320
So with you coming back to your example about saying, well, what if the key keeper says,

09:40.320 --> 09:45.480
I'm not going to open that API because of, well, they need to really justify that on

09:45.480 --> 09:49.000
that, within that particular exception that we have there.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.560
But it's not really an exception because they still have to comply with the obligation.

09:53.560 --> 09:59.120
So there you can see, you know, a big difference with these anti-competition law cases that

09:59.160 --> 10:00.440
take ages.

10:00.440 --> 10:04.080
And you know, sometimes compliance is not as effective as we would like to.

10:04.080 --> 10:08.400
Now moving quickly then about, for example, your last question about competition law and

10:08.400 --> 10:13.920
the DMA, we have actually at the beginning of the DMA, we have some legal provisions

10:13.920 --> 10:16.480
saying how actually both interact.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.360
So for example, when it comes to the DMA, and this is an important aspect, the DMA is

10:20.360 --> 10:26.040
not like something that is just really rigid.

10:26.080 --> 10:33.080
We have some mechanisms to adapt the DMA, have more obligations or amend the obligations

10:33.200 --> 10:38.840
that we have is if the practice, for example, in the software development community changes

10:38.840 --> 10:42.400
and we identify more issues, we can include those.

10:42.400 --> 10:47.200
And one way of including those is, well, if we have been running an anti-trust case, a

10:47.200 --> 10:51.320
competition law case, and we have discovered that there are some things that would need

10:51.360 --> 10:56.840
to be in the DMA so that we can actually act quickly, then that's a way of the DMA informing

10:56.840 --> 10:59.160
from the competition law.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.880
So there's a lot of synergies between the two RAs.

11:01.880 --> 11:06.000
And then finally, very quickly, on the quality of use and messaging services, you're right.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.440
So one of the concerns would be, well, you know, what service is provided, is a service

11:10.440 --> 11:17.440
provided by Meta, you know, what about my Meta data going to the service of Meta, right?

11:18.440 --> 11:23.640
One important safeguard that Article 7 has is that users have an opt-in option.

11:23.640 --> 11:29.320
So if you, for example, are using, say, Signal, and Signal says suddenly, oh, we want to

11:29.320 --> 11:34.280
interweb with WhatsApp, then you're still, as I use it, you can say, well, but I don't.

11:34.280 --> 11:39.760
So then you can just opt out from that option and you can deactivate the interoperability

11:39.760 --> 11:41.240
option from there.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.840
And that's a way of calibrating that concern.

11:43.960 --> 11:48.040
In any case, if you think about the way that Article 7 is constructed and interoperability

11:48.040 --> 11:54.040
for messaging services is constructed, it's a request from the alternative messaging services.

11:54.040 --> 11:59.400
So in this case, it would be Signal that has to evaluate, okay, this is the privacy that

11:59.400 --> 12:01.640
I value for my users.

12:01.640 --> 12:07.320
And you know, it's a business decision that I go to WhatsApp or to Meta and request interoperability.

12:07.320 --> 12:12.720
Now if we are a very privacy-conscious service, maybe it's not in your interest to do that.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.640
So in any case, privacy has to be preserved.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.320
That's also in the law.

12:18.320 --> 12:22.800
And still users, ultimately, you can choose and say, well, I'm still in Signal, for example,

12:22.800 --> 12:25.960
and I don't want to have anything to do with WhatsApp.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.120
Thank you very much.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.120
Questions?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.120
Yeah.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.560
I remember you raising your hand from the very beginning.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.560
I'll come to you too, don't worry.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.280
Here you are.

12:38.280 --> 12:47.240
I had a question regarding the long fight for getting refunded from Microsoft Windows.

12:47.240 --> 12:55.960
So when you buy a laptop at the store, you can only find laptops with Microsoft Windows.

12:55.960 --> 13:00.000
And when you refuse a license, you basically cannot get refunded.

13:00.000 --> 13:07.200
That's a very long demand from the open source community that for software that you don't

13:07.200 --> 13:11.120
use, you should be refunded.

13:11.120 --> 13:17.400
So there is the monopoly of Microsoft's still Windows on laptops.

13:17.400 --> 13:22.960
And I don't see how the side loading of apps is going to help to tackle that problem.

13:22.960 --> 13:29.720
I think there was a missed opportunity in the DMA to say instead of allowing the user

13:29.720 --> 13:38.480
to have this right to sideload apps, we should also have the freedom to load anything we

13:38.480 --> 13:43.200
want, including alternative Linux distributions.

13:43.200 --> 13:48.880
At the moment, I see that this sideloading apps is only tackling the problem of the user

13:48.880 --> 13:53.640
space, the applications, but not the operating system.

13:53.640 --> 13:59.200
So it will help, but I don't think it's enough because you're also strengthening, but by

13:59.800 --> 14:05.000
doing apps for those platforms, you're also strengthening those platforms.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.840
You're strengthening this oligopoly by doing that.

14:09.840 --> 14:17.840
And also the sideloading apps, I was expecting that the OS manufacturers would put a lot of

14:17.840 --> 14:24.280
restrictions using any kind of excuses to not have full access to the hardware, try to

14:24.360 --> 14:32.360
obfuscate certain APIs, don't provide documentation on how the hardware works and so on.

14:32.360 --> 14:38.360
And it's the first step, but I don't think it's enough.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.640
I don't know if you want to answer to this because it was as much as a comment, as a

14:41.640 --> 14:42.640
question.

14:42.640 --> 14:43.640
Yes, several questions?

14:43.640 --> 14:46.640
Yeah, all right, let's get several questions then.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.640
No?

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
You were asking for the whiteboard.

14:51.000 --> 14:55.000
I think two, so one, two, and then a third one.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.680
Craig Russell, and I'm a software developer.

15:00.680 --> 15:10.680
It seems that if you're going to allow developers to access these services, then instead of making

15:10.680 --> 15:16.800
them petition the gatekeeper and go through a list of, I don't know, how many thousand

15:16.840 --> 15:24.040
applications they're going to process and then say, well, it'll be sometime in 2036 before

15:24.040 --> 15:28.160
we get to the ten thousandth application.

15:28.160 --> 15:36.160
Why shouldn't you require the interoperability APIs to be open source and put it in the public

15:37.400 --> 15:44.400
domain, then there's no argument about who can use it because everybody can use it,

15:44.480 --> 15:47.480
whether you're open source or commercial.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.640
Thank you very much.

15:50.640 --> 15:53.640
That's my favorite question so far.

15:53.640 --> 15:58.640
Thanks very much.

15:58.640 --> 16:03.920
I've got a question actually back to the application specific.

16:03.920 --> 16:08.000
Some of us will have seen what Apple have published and what their proposal is, and it's very

16:08.000 --> 16:11.960
obvious from their proposal that essentially every time there's a safeguard, every time

16:12.000 --> 16:16.520
there's anything that could lower the amount of things they have to do, anything that could

16:16.520 --> 16:20.280
help them restrict the amount of freedom users have, they're exploiting it and they're going

16:20.280 --> 16:21.640
to keep exploiting it.

16:21.640 --> 16:28.320
My question really is how is the commission going to manage to make sure that basically

16:28.320 --> 16:31.760
Apple dragging their heels isn't going to stop this from happening because right now

16:31.760 --> 16:36.120
what it seems like is they're going to charge developers in a way even if they're not using

16:36.120 --> 16:39.200
Apple services and so on and so forth.

16:39.240 --> 16:41.920
How are the commission going to stop Apple from dragging their heels because clearly

16:41.920 --> 16:45.920
they're very much willing to take this to the courts.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.960
All right so I'll leave you answering the questions.

16:52.960 --> 16:56.960
If anyone has a question for Lere, if not I will ask the next one.

16:56.960 --> 16:57.960
Here you are.

16:57.960 --> 17:03.960
Yeah, no actually I can tackle the, well in a way the way I see them, the three questions

17:04.040 --> 17:07.240
I cannot relate it.

17:07.240 --> 17:09.520
I see the relationship in this way.

17:09.520 --> 17:13.320
So for example the first two questions, two minutes, okay.

17:13.320 --> 17:19.680
Now the first two questions, I think so for example about refunding licenses and then

17:19.680 --> 17:25.600
also why is Apple doing this about having the request and not really just giving all

17:25.600 --> 17:28.440
the APIs open.

17:28.440 --> 17:31.040
Well this is actually the type of feedback that we are looking for.

17:31.120 --> 17:36.040
This is the type of feedback that we need from stakeholders because in a way one of

17:36.040 --> 17:41.640
the things of the DMA is that this is also an important aspect is that gatekeepers once

17:41.640 --> 17:45.600
they've been designated they have to comply with this within six months and it's for them,

17:45.600 --> 17:51.600
the burden is on them so they have to come to us and put on the table solutions to comply

17:51.600 --> 17:55.720
with this and they have to explain well we're going to comply with the vertical interpretable

17:55.720 --> 17:59.840
ligation in this way and then it's for the commission and this I can go to the third

17:59.840 --> 18:04.200
question, for the commission to evaluate if whatever they are doing is actually within

18:04.200 --> 18:05.320
the law.

18:05.320 --> 18:10.520
So for example when it comes to giving the open, the API, sorry, giving the APIs directly

18:10.520 --> 18:16.400
open instead of having like a process request that can look more than some then it would

18:16.400 --> 18:21.720
be asked to evaluate if that compliance solution that they are putting on the table is actually

18:21.720 --> 18:25.920
compliant with the law and then we will see with all the procedural tools that we have

18:25.920 --> 18:31.640
and we can actually have a case in this case against Apple and then this leads me to the

18:31.640 --> 18:33.680
third question which is what can we do?

18:33.680 --> 18:39.960
Well the DMA gives the commission a lot of powers to investigate and enforce all the

18:39.960 --> 18:43.800
obligations not only vertical interpretable but all of them so for example one option

18:43.800 --> 18:49.760
would be to, the commission can have specification decisions, we can tell Apple and say well

18:49.760 --> 18:55.600
you have been proposing this, this doesn't work, you have to comply with this specific

18:55.600 --> 18:59.400
solution that we are putting on the table now and that's something that in competition

18:59.400 --> 19:03.080
law for example cases that doesn't really exist, competition law cases you have a remedy

19:03.080 --> 19:06.720
in the case and that would be it but as here we can go to Apple and we can say in this

19:06.720 --> 19:10.560
case, we can say well this is our specification decision, this is how you should comply with

19:10.560 --> 19:16.640
this article and then we can also open infringement procedures that are actually pretty quick

19:16.640 --> 19:21.240
and in those non infringement decisions we can say well you have not complied with this

19:21.240 --> 19:26.640
obligation and here's your fine, this is how you should comply with that and then if

19:26.640 --> 19:33.920
they still don't comply with that we can impose daily fines on a daily basis and then if they

19:33.920 --> 19:38.320
get three strikes like three non-compliance decisions that would be systematic non-compliance

19:38.320 --> 19:43.640
and there the commission has a lot of powers even to impose structural measures.

19:43.640 --> 19:48.040
Thank you very much, then I will get two more questions, there is one from each one from

19:48.040 --> 19:53.760
each and then after that anyway we have the workshop session as well where everybody can

19:53.760 --> 19:57.920
ask questions and make comments directly on the tables but I'll let Amandine explain this.

19:57.920 --> 20:02.600
The question I have for Leire in the meantime is that open specification we just mentioned

20:02.600 --> 20:05.760
and you mentioned open specifications as well and it seems that you are trying to achieve

20:05.760 --> 20:09.800
interoperability with your open specifications as well so I'm wondering is there some sort

20:09.800 --> 20:13.680
of bridge between the two regulations in sense that the commission could be leveraging an

20:13.680 --> 20:18.800
open specification developed in another through another piece of legislation in order to enforce

20:18.800 --> 20:24.640
interoperability requirements to gatekeepers for instance one day and something I wonder

20:24.640 --> 20:29.920
whether or not you see also something similar but I shut up and I'll let Haas give the question.

20:29.920 --> 20:37.320
Are you a mind reader? So this was a question from online, so I'm just a messenger for interoperability

20:37.320 --> 20:41.440
the data act mentions harmonized European standards is there anything in preparation?

20:42.440 --> 20:48.120
Thank you, thank you indeed I am a mind reader and the question was that way.

20:48.120 --> 20:59.240
Thank you, my question is about the cloud interoperability is it only about the data or

20:59.240 --> 21:05.760
it's also about the workloads and if yes on what level is it on like yes.

21:05.760 --> 21:12.720
All right so I give you the mic later and Alex if you want to add something because I think

21:12.720 --> 21:15.720
it's connected to what you do as well and then after that we'll have to wrap up.

21:15.720 --> 21:23.280
Okay so the first one with respect to the open specifications and the relationship with the

21:23.280 --> 21:30.320
data markets act I think that somehow they are related but for the time being as far as I know

21:30.320 --> 21:35.240
in the data markets act there are no gate keep there are no cloud service providers named as

21:35.240 --> 21:44.520
gatekeepers. So okay okay sorry sorry so that currently in the data markets act there is no

21:44.520 --> 21:51.040
gatekeepers there's no cloud service providers named as gatekeepers but eventually the open

21:51.040 --> 21:56.960
specifications for interoperability should also apply in that respect. With respect to the question

21:57.000 --> 22:02.560
online I think everybody answered it so this now a process in which we're actually

22:02.560 --> 22:09.960
analyzing the existing standards and if there aren't any on interoperability we will define them

22:09.960 --> 22:17.160
there's going to be a study allowance on that and what was the last one? The last question?

22:17.160 --> 22:24.800
Oh yeah the data the data and the workloads so in principle in principle the data act is for data

22:25.680 --> 22:31.000
at infrastructure level and also at platform and software as a service level but not so much

22:31.000 --> 22:38.440
for workloads so but that's something to think about thank you. Okay so I think we're gonna wrap

22:38.440 --> 22:42.080
up the panel but then we're gonna open the workshop when you're gonna be able to be more

22:42.080 --> 22:48.120
interactive and then I will finish your question to the audience as well. Alex mentioned the fact

22:48.120 --> 22:54.360
that now specification has to be open maybe they will have to require the user specification and

22:54.400 --> 23:01.800
you ask a question very clearly why not open sources so I wonder if any of you see anything that

23:01.800 --> 23:09.080
could stop a regulator to say no no you have to use that specification and you have to open source

23:09.080 --> 23:13.720
those specific APIs and open standards I just wonder because that's one of the question that is on

23:13.720 --> 23:20.000
the table of Amandine but I will let Amandine and give you a round of applause for the panelists.

23:25.120 --> 23:29.760
And I will let Amandine give you the details about how the workshop will be going where you can

23:29.760 --> 23:33.280
actually give your inputs on how to enforce the two different pieces of legislation.
