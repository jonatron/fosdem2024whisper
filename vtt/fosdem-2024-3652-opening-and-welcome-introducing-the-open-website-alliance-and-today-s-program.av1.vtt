WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.520
So let's do this just a tiny bit differently.

00:10.520 --> 00:22.320
Now kicking off the day with sound, my name is Jam, and if you have questions or comments

00:22.320 --> 00:27.560
about the sessions and so on, I'm going to try and facilitate helping the speakers, getting

00:27.560 --> 00:33.920
the stuff done during the day in this room, and presumably when we have questions I'll

00:33.920 --> 00:35.560
be able to run over with the microphone.

00:35.560 --> 00:41.600
We only have one microphone though, and we are being streamed, so to be nice of us to

00:41.600 --> 00:45.800
speak into the microphone, or if someone's so enthusiastic that they're shouting out

00:45.800 --> 00:52.280
their questions, then if you're the speaker, repeat the question into the microphone.

00:52.280 --> 00:59.120
So today's dev room at FASEM 2024 is on the occasion of the launch of the Open Website

00:59.120 --> 01:06.880
Alliance, which was created by leadership level conversations between four open source

01:06.880 --> 01:12.960
content management systems, WordPress, Drupal, and Type 03, and we have representatives from

01:12.960 --> 01:18.800
three of those organizations with us today to celebrate that launch.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.000
Stop the champagne.

01:21.000 --> 01:25.800
Welcome to the stage.

01:25.800 --> 01:31.680
That was nice when you get to practice.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.800
So here, you hold that.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
This is not working.

01:35.800 --> 01:40.800
This is going to be the theme of the day.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.360
I have no confidence.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.800
All right, I'm just going to hold this.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.080
It's all good.

01:48.080 --> 01:57.000
We have one microphone, so passing a lapel mic around is a good exercise in dexterity.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.480
My name is Crystal Deonisopoulos.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.080
I am the president of Open Source Matters, which is the organization that supports the

02:02.080 --> 02:09.120
JUMLA project, and we are very, very excited to help co-found the Open Website Alliance.

02:09.120 --> 02:17.480
I think it's going to be an incredible opportunity for our CMSs to grow and learn together and

02:17.480 --> 02:23.440
share expertise and really support each other, because as we'll be talking about, we have

02:23.440 --> 02:26.000
so much in common.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.800
We have a charter, which we'll put back on the screen for people who missed it.

02:31.800 --> 02:37.000
You can take a look at what we've agreed to, which is, I think it's pretty cool.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.560
So thank you.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.120
Hi, I'm Matias Bortlesnik.

02:41.120 --> 02:47.080
I am a board member of the Type 3 Association, banner over there.

02:47.080 --> 02:52.840
And yeah, we didn't fit all of them together, but we are good friends anyway.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.840
Yes.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.680
My name is Matias.

02:56.680 --> 03:02.920
But yeah, we came together in the Open Website Alliance.

03:02.920 --> 03:09.440
First we met around discussing what to do about the Cyber Resilience Act in the European

03:09.440 --> 03:11.040
Union.

03:11.040 --> 03:15.120
And we just continued and we created this amazing charter.

03:15.120 --> 03:22.440
And what I want to say as well is that any other free and open source CMSs who align

03:22.440 --> 03:30.040
with the charter are very welcome to apply and can contact any of our projects and will

03:30.040 --> 03:35.800
lead them into bliss.

03:35.800 --> 03:39.400
And my name's Owen Landsbury from the Drupal Association.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.040
I volunteer on the board there.

03:42.040 --> 03:47.160
And we were very excited to be invited to join the Open Website Alliance to really

03:47.160 --> 03:52.920
further the strength of open source and to have a consistent message that we can tell

03:52.920 --> 03:54.840
the world.

03:54.840 --> 04:03.520
Also WordPress was supposed to be here, but got sick.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.320
WordPress was sick today.

04:05.320 --> 04:09.320
And send their apologies.

04:10.240 --> 04:14.880
So kicking off straight into the program of the day, thank you very much.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.080
Congratulations.

04:16.080 --> 04:26.960
So that's what the schedule for the day looks like today.

04:26.960 --> 04:31.600
It's pretty interesting and exciting.

04:31.600 --> 04:32.600
My name is Jam.

04:32.600 --> 04:38.200
I said that I'll be running the room today and sharing the mic with Matias in the first

04:38.200 --> 04:41.520
session.

04:41.520 --> 04:47.680
And we have people representing a number of different communities and entities that interact

04:47.680 --> 04:50.120
with multiple communities as well.

04:50.120 --> 04:52.360
So I'm really, really happy to be here.

04:52.360 --> 04:59.680
This feels like an incredibly important step in living open source values.
