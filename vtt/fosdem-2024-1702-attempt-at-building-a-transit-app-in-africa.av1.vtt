00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Thank you.

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
So, hello.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
So, hello.

00:21.000 --> 00:29.000
I'm Tarek Twati, so I'm a software engineer based in Nantes, France, in northwestern France.

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
I'm a JavaScript developer and passionate about containers and functional programming,

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
and also a railway and transit enthusiast.

00:41.000 --> 00:50.000
Today I'm going to talk about an idea I got in the late 2017.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
I was a foreign student in Nantes, and to navigate through the city,

00:57.000 --> 01:06.000
I used a transit app for a local transit app provided by the provider.

01:06.000 --> 01:13.000
So, the app helped me get autonomous in navigating through the city.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.000
I was able to get everywhere I want and was fully autonomous.

01:19.000 --> 01:27.000
I was remembering back in Tunisia, where I could travel.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
It was a bit more complicated.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
Back to Tunisia, so in a small country in North Africa.

01:37.000 --> 01:48.000
It's a country which is car-centric, so not, let's say, transit-friendly.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.000
I was thinking about foreign people, how can they travel like I was traveling in Nantes?

01:56.000 --> 02:05.000
How can they travel in a car-centric city where there's no app or service like I was enjoying out there?

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
So, I looked on the internet, there's no solution, nothing was available,

02:11.000 --> 02:17.000
whether on Google, Google Maps, or OpenStreetMaps, or any other thing.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
So, the idea came along to build something like that.

02:22.000 --> 02:30.000
So, to build an app, we first need data and to be able to share to other people.

02:30.000 --> 02:39.000
So, to achieve some data, there was no, maybe, data platform that maybe the provider,

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
maybe able to use it and extract some data.

02:44.000 --> 02:53.000
There was nothing. So, the only thing available was to go see the provider, the transit provider,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
and see with them what was possible.

02:56.000 --> 03:05.000
So, the transit provider was friendly and gave me some data set, let's say,

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
or some timetable that was a bit restrictive.

03:09.000 --> 03:17.000
The timetable was from point A to point B, so a terminus to a terminus.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
And for stations, it was more tricky.

03:21.000 --> 03:32.000
There was no number of stations on the line, there was no departure from terminus to the next station,

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
there was only from terminus to terminus.

03:35.000 --> 03:47.000
So, I asked the provider about these informations and what he replied to me that there was a guy who only know these stations.

03:47.000 --> 03:59.000
So, we do own the data from point A to the point B, but what is going on on the line, we don't know.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.000
There's one guy who knows, but no idea who took this guy.

04:05.000 --> 04:17.000
But the idea was to map the stations with people.

04:17.000 --> 04:25.000
So, what I came along, so it was to take the bus, take the lines I already got data on,

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
and map each stations. And it was also more trickier.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
So, as the bus doesn't stop at stations, the bus can stop on demand.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
So, you may take the bus and someone asked to stop, it's not a station.

04:42.000 --> 04:50.000
And trickier too, there was no station names, so I came to give names to stations.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
So, mostly building a transit network.

04:56.000 --> 05:04.000
As we don't have stations, we don't have time departure on each station.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
So, I came along to estimate departure.

05:08.000 --> 05:18.000
So, I had to take several times at several periods the same line to have an average between traffic, no traffic,

05:18.000 --> 05:24.000
and have an estimation on each station on both directions.

05:24.000 --> 05:33.000
It was too exhausting. And ended up having a massive spreadsheet with all this data,

05:33.000 --> 05:40.000
and turn it to a GTFS model. I don't know if there's people who know the GTFS.

05:40.000 --> 05:50.000
It's standard around transportation, which is able to, which is kind of tricky,

05:50.000 --> 06:00.000
but it's mostly CSVs with bad, bad format, but it's mostly standard that able to exchange transit information.

06:01.000 --> 06:09.000
So, I was able to get around all this with the help of all the bus drivers.

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
And that's it.

06:12.000 --> 06:21.000
So, I now have some data on some lines. I made maybe two months to build this data set.

06:21.000 --> 06:28.000
And now what I made later on is to build a web app made in React, based on Google Maps,

06:28.000 --> 06:38.000
and to expose mostly the lines and all the station tracks drawn on the canvas.

06:38.000 --> 06:44.000
And also to build a chatbot for users where they are able to send their location

06:44.000 --> 06:48.000
and get nearby stations and nearby departures.

06:51.000 --> 06:58.000
So, why is this an attempt and not a success?

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
First thing, that the service was not too attractive.

07:03.000 --> 07:14.000
Though I didn't communicate on it. There was not maybe marketing or no communication.

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
Maybe the lines were also not too attractive.

07:18.000 --> 07:29.000
So, the company first gave me three lines to start with, and the three lines were a bit not too attractive.

07:29.000 --> 07:41.000
And also the issue I had, I attempted to calculate to have an average departure on each station,

07:41.000 --> 07:48.000
but the average wasn't too precise enough.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
And used with the GTFS, we have the standards, we have validators to validate that data is correct,

07:57.000 --> 08:05.000
and not too incoherent, but we still had incoherent departures.

08:05.000 --> 08:12.000
So, next step from this project, I did it in 2017.

08:12.000 --> 08:20.000
I wanted to get it back and update the GTFS data I had and upload them on OpenStreetMap,

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
so to make them accessible to everyone, and allow other people to contribute to this data set,

08:27.000 --> 08:32.000
or build what I have used as data sets.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.000
And that's it.

08:41.000 --> 08:46.000
Also, to add something, if there's people interested in this project,

08:46.000 --> 08:51.000
let me know, we can maybe create a metric channel to contribute to.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Thank you.
