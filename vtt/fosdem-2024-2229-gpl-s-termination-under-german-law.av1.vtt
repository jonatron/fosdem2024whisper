00:00.000 --> 00:15.480
Let's welcome our next speaker, Sebastian Steck.

00:15.480 --> 00:22.280
So hello, also from me a warm welcome to the Legal and Policy Issue Staff Room.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.600
Let's start right away.

00:24.600 --> 00:30.520
Today I would like to talk about GPL's termination from the point of view of German law.

00:30.520 --> 00:34.120
You might first wonder what do I mean by termination?

00:34.120 --> 00:43.240
So if someone, the licensee violates the GPL, there are some consequences for the licensee

00:43.240 --> 00:49.760
which happens automatically and there are other consequences which need some more manual

00:49.760 --> 00:52.320
action by the copyright holder.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.720
I will frame this as manual termination.

00:55.720 --> 01:01.560
So I would, in this talk, call both mechanisms termination.

01:01.560 --> 01:06.920
So even though most strictly you could say only the manual termination is really termination

01:06.920 --> 01:14.840
and the automatic part is something else like conditions or scope of copyright permissions

01:14.840 --> 01:17.520
or something like that.

01:17.520 --> 01:22.720
And in German law, as you might already know, we have a lot of precedents.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.560
Thanks for Ralf Welte and Thier Jäger.

01:25.560 --> 01:31.520
And in my opinion, the best summary is this relatively recent decision of the upper district

01:31.520 --> 01:36.880
court of Ham and they say, according to the well anonymous opinion in case law and the

01:36.880 --> 01:42.400
at least predominant opinion in the literature, the distribution of software license under

01:42.400 --> 01:47.080
the new general public license in breach of the license conditions constitutes a copyright

01:47.080 --> 01:49.080
infringement.

01:49.080 --> 01:56.880
So the assances here, if someone violates the GPL, the copyright holder has the remedies

01:56.880 --> 02:00.520
for copyright infringement at hand.

02:00.520 --> 02:06.800
And the predominant remedy used in copy left enforcement is here, of course, to get an

02:06.800 --> 02:07.800
injunction.

02:07.800 --> 02:14.000
So the copyright holder could get an injunction that the defendant may not distribute.

02:14.000 --> 02:19.600
The copyright holder's work or else if the licensee should dare to do it any way, the

02:19.600 --> 02:22.800
licensee will be fined or jailed.

02:22.800 --> 02:33.600
So but Harald Welte did not ask for a plain injunction about any distribution.

02:33.600 --> 02:40.160
So it was a very clever piece of lawyering in my opinion of Thier Jäger to say, well,

02:40.160 --> 02:45.400
we had a phrase unless accompanied with the materials that GPL required.

02:45.400 --> 02:51.600
So to be more precise, they had spelled out what the materials that GPL requires are exactly

02:51.600 --> 02:52.600
R.

02:52.600 --> 02:58.480
So and why did they do that?

02:58.480 --> 03:05.680
You could easily imagine to ask the court to get an injunction against distribution

03:05.680 --> 03:07.800
in any matter.

03:07.800 --> 03:17.360
So and the point here is the main defense of a defendant of a copyright injunction is

03:17.360 --> 03:19.440
say, well, but I have a license.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.440
You can't get a license.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.000
Forbidding me behavior, the license allows me to do.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.280
And this leads right to the point, what is this future distributions?

03:30.280 --> 03:39.000
The due past violations caused the licensee to lose their right to make future distributions

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
and distributions of course have to be compliant on their own.

03:42.000 --> 03:46.440
So in particular, a company with the materials that GPL required.

03:46.440 --> 03:54.200
So up to my knowledge, no court had ever to decide whether the second alternative is actually

03:54.200 --> 03:56.520
viable and allowed.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.720
But there was somehow a backdoor or detour how this question slipped into some of the

04:01.720 --> 04:11.520
lawsuits Harald Wertefeld and it was basically the licensee argued, well, this termination

04:11.520 --> 04:13.960
clause is so strict that's unfair.

04:13.960 --> 04:19.200
It's an unfair term of adhesion and it should thus be regarded as void.

04:19.200 --> 04:22.440
So there would be no termination at all.

04:22.440 --> 04:27.480
So and the courts rejected the argument, this for example is from the ruling of the

04:27.480 --> 04:32.080
very first court ruling on the GPL in Germany.

04:32.080 --> 04:39.160
And they said the violator can reacquire the rights by acceptance of and obeying the conditions.

04:39.160 --> 04:50.960
So the courts had the opinion that even a past violator could make lawful copies in

04:50.960 --> 04:55.040
the future by obeying the GPL in the future.

04:55.040 --> 05:01.120
So it would not have been viable to try to get an injunction in the second way.

05:01.120 --> 05:07.040
Nonetheless, in my opinion, but as I already said, this is not yet tested in court, it

05:07.040 --> 05:15.920
is possible to get an injunction of the second nature if you take the copyright holder takes

05:15.920 --> 05:18.720
the right preparatory steps.

05:18.720 --> 05:26.000
So but you might first ask is it really reasonable to try to go that route or should we just

05:26.000 --> 05:29.040
stick with the first alternative.

05:29.040 --> 05:37.640
And the problem or the potential problem here is you may not fit any GPL violation into

05:37.640 --> 05:40.960
unless accompanied with the materials that GPL require.

05:40.960 --> 05:48.040
So you may imagine that I want to be violator says, well, our schemas, we put all the documents

05:48.040 --> 05:54.560
we need together with the binary, the license tax, the warranty disclaimer and a perfect

05:54.560 --> 05:55.880
offer for source.

05:55.880 --> 06:01.440
But it's only perfect to the letter if someone later asked, they just ignore them.

06:01.440 --> 06:12.280
So it may be the case that such conduct cannot be bear it by an injunction and following

06:12.280 --> 06:14.680
the first alternative.

06:14.680 --> 06:21.160
So I would argue in the following what could a copyright holder do to have the second

06:21.160 --> 06:22.800
option available.

06:22.800 --> 06:27.360
And then at the end of the day, at least, with the first law students, you would have

06:27.360 --> 06:36.920
you would go both routes in the alternative and then see what the courts actually say.

06:36.920 --> 06:41.640
So let's look back at section four of the GPL version two.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.200
That's the so-called termination clause.

06:44.200 --> 06:53.640
Here we see the second sentence, which basically says that any attempt to make use of the licensed

06:53.640 --> 07:00.480
work, which is against the license, will automatically terminates the rights of under

07:00.480 --> 07:02.440
this license.

07:02.440 --> 07:09.000
So the FSF had already come to the conclusion that if you read this word by word in a very

07:09.000 --> 07:16.760
harsh way, you could say, well, that means once more mistakes and all your rights are

07:16.760 --> 07:17.760
gone.

07:17.760 --> 07:25.400
So since they realized that that is impractical, in practice, they made another termination

07:25.400 --> 07:30.000
clause in GPL version three, which is basically a manual termination.

07:30.000 --> 07:35.640
So to summarize that under GPL version three, the copyright holder has to first send a warning

07:35.640 --> 07:41.800
letter and then wait some time and then they can send basically the termination notice,

07:41.800 --> 07:46.480
even though the GPL version three does not use these words, but I would frame it using

07:46.480 --> 07:48.280
these words.

07:48.280 --> 07:58.440
So by the conclusion that such terms would be impractical and even unjust was also made

07:58.440 --> 08:00.360
by the German legislator.

08:00.360 --> 08:06.080
And for this reason, they introduced this section into the civil code, which basically

08:06.080 --> 08:12.520
says if there should be a contract which says that if one party violates the contract, they

08:12.520 --> 08:21.640
lose all their rights, such provision should be instead read as a right to rescind in the

08:21.640 --> 08:27.400
event that a party should violate the contract.

08:27.400 --> 08:35.520
So we have now informed us what does the rescission actually or more precisely mean under German

08:35.520 --> 08:36.920
law.

08:36.920 --> 08:50.920
And rescission in layman's terms means the rescinding party sends a rescission notice

08:50.920 --> 08:54.800
and then the contract has to be unwinding.

08:54.800 --> 09:01.120
So more precisely here, the civil code says that the performances received must be returned

09:01.120 --> 09:05.960
and the benefits derived must be surrendered in the event of a rescission.

09:05.960 --> 09:11.240
And to get really the essence of what does this mean, we will have to look into a specialty

09:11.240 --> 09:15.720
of German law and that's first the so-called separation principle.

09:15.720 --> 09:20.800
So the separation principle says that every, every day's transaction, like for example,

09:20.800 --> 09:25.920
a regular contract of sale splits itself up into multiple contracts.

09:25.920 --> 09:31.040
You have first the contract of obligation which solely creates the obligations.

09:31.040 --> 09:36.360
For example, in the contract of sale, it only creates the obligation on the seller to deliver

09:36.360 --> 09:40.720
the goods and on the buyer to pay the money and take the goods.

09:40.720 --> 09:46.200
And then to actually transfer the title when the goods are transferred, you have to enter

09:46.200 --> 09:49.960
into a second contract, a so-called disposition contract.

09:49.960 --> 09:54.400
And you may guess it, to transfer the money you need a third contract, another disposition

09:54.400 --> 09:57.120
contract usually.

09:57.120 --> 10:02.040
So and the consequence of the separation principle is the so-called abstraction principle which

10:02.040 --> 10:09.480
says if an obligation or the complete obligating contract gets void, this does not automatically

10:09.480 --> 10:14.200
void the disposing contracts, meaning that the goods are not transferred automatically

10:14.200 --> 10:17.960
back, the money is not transferred automatically back, the rights are not transferred automatically

10:17.960 --> 10:22.200
back, the title is not transferred automatically back and so on.

10:22.200 --> 10:29.320
So in a contract of sale, this means that they have to take, the buyer and the seller

10:29.320 --> 10:39.560
have to take extra steps to actually transfer the rights, the titles back.

10:39.560 --> 10:49.200
So translated to the GPL, this would mean if the copyright holder resents the GPL,

10:49.200 --> 10:56.880
this would only turn the obligating contract into a new contract requiring those parties

10:56.880 --> 11:00.200
to give back what they had previously received.

11:00.200 --> 11:05.800
But strictly formally speaking, the rights still stay where they are, they only have to

11:05.800 --> 11:07.000
be given back.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.360
This may be a technical formality, I would argue it basically is, we will see later how

11:13.360 --> 11:14.880
you can handle that.

11:14.880 --> 11:25.320
But I think you should be aware that the rights stay first where they are.

11:25.320 --> 11:35.480
So let us now look a little bit more into detail what recession means or what do you

11:35.480 --> 11:36.960
have to do for a recession.

11:36.960 --> 11:44.080
So you may wonder what is the warning I have told right at the beginning and this is the

11:44.080 --> 11:49.520
section closest to giving us an answer, do you need to sign the warning letter before

11:49.520 --> 11:52.040
we can do a recession notice.

11:52.040 --> 11:57.960
And this section is more precisely on statutory or decision rights.

11:57.960 --> 12:03.600
So what we have talked before was contractual recession rights, read into the determination

12:03.600 --> 12:04.920
clause.

12:04.920 --> 12:13.040
So this section does not apply directly but nonetheless in my opinion this emphasised the

12:13.040 --> 12:18.800
underlying principle that you should send a warning notice or you must send a warning

12:18.800 --> 12:21.880
notice very unreasonable and fair and so on.

12:21.880 --> 12:32.240
So I would just recommend send a warning notice and then you are on the safe side.

12:32.640 --> 12:41.440
To summarize what we have seen up to now, there is at least another German law, no automatic

12:41.440 --> 12:43.280
termination of the GPL.

12:43.280 --> 12:51.160
That means current or past violations do not void automatically future distribution rights,

12:51.160 --> 12:54.760
of course future distribution which is compliant.

12:54.760 --> 13:01.960
But nonetheless a violation is still a copyright infringement because the permissions are only

13:01.960 --> 13:06.520
granted under conditions that the GPL is abate.

13:06.520 --> 13:15.440
In US terms you would say there is a scope of the license and if the licensee acts outside

13:15.440 --> 13:20.960
of the scope you can get an injunction saying no you may not act outside of the scope, you

13:20.960 --> 13:24.120
may not violate the conditions.

13:24.120 --> 13:30.640
So if you have a case as a copyright holder, if you see a device for example which is violating

13:30.640 --> 13:36.560
and you can say that there is a violating from just opening the box and see what is in

13:36.560 --> 13:42.200
there, you have a clear violation, I would recommend you strongly to go that route if

13:42.200 --> 13:49.720
it is well paved, there is lots of precedent and I would add one remark here, you can get

13:49.720 --> 13:52.440
a preliminary injunction in such cases.

13:52.440 --> 13:58.440
A preliminary injunctions are very favourable for the copyright holder under German law,

13:58.440 --> 14:07.400
for example they do not have to provide a deposit and the only drawback of a preliminary

14:07.400 --> 14:14.560
injunction is one that you have to be quick and be sure that it will prevail because else

14:14.560 --> 14:16.440
you would owe damages.

14:16.440 --> 14:25.480
So if you have a clear violation I would recommend go to the lawyer right away and then the lawyer

14:25.480 --> 14:31.960
will send a warning letter giving the violator one or two weeks to solve the problem and

14:31.960 --> 14:37.520
if the problem is not solved go to the court and ask for an injunction because the court

14:37.520 --> 14:42.560
will reject the preliminary injunction if you have waited too long and that is if you

14:42.560 --> 14:49.480
have waited more than roughly a month from knowing the violation.

14:49.480 --> 14:55.280
So and I may add here this is what Harold Welter did at least what he later did he also

14:55.280 --> 15:04.920
wrote that when he wrote on his own to violators he was just ignored so it was basically it

15:04.920 --> 15:12.400
was not only a waste of time and his own resources but it also would have written of getting a

15:12.400 --> 15:19.080
preliminary injunction so I was strongly argued there is no point to be that friendly in a

15:19.080 --> 15:26.480
clear case to say well we sent a warning without lawyer first so that you don't have to pay

15:26.480 --> 15:29.920
the lawyer for writing the warning.

15:29.920 --> 15:36.720
So but on the other hand there may cases well the copyright holder has to manually terminate

15:36.720 --> 15:48.400
the GPL and it's not so the scholars do not all agree whether this theory what I've presented

15:48.400 --> 15:54.560
is actually the right theory some others say well you have to do something which we could

15:54.560 --> 16:02.400
translate as cancellation or termination so but in the end you should set a deadline for

16:02.400 --> 16:08.840
cure in any way so send a warning in any way so no matter what legal theory actually would

16:08.840 --> 16:14.800
prevail you should send a warning and just say here is the warning if you don't fix the

16:14.800 --> 16:24.200
problem we will take further measures so and then if the problem is not solved the copyright

16:24.200 --> 16:30.880
holder can send in this case a decision notice it may be a cancellation notice or whatever

16:30.880 --> 16:37.840
so and here is one more important detail I wrote here partly a decision notice so you

16:37.840 --> 16:43.800
may have wondered what happens was the past distribution if the copyright holder resents

16:43.800 --> 16:52.200
the license have they be somehow unwinding and even though it's rarely mentioned in the

16:52.200 --> 16:58.600
civil code it's clear amongst scholars that you can have a partly decision if that's reasonable

16:58.600 --> 17:04.460
for example with the GPL you can say the copyright holder can say I resent for all your future

17:04.460 --> 17:09.680
permissions so that you can meaningfully give me these permissions back and I let the contract

17:09.800 --> 17:15.240
as is the GPL as is for all past distributions so if there were for example an obligation to

17:15.240 --> 17:23.480
provide source code this obligation would still be intact so and if you follow other

17:23.480 --> 17:28.360
theories like you need a cancellation you then have to send a cancellation notice or whatever

17:28.360 --> 17:36.160
so I think it would be relatively easy to formulate it well enough that you can fit the

17:36.160 --> 17:42.400
notice now your rights are terminated into any legal framework which might apply so and if

17:42.400 --> 17:49.920
rescission is the right framework you have then demand the permissions back before you can get

17:49.920 --> 17:56.520
an instruction not to use this granted back permissions but at the latest when you're at

17:56.520 --> 18:03.240
this step you should really get a lawyer so and then the lawyer will just write into to

18:03.280 --> 18:09.720
complain a we want to have an injunction on the conditions and if that doesn't work you want to

18:09.720 --> 18:15.880
have in the alternative our rights back if they needed to be given back first and then we want

18:15.880 --> 18:26.000
also an injunction against any distribution so that's basically what I would say a copyright

18:26.120 --> 18:36.040
you're doing such situations so before we come to questions let me make two more remarks first

18:36.040 --> 18:42.520
you may have copyrights or money or something else you feel is valuable for copy left enforcement

18:42.520 --> 18:48.240
and then your best address you can go to a software freedom conservancy so here are Bradley and

18:48.240 --> 18:54.440
Karen and I and I'm sure they are happy to help you with this but you are also able to happy

18:54.480 --> 19:00.200
yourself if you want to just assign your copyrights go to as of conservancy or assignment or if you

19:00.200 --> 19:06.880
have some money to give visit as of conservancy org slash donate or you can also become a

19:06.880 --> 19:12.880
sustainer and give them regularly money so and the second remark is so here is the disclaimer

19:12.880 --> 19:18.680
for the legal talk and the disclaimer may be surprisingly I have given no legal advice you

19:18.680 --> 19:24.000
may have not noticed it but the trick here is according to the German legal services act

19:24.200 --> 19:31.040
legal advice is only advice given in a specific individualized situation so it is allowed to

19:31.040 --> 19:36.800
everyone to discuss the general situation to discuss about some hypotheticals so during

19:36.800 --> 19:46.320
Q&A I strongly ask you to not bother me with your specific personal problems I'm happy to have

19:46.320 --> 19:51.840
general discussions about all this with you and I'm happy to discuss about hypotheticals but that's

19:51.840 --> 20:12.840
it so thank you for your talk and I think it's great that you bring up this last slide because

20:12.840 --> 20:17.600
now I can sneak in a little remark on the previous panel because I think the solution to all the

20:17.600 --> 20:23.240
problems that we have discussed earlier is fairly easy and maybe it's time for us as an open source

20:23.240 --> 20:30.680
community to start demanding that the ownership of the source code is with people like SF

20:30.680 --> 20:40.680
Conservancy and other non-profit organizations yeah like I must I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm a no I'm a

20:40.680 --> 20:45.680
cybersecurity consultant so I do horrible horrible work in my like what I'm paid for I'm a very

20:45.760 --> 20:54.560
unethical person in my day job but I don't write code and I especially don't write proprietary

20:54.560 --> 20:59.360
code and if I did I would donate it to Conservancy because I think that will actually solve the

20:59.360 --> 21:06.280
problem of for-profit companies monopolizing software so sorry I don't have a question on

21:06.280 --> 21:16.200
your talk but that was just too good an opportunity I did not ask either of them to promote us and

21:16.200 --> 21:21.040
we really appreciate it it's a little it's a little embarrassing but much appreciated I actually

21:21.040 --> 21:26.800
have a real question on your talk it's a really excellent analysis I'm curious if you looked at

21:26.800 --> 21:31.080
the other side of the question because some of the I guess they're called stat I don't we would

21:31.080 --> 21:36.040
call them statutes in the US that you were quoting they seem to also relate to this I'm sure you're

21:36.040 --> 21:43.120
familiar with Till Ligger's theory that you can receive a new license once you come into compliance

21:43.120 --> 21:47.720
merely by downloading the software again and it's it seemed like some of the things you were

21:47.720 --> 21:53.960
quoting there hinted at why he has that analysis because I never fully understood his analysis but

21:53.960 --> 21:57.800
some of your your some of your points seem to fit with that and it made a lot more sense to be

21:57.800 --> 22:06.480
hearing it from you so I think that the relevant sort you have to have here is what is the disposing

22:06.480 --> 22:14.840
contract of the copyright holder to transfer the right through the licensee and depending on how

22:14.840 --> 22:21.480
you would frame that you could say they would give it on an ongoing daily basis or you could say

22:21.480 --> 22:26.680
they give it up front or they could say they give it up front and additionally an offer to give it

22:26.720 --> 22:32.840
to you again if you should violate and depending on how you frame that you would end up with

22:32.840 --> 22:40.000
different things you would have to give back so so I was by intent vaguely about that because I

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
know there are different theories what this what is actually transferred and so what have to be

22:45.000 --> 22:52.320
actually giving back but but in my point of in my point of view the essence is there is a decision

22:52.320 --> 22:59.120
right which would provide the obligation to give back what they still have no matter what it actually

22:59.120 --> 23:18.040
is yeah I'm from Germany I know all these things actually I met hard welcome until yeah and I can

23:18.040 --> 23:25.600
tell everybody that at least one of the companies he's you'd learned from this but the question is

23:25.600 --> 23:33.120
can you also give us insights on the situation in the US because I know there is something called

23:33.120 --> 23:38.800
the simple where case maybe Karen could tell us something about this and as far as I remember

23:38.800 --> 23:47.080
that in this situation the the copyright holder of the GPL license of the clearly stated on the

23:47.120 --> 23:56.080
website that certain companies permanently are banned from using their software I don't know

23:56.080 --> 24:03.280
exactly how the situation is I can say enough for sure that illegal systems different different

24:03.280 --> 24:11.320
are strongly different in in these questions and these kind of edge cases so I knew that there is

24:11.480 --> 24:18.720
theory under us Lord that the rights of her men play avoid I knew on the other hand that there is

24:18.720 --> 24:24.920
theory you can get a new license by downloading it but at the end of the day it will have to be

24:24.920 --> 24:36.200
tested in court yeah so I got curious about two things you're right in the about German law that

24:36.200 --> 24:42.640
you mentioned so as far as I understand one German court said that you can reacquire

24:42.640 --> 24:48.960
automatically rights under the GPL because you just go again to the website and download code and

24:48.960 --> 24:54.280
I could you maybe elaborate why the court says so because if it worked then you could actually

24:54.280 --> 25:01.800
constantly could violate I could elaborate on that and so sorry and just the second question is

25:02.240 --> 25:09.200
it under German law that the license has I don't know the German terms for that but I understand

25:09.200 --> 25:16.080
that in civil law you have contracts that have only this obligatory effect and the real effect of

25:16.080 --> 25:23.320
transfer of let's say property rights so do I understand correctly that licenses in German law

25:23.520 --> 25:32.440
have this real effect of transferring actually any rights okay so to your second question first

25:32.440 --> 25:37.560
this goes basically back to the separation principle and how you would understand the term

25:37.560 --> 25:44.520
license in the in on the background of German law you could say the license is only the disposing

25:44.520 --> 25:49.200
contract with the real effect or you could understand the term licensing it also includes

25:49.400 --> 25:59.640
the basically more contract obligating contract thing creating the obligations so well I assume

25:59.640 --> 26:10.640
even the term wordlet sense is not used strongly for the foreboding of for those things and to

26:10.640 --> 26:18.120
to the problem of what happens if a violator violates again and again or can they do that or

26:18.160 --> 26:31.280
can they not do that so I think if the violation is unnoticed or at least unactioned by any copyright

26:31.280 --> 26:39.480
holder they can violate again and again which would be each violation again copyright infringements

26:39.480 --> 26:46.320
but if nobody stops them then nobody stops them of course and on the other hand there is precedent

26:46.920 --> 26:56.640
which then lead to amendment of the civil code that no party of a contract can be forced to be

26:56.640 --> 27:05.040
trapped into a contract forever if the other party constantly does not apply to the contract so

27:05.040 --> 27:14.600
so no matter how which legal theory you actually apply or how you would actually frame it in my

27:14.640 --> 27:20.480
opinion you could always go back to this historic ruling and say well but a copyright holder cannot

27:20.480 --> 27:25.920
be trapped into TPL needing to tolerate violations forever

27:45.600 --> 27:55.080
thanks really interesting talk you already briefly mentioned us or the previous question was

27:55.080 --> 28:05.400
about the US am I correct in thinking that this will be not the same but similar in other European

28:05.400 --> 28:17.360
countries or am I wrong on that I don't know exactly enough the law of the other European

28:17.360 --> 28:24.440
countries to get to be able to give a precise answer but I would guess it's more like the

28:24.440 --> 28:30.200
German way for the countries which had to Roman tradition that's basically the non-English speaking

28:30.480 --> 28:36.440
countries and the English speaking countries have to have the British tradition basically and

28:36.440 --> 28:42.600
these have done other rules okay let's thanks a question
