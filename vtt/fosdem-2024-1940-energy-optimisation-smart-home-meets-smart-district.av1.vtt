WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:42.240
Good afternoon.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.240
My name is Rik Barillot.

00:43.240 --> 00:47.840
I've been a core member of Open Remote for a bit more thanâ€¦ louder?

00:47.840 --> 00:48.840
Okay, sure.

00:48.840 --> 00:53.840
A core member of Open Remote for a bit more than 12 years now.

00:53.840 --> 00:57.560
I'm not the person who was supposed to give this talk, so I'll do my best to work it

00:57.560 --> 00:58.560
through.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.960
Don't hesitate to come back afterwards, and I can point you to some of my colleagues

01:01.960 --> 01:03.960
that worked on those projects.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.960
A bit away?

01:05.960 --> 01:06.960
Yeah.

01:06.960 --> 01:07.960
Okay.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.960
Okay, I'll do my best.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.960
And speak louder?

01:12.960 --> 01:13.960
Okay.

01:13.960 --> 01:22.360
Okay, so Open Remote, it's a 100% open source IoT platform, so it would do whatever you

01:22.360 --> 01:24.440
expect from an IoT platform.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.960
Back to the devices, have some logic, and user interfaces.

01:28.960 --> 01:31.880
We'll come back to that a bit later.

01:31.880 --> 01:37.760
So open source, fully free, available on GitHub, and a community throughout the world that's

01:37.760 --> 01:38.760
pretty active.

01:38.760 --> 01:45.680
But also some projects that we work on with some companies.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.520
That's mainly what the core team does when I said professional.

01:48.520 --> 01:51.440
It's working on those projects.

01:51.440 --> 01:57.960
Also they have projects that are in home security or smart cities, typical IoT projects in more

01:57.960 --> 02:05.440
exotic things like smart clothing, architecture, and of course a lot of projects in the energy

02:05.440 --> 02:12.880
domain, energy management, but also some link to other aspects of energy.

02:12.880 --> 02:18.320
And we'll go into a bit more detail in the Nottingham city project a bit later.

02:18.320 --> 02:21.480
So looking at Open Remote, what is it?

02:21.480 --> 02:29.120
It's mainly a middleware developed in Java.

02:29.120 --> 02:35.360
It has a database that is both for the configuration of the system and for the state of the system.

02:35.360 --> 02:40.440
So the current values of your sensors, but also all the historical data.

02:40.440 --> 02:46.800
It has quite a few connections using standard protocols, so you can connect to gateways

02:46.800 --> 02:48.440
or to data feed.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.080
We'll see that later.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.880
Awesome property hardware.

02:52.880 --> 02:56.560
It has a set of user interfaces.

02:56.560 --> 03:01.800
You have standard more management user interfaces where you can configure the system or see

03:01.800 --> 03:04.840
the values or trigger some actuators.

03:04.840 --> 03:09.680
You get Insight, which is a dashboarding kind of application.

03:09.680 --> 03:16.160
But we also have a set of web components, freely available that you can use to build

03:16.160 --> 03:19.600
your own custom application for a given project.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.760
And so you have an application that you can access through a browser, or you can embed

03:23.760 --> 03:27.360
it into a mobile app, what we call the consoles.

03:27.360 --> 03:32.120
And you can also connect to other systems like Grafana, Power BI, if you want to have

03:32.120 --> 03:34.800
extra features.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.280
Then you have, of course, a mechanism for the logic.

03:38.280 --> 03:44.840
We support different type of rules engines, simple through the UIs like IFTTF.

03:44.840 --> 03:49.480
So if then that or more advanced features like Groovy scripting.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.680
So if you want to go really deep.

03:52.680 --> 03:57.800
There is a set of default services, so building blocks that you can use, for instance, to

03:57.800 --> 04:05.080
push notification to the mobile phones or to place devices on a map or to implement

04:05.080 --> 04:09.040
optimization services, what we'll talk about in a minute.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.760
And this is, of course, built with security in mind.

04:11.760 --> 04:20.200
So there is a strong identification, authentication and authorization layer in the system.

04:20.200 --> 04:25.120
So coming to energy optimization.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.640
We'll talk about two things.

04:28.640 --> 04:33.560
As we say, what we call smart home, but it can very well be a smart office or even an

04:33.560 --> 04:34.560
office complex.

04:34.560 --> 04:39.160
Basically, it's the concept of an island behind a meter.

04:39.160 --> 04:43.080
And you have kind of a sole proprietor of the island.

04:43.080 --> 04:49.080
And then when you move to the smart district, it's a composition of many islands behind

04:49.080 --> 04:51.080
one transformer.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.520
The problems are a bit different, but the system is the same.

04:54.520 --> 05:00.520
So if you look at the system, yeah, whatever, I'll do this.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.920
You have your renewable energy, so solar and wind.

05:03.920 --> 05:07.200
You have the grid, both import and export.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.880
You have a battery with charge discharge, and you have your load, your consumers, but

05:11.880 --> 05:16.720
can also sometimes feed in energy back into the system.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.960
Some electric vehicles can do that.

05:19.960 --> 05:26.280
So the goal for the smart home is to optimize either based on the cost, so you want to pay

05:26.280 --> 05:32.680
the least amount, or on the environmental footprint, so you want to be green as much

05:32.680 --> 05:34.120
as possible.

05:34.120 --> 05:41.480
The data that we have to do that is for the renewable energy, we are going to estimate

05:41.480 --> 05:46.600
the consumption based on the peak characteristics of the installation, so how much your solar

05:46.600 --> 05:53.640
power can produce, solar panel can produce, and on weather data, so we can take the estimate

05:53.640 --> 05:56.000
of that.

05:56.000 --> 06:01.720
For the grid, we have dynamic tariffs, so people can, for instance, have contracts where

06:01.720 --> 06:08.040
they pay a different tariff by the hour or by the quarter even, and so we have the data

06:08.040 --> 06:15.360
to know those costs, but there is also a carbon cost associated with the type of energy that

06:15.360 --> 06:17.400
is produced.

06:17.400 --> 06:22.640
The battery, it's a charge discharge, but there is also a cost, so a levelized cost

06:22.640 --> 06:27.560
of storage, so for instance, if your battery costs 1,000 euro, and it can do 1,000 charge

06:27.560 --> 06:32.280
discharge, every charge is charged cycle is 1 euro, so you need to take that into account

06:32.280 --> 06:39.120
when optimizing, and so for the loads, we have the path consumption, and we do a weighted

06:39.120 --> 06:44.560
exponential average to predict the future consumption on that.

06:44.560 --> 06:49.920
So now what we are trying to optimize, as I said, is minimizing the cost of the carbon

06:49.920 --> 06:53.640
exhaust based on all this data.

06:53.640 --> 07:01.200
And so the system will control what we call the flexible load, so depending on this data,

07:01.200 --> 07:07.200
it can decide when to charge or discharge the battery, it can decide when to charge or discharge

07:07.200 --> 07:13.560
potentially the electric vehicles, or it can decide to control heavy loads, like heat pumps

07:13.560 --> 07:20.800
where you have a bit of freedom and when you can power them up or the temperature set point,

07:20.800 --> 07:25.080
things like that.

07:25.080 --> 07:30.440
And this can be automatic of course, but it could also be simply manual by pushing information

07:30.440 --> 07:33.080
to end user through the UI.

07:33.080 --> 07:38.800
When you move to the smart district or the collection of island behind the transformer,

07:38.800 --> 07:45.200
you have a slightly different problem, which is the transformer that is between your district

07:45.200 --> 07:50.760
and the grid, which has a peak capacity, and so what you want to make sure is that you

07:50.760 --> 07:56.640
stay under the capacity of the transformer, both for import and for export.

07:56.640 --> 08:01.160
So when there is a real high production of renewable, you don't want to surcharge the

08:01.160 --> 08:03.200
grid.

08:03.200 --> 08:09.280
So the data that we have is basically the same for the battery, for the renewable and

08:09.280 --> 08:10.640
for the loads.

08:10.640 --> 08:18.720
In addition, we have real time peak power, not peak net power of the transformer, so we

08:18.720 --> 08:23.000
know how much the transformer is currently taking in and out.

08:23.000 --> 08:28.800
And we also can then adjust the optimization algorithm with a fake kind of tariff.

08:28.800 --> 08:37.640
So if we know that we need to change the consumption on the transformer, we can like fake how much

08:37.640 --> 08:44.920
the electricity would cost so that the optimization algorithm would steer one way or another.

08:44.920 --> 08:50.400
And so we keep doing the optimization at each individual island, but we want to push

08:50.400 --> 08:54.800
for the global optimization so that the grid stays or the transformer, the grid stays under

08:54.800 --> 08:57.960
control.

08:57.960 --> 09:02.760
And so one additional problem comes now with the fact that you have many households, for

09:02.760 --> 09:06.560
instance, in a district, which can have their own technology.

09:06.560 --> 09:10.640
So it's quite complex to control them, to automate them at all.

09:10.640 --> 09:17.520
So one way, and we're exploring that, is interfacing with more home automation systems,

09:17.520 --> 09:21.960
like Open Hub or Home Assistant, for instance.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.920
Another way is to manually impact.

09:23.920 --> 09:30.640
And so what we can do is send personal challenges to every household where the people can earn

09:30.640 --> 09:38.360
points, which basically earns them money if they play nice within the whole ecosystem.

09:38.360 --> 09:43.040
And there is a lot we can do is we also have shared flexible loads.

09:43.040 --> 09:48.040
So for instance, in a district, you can have the shared charging station for the electric

09:48.040 --> 09:49.040
vehicles.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.520
And then we can control and, for instance, diminish the available power so that we can

09:52.520 --> 09:57.680
also keep the grid under control.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.760
So that is the general idea.

09:59.760 --> 10:03.400
That is what we are aiming for.

10:03.400 --> 10:09.400
There are several pilot projects that are starting to implement that.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.680
So this is the global idea.

10:11.680 --> 10:15.600
One of them is the Nottingham City Council.

10:15.600 --> 10:24.520
The idea, it's a smart home, but really it's more smart, well, we could say office complex.

10:24.520 --> 10:28.920
The idea is to control the charging of all the vehicles, electric vehicles that are used

10:28.920 --> 10:32.080
by the City Council at Nottingham.

10:32.080 --> 10:38.480
And so what it means is you can control a global static battery plus the charging of

10:38.480 --> 10:43.760
all the vehicles to save money.

10:43.760 --> 10:50.320
You can also control or you want to have your vehicle charged at least to some level because

10:50.320 --> 10:53.000
you want to use it in the end.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.720
And you also want to prevent surpassing the limit, the power limit that you have for the

10:56.720 --> 10:57.720
whole district.

10:57.720 --> 11:00.960
Oh, sorry, Council.

11:00.960 --> 11:06.280
And so what you see on the right is the dashboard interface that we have in Open Remote that

11:06.280 --> 11:09.760
can show you the different location of the vehicles.

11:09.760 --> 11:14.120
So we can track that anonymously, but we can track the different vehicles and the global

11:14.120 --> 11:21.200
power that is currently used by charging of this vehicle.

11:21.200 --> 11:27.840
If we now move to the smart district, this is a project that is currently starting in

11:27.840 --> 11:37.000
Amsterdam, where we have a community of about 500 households that are part of this project.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.600
One thing is each household can control their consumption by we interface with the meter

11:43.600 --> 11:48.640
and they can see a real time information about the power they're consuming through the mobile

11:48.640 --> 11:53.400
app so they can adapt their own consumption.

11:53.400 --> 11:58.000
We have the challenges that I talked about so they see how the whole district is doing

11:58.000 --> 12:02.640
and their proposed challenges so that they can play nice within the neighborhood and

12:02.640 --> 12:06.760
by doing so earn money.

12:06.760 --> 12:13.480
And we can also, as we said, limit the if there is really an emergency, we can control

12:13.480 --> 12:17.880
the heavy loads that are shared for the district to make sure that we don't go above the limits

12:17.880 --> 12:21.840
of the transformer.

12:21.840 --> 12:26.240
So it looks a bit like that and these are design of slides so there are some inconsistency

12:26.240 --> 12:33.480
in the wording, but globally every participant will see his own consumption with a bit of

12:33.480 --> 12:36.120
a history on how the district is doing.

12:36.120 --> 12:41.680
And the green dots around the indication are a global indication of how the district

12:41.680 --> 12:43.800
is doing.

12:43.800 --> 12:48.160
So it's really gamification there.

12:48.160 --> 12:52.080
Now you see that at some point the neighborhood might be reaching the limit so we are reaching

12:52.080 --> 12:58.080
the limit at the transformer level and so we will propose to the person in each household

12:58.080 --> 13:02.320
a challenge saying well for the next hour you need to keep your consumption below this

13:02.320 --> 13:04.760
level.

13:04.760 --> 13:10.400
If the person accepts then for the duration of the challenge they will see their own consumption,

13:10.400 --> 13:18.920
see the limit, how they are doing against it and how many points they will collect.

13:18.920 --> 13:25.360
And so they also receive tips, say well potentially if you want to keep your consumption under

13:25.360 --> 13:30.920
the limit maybe charge your car a bit later or set the temperature a bit lower, something

13:30.920 --> 13:34.200
like that.

13:34.200 --> 13:41.040
When the challenge is done they see how many points they have collected and then they of

13:41.040 --> 13:44.800
course can see a summary of all the challenges they have completed, how many points they

13:44.800 --> 13:49.040
have earned, etc.

13:49.040 --> 13:54.680
This is the view from the manager so we can see different meters that are all connected

13:54.680 --> 13:55.680
to the system.

13:55.680 --> 14:01.400
At this stage as it's pilot project they have 50 meters connected, the project just started,

14:01.400 --> 14:08.240
the target is to have 150 by the end of the month February and with 150 this should be

14:08.240 --> 14:12.960
enough to already influence the whole behavior of the district.

14:12.960 --> 14:17.720
So with 150 connected meters we should be able to have an impact really on how the district

14:17.720 --> 14:21.760
and the impact on the transformer.

14:21.760 --> 14:28.000
And so this is here the dashboard where you see a summary, the small diagram I showed

14:28.000 --> 14:35.360
with the consumption and the load on the transformer, how we are doing compared to the peak performance

14:35.360 --> 14:43.200
of the transformer, a historical graph and things like that.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.880
So thank you, these were the two projects that are currently running on energy management

14:47.880 --> 14:51.840
at this stage, there have been others.

14:51.840 --> 14:59.680
You can find the open remote platform in the GitHub repo, there is also the forum where

14:59.680 --> 15:02.640
the community is active and other information.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.160
Thank you very much.
