00:00.000 --> 00:17.000
It's all right. I am early or on time? I'm on time. I'm punctual. That's brilliant.

00:17.000 --> 00:27.000
So, hello. My name is Salve Nielsen. I'm one of the few fellows that hack around with

00:27.000 --> 00:38.000
the Netherlands in Oslo, Norway. And last year, I bumped into, with some other people into thinking about security on the

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
seapen. So, stuff happened and I'm going to tell you about that now. And a little bit, it's kind of an introduction to

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
FOSTA. Similar talks have been given at other conferences already. And a little bit of an update.

00:53.000 --> 01:02.000
So, I hope you can bear with me. So, we were established at the Perl Tulsen Summit in Lyon last year.

01:02.000 --> 01:14.000
And the purpose here is to basically feel an void about caring about seapen security. There are already people who care about

01:14.000 --> 01:27.000
security in the Perl community. Mostly they live on the P-File porters list. But when it comes to the seapen ecosystem, a couple of us raised our

01:27.000 --> 01:35.000
hands and said, okay, we'll try and do something about that. These are the people that showed up at the Perl Tulsen Summit.

01:35.000 --> 01:52.000
And a bunch of these are also on the seapen security working group. So, what's in scope for this working group? We are, there's a lot of

01:52.000 --> 02:04.000
people who are interested in the security of the Perl. So, we try to do security outreach. That means information work. It's maybe not obvious that's

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
needed because of course everybody knows how to Google and figure out something. But we try to think a little bit about how to do things that are

02:12.000 --> 02:26.000
connected to the security of the Perl. So, that includes making sure that important security issues that are probably registered as a CVE. That if there are

02:26.000 --> 02:37.000
anything that show up in the CVE index that they are responding to in a good way. And we're not solving the problems. We're helping the people who are

02:37.000 --> 02:48.000
involved in the project, for example, that doesn't have a responsive author will make a little bit of an effort to try to find a replacement or solve it that way. This is basically what happened with

02:48.000 --> 03:02.000
spreadsheet parseXL and parseXLX. And we are super happy somebody stepped up and actually resolved those issues. And we do some coordination with other

03:02.000 --> 03:21.000
scientists through the search.org VINCE interface. And so, we are trying to build up a network so we can make sure to report things properly and share the information we have and help those people who need help.

03:21.000 --> 03:40.000
And there is some triaging and coordination going on there. And the goal here is to make sure that important vulnerability issues are not ignored. So, that's one of the major topics we're working on. We care also about having a good

03:41.000 --> 03:58.000
vulnerability index. There are, I think, one or two options right now. This one, called C-Pan-Odeta, I think, has something going on there which is useful. But it needs to be up to date and we want to help with that and maybe see if we can integrate it with other

03:58.000 --> 04:26.000
indexes out there. Furthermore, let's see what's going on here. That was not the point. Okay, the screen is saying hello. Okay, sorry for technical problems here.

04:28.000 --> 04:55.000
It looks like my computer doesn't like the USB C connection here for a moment. Sorry about that. Okay, let's throw it out and put it in again. That's always how it works.

04:59.000 --> 05:25.000
There, sweet. Yeah, it would manage to fix itself or the old computer are just saying. So, yes, vulnerability index. We also care about what's called supply chain provenance, which is basically where the stuff come from and how did it become the way it is.

05:25.000 --> 05:51.000
And in general, supply chain security. Things that we are working on there. Look here. It's already disappearing. This is a bit annoying. I'll try to continue. We want to make an effort to make sure that all the C-Pan clients use HTLess by default, for example.

05:51.000 --> 06:13.000
So we connect quickly to the servers that we want to download from. We want to make use of something called the update framework, which is used by other packaging ecosystems for securing the whole process of publishing and sharing the modules out there.

06:13.000 --> 06:40.000
We want to introduce repository signatures and author signatures at some point. We, moving on, we have, come on. It looks like I'm having more trouble than is necessary here. This is quite annoying.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
No.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
No.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
No.

07:00.000 --> 07:13.000
All right. So we are looking also at, oh, this is the wrong page. Interesting.

07:17.000 --> 07:46.000
We're also looking at tracking all the changes that happen on the software. Look here. Using S-bombs, software below materials. That's a huge topic and demands from that downstream when people in running software on critical infrastructure, for example, have now, they're obliged by law to keep track of dependencies and what's going on.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
And this whole

07:49.000 --> 08:17.000
field also includes solving the problem of how to refer to the depends across package ecosystems. So with that, there's something called package URL, which is currently in use by a lot of systems out there that and S-bomb standards to refer between

08:19.000 --> 08:38.000
two packages in different ecosystems. If all goes well, we'll actually have C-pans as part of the package URL standard, sometimes this weekend, I'm hoping. I talked with the author yesterday at the party, at the conference here in Brussels.

08:39.000 --> 08:49.000
And we want to improve the indices in general when it comes to interoperability with other indexes, package indexes.

08:53.000 --> 09:03.000
Let's see. Since we don't have slides here, this is really annoying. So I'm sorry this doesn't work as expected. Does anybody have a USB to HDMI connector?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
USB C.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.000
No, no, that's, I need to, I need to, female HDMI.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Ah, okay.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Let's see if this helps.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
Crossing fingers.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.000
Because if it doesn't get better now, then it's not my computer.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
All right.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
There's something called transparency logs.

09:49.000 --> 09:58.000
There is some tooling called six store and six some that we want to take inspiration from to create transparency around what changes happen on C-pans.

09:59.000 --> 10:05.000
So if something is updated without anyone knowing, we want to detect stuff like that.

10:07.000 --> 10:22.000
We also would love to have a way to do a patching of C-pan distributions when an upstream of there is completely unresponsive and we have no way of resolving a crisis quickly.

10:23.000 --> 10:32.000
So to publish a patch in a structured way so that, say, for example, a client can detect, oh, there's a patch that is not applied here, but we do want to download or something like that.

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
We'll see how that works. It's a current dream we're having.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
We do care about compliance and privacy.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
So having an idea of what kind of legislation is relevant for us.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.000
That's super important and documenting that stuff is part of that.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
So we have a reading list already published.

10:59.000 --> 11:13.000
We also want to have good tooling for software composition analysis and like checking finding ways to detect if something, some of your dependencies have certainly gotten a vulnerability or something.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
So we say, for example, during a test run configured, oops, there was something happening.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
One of the dependencies you need to update is lots of good ways to do that.

11:23.000 --> 11:29.000
There's already some tooling in place actually, but these are what we want to do.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
There's also the act of having a project management.

11:35.000 --> 11:42.000
So we're taking that part of that and that means creating a good charter, having a pre-release disclosure agreement.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.000
That tells us under what terms we can share information or not.

11:47.000 --> 12:00.000
And do general information around how things are put together as an organization and which place we play in the larger ecosystem.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
Funding is also an important part of this because I have to be frank here for a moment.

12:07.000 --> 12:13.000
And that is working on security issues on behalf of others on a volunteer basis isn't always fun.

12:13.000 --> 12:19.000
Sometimes it can be increased like horribly boring or frustrating or just solving problems that I don't have.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
I imagine this is the same for everyone.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
So we're looking also for finding ways to actually fund some of the work that we want to do.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
And there's a whole lot of other stuff we want to do.

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
And the most important thing for us is that while Perl isn't the super big thing it was 20 years ago,

12:43.000 --> 12:52.000
it's still used everywhere in critical infrastructure and in important businesses that with money is earned right now.

12:53.000 --> 12:59.000
So people call it legacy systems these days, but we have to remember legacy means also earning money.

13:00.000 --> 13:06.000
So we cannot just ignore and say I'll rewrite stuff later or we'll just update.

13:07.000 --> 13:13.000
No, no, we need to update stuff now and we need to figure out exactly what's running and to make that happen.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.000
We need to enable a whole lot of things using the stuff I already mentioned.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
And there's also some cultural things worth mentioning.

13:26.000 --> 13:33.000
And in the Cpan and Perl community, we don't always think actively about security.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
So we're hoping to be a little bit of a catalyst for over time to change the culture also.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.000
And that means learning new stuff, not only being a DevOps, but thinking also how to become a DevOps,

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
or Sec DevOps or whatever it's called.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
The security becomes part of how we operate.

13:52.000 --> 14:01.000
And in my opinion also we're pretty good at having our own ecosystem where things have worked for a long time

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
and we know we can trust it and it's been very predictable.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
But we're not that good at interoperating across the ecosystem boundaries.

14:11.000 --> 14:17.000
Like say for example if you package something in Debian, it's like how do from Debian's perspective

14:17.000 --> 14:23.000
is what do we have to do to make whatever these guys are doing work in our environment.

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
When we could have used say good standards for communicating dependencies in a machine readable

14:32.000 --> 14:35.000
and common way that works across all kinds of ecosystems.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
That's a super interesting problem that people are working on right now to solve personally

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
and I hope we can be part of that.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.000
So why do we do this?

14:49.000 --> 14:54.000
There are new security demands coming from the EU and from an old executive order in the US.

14:55.000 --> 15:04.000
These are specifically aimed at institutions and companies that write software for critical infrastructure

15:05.000 --> 15:18.000
and that could be anything from power internet access, street light management, water treatment plans, administrative systems,

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
all kinds of places throughout society.

15:23.000 --> 15:28.000
If something breaks it affects the normal operation of society in a negative manner.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
That means these two directives applies.

15:32.000 --> 15:41.000
For the cyber security sector which is still upcoming, it's more about internet enabled devices which basically means anything

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
from toys to phones and all the systems that connect to and update those.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
So that means everything.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
So we will be affected.

15:52.000 --> 16:01.000
These laws are coming this year and will be rolled in in the next few years.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
I think it's 18 months or something.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
So this is upcoming stuff.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
That means we have the legislative guns pointing at us basically.

16:13.000 --> 16:22.000
We would also love to find ways to show that those of us who publish things on c-pan have our ducks in a row.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
We have the things in order.

16:26.000 --> 16:31.000
People can't trust the code we publish and we do that's what's necessary to make that happen.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
So there's some awareness raising.

16:37.000 --> 16:45.000
So we're discussing blog posts and all kinds of other ways to get more people involved in this.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Who are we?

16:48.000 --> 16:56.000
Brenno, Graham, Inge, Jose, Andreas, Leon, Olaf, sitting there, Pete, René, Sam, Salvis, Mi, Stig, sitting there.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Tim, Merein isn't here today.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
And a whole lot of others.

17:02.000 --> 17:09.000
We, these are a couple of the people that were at the Peralta Julesin Summit.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
I'm there.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
It's a photo of me where I don't look horrible.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.000
That's good.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
So that's Stig and Inge and Leon and Merein and Brenno.

17:20.000 --> 17:25.000
And the reason I say all the names here is to make a point actually.

17:25.000 --> 17:41.000
When somebody talks with you about supply chain security, there are people like this and the group picture that are actually working on the supply chain, the bits and pieces that make that up.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
On a volunteer basis.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
And meaning humans.

17:48.000 --> 17:52.000
It's not like a black box where suddenly stuff appears.

17:53.000 --> 18:00.000
We have to actually think about this as almost like our open source colleagues.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.000
We work together with these people.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
So what I want to hear is to ask you to join us.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
Do you care about open source security?

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
Do you have some extra tweets, some time to spend over?

18:14.000 --> 18:25.000
Do you have a manager that is aware of that there's a security commons out there that is shared and that needs to be updated and kept alive and kept healthy?

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
And you all would like to fix security yourself.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Please contact us.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
We need help.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
We are a bunch of volunteers right now, but we do not have all the time needed.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
And at the moment we don't have the funding either.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
So there's that.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
So to find us, we are on our seal and there's a link there.

18:46.000 --> 18:49.000
You can find all the necessary on security.metasep.org.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.000
You could also use the security.zip.org and the mailing list where we coordinate stuff is the zip and security.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
It's closed off, but with a little bit of dancing and singing, you can get into there.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
So I don't know.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
We probably don't have time for questions and comments.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Two minutes.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.000
Two questions. Yes.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
Three, very short remarks.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
First, I'd love to see a module creating a sports, lively.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Yes. Working on that.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Okay.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
If you want to help, talk with me.

19:24.000 --> 19:32.000
Second, I'd like to have 502 support for a stick support for any of the big frameworks we have in the fall.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
More delicious or dancer tour.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.000
We won't do anything on that, but if you want to publish something, go ahead.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
I've been looking into that a little bit.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
Okay.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Who in this room has a Vince account?

19:46.000 --> 19:47.000
I have one.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I like it very much, but please make yourself.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
Vince is a vulnerability sharing system that search.org runs.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
We have a couple of us on the have it already.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
So if you are scared about security enough to have an account there, you're welcome to join us.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
That's a very good criteria.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
But of course, please actually help.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
We have a lot of people that are having bystanders looking at.

20:13.000 --> 20:19.000
There's something called the bystander effect where lots of people look at an accident and waiting for someone else to make the first move.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
That is, we cannot have that.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
We need people to actually want to make sure it happens.

20:24.000 --> 20:31.000
Having a Vince account, maybe not enough, you have to publish yourself and say to them, hey, we use the problem.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
Yes.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
There's a whole lot of stuff.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
More questions?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
One question.

20:40.000 --> 20:48.000
Well, you get the difference from everyone, but for me, it's that we need more people who are actively working at the moment.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.000
But you have a whole lot of stuff, which is all of them are good things.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
I should try to paint a picture of today.

20:56.000 --> 21:01.000
And if something tickles your brain, then you're quite welcome to join us and make something happen there.

21:02.000 --> 21:09.000
If you know something we don't, then please tell us.

21:10.000 --> 21:15.000
We're in the process of learning.

21:16.000 --> 21:20.000
I'm getting an idea that this is the end, so I will say thank you.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.000
And I hope this was useful for you.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.000
And please get in touch if you care about security on CPAP.
