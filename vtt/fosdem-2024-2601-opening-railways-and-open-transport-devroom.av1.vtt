00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
So, hello everyone.

00:09.400 --> 00:15.480
Hello everyone, thank you for being here and for making this room so full even in the early

00:15.480 --> 00:16.480
morning.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.720
Don't be confused, I'm speaking in this microphone just for the stream so we have to talk a little

00:20.720 --> 00:23.600
bit louder here so that people online can hear us.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.560
I hope that's all right for you also to the speakers.

00:27.040 --> 00:32.000
Okay, so we are very thrilled from the organizers that you are all here and that we collected

00:32.000 --> 00:33.320
so many interesting talks.

00:33.320 --> 00:40.400
We will shortly give an introduction into what we thought about this schedule, why the

00:40.400 --> 00:45.340
talks are there and were selected, but in general we had so many good contributions

00:45.340 --> 00:49.760
and submissions to this deaf room so it was really hard and we hope that you will enjoy

00:49.760 --> 00:51.040
the program.

00:51.040 --> 00:59.360
We, that is people from different railway companies I would say in Europe, like in the

00:59.360 --> 01:06.160
last year when we first presented this room or organized this room, yeah, we learned a

01:06.160 --> 01:12.600
lot and we also learned each other and we are actually, we can say we just founded the

01:12.600 --> 01:18.080
Open Rail Association just a few days ago officially so this is one of the forms that

01:18.160 --> 01:22.040
we have where we bring together people from the community, from the free and open software

01:22.040 --> 01:26.360
community but also from railway operators, from the transportation community to work

01:26.360 --> 01:31.440
together and yeah, this is one of these great opportunities so it's great that we can do

01:31.440 --> 01:33.840
this for the second time in a row.

01:33.840 --> 01:42.320
And yeah, thank you.

01:42.320 --> 01:48.160
We, that is here, Louis Hamelon from SNCF, we will also give a short introduction now

01:48.160 --> 01:52.760
and then it's me, Max Mehl from Deutsche Bahn, we have Comedius Schumacher from Deutsche

01:52.760 --> 01:59.520
Bahn, Peter Keller from SBB, Mahalia Steffan from SBB as well and Simon Clavier from SNCF

01:59.520 --> 02:03.640
so you see we are quite international here and we are the organizers.

02:03.640 --> 02:07.360
So Louis, do you want to give us a short intro into the day, what can we expect today?

02:07.520 --> 02:09.040
Yes, thank you Max.

02:09.040 --> 02:15.520
So we try to tell a story this year and not to put some talks, the one after the other

02:15.520 --> 02:23.480
and we start with, first with something about the data and about the traffic forecast and

02:23.480 --> 02:30.240
to modelize the data of the demand and then what happened with the data, we try to simulate

02:30.240 --> 02:36.840
the passenger behavior with a mat sim tool which is a quite fancy tool and then once

02:36.880 --> 02:46.120
we have this transport modeling passenger model, we can use it for making simulation

02:46.120 --> 02:52.240
and building timetables so we have these three talks about a fancy tool which is called OSRD.

02:52.240 --> 02:59.480
Yes, it's a and this tool, so we will have three talks about this tool, one about the

02:59.480 --> 03:05.040
map, one about the running time algorithm and the other one about the signaling system

03:05.160 --> 03:15.040
and then how it is used and nice and what is, what, how the community works with all the,

03:15.040 --> 03:21.320
the, the, for the railway and for the transportation in general.

03:22.840 --> 03:23.840
Cool, Tristan.

03:25.760 --> 03:29.040
That's it for me, so maybe we can start now.
