WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.840
Okay, our next speaker is Peter from linmob.net and linuxmartphones.org and he's talking about

00:14.840 --> 00:17.500
the Linux phone app ecosystem.

00:17.500 --> 00:24.880
Please have a round of applause.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.960
Hello everybody.

00:25.960 --> 00:31.560
So I hope everybody can hear me and yeah, this is my first talk and I'm really glad

00:31.560 --> 00:32.560
to be here.

00:32.560 --> 00:38.640
It's amazing that this conference is running every year volunteer based and that we have

00:38.640 --> 00:44.920
another room this year to have all these great mobile Linux talks.

00:44.920 --> 00:51.000
Now we'll have one that's maybe less great but I don't know.

00:51.000 --> 00:56.720
So I think I need to hold that.

00:56.720 --> 01:00.040
So this is an important thing.

01:00.040 --> 01:06.760
You can use those devices, Qualcomm SOCs or the little five and whatnot and you want

01:06.760 --> 01:11.000
to touch on all of it but it does have no apps, right?

01:11.000 --> 01:15.840
So in theory this could be so simple.

01:15.840 --> 01:25.400
You just install Waderoid on your distribution, simple and then you install asteroid, free

01:25.400 --> 01:32.280
software apps and then maybe you need some proprietary stuff so you can do that and you

01:32.280 --> 01:34.600
have all the apps.

01:34.600 --> 01:40.560
Well, you know, I've done that with Linux, it was in the past and so on and microg is

01:40.560 --> 01:49.680
amazing and whatnot but there's always issues and especially with virtualized Android and

01:49.680 --> 01:53.480
so yeah.

01:53.480 --> 02:00.680
There are good approaches and worse but I think I would rather go with native if possible

02:00.680 --> 02:07.240
so this talk is only about native apps, whatever that means.

02:07.240 --> 02:12.240
But not so fast, let's have a brief agenda.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.480
Who am I?

02:13.480 --> 02:15.720
Some dumb puns maybe.

02:15.720 --> 02:16.960
What's not in this talk?

02:16.960 --> 02:20.000
I don't have a slide for that because why?

02:20.000 --> 02:24.280
And then apps on Safe for Sure has absolutely a bunch of touch and the new contenders so

02:24.280 --> 02:31.880
what I do with the links on apps.org or what others and I do with the links on apps.org

02:31.880 --> 02:37.080
because I don't develop any apps as other people and I don't add all the apps.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.960
Can't do it.

02:38.960 --> 02:44.720
And then highlights we have, gaps and challenges and Q&A maybe.

02:44.720 --> 02:49.360
So motivation.

02:49.360 --> 02:59.720
We already heard of three major projects, realms maybe mentioned like with Safe for Sure has

02:59.720 --> 03:06.040
and you want to touch and all these new Linux distributions that's born up that we'll get

03:06.040 --> 03:14.560
into later and I think this is a small space in terms of market share but to solve that

03:14.560 --> 03:18.120
it's heavily fragmented.

03:18.120 --> 03:22.440
So maybe there's something to learn.

03:22.440 --> 03:30.800
Maybe another platform project, whatever you call it, product does something different

03:30.800 --> 03:35.160
and that's great and maybe others can learn from that.

03:35.160 --> 03:38.440
And then I wanted to spend some time with you, want to touch and Safe for Sure has after

03:38.440 --> 03:47.440
a while but yeah I don't know, broke happened so yeah that part is going to be rather thin.

03:47.440 --> 03:57.560
So then I had some assumptions at first so surely stuff like email that's easy, document

03:57.560 --> 04:08.080
protocols, well maybe quite complicated but it's there, metrics, it's there, XMPP, just

04:08.080 --> 04:18.480
do it and then stuff that has free APIs also yeah you know people will do it and then everything

04:18.480 --> 04:23.440
that has an API even if paid should also be doable.

04:23.440 --> 04:27.840
So yeah, let's get into it.

04:27.840 --> 04:31.080
So Safe for Sure has.

04:31.080 --> 04:36.360
When, oh I forgot the introduction part, shit.

04:36.360 --> 04:45.800
So yeah this is my website, it's lin.net that stands for linear mobster's network, no actually

04:45.800 --> 04:46.880
not.

04:46.880 --> 04:55.400
So this is a logo, you may know it from YouTube and this is the current homepage, weekly updates,

04:55.400 --> 05:01.640
a lot of work and now how it started because I think that part matters a bit.

05:01.640 --> 05:08.280
So it started in 2007 and even back then we had plenty of Linux mobile projects, community

05:08.280 --> 05:16.160
and others coming over from the handheld age to the smartphone age, handhelds.org, linux.go.org,

05:16.160 --> 05:24.280
I don't know if anybody was in those IRC rooms at the time if you are in your year, great.

05:24.280 --> 05:31.840
That's real stamina, what would you call that?

05:31.840 --> 05:43.880
So I somehow stayed around, well I left briefly because in 2011 we had like a major two things

05:43.880 --> 05:51.120
killed by CEO, so what happened with Nokia and what happened at HP, new CEO and then

05:51.120 --> 05:59.440
boom mobile linux, look promising, died, also open moco.

05:59.440 --> 06:08.560
Now to get into this talk, while I was doing a blog and totally into the Aztec in 2020

06:08.560 --> 06:13.640
with a pine cone and oh my god what can you do, this thing only lasts five hours but hey

06:13.920 --> 06:22.480
I want to use it so is there a list of apps from this, forked it, eventually turned it

06:22.480 --> 06:28.840
into this because the previous implementation would no longer work on those low Linux phones

06:28.840 --> 06:36.440
and it's still pretty bad, I think there's an issue tracker on Framigate and we'll get

06:36.520 --> 06:46.560
to that later maybe but yeah so improvements of Alka I say but there's a lot that has been

06:46.560 --> 06:56.040
learned and I think it can be helpful so we skip that so say a fish, like we just said

06:56.120 --> 07:09.080
Elop killed the Anain and Harmaton Nokia and from the ashes raised YOLLA and they introduced

07:09.080 --> 07:16.680
the YOLLA phone into 2013 and it's quite modern so it's BTRFS well yeah who cares file systems,

07:17.240 --> 07:30.520
Wayland system the 2013, Wayland really and then there's a going, troubled surely don't make any

07:30.520 --> 07:36.440
more on devices you can buy a license bring you on Sony device and they've got something that's

07:36.440 --> 07:43.360
quite interested for those that need those proprietary bits to close the gap that's Android

07:43.400 --> 07:52.480
app support not a topic of this talk so what do they have so there are multiple interfaces to

07:52.480 --> 08:00.280
get software so there's the YOLLA star requires the YOLLA account no for pay apps has no web

08:00.280 --> 08:07.320
interface so I did not count those apps maybe there's an API or something we didn't look into it

08:07.360 --> 08:15.360
but yeah it looks quite nice and that's not the only source of software that's well organized

08:15.360 --> 08:24.640
there there's also open repost on that now that one is really old if you go on to open repost

08:24.640 --> 08:35.000
on that you will see that it lists one app for the LibreM 5 or for POS but it also has many apps

08:35.120 --> 08:44.480
for the N900 which I think many people still have fond memories of and the N9 and there's even

08:44.480 --> 08:52.120
some development still for the N9 so people are still using that thing today yeah it has a

08:52.120 --> 09:01.880
Storm in frontend for Safefish has also no for pay apps it like I said lists up for the projects

09:01.880 --> 09:11.800
and it has approximately 1800 apps and counting listed for Safefish but I don't think that with

09:11.800 --> 09:20.000
the transition from arm 32 to 64 bit and the long history of four major releases that Safefish

09:20.000 --> 09:26.880
apps you will be as you will be able to use all of them now this is what it looks like a little

09:26.880 --> 09:36.280
bit less entertaining than the YOLO Star but also I think quite fun and then there's a newest

09:36.280 --> 09:44.480
contender of course because more options better and that's Chum it since recently has a web front

09:44.480 --> 09:52.000
end it also has no for pay apps it has 170 apps listed for Safefish and it includes and this is

09:52.600 --> 10:00.960
for me a total highlight because it's this cross project collaboration I'm talking about it includes

10:00.960 --> 10:09.800
some Kyrgyz apps by packaging a modern version of Qt because Safefish uses silica for its widgets

10:09.800 --> 10:17.440
and it's stuck on Qt 5.6 forgot to tell you that earlier I mean who wants to talk about those

10:17.480 --> 10:27.760
sites that aren't so nice and shiny but people made it work and you can run like cast Angerfisher

10:27.760 --> 10:36.760
web browser which is nice because sometimes you may want a Chromium web browser because the real

10:36.760 --> 10:44.160
web browser in Safefish or as is Gekko based which is also really unique and there will be a

10:44.160 --> 10:56.920
talk about that later on so yeah highlights I did a little impromptu poll on Masterdun I wanted

10:56.920 --> 11:02.280
to do something better but these are the highlights of Safefish OS so if you're using Safefish OS

11:02.280 --> 11:09.160
and you haven't installed those apps I mean what are you doing just take out your Safefish phone

11:09.280 --> 11:17.160
and then install them and maybe enter your security code yeah and then you can do this nice

11:17.160 --> 11:24.240
multitask gesturing thing I will not go into demoing apps on Safefish OS I did that for YouTube

11:24.240 --> 11:31.720
and I failed miserably people were making fun of me doing that again so yeah there's a lot Safefish

11:31.720 --> 11:38.920
OS connect by the way integrate with KDE connect so if that's not obvious and then we have even

11:38.960 --> 11:48.640
had contract so if you were like me having a relative that was in deep danger that was something

11:48.640 --> 11:57.400
to appreciate at the time I mean now no more tracking why would we so yeah then next one

11:57.400 --> 12:07.040
just at Safefish now let's go for a bunch of touch it's about as old if not older envisioned in

12:07.080 --> 12:18.000
2011 this is nice quarter on there so it was in 2011 that it was announced and it would Ubuntu

12:18.000 --> 12:26.000
would support smartphones tablets smart TV smart screens smart watches head units whatnot

12:26.000 --> 12:35.440
everything maybe peak Ubuntu I don't know and then they I left out the prepaid crowd

12:35.440 --> 12:45.760
for everybody else about that one and then had the first commercial device in 2015 February 2015

12:45.760 --> 12:57.160
so like nine years ago by now my man time flies and they'd used mirror which these days is a

12:57.200 --> 13:09.720
way than compositor but then wasn't upstart because yeah and unit 8 their own convergent thing unity

13:09.720 --> 13:21.200
hate is amazing it's now you know Mary thankfully because canonical eventually would drop that all

13:21.240 --> 13:29.960
that great effort because didn't have market success so another death by CEO if you will but it was

13:29.960 --> 13:35.080
picked up by the community and could be picked up by the community because it was completely open

13:35.080 --> 13:42.400
source so maybe that's one of those lessons so only trust projects that are completely open

13:42.400 --> 13:49.160
source because then it doesn't matter if they go under and yeah you be porters doing great

13:49.200 --> 14:00.240
drop the latest release was just a few days ago and the store situation is also pretty simple

14:00.240 --> 14:09.160
as the open store it has a web interface so you can browse it without having even to touch

14:09.160 --> 14:16.880
device and get an idea of what would be available even as ratings so can look into is this actually

14:16.920 --> 14:27.520
working and it has more apps for the older one than for the new one so really I think

14:27.520 --> 14:37.520
that those numbers you know with 210 whether it's about 610 I think it's actually 217

14:37.880 --> 14:47.520
215 by now but yeah who cares about the exact number that really should improve the open store

14:47.520 --> 14:56.120
has one neat feature I wanted to put a screenshot of that into my slides but who has the time so

14:56.120 --> 15:05.880
when you install an app on the open store it basically sometimes if that's specified next

15:05.920 --> 15:14.920
you for donation to the developer and I think if I remember correctly it may do that later on

15:14.920 --> 15:24.040
again and I know nagging nobody like likes to be necked me neither and nobody wants to feel

15:24.040 --> 15:29.520
bad because they don't have the time to fill out the details and do that stuff that you need to

15:29.560 --> 15:37.200
do that donation because it's also complicated because payment but I think that's a nice idea

15:37.200 --> 15:46.440
because you know giving something back and not just feedback does not work for me fail I don't

15:46.440 --> 15:53.600
know this is garbage you know maybe communicate friendly that might help and maybe donate if

15:53.640 --> 16:02.600
there's a way to keep this going you know we need to do that and then of course other ways to install

16:02.600 --> 16:09.520
apps so you can do you want to contain over 604 this was totally uninteresting for you know all

16:09.520 --> 16:17.080
those new apps we get to later because well in 1604 you want to 604 not much was mobile

16:17.080 --> 16:25.320
friendly in the GT cable they can type that and neither in KDE land really and then with 20 or 4

16:25.320 --> 16:31.080
it's a little bit better but you need to bring your own environment variable variables and then

16:31.080 --> 16:37.880
there's new development only work on some devices snaps are you can install snaps on you want to

16:37.880 --> 16:48.080
touch now snaps are known to be controversial but on a system like you want to touch which is also

16:48.080 --> 16:56.200
in a way immutable air quotes and was very early with that so that's another thing that's great I

16:56.200 --> 17:04.280
think it's nice to have another option to distribute software more widely and if snaps what's been

17:04.280 --> 17:10.360
added first got a sticker on my little tablet here that's just what I would have preferred but

17:10.360 --> 17:18.000
it's good to have really nice and well you need to bring your own and worse to make it scale properly

17:18.000 --> 17:25.840
but wouldn't be fun otherwise highlights you must know so if you do a poll on master then apparently

17:25.880 --> 17:34.880
people favor message on clients it's weird and Weber a tool for web app creation generally you

17:34.880 --> 17:41.720
want to touch has a bunch of web apps which is great they have a way to do those other projects

17:41.720 --> 17:48.560
should do that too because it's maybe is relatively simple way to make a service seem

17:48.560 --> 17:53.600
available from an app store because people don't think that there's web browser that they could

17:53.600 --> 18:03.680
use then Deco great email client well might use some work to get GPG award but I mean come on

18:03.680 --> 18:11.160
it's an email client didn't have that when it was on the canonical throne that was fun when I first

18:11.160 --> 18:15.080
tried you want to touch it was like what the fuck because the only email client that shipped was a

18:15.240 --> 18:26.600
Gmail client again whatever past memories and then you nav for navigation and then there are more

18:26.600 --> 18:34.160
some of those really should be brought over just some highlights I think you can read those yourself

18:34.160 --> 18:42.240
so fluffy flesh had flutters interesting because they did not ship GTK and flutter in that click

18:42.280 --> 18:48.760
package as far as I could concern they made it a web app so they flutter can do web apps and then

18:48.760 --> 18:55.440
they went that way so also interesting hack would like to see more of that and then there's an app

18:55.440 --> 19:05.400
for scooter for scooters you know those urban mobility shit supporting two services really

19:05.400 --> 19:13.840
great I don't know whether it works didn't try be friendly if you try and have bugs Tesla app

19:13.840 --> 19:23.560
don't have a Tesla no idea Nostar nobody needs Nostar but they have a client and it works for me

19:23.560 --> 19:29.960
because I try to go there with my blog and whatnot but and then of course it's body for a premium

19:29.960 --> 19:41.160
client because like assumptions earlier it's body for premium IP I works good so and then gaps

19:41.160 --> 19:51.200
briefly for this metrics apps maybe so yeah not not really happy with that situation it's

19:51.200 --> 19:57.200
interesting the element adaptation is something like a hack some CSS hacks on top of element desktop

19:58.160 --> 20:05.040
nice approach but of course something like that is prone to break it you basically patch the

20:05.040 --> 20:14.960
more moving target how to do just ask all the Android custom ROMs and then XMPP of course and

20:14.960 --> 20:21.560
desktop Firefox we want to touch that's one for the poll yeah that would be great now new contenders

20:21.560 --> 20:29.720
and that's the area I'm competent about which why I spend so much time on other shit to not talk

20:29.720 --> 20:40.000
about it too much so up top you see the UIs for or also mom shell I could have put another logo

20:40.000 --> 20:45.800
there plasma mobile and then as a joke because I'm not going to talk about thermal apps sorry

20:46.760 --> 20:56.440
as XMO it's it's awesome I use it on my pine phone pro and then distributions you know dang next

20:56.440 --> 21:02.920
post macros mobian fedora there's a mobility stick then that fun icon anybody know what the

21:03.080 --> 21:16.000
icon on the right is any hands yes no it's open mandrieva made made one image for the

21:16.000 --> 21:20.920
pine phone but I had to put it here we are right now as some rolling of but you want to

21:21.480 --> 21:29.920
mobile next OS nice to have that too and of course open zoos the lizards are here too so yeah

21:29.920 --> 21:41.560
and then of course how did that get started it's all history 2017 maybe 2020 live in five pine

21:41.720 --> 21:49.320
phone what's a project based on desktop distributions like we saw I've got two times

21:49.320 --> 21:59.600
there being in that list and many eyes plasma mobile with kirgami for apps for with first

21:59.600 --> 22:05.880
lipendi a widget library to make GTK apps more adaptive and then these days lip of

22:05.880 --> 22:14.200
data for GTK for which really made us rain to go so that's more of a success than I would

22:14.200 --> 22:23.720
have hoped for as a spectator on the sidelines really impressive and then the downsides well

22:23.720 --> 22:30.480
no proper app store solution ish hands links for naps for dog org you know I was really hoping

22:31.200 --> 22:37.920
that we wouldn't need that by now because you don't want to maintain a website that lists like

22:37.920 --> 22:47.160
I don't know 500 maybe including games these days apps and has to you have to check those and

22:47.160 --> 22:56.720
then does it still work oh no I don't know who has the time so these are all the fun UI

22:56.880 --> 23:03.600
frameworks that I used in apps listed on Linux for network most of these don't really matter

23:03.600 --> 23:12.520
and I already mentioned the ones that do really matter except maybe flutter because that's going

23:12.520 --> 23:20.720
somewhere well but we will touch the later this is just as an overview so there are plenty apps

23:21.040 --> 23:27.600
with Kirigami it's like hundred and forty naps listed so plus my mobile is going rather strong

23:27.600 --> 23:36.600
there no side goes a little bit stronger up top with a lipendi I mean I could also call

23:36.600 --> 23:43.800
the account GTK for and GTK 3 but some of those don't really super fit very well you know only

23:43.840 --> 23:50.920
with foch scale to fit heck and whatnot if you've been in that arena you've seen that

23:50.920 --> 24:01.720
rodeo it works and it's great to have it but it shouldn't be there so yeah the panty 66 lip

24:01.720 --> 24:09.600
advisor 156 used to be more in the panty camp stuff is moving over which is I think good to see

24:10.520 --> 24:17.360
I don't know why I've got one you bunch of components at there yeah I think it was

24:17.360 --> 24:23.680
future five before it was an open store and then programming languages well I think everybody

24:23.680 --> 24:29.360
here in here is more competent to judge this than me I can do a little bit Python and some CSS and

24:29.600 --> 24:39.120
HTML and whatnot and barely do JavaScript but so it comes with the with the toolkits right

24:40.240 --> 24:45.680
there are also some things that I did not know before I started this list I didn't know that there

24:45.680 --> 24:54.400
were GTK apps made with C++ I always assumed that was all cute but yeah you learn so looking at the

24:54.400 --> 25:02.720
interfaces you can use to browse software here's one that's really nice these days it's no software

25:03.280 --> 25:12.560
see that fun little thing there that says adaptive yeah that's great that's metadata if that were

25:12.560 --> 25:20.880
everywhere I could stop working on Linux phone apps boy would I love that so but we're not there yet

25:20.880 --> 25:30.720
so yeah it's tough so can show that and then there's even a fork that only lists the apps that are

25:32.960 --> 25:37.920
indicated to be adaptive you know you can always write anything in metadata nobody checks

25:38.960 --> 25:44.160
so you could claim your app is super adaptive and it's not but then you will get that feedback so

25:44.160 --> 25:50.160
don't do that and also don't do it because otherwise I really can't retire that website at any time

25:50.880 --> 26:03.040
yeah so and then discover well it doesn't show adaptiveness but the thing is if something is

26:03.040 --> 26:14.080
kirigami most of the time it should work except a few few things that don't but you don't need

26:14.080 --> 26:20.000
everything in your phone right then there are of course also some cute widget apps that also work

26:21.040 --> 26:22.880
only barely and if you're lucky

26:25.600 --> 26:34.640
yeah and then metadata it's beautiful so my day job isn't publishing and in publishing we still love

26:34.640 --> 26:44.640
xml and abstream metadata is also xml and so this is a common specification

26:45.600 --> 26:51.520
that has been extended over the years I think that started I don't know decades ago or maybe

26:52.720 --> 26:58.800
but it's definitely more than one decade at this point and there I have some links on the

26:58.800 --> 27:03.360
site on a blog post and form fractures how to specify those before that there was an intern

27:03.360 --> 27:09.920
specification by purism and you can put your licensing in there you can put description release

27:10.000 --> 27:16.720
loads you know go crazy and the good thing is except for the release notes if I

27:18.000 --> 27:23.120
execute a script I can pull all those nice informations into linux phone apps are no

27:23.120 --> 27:34.000
ain't that great so yeah if you are developing an app please add metadata maybe there's a meta

27:34.000 --> 27:41.200
info creator that makes that relatively easy I know it's some extra sure and it sucks and nobody

27:41.200 --> 27:48.480
has the time but it's I think it's really useful for people and if you maybe want to contribute

27:48.480 --> 27:56.960
and run through the code forges and find apps that don't have metadata and make merge or pull

27:56.960 --> 28:09.200
requests adding that metadata go for it thank you yeah but with that express the metadata sorry

28:09.200 --> 28:12.320
about my excitement for xml nobody likes that anymore I know

28:16.080 --> 28:24.640
highlights for apps I don't think I need to iterate through the app just highlight itinerary

28:25.360 --> 28:30.880
it's really a better travel companion than the app by Deutsche Bahn for example which I know

28:31.920 --> 28:38.000
very much unfortunately because it's generally not only taste you about delays but it also tells you

28:38.000 --> 28:46.720
how to get from that one platform you have to start changing trains on to the other platform so you

28:47.360 --> 28:52.880
can see that because it's not always that numbers that are next to each other are on the same platform

28:52.960 --> 29:00.960
and that matters if things are delayed once again and then angle fish nice mobile web browser also

29:00.960 --> 29:07.920
on SafeWishers like I mentioned and then pure maps pure maps again we had that before could also

29:07.920 --> 29:20.880
have been on the Ubuntu touch list pure maps well everywhere oh I forgot cast so sorry cast is

29:21.840 --> 29:26.400
it's also great it's really feature rich does chapter markers I like podcasts sorry

29:27.520 --> 29:36.560
and then highlights in the norm side well chats and calls because you know sms mms calls who wants to

29:36.560 --> 29:42.720
get phone calls but yeah people do and if all your stack works it works even as a

29:43.440 --> 29:47.920
yeah very worst client again that's from the poll and also it's really nice

29:48.720 --> 29:55.040
10 gram that's little thing for web apps you can also use it on your desktop all of these apps are

29:55.040 --> 30:00.880
also available on your desktop so if you don't have Linux phone you can also use all of these apps on

30:00.880 --> 30:07.680
the past two slides and they are also great on desktop because adaptive apps aim to be great

30:07.680 --> 30:15.440
anywhere and I think these listed here all succeeded that and then of course communication

30:16.160 --> 30:21.360
railway like maybe maybe I trouble the trains too much I don't know can you travel to the trains too

30:21.360 --> 30:33.840
much no idea and then spot Spotify premium again API magic and then flat sale because helps sometimes

30:34.560 --> 30:40.000
and then other highlights so these are apps that are on kiri gami and I've put two matrix clients

30:40.000 --> 30:46.320
and they may be I use too much metrics yeah and I must use too much metrics so one is using

30:46.960 --> 30:52.800
cute quick components to Nico and the other one is using flutter

30:55.040 --> 31:03.440
so special one apps that run anywhere on mobile Linux we had no pure maps

31:04.160 --> 31:14.080
maps navigation whatnot and maze fish smart watches and stuff is that and then kaitan that's an xmpp

31:14.080 --> 31:19.440
client and yeah it's only in ubuntu touch 64 that's why the asterisk is there but otherwise

31:20.560 --> 31:23.840
looks like building cute apps that are cross-platform is possible

31:24.560 --> 31:29.680
another special apps that run everywhere including legacy platforms

31:30.720 --> 31:37.840
so iOS and Android well see next talk flutter maybe I don't know we're really interested looking forward

31:37.840 --> 31:45.760
to that and then current gaps so what if you are have time and want to start here's the list

31:46.160 --> 31:52.080
we already saw that some of these things are solved somewhere I think you're going to touch also as a

31:52.080 --> 32:00.480
cryptocurrency wallet if you need that I don't know maybe you do and then of course what's that yeah

32:01.120 --> 32:07.120
tough and then more current gaps that I found elsewhere attention grabbing social media I think

32:07.120 --> 32:13.120
we need Instagram and TikTok to make that mainstream and we need Facebook for the Grand

32:13.360 --> 32:23.760
Parents and we need office clients to edit fucked word documents and shit and axler well you

32:23.760 --> 32:33.200
need that there are some approaches by the way that's one kt app and then yeah so gaps this

32:33.280 --> 32:43.360
brings me to packaging um aside from metadata you know releasing an app helps I'm not explicitly

32:43.360 --> 32:50.320
said stating that I'm looking at k delta chat in this very moment but I am so that's nice

32:50.320 --> 32:59.840
app it works delta chat is encrypted chat via email protocols nice but no release so not package

32:59.840 --> 33:12.160
anywhere aside from a u r and xOS yeah and also I mean maybe maybe flat up so in my little impromptu

33:12.160 --> 33:17.440
poll one answer was and that made me really so yeah this app seems great I'm looking very much

33:17.440 --> 33:27.200
forward to it land in db and stable and I'm like oh god this person is patient should learn something

33:27.200 --> 33:40.000
from them crazy yeah so please if you maintain an app maybe do that toggle thing release it at some

33:40.000 --> 33:47.520
point you know don't release it while it doesn't work won't help anyone but maybe release it once it

33:47.520 --> 33:54.320
when it won't when it barely works because it works barely but works then of course

33:55.040 --> 33:59.040
flatter apps build only for x86 64 linux

34:01.040 --> 34:06.720
electrode apps build only for 886 64 linux what the fuck signal

34:08.560 --> 34:14.640
and then generally apps build only for x86 64 linux you know aside from doing this mobile

34:14.640 --> 34:22.000
linux phone thing I've been running arm laptops for years and it's I mean now with fast arm laptops

34:22.000 --> 34:30.320
it's less of a problem you can compile shit but oh god imagine the pine book and then compiling a big

34:30.880 --> 34:38.080
electron app I mean you can't do that but boy that's like waiting for stuff landing in db and stable

34:41.040 --> 34:48.320
yeah then future challenges things get worse actually more and more services disappear behind

34:48.960 --> 34:54.640
apps and they in apps that are you know on the android side require play service often

34:56.160 --> 35:02.400
and thus don't easily work in bed right and that's a deal for public and private services so I think

35:03.840 --> 35:11.040
this is some german examples who cares but yeah we need virtualized android maybe we need to reverse

35:11.600 --> 35:16.640
engineer other things or we need to push government well governments I mean we're in brussels here

35:18.400 --> 35:27.040
double capital Belgium and the EU and NATO they're not state whatever but yeah so

35:28.240 --> 35:33.600
technical solution obvious one is the web and then of course what would I like to see more cross

35:33.600 --> 35:38.800
project collaboration in the app space I think I stress that enough but I've made it it's

35:38.800 --> 35:46.160
stress it enough to access to non-distribute sources easier and distributions and now that's

35:46.160 --> 35:53.280
controversial like enabling flat up from the get go and maybe even the snap store oh god people

35:53.280 --> 36:00.400
with throats brings at me and then donation bagging and other app install things maybe a future for

36:00.400 --> 36:08.240
software thingies and then a bug tracker like mozilla's platform tilt if you don't know they list

36:08.480 --> 36:16.400
this stuff whether disadvantage by last large companies also goes into that political avenue

36:17.760 --> 36:25.120
and help with linux phone apps or or so yeah yeah I want to make it a progressive web app I want to

36:25.120 --> 36:32.720
make search and filtering better but yeah who has time so conclusions I hope this wasn't too overwhelming

36:32.720 --> 36:40.080
or boring there may be more apps than you'd think regarding initial assumptions I think

36:40.640 --> 36:47.360
honestly despite trying to prove it people are just scratching their itch and that is perfectly fine

36:49.280 --> 36:58.640
so thank you this is the stuff where can reach me and where the next four minutes are always and

36:58.880 --> 37:04.800
if you want to contribute from agate it has issues with sign in so send just send that

37:04.800 --> 37:12.560
page to the mailing list and that last link is a really cursed really bad my skills at web development

37:12.560 --> 37:28.160
level thing that helps to create things time for questions thank you very much Peter any

37:28.160 --> 37:37.520
questions from the audience ha successfully over they're all taking it in still bored them to tears

37:38.240 --> 37:45.520
I'd ask the question oh it's actually not a question it's a statement this is David but no I just

37:45.520 --> 37:51.040
wanted to I wanted to thank you for taking all your time and preparing the weekly post as a user of

37:51.040 --> 37:55.920
mobile linux not so much a coder it has been huge to get me in the community to keep me in the

37:55.920 --> 38:00.000
community keep me up to speed with everything that's happening I realize that one person can't

38:00.000 --> 38:06.160
always do it but I just want to say thank you thank you that helps keep going

38:11.760 --> 38:16.160
another question or statement yeah in the back we'll take a second

38:16.560 --> 38:30.560
so I too want to have a Linux phone so can you please tell me how much time it's suffering do

38:30.560 --> 38:41.280
I have to you have to give to to achieve that goal depends on your approach so I think it's

38:41.280 --> 38:46.080
impossible to answer without knowing your specific use cases and the services you want to use and

38:46.480 --> 38:50.480
how much pain you're willing to go through or whether you're going to be like well you know

38:50.480 --> 39:00.960
wait right fine and also it depends on which hardware you choose but to go to hardware choices we

39:00.960 --> 39:07.840
need first to establish which distribution you go on and then go down some huge decision tree maybe

39:07.840 --> 39:14.560
that's a talk for next foster I have a pine phone but it's lying on my desk for I'm so it's catching

39:14.800 --> 39:23.680
us like most of those yeah I've got one of those too so many two of those yeah so pine phone of

39:23.680 --> 39:32.080
course since I've been paid by post marketer has no post marketer is amazing Mobian is also amazing

39:32.640 --> 39:42.240
think those safe choices and then try to solve your issues one thing at a time but if you have

39:42.320 --> 39:51.200
issues with your carrier and reliability and stuff then yeah it's get tough so maybe maybe

39:51.200 --> 39:59.760
different device maybe different carrier it's it's complicated okay I keep on dreaming do that

39:59.760 --> 40:12.560
a question from the matrix what do you think of box 64 I think we can use this to run some of our

40:12.560 --> 40:20.320
x86 64 programs as a current worker on until we have a 64 version of the binaries I think in some

40:20.320 --> 40:25.760
cases this is definitely useful and I think people love that for proprietary games mainly

40:26.480 --> 40:32.480
um with some electron apps you can actually use an arm 64 electron runtime and then run that

40:34.800 --> 40:41.120
so it's not always necessary to go that route but I mean why not so I personally haven't played

40:41.120 --> 40:45.920
with that because I am too thick to understand the instructions and don't have the time but yeah box

40:45.920 --> 40:58.240
64 also great just emulate shit works all right another question yeah there's one okay please pass on Mike

41:02.960 --> 41:07.840
hi once again I echo the comment thank you very much for your weekly

41:08.800 --> 41:14.240
lim mob log of everything that's going on in linux mobile but my question is I well I think it's

41:14.240 --> 41:20.160
about purism about a year ago talked about a payment mechanism for developers I think maybe it's

41:20.160 --> 41:23.840
like a theory of it but I don't know if there's any you know anything about that about how that might

41:23.840 --> 41:30.320
be changing the landscape of linux mobile apps well I think it would be very good to have some

41:32.800 --> 41:38.640
thing like that and they are in a place to do that as a business they've got an easier route to that

41:38.640 --> 41:48.800
than all these non-profits um but I haven't don't have any news so I very much look forward to

41:48.800 --> 41:55.840
something like that but as far as I know it's not happened yet thanks please give another round of applause
