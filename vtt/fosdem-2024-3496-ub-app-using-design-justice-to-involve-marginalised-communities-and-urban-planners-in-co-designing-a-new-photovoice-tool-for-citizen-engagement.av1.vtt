WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.900
Thank you. Yes, sir. As already mentioned, my name is Sophie and I work at the Techno

00:12.900 --> 00:19.560
Anthropology Lab in Copenhagen. I'm here to share with you an app that me and colleagues

00:19.560 --> 00:25.440
and local urban planners and local marginalized communities in Copenhagen have developed.

00:25.440 --> 00:30.200
It's called the Urban Belonging app and of course it's open source. But the reason why

00:30.200 --> 00:34.440
I'm really here to talk about it is because I think the process of how we made the app

00:34.440 --> 00:42.000
is really interesting. So, okay. First of all, PhotoVoice is good to know what that even

00:42.000 --> 00:48.080
is and this is kind of a participatory action research methodology that has been developed

00:48.080 --> 00:54.960
especially to find methods and ways of evolving illiterate communities and has been developed

00:54.960 --> 01:00.400
through kind of 60s and 70s and in the 90s it was really kind of stabilized as a method

01:00.400 --> 01:05.120
with a lot of kind of frameworks and publications coming out. That frames this as a method to

01:05.120 --> 01:10.520
involve local communities in kind of contributing their perspectives and their experiences on

01:10.520 --> 01:15.600
particular issues. And it often also involves not just kind of capturing photos and giving

01:15.600 --> 01:21.680
cameras to local residents and communities but also involving those communities in kind

01:21.720 --> 01:28.480
of selecting and highlighting and doing storytelling with those photos. So kind of a longer participatory

01:28.480 --> 01:35.200
process. And to situate kind of where we developed this app, this was a development that came

01:35.200 --> 01:40.280
out of a project called the Urban Belonging project, hence the name of the app. And this

01:40.280 --> 01:44.720
was really a project that set out to kind of map marginalized perspectives on the city.

01:44.720 --> 01:50.240
So it was rooted in kind of urban planning context and asked, you know, how can we involve

01:50.280 --> 01:55.960
different marginalized communities to shed light on different perspectives on the city?

01:55.960 --> 02:02.960
And in the process we need new citizen engagement tools that kind of re-tool citizen science

02:02.960 --> 02:09.160
and maybe challenge some of the problems that we've seen in the field. So the project involves

02:09.160 --> 02:14.800
a range of different research partners and urban planning partners both in Copenhagen

02:14.800 --> 02:19.040
and in Amsterdam. But most importantly for what I'll say today is that it involved these

02:19.120 --> 02:25.200
different community partners that represented the communities we wanted to in the end use the app.

02:25.200 --> 02:32.000
So we had LGBT plus people, people with physical disabilities, homeless folks, ethnic minorities,

02:32.000 --> 02:39.160
people with mental vulnerabilities, deaf people and also international expats. And so what we

02:39.160 --> 02:44.000
wanted to do in the project was to involve these groups in mapping their experiences of belonging

02:44.000 --> 02:48.480
in the city. And we found out that it was really important to kind of involve the groups from

02:48.480 --> 02:53.680
the beginning and even framing and designing the project. And we used, as I'll get back to,

02:53.680 --> 02:58.800
their inputs to frame kind of the specs and the design of the photo voice app that we then created.

02:59.760 --> 03:04.720
And then the communities went out and used that to kind of collect different data points about the

03:04.720 --> 03:10.560
city, which was then kind of interpreted in these community led workshops and it resulted all in

03:10.560 --> 03:17.040
kind of different exhibitions and co-creation of new frameworks of what does it mean to design

03:17.040 --> 03:22.400
cities for belonging. So that's kind of the overall project. But if we hone in on the development

03:22.400 --> 03:28.960
of the app, which is really what I'm here to talk about, as I already kind of signified in the title,

03:28.960 --> 03:34.240
the project really takes inspiration in two things. So on one hand data feminism and on the other hand

03:34.240 --> 03:41.520
design justice. And so design justice, it kind of tells us that even if we're really well-meaning

03:41.520 --> 03:48.400
as designers, you know, we kind of, we often end up having these abstract ideas or ways of

03:48.400 --> 03:54.000
representing community needs. And most importantly, most of the kind of strategies involved creating

03:54.000 --> 03:58.880
these abstractions where the communities are not at the table of the design process. So we think

03:58.880 --> 04:05.520
that we're being kind of inclusive and so on. But at the end of the day, if the communities that we

04:06.640 --> 04:11.440
assume will use a technology are not at the table themselves, they're not fully represented.

04:11.920 --> 04:17.840
And so Costantel Schaak tells us that, you know, involving communities and community members is

04:17.840 --> 04:25.200
kind of the most important thing to do, not just because of justice and kind of fairness, but

04:25.200 --> 04:30.960
also because community members will essentially have knowledge and experiences and perspectives

04:30.960 --> 04:38.000
that we cannot imagine as a kind of homogeneous group of designers. So this is kind of design

04:38.000 --> 04:42.720
justice. And then on the other hand, we have, or supplementary way, we have data feminism, which

04:42.720 --> 04:49.600
tells us that data infrastructures often are, you know, kind of reproducing or

04:52.400 --> 04:57.760
enlargening the biases and the hierarchies that already exist in society, especially when it's a

04:57.760 --> 05:03.280
homogeneous group of privileged people that sit and do the technology design and design of data

05:03.280 --> 05:09.280
infrastructures. So data can be used and often is used to kind of oppress and exclude and extract.

05:10.160 --> 05:15.520
But of course, we can also think of those same infrastructures and practices as opportunities

05:15.520 --> 05:24.800
of kind of liberation and co-creation. So with these kind of jumping off points, we went into a

05:24.800 --> 05:32.960
design process for our app that really involved a lot of different stakeholders. And as you can kind

05:33.040 --> 05:38.800
of see in this visualization, that becomes very messy. So it's not so linear and easy and predictable

05:38.800 --> 05:45.520
as we maybe would often like, but also it yields really interesting results. So as signified in

05:45.520 --> 05:51.040
the top corner here, we had a research team in Copenhagen, STS, digital methods researchers,

05:51.040 --> 05:56.160
we had visual methodologies researchers from Amsterdam. We also had kind of a starting point

05:56.160 --> 06:01.520
which was that we actually built on an open source app that even existed to begin with,

06:01.520 --> 06:06.560
which of course then had built in epistemologies and so on that we needed to kind of work with.

06:07.280 --> 06:12.240
But then we involved kind of planning practitioners, we involved citizen engagement professionals,

06:12.240 --> 06:18.880
so the people in Copenhagen that work with citizen engagement every day. And then importantly also

06:18.880 --> 06:24.240
the community organizations themselves, which are kind of the red dots. And I think even mapping

06:24.240 --> 06:29.520
and being transparent about when do different kind of actors have an input in such a process

06:30.080 --> 06:36.320
can be an important step of kind of situating our tool and being transparent about how it's made.

06:37.440 --> 06:42.720
But to kind of give you a few deep dives into then well what does the tool do and how was it

06:42.720 --> 06:50.240
shaped in its kind of features by these different actors. So first of all kind of the research

06:50.240 --> 06:55.200
team of course started with talking to urban planners and citizen engagement professionals

06:55.200 --> 07:02.800
about why are we not using photo voice more often when we want to involve a local perspective

07:02.800 --> 07:08.320
in urban planning. And certain kind of limitations arise both from these practitioners but also

07:08.320 --> 07:13.200
from the photo voice literature. And one is that you know photo voice often collects a really

07:13.200 --> 07:18.320
small number of photos and have a pretty limited also sample of participants. And that's because

07:18.320 --> 07:25.360
the way it's done right now is really kind of hands on that a researcher will send emails out

07:25.360 --> 07:30.720
to different participants and ask them to go and use the camera in their smartphone to take pictures

07:30.720 --> 07:35.440
and then send them via WhatsApp or email or something to the researcher who then has to sit

07:35.440 --> 07:40.400
there and kind of keep track on the different participants and the different images that are

07:40.400 --> 07:46.000
coming in and they come in in very unstructured formats as well. So that leads to the second limitation

07:46.000 --> 07:51.760
which is that photo voice data tends to be really unstructured. You can imagine that if you just ask

07:51.760 --> 07:58.000
people to send you photos in a text or on email it will be really different what different participants

07:58.000 --> 08:06.480
do and how much kind of captions and annotations of those images they send. So there's kind of an

08:06.480 --> 08:11.760
issue there that makes it very difficult to actually kind of scale and to use as a stable method.

08:12.480 --> 08:17.840
Then data is also not so safely stored when we ask people to just kind of send these images in you

08:17.840 --> 08:23.200
know text messages or whatever. Then because of this kind of handheld approach it also means

08:23.200 --> 08:27.760
that most projects they tend to focus on one marginalized group because it's really difficult

08:27.760 --> 08:32.560
to manage a lot of different users within different kind of communities and so on. And that is of

08:32.560 --> 08:38.160
course a huge limitation if we want to kind of bring different groups together around discussing

08:39.120 --> 08:47.600
issues at an kind of urban scale. And then finally because it's again pretty handheld the way it has

08:47.600 --> 08:52.480
been done so far it also means that researchers tend to tell the participants where they should go

08:52.480 --> 08:58.240
to capture photos because you need to kind of know geographically where the data is coming from

08:58.800 --> 09:04.160
and since you're not really tracking that at a systematic scale in terms of geocoding or geotacking

09:04.240 --> 09:10.640
the result is often that you're kind of already framing where it matters to go and look at a

09:10.640 --> 09:17.440
certain phenomena. That's of course kind of something we could tweak or rethink. So the app that we've

09:17.440 --> 09:24.080
developed has these key features so it enables kind of a structured collection of photos where

09:24.080 --> 09:29.600
users can be invited into different groups and tasks and are given a certain prompt that of

09:29.600 --> 09:35.120
course can be customized and then that means that we know in response to what is it that we're

09:35.120 --> 09:40.640
actually getting photos collected. Then the app also geotracks where the photos are taken and the

09:40.640 --> 09:46.880
walks that people are kind of going on while capturing these photos. And then most interestingly

09:46.880 --> 09:53.520
I think for kind of quality quantitative research purposes is that we can ask participants to annotate

09:53.520 --> 09:59.040
their images when they collect them on the spot. So we have no issue with kind of recall

09:59.920 --> 10:05.040
problems or memory problems and we get this structured kind of metadata on our images.

10:05.760 --> 10:11.280
And then to add an even other layer we also can ask participants to react to each other's photos.

10:12.080 --> 10:17.520
And so that means that we can start to get this really kind of rich data where we know how the

10:17.520 --> 10:22.880
person who's an author of a photo feels about it but also how other people that look at that same

10:22.880 --> 10:29.680
photo feel about it. That of course invites as you can imagine network analysis and all these

10:29.680 --> 10:36.080
different kind of analytical opportunities open up. So just to show you kind of an example of what

10:36.080 --> 10:41.120
that looks like this is the very simple interface where you can either go for a walk or you can just

10:41.120 --> 10:48.400
take a single picture then you start a task and you kind of are prompted with whatever is the

10:48.400 --> 10:57.280
prompt defined for the particular group. And here I'm on university Wi-Fi so the little devil wheel

10:57.280 --> 11:02.400
is spinning out of control but then when you take the photo what happens is that you're moved into

11:02.400 --> 11:08.160
this annotation space. So you're asked to also say something about the photo and this can be customized

11:08.160 --> 11:14.080
of course project by project what are the interesting kind of metadata points to collect.

11:14.640 --> 11:19.600
You can have kind of scale questions different categories you can have open answer

11:21.040 --> 11:26.640
other categories and so on. And then you can keep going and you can do this either as a single task

11:26.640 --> 11:31.440
you can go on these kind of walks where you you maybe go for half an hour in an area and you

11:31.440 --> 11:37.040
collect multiple photos and then we both track the individual photos but also the way you move

11:37.040 --> 11:42.880
through the city or the space to train. Okay so those are kind of the core features but then as I

11:42.880 --> 11:47.280
have already mentioned the important thing here was that the communities that we wanted to use the

11:47.280 --> 11:53.200
app were involved in kind of designing the specs for it. So some of the things that we learned in

11:53.200 --> 11:58.640
that process I'll just give you a few examples and I mean the list is really exhaustive but just

11:58.640 --> 12:05.280
kind of to give you some pointers of what this can offer. We had a representative from the homeless

12:05.280 --> 12:10.720
group say that you know while homeless people are used to using smartphones and taking pictures

12:11.440 --> 12:16.640
they're really not kind of trained in the Instagram like aesthetics and visual hierarchies of how to

12:17.360 --> 12:21.520
take certain pictures that look in certain kind of way and so they were really worried

12:21.520 --> 12:27.600
that if we invited multiple groups to deliver photos to this project these kind of visual

12:27.600 --> 12:34.000
hierarchies might mean that certain perspectives are foregrounded more than others if you don't have

12:34.000 --> 12:39.520
kind of visual aesthetic skills in framing and taking photos in a certain way. And a similar thing

12:39.520 --> 12:44.320
was highlighted by the Danish Deaf Association representative who said that you know the deaf

12:44.320 --> 12:49.760
community is a highly visual culture but they were worried that if you want people to kind of

12:49.760 --> 12:54.960
document the challenges and the negative things in the city it's really important that people

12:54.960 --> 13:03.120
don't feel a pressure to take photos in a certain kind of way. And so these kind of inputs informed

13:03.120 --> 13:08.560
decisions to not have any editing or filtering options for instance in the app so when you take

13:08.880 --> 13:14.320
photos on the spot and you cannot edit or change them so the light is the light and the way it

13:14.320 --> 13:19.680
looks is the way it looks and we also had decisions to kind of standardize the photos to a square

13:19.680 --> 13:25.920
format so that there's not like differences between what kinds of phones people have and what are the

13:25.920 --> 13:33.120
ratios of the photos and so on and how good are people at framing. We also kind of left out the

13:33.200 --> 13:40.400
option to upload images from the library so this was a kind of purposeful choice to make it to make

13:40.400 --> 13:46.560
sure that people had to be kind of in situ in the city capture things as they are when they see them

13:47.360 --> 13:52.320
and avoid these visual hierarchies that some people can take a million photos and go home and

13:52.320 --> 13:57.920
edit it and then kind of upload the good ones. This has since changed because we've developed the app

13:57.920 --> 14:02.960
of course to be able to also do other things so now you can indeed upload from a library but

14:04.960 --> 14:09.440
another kind of thing that came up from all these different communities was a course a lot of issues

14:09.440 --> 14:15.920
with trust so they have been involved many times by the city this is not only the case in Copenhagen

14:15.920 --> 14:22.000
but everywhere in the world these types of communities are so tired of being involved in

14:22.000 --> 14:26.400
kind of false processes that don't give them any control over the data that they contribute

14:27.360 --> 14:31.200
and where they are not really sure kind of what the data is being used for and

14:32.160 --> 14:36.640
if they wanted to go and kind of delete the data or pull it out of a data set that's really kind

14:36.640 --> 14:42.320
of difficult for them. So we also designed the app to have kind of different features that would

14:42.320 --> 14:48.320
support trust with the community so one is that participants are anonymous in the app so you

14:48.320 --> 14:53.280
cannot kind of know who has taken which kinds of photos and that's of course really important

14:53.360 --> 15:00.880
as it means that it is in workshops or other kind of formats that participants can choose to say

15:00.880 --> 15:05.360
that they have taken certain photos and unfold them and they can also choose to not do that.

15:06.640 --> 15:11.440
We have an option to invite people with email to the app but we also have an option to just

15:11.440 --> 15:17.840
pre-generate kind of anonymous user IDs and invite people via that. We give participants

15:17.840 --> 15:22.960
control over when and how the tracking the geotracking in the app starts and ends

15:23.840 --> 15:28.560
and we give participants options to always see the data that they've collected and contributed

15:28.560 --> 15:34.000
and to always delete it directly within the app. So these are just kind of some of the features

15:34.000 --> 15:40.240
that came from this involvement but I think they're really important in in securing kind of trust

15:40.240 --> 15:45.520
with the communities. So I'll just show you a few kind of examples of what are the kind of analytical

15:45.520 --> 15:50.960
affordances then that this type of data collection opens for. So using the example of the urban

15:50.960 --> 15:57.440
belonging project we had more than a hundred walks by 33 different participants and we had

15:57.440 --> 16:04.880
1400 and some photos collected and of course as I've said you can geolocate them and see where

16:04.880 --> 16:10.160
they are in the city and how people move. You have the images themselves which can be analyzed in a

16:10.160 --> 16:15.120
number of ways. You can use AI but of course you can also use the annotations that people have

16:15.120 --> 16:23.760
created themselves. We even have the reactions that I mentioned so this map for instance shows

16:23.760 --> 16:30.560
distributions of photos with the sentiment in the middle of the dot coming from the author

16:30.560 --> 16:36.400
themselves but then also other people's sentiments or how they feel when they saw the photo and

16:36.400 --> 16:42.640
reacted to it within the app. This is kind of shown as a circle around and this of course is

16:42.640 --> 16:48.880
really interesting in workshops as you can bring up kind of more contested photos and say well why

16:48.880 --> 16:57.280
why are we disagreeing or agreeing on something. We can open kind of geospatial types of analysis

16:57.280 --> 17:03.120
and see well where are different people taking different kinds of photos and we can even zoom

17:03.120 --> 17:07.920
in on kind of the very local level and look at this kind of route data and see well how are

17:07.920 --> 17:15.360
different people moving in and out of a space. So yeah we're seeing this being used for really

17:15.360 --> 17:21.680
interesting kind of analytical cases. These annotations that people are giving to the photos

17:21.680 --> 17:27.680
also helps to zoom in on certain issues. For instance we could see in our project that photos of urban

17:27.680 --> 17:33.280
nature which is what people have said their photos are about predominantly were associated with a

17:33.280 --> 17:38.480
positive sentiment and so that can kind of inform you know zooming in and filtering your data and

17:38.480 --> 17:43.200
looking specifically at photos of nature if that is what is interesting in your project.

17:45.520 --> 17:52.400
So we've done kind of this development of the app for this project but then since then we have

17:52.400 --> 17:58.080
kind of open sourced it and kept developing a whole toolkit around it to make it as accessible

17:58.080 --> 18:03.120
for as many people as possible. So we now have kind of a web-based interface where you can go

18:03.120 --> 18:09.200
and manage groups and set up the tasks and do different translations of the tasks again to

18:09.200 --> 18:15.360
make it accessible. There's an easy overview and export of the data for people that are not programmers

18:17.440 --> 18:24.240
and this is of course really important to make sure that local NGOs, architects, designers,

18:24.240 --> 18:30.560
all kinds of groups without kind of data science expertise can also use it. And then we have this

18:30.560 --> 18:36.640
kind of interactive data dashboard that is just easy to generate and so this is an example of what

18:36.640 --> 18:42.480
that looks like and every kind of project that uses the app can just kind of easily generate

18:44.320 --> 18:49.920
this kind of interactive way of publishing your results or your data set.

18:49.920 --> 19:03.360
So with all of this said we've been really kind of happy to see that the tool which is hosted at

19:03.360 --> 19:11.600
University of Olbo but it's open source it has been kind of used in different ways so we have a lot

19:11.600 --> 19:17.120
of people who are using kind of our version at the university but we also have different companies

19:17.120 --> 19:21.440
who have grabbed the code and set up their own version of this app which is of course what we

19:21.440 --> 19:28.240
wanted and so we've seen really kind of interesting use cases. Gale Architects who were also a partner

19:28.240 --> 19:32.720
in this project they've set up their own version of the app and are running all kinds of different

19:32.720 --> 19:38.880
projects with that. We have had an early use case of the DVSA which is an NGO in Seattle

19:39.520 --> 19:45.120
use it to map environmental justice issues, artworkers with disabilities is another kind of NGO

19:45.120 --> 19:50.880
with different researchers using it so cultural heritage project in Italy and currently the

19:50.880 --> 19:56.880
University of Copenhagen is using it to map perceptions of nature and we also have kind of

19:57.680 --> 20:06.400
municipalities and policymakers use it in relation to urban development. So this is really positive

20:06.400 --> 20:14.720
but I'm also faced with a few questions that I can share with you as I round off. So one is

20:15.120 --> 20:21.200
well what kind of community-based financial model can we set up to secure the kind of continuous

20:21.200 --> 20:27.440
maintenance and development especially as we want to host a version of this app at the university

20:27.440 --> 20:33.360
that can be used by NGOs and so on that don't have resources to set up their own app.

20:36.320 --> 20:42.320
How do we kind of continue to involve marginalized communities and perspectives in how the app

20:42.320 --> 20:49.360
is tweaked and developed from here and then finally kind of how do we offer up this tool

20:49.360 --> 20:56.320
while warning against techno solutionism so because the tool is developed as an inclusive tool we've

20:56.320 --> 21:01.760
also seen some bad use cases where it has just kind of been used without much thought about

21:02.480 --> 21:06.960
methodology or anything else and it actually ends up really disappointing the communities that it's

21:06.960 --> 21:12.480
supposed to serve. So those are some of my kind of questions that I'm struggling with right now

21:12.480 --> 21:16.960
and that we are working to figure out. Yes.

21:24.960 --> 21:29.360
Great we have a lot of time for questions around maybe seven minutes.

21:29.680 --> 21:36.960
Yeah hi thank you. What came to mind was this whole kind of gift exchange for.

21:36.960 --> 21:44.160
Sorry what? Gift exchange. Oh yeah. Is it then data for use of the system or to go back to answer

21:44.160 --> 21:53.520
your questions can it be that we'll receive vouchers or some kind of I don't know events or food

21:53.520 --> 21:59.600
source or something something else that they the participants get in return for. For participating.

21:59.600 --> 22:05.200
Yes exactly. Yes like a larger framework that could be incorporated into the system. Yeah.

22:05.200 --> 22:10.880
So that was my question like where does the data go. Repeat the question. Well I hope that I understand

22:10.880 --> 22:17.440
it correctly but I think you're asking how can you design kind of measures into the to such a

22:17.440 --> 22:21.440
project that actually also gives something back to the communities that are donating their time

22:21.440 --> 22:26.720
and their data. Is that correct. Yes. Yeah I think that's really important and it's very different

22:26.720 --> 22:30.800
what you can do. I mean there's a lot of rules for instance on the university that we can't just

22:30.800 --> 22:36.960
like pay people but I was participating in this project in Seattle where they could do that.

22:36.960 --> 22:41.840
They could actually pay participants an hourly wage for that time and that's of course like the most

22:41.840 --> 22:47.120
useful if you can do that but if you can't then you can find other things to do. So in our project

22:47.200 --> 22:52.960
for instance we did professional headshot photos of all the participants both to kind of use if

22:52.960 --> 22:58.960
they gave permission for that in our report on the project but also for them to use professionally

22:58.960 --> 23:04.000
and that was actually pretty popular and so we tried to find we gave movie tickets and all these

23:04.000 --> 23:09.680
other things right. And I think depending on where you are in the world food kind of vouchers

23:09.680 --> 23:12.640
and stuff like that can be really helpful. Yeah.

23:16.480 --> 23:21.120
Kind of a not fun question but one thing that was lacking in the presentation which was amazing

23:21.120 --> 23:28.480
great is what about the content moderation on the photos? Content moderation? Yeah well that

23:28.480 --> 23:35.600
is the sign into the kind of this kind of this kind of interface that we have online.

23:36.400 --> 23:42.080
So you each participant can only see their own photos so I mean that's pretty protected

23:42.800 --> 23:49.520
and then there's the the moment where you if you want to as a project manager to open the photo

23:49.520 --> 23:56.000
the collective collected kind of photo library up to people so they can see and react to each other

23:56.000 --> 24:02.240
before that happens there's a moderation feature so you can in this interface you can go as a

24:02.240 --> 24:07.040
project manager and say you know are there some of these photos that shouldn't be circulated out to

24:07.040 --> 24:14.080
everyone and of course as a project manager you can also choose to ask participants to go and

24:14.080 --> 24:19.120
review their own photos and delete the ones that they wouldn't have others look at. So it's giving

24:19.120 --> 24:23.760
kind of the tools to the project manager and the participants to do this. Yeah.

24:25.840 --> 24:30.000
I think this is really important kind of point from data feminism is this idea of

24:30.000 --> 24:35.600
paradox of exposure so this kind of sensitivity and awareness that creating visibility is not

24:35.600 --> 24:41.120
just always positive but can also lead to harm and to kind of negative outcomes and so we've really

24:41.920 --> 24:45.040
thought about that a lot and I think it's really important to design for that

24:45.600 --> 24:50.160
both in the tool but also in the process of how you actually use it. Yeah.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.960
Oh there was one there.

25:00.000 --> 25:06.240
Positive neutral or negative. Did you give any thought about like the difference between a photo

25:06.240 --> 25:14.000
being truly neutral versus there's good and there's bad and I see both and so I would classify as neutral.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.800
Is there any way to like get this information out of a picture or is there something that

25:18.800 --> 25:22.800
someone would need to go and like examine after we have something?

25:23.760 --> 25:31.440
Yeah. Well that's a complicated thing to answer in a very short way but the question is how can you

25:32.240 --> 25:38.880
distinguish between positive negative and kind of neutral versus well ambiguous that there's

25:38.880 --> 25:43.440
both positive and negative in the same photo and in our project the urban long project we had the

25:43.440 --> 25:48.800
middle category be kind of ambiguous so that was how we defined it and other people maybe choose to

25:49.280 --> 25:53.200
say that the middle category is neutral or whatever I think that really depends on context

25:54.000 --> 26:00.320
but I also think that what we did here was create an app that can that can generate this really

26:00.880 --> 26:06.480
enriched data set but our entire process was set up around having participatory workshops

26:07.040 --> 26:12.000
so we brought this data to people we brought the photos we brought the maps and so on and then

26:12.000 --> 26:18.160
asked them to tell us and so really the answer is that we cannot answer the question but that we

26:18.160 --> 26:23.680
should bring this data back to people and use the visual nature of it to engage dialogue

26:24.480 --> 26:29.600
and so it might be both ways really but the participants can say so.

26:30.080 --> 26:30.560
Yeah.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.040
Sorry what? The policy makers did they show any interest?

26:51.440 --> 26:58.080
Yes. Yes the cities and city kind of municipalities and city councils and so on they

26:58.080 --> 27:02.560
know that they have a problem like they are lacking tools to engage diverse perspectives

27:02.560 --> 27:08.240
and as we did here multiple groups and not just kind of tokenizing and involving one minority group

27:09.200 --> 27:14.320
so they need this sort of tools and they needed to be structured because that is what gives validity

27:14.320 --> 27:19.680
to a political decision right and that was what was missing before with this kind of handheld

27:19.680 --> 27:26.400
approach to photovoice. Thank you so much.
