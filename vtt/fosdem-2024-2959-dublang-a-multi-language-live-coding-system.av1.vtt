00:00.000 --> 00:13.320
Hello, thank you first the organization for accepting my talk and thank you for coming.

00:13.320 --> 00:19.760
And in this talk I will present software that I am developing since I think two years ago

00:19.760 --> 00:22.040
named the Dublang.

00:22.040 --> 00:25.680
It's a multi-language live coding system.

00:25.680 --> 00:32.400
And then I will do a very short presentation here with a small video demonstration.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.960
And first a bit about my profile.

00:34.960 --> 00:43.040
I work as a research software engineer inside the project named Cortex Platform in France

00:43.040 --> 00:46.640
inside the University Gustave Eiffel.

00:46.640 --> 00:53.240
Also I am a collaborator of the software heritage project as an ambassador and a debunk

00:53.240 --> 00:55.880
contributor and also as a hobby.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.720
I am a live coder and visual artist.

00:58.720 --> 01:04.400
I am very interested in live coding to produce sounds and to produce video as well.

01:04.400 --> 01:12.600
And that's why I created this tool to support my interest in this subject.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.880
First the name of the project.

01:15.880 --> 01:22.600
I think it's important to mention from where comes the inspiration.

01:22.600 --> 01:28.440
The Dublang name is inspired by the musical style Dub.

01:28.440 --> 01:35.440
And Dub consists of remixes of existing music and Dublang consists of remixes of existing

01:35.440 --> 01:36.760
software.

01:36.760 --> 01:45.520
Then one of the goals of the Dublang tool is to have a single interface text to our interface

01:45.560 --> 01:55.040
live coding interface to manipulate and to use multiple different tools in the same source

01:55.040 --> 01:58.840
code in the same session.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.560
Then how it is designed.

02:02.560 --> 02:11.600
The Dublang system is designed in a client server architecture.

02:11.600 --> 02:19.320
And for that I am using in the client side I am using Nail Vim text editor because I

02:19.320 --> 02:25.080
found it very easy to implement not also because it's easy to implement using the Lua language

02:25.080 --> 02:31.800
that it's a really nice script language that fits very well in the purpose of this tool

02:31.800 --> 02:37.360
as the purpose is to mix different tools in the same environment than a script language

02:37.360 --> 02:41.120
like Lua language works very well.

02:41.160 --> 02:49.240
And then in the other side I have the servers that is being managed by system D service.

02:49.240 --> 02:55.120
Then here is one example of how it looks like Dublang source code.

02:55.120 --> 03:04.120
Then here is an example where I have two different languages and the region with the hashtag

03:04.120 --> 03:11.320
and exclamation defines a region for a specific language.

03:11.320 --> 03:18.760
And then I can have in the same source code different regions with different program language.

03:18.760 --> 03:24.320
And then for each language I have to implement inside the Dublang system extension through

03:24.320 --> 03:25.520
a plugin.

03:25.520 --> 03:31.400
Then the Dublang system is built on top of the architecture is pluggable.

03:31.400 --> 03:39.160
And I can create plugins, new plugins to integrate new languages or new tools.

03:39.160 --> 03:45.240
Let's see if I can play this video here as example.

03:45.240 --> 03:48.240
I hope the sound works.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.360
It doesn't work the sound?

04:00.360 --> 04:02.360
No, it doesn't.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.360
But I don't have sound yet in this moment.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.360
Oh, that's still something.

04:14.360 --> 04:16.360
You can try.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.360
You should be here.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.360
Plugging this into the audio object.

04:22.360 --> 04:26.360
If you're looking, you might get sound.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.360
What I do with this?

04:34.360 --> 04:36.360
Which put a click left or right?

04:42.360 --> 04:43.360
Sorry.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.360
Oops.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.360
What happened?

04:49.360 --> 04:51.360
I don't know what happened here.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.360
Oh, man, what's happening?

05:10.360 --> 05:12.360
Okay, there we are.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.360
I clicked it in the wrong button.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.360
Sorry.

05:15.360 --> 05:18.360
It won't feel screen apparently, but there you are.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.360
Let me go back one or two seconds.

05:25.360 --> 05:35.360
Then here, I have more or less the same code I showed in the previous presentation.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.360
Where is the sound?

05:40.360 --> 05:42.360
I lost the sound.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.360
Ah, look here.

05:48.360 --> 05:49.360
Oh.

05:57.360 --> 05:58.360
Yes.

05:58.360 --> 06:07.360
Then here, when I evaluate this, it's being executed by the super collide server.

06:08.360 --> 06:13.360
And then in the same source code, I'm going to add some...

06:14.360 --> 06:18.360
I think I finished my time.

06:18.360 --> 06:22.360
Just to finish this is now them.

06:22.360 --> 06:28.360
Then this is Bambam, it's being executed by the Tidal Cycles language.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.360
Then two different servers and the client is sending it to the proper server.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.360
Sorry for extending my time.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.360
Thank you for your attention.

06:44.360 --> 06:46.360
No time for questions, I suppose.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.360
Thank you.
