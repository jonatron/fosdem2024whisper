00:00.000 --> 00:10.880
Hi, I'm Bonnie Merring from the Free Software Foundation Europe and I have five minutes

00:10.880 --> 00:13.760
to present you packing for freedom to you.

00:13.760 --> 00:20.960
This is due to me because I'm a very last late approach and yeah, it's a bit of my

00:20.960 --> 00:26.400
fault, but I'm very happy that the Boston people made this possible for me to present

00:26.400 --> 00:29.640
you packing for freedom coding competition to you.

00:29.640 --> 00:32.400
So what's it all about?

00:32.400 --> 00:37.640
You packing for freedom is a programming competition for teenagers that will come to their eligibility

00:37.640 --> 00:40.080
criteria in a second.

00:40.080 --> 00:45.920
Basically you develop your own project in a period of six months and in those periods

00:45.920 --> 00:50.360
you work on this project by yourself or in a team.

00:50.360 --> 00:55.320
You can always ask for help and they have no limitations to the project ideas.

00:55.320 --> 00:58.560
We know this is quite a challenge.

00:58.560 --> 01:04.640
And we are always happy to help with coming up with a project idea and you can always

01:04.640 --> 01:07.520
approach us during this time.

01:07.520 --> 01:12.560
The only requirement is that it needs to be free software in the end.

01:12.560 --> 01:15.800
So you need to publish it on their free software license.

01:15.800 --> 01:17.760
We always help with this as well.

01:17.760 --> 01:22.720
So if you have questions about licensing, you can always approach us.

01:22.720 --> 01:26.760
And yeah, that's basically the idea of you packing for freedom.

01:26.880 --> 01:33.080
Now I come to the eligibility criteria and who can actually participate.

01:33.080 --> 01:40.360
I think not all of you are in this age area but you might know people who are or teachers

01:40.360 --> 01:45.120
so feel free to share the information.

01:45.120 --> 01:49.160
People between 14 and 18 can participate from Europe.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.240
Not just you.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.720
You don't need citizenship.

01:51.720 --> 01:52.920
You need to live here.

01:52.920 --> 01:56.000
So also refugees are welcome to participate.

01:56.000 --> 02:02.880
Sadly, we cannot help with hardware in this case but maybe the local Hexpace can help

02:02.880 --> 02:04.040
out.

02:04.040 --> 02:08.000
And you don't, as I already said, you don't need to have the European citizenship.

02:08.000 --> 02:15.600
So be free to share this information as I now see a bit of older phrases than 14.

02:15.600 --> 02:21.800
And this is where they can register and you find all this information also on ufackingforfreedom.org.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.400
And now about the programming period.

02:25.400 --> 02:30.560
It already started for this year but we will have the next year as well and we are still

02:30.560 --> 02:32.360
open for late registration.

02:32.360 --> 02:38.520
So people can actually participate or join us during the whole time of the coding period.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.600
Then they just don't have that much time as the others.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.080
So and we know that.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.080
We take this a bit into account.

02:45.080 --> 02:50.880
Yeah, and there are already around 90 people who have joined up for this year's coding

02:50.880 --> 02:52.440
competition.

02:52.440 --> 02:57.320
So usually some of them drop out during the six months period.

02:57.320 --> 03:01.640
And yeah, this is how the period looks like.

03:01.640 --> 03:05.000
And during this time, we have monthly calls.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.640
So we try to give them some input about free software, about how you actually work on projects.

03:11.640 --> 03:18.240
There's an expert from our Shuri who tells them more about the whole topic of Git, for

03:18.280 --> 03:25.320
example, which is quite a lot in procession or how to actually do licensing.

03:25.320 --> 03:26.320
So we are always there.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.480
We are approachable.

03:27.480 --> 03:32.600
And in those monthly calls, the teenagers also have the possibility to actually talk

03:32.600 --> 03:37.200
to each other in breakout rooms, to chat with each other and to connect to other young

03:37.200 --> 03:43.400
people from all over Europe who are actually also interested in programming and free software.

03:43.520 --> 03:50.680
I heard from some participants from the last two rounds that this is really an amazing

03:50.680 --> 03:54.520
thing because they are actually building friendships all across Europe.

03:54.520 --> 03:58.880
And then they visit each other and they form teams and they collaborate.

03:58.880 --> 04:03.440
So it's really the spirit of free software in it.

04:03.440 --> 04:07.000
And yeah, that's one of the things that we offer monthly calls.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
Every month we have this and we have, of course, also a lot of other communication channels

04:11.080 --> 04:14.160
where they can talk with each other.

04:14.160 --> 04:18.320
And yeah, as I already mentioned, we help with legal and licensing questions, general

04:18.320 --> 04:19.320
question motivation.

04:19.320 --> 04:23.800
We don't help with the programming, but they are always like it's free software.

04:23.800 --> 04:29.400
So they, in the spirit of free software, it's helpful for them to ask others and they are

04:29.400 --> 04:34.840
welcome to get help if they need it from their teachers, from some other resources.

04:34.840 --> 04:40.240
So it's not about they working on their own and if they are stuck, they are stuck.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.080
So we try to help as much as we can.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.520
And it's mostly about the fun.

04:46.520 --> 04:52.520
It's mostly about this and this is very important for us and that's what we try to keep alive

04:52.520 --> 04:54.880
with the monthly meetings.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.000
Now for the prices.

04:57.000 --> 05:05.160
So this is really important for the youngsters and I know that.

05:05.160 --> 05:09.800
So as much as there is fun involved and as much there is programming involved, we also

05:09.840 --> 05:13.560
have some pretty much nice prices as I would say.

05:13.560 --> 05:19.520
The first place can get 4000 euros, the second place 2000 and third to sixth place still

05:19.520 --> 05:21.640
get 1000 euros.

05:21.640 --> 05:29.400
There are three special prices that we award for example for people from a war zone, people

05:29.400 --> 05:33.720
from who are really young and who participate.

05:33.800 --> 05:41.400
Yeah and that's how the sherry then gives out the prices and evaluates project after the

05:41.400 --> 05:45.200
programming period and that's what I get.

05:45.200 --> 05:49.080
And yeah, you can follow us on social media.

05:49.080 --> 05:52.160
That's basically it and I'm pretty much on time.

05:52.160 --> 05:58.040
I have one minute for questions if there is any question.

05:58.040 --> 06:02.120
Here's again the registration link and yeah.

06:04.680 --> 06:05.880
No questions?

06:05.880 --> 06:06.880
Perfect.

06:06.880 --> 06:11.360
I'm at the FSFE booth around there so if you want to approach me there and get more information,

06:11.360 --> 06:18.920
get stickers, get posters, come to building K level 2.

06:18.920 --> 06:19.920
Thank you very much.
