WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.000
I'd like to welcome Pierre, I've got your last name, Pierre.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Pierre Slamish.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
All right.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.000
That's, oh yeah.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
I think it's one of the more recent World Projects started, isn't it?

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
We created a plan for the pack in 2012.

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
So it's just over 10 year old project.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
That's value of a teenager.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
Right.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
Let's welcome Pierre.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.000
And thank you, Lee, by the way.

00:36.000 --> 00:41.000
We use, we depend on your work.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
So I'm going to talk about open food fact.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
And it's not going to be a very technical talk,

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
but more like experiences of people getting into Pearl in 2024

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
to contribute to food transparency and to transform the food system.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
So I'm, yeah, I'm Pierre.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm one of the co-founders of open food fact.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
So I'm not the technical guy.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm the product manager, but I double in a, in a product opener,

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
which is our Pearl back end.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
So on the menu, I'm going to briefly introduce open food fact to both of you

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
who don't know it yet.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
Then I'll have a part on starting Pearl in 2024.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
So some portraits of our contributors,

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
how you can have impact on the food system with Pearl,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
and finally some Q and A.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.000
So about the open food fact, it's the answer to a very simple problem.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
How do you pick a product in the supermarket?

01:42.000 --> 01:45.000
You have many products, a lot of information.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
It's hard if you want to pick one for your children.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
It's very hard.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
And then when you get to the nutrition table,

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
you have this long ingredient list, but sometimes you can't read.

01:55.000 --> 02:00.000
The nutrition table personally, I have never managed to make sense out of it.

02:00.000 --> 02:05.000
And so you have to make decisions every day to get food.

02:05.000 --> 02:11.000
So open food fact is all about empowering users to have an impact on their own health,

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
but also on the environment and the food system at large.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
So we kind of have this slogan,

02:18.000 --> 02:22.000
don't panic when you're in the supermarket, organize.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
So trying to get together and have an impact on the food system.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
So we've been nicknamed by the media, the Wikipedia for food products.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
We have over 3 million products in 160 countries and languages.

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Our data sources are crowdsourcing.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
So using your mobile phone, you can actually add photos, add data,

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
manually and using machine learning help.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
And the food industry, which is beginning to realize that closing their data

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
doesn't make any sense.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
So we want transparency to become the norm.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
So I'm going to show you how pale code in production

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
is having impact every day for millions.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
This is, so the first thing is a nutrition score,

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
which you may have seen in Belgium, in France and in other countries.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
We started computing nutrition score in 2015.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
It was a scientific formula at the time.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
So we decided, okay, let's compute it on all the products we have

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
and show it to people in the app.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
And we helped democratize nutrition score before it passed into law.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
So this is a screenshot of something one of our contributors had done at the time.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.000
He pasted some nutrition score on all the, using image editing software on all the products.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.000
Fast forward a couple of years, you go from digital to actually seeing

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
a whole supermarket ale full of nutrition score,

03:55.000 --> 03:59.000
which shows that you go from digital to real life impact.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000
So I mean, not only people who run the code, who use the software,

04:07.000 --> 04:12.000
but everyone can benefit, but everyone can benefit, even people who don't care about it.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
So from pale code to real life impact.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
And it goes even beyond just displaying the score.

04:18.000 --> 04:25.000
We started to realize that producers are actually changing the nutritional composition of their food products.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
So it's a systemic impact.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Code can have a systemic impact on the food system.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
It's absolutely bananas.

04:33.000 --> 04:40.000
What you can do also with a path of tour is compare products at very large scale.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
So for instance, we are able to monitor the composition of Fanta.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
And as you see, it's not the same in every country.

04:48.000 --> 04:55.000
So basically we can show what's the industry is trying to hide us.

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
We also have help producers improve their product.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
So one of our part of our software stack is the producer platform.

05:05.000 --> 05:12.000
And we do some computations based on the nutrition table to actually provide reformulation opportunities.

05:12.000 --> 05:20.000
If you reduce sugar by 20 milligrams, you can actually go from nutritional score B to nutritional score A.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
So computing helps also change the products.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
And yeah, brands are starting to...

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Oh, sorry, I went a little bit too far.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Yeah, brands are starting to...

05:32.000 --> 05:38.000
All those brands have actually started to share data and use the import system,

05:38.000 --> 05:41.000
the mapping and import systems that are in OpenFood fact,

05:41.000 --> 05:46.000
that are kind of hairy XML parsing and all of that.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
And so yeah, they are sharing data in many countries at large scale.

05:52.000 --> 06:01.000
And to code this stack, we have Stefan, the founder of the OpenFood project,

06:01.000 --> 06:06.000
but we also managed to get more coders on board.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.000
People who just picked up Perl just to be able to contribute to the food system transparency.

06:12.000 --> 06:19.000
We started learning Perl in 2022, 23, 24 just to be able to have an impact.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
And Lee, I can confirm you that newcomers don't have any preconceptions.

06:25.000 --> 06:34.000
So for instance, Yukti picked up Perl in 2022 and she's improving the backend code quality.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
So she's very serious about food transparency.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
She doesn't look at the front, she looks at the back where the nutrition tables are.

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
She wrote a lot of tests, bug fixes, and she's into Perl correctness.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
And she's obviously like a soul trying to convert all people she meets into OpenFood users.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
Stefan, who coded much of the code, learned Perl in 1998 when he was at Yahoo.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.000
He likes to do origami in his free time.

07:08.000 --> 07:15.000
And some of the code base are things that he coded perhaps a little bit too quickly 10 years ago

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
when he launched the OpenFood project.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
And he recently paddled in a 10 degree water.

07:20.000 --> 07:27.000
Monalika, she picked up Perl in 2023 to improve the UI, the test, and the code.

07:27.000 --> 07:34.000
So it was part of the program funded by the Perl Foundation to include more people in computing.

07:35.000 --> 07:44.000
So she worked on product image protection to ensure that data quality stays constant

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
and misuse and user management, email misuse and user management.

07:50.000 --> 07:59.000
Alex, who's a Python person, but took the Perl Camel two years ago to contribute to OpenFood fact,

07:59.000 --> 08:06.000
who's part of the permanent team, and who's using some of the tools you code in this room,

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
so Proxmox, Sanuid, and many, many more.

08:09.000 --> 08:14.000
Benoit, who picked up Perl in 2023 to improve the data quality system,

08:14.000 --> 08:21.000
and he's learning nutrition science almost as fast as he is picking up Perl.

08:21.000 --> 08:28.000
And John, who didn't do much Perl before and started learning Perl in 2022.

08:28.000 --> 08:36.000
And he's spending one day a week leveling up in Perl to be able to contribute to OpenFood fact.

08:36.000 --> 08:45.000
So I'm going to go a bit faster, but as you see, the dynamic of people picking up Perl is actually very much alive.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.000
Young people, girls, etc. are actually learning Perl to be able to contribute to OpenFood fact.

08:52.000 --> 09:00.000
So John, he introduced Perl's critique to the pipeline, and we thank him for that somehow.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
So a bit more technical.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.000
So our backend is ProductOpner, so it's the backend for the web version.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
It's a monolithic system for the web, so there's no like front-end backend thing.

09:21.000 --> 09:25.000
But it's also providing the API of OpenFood fact.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
So it provides the database.

09:27.000 --> 09:34.000
It provides the ReadWrite API, the website, the producer's platform I talked about,

09:34.000 --> 09:41.000
analyzing and enriching of product data, so a lot of regs in every direction,

09:41.000 --> 09:46.000
and the computation of scores from the nutrition table, from the data.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
We are then able to calculate nutrition score, about nutrition,

09:50.000 --> 09:58.000
know about ultra-processing, and eco-score, which is even more complex to compute about the environment.

09:58.000 --> 10:06.000
So a lot of ingredient parsing, very hairy stuff, and what the architecture looks like.

10:06.000 --> 10:17.000
So we use ModPel and Apache to basically query the products which are stored in a storable file system.

10:17.000 --> 10:25.000
We are then able to fulfill the user queries, and for aggregated query,

10:25.000 --> 10:30.000
we store everything in a MongoDB database for more complex queries.

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
So the data structure is very hairy.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.000
OpenFood is a very complex matter.

10:37.000 --> 10:43.000
As the year evolved, the data structure became more complex and complex.

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
You have probably one-tenth of the data structure.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
And we store all the...

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
So this is the old interface, and we store everything.

10:54.000 --> 10:59.000
We store all the revision of the food products as well to ensure that...

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
to see the evolution of food products over time.

11:01.000 --> 11:06.000
I told you that producers were evolving products to make them better.

11:06.000 --> 11:13.000
So we are able to basically go back in time by storing revisions of the products at a given time.

11:13.000 --> 11:23.000
So when people scan, they will require product.store, but it will require the last revision.

11:23.000 --> 11:30.000
We are also exploring for aggregated queries the possibility of migrating to Postgre.

11:30.000 --> 11:37.000
So yeah, that's how we do a MongoDB query.

11:37.000 --> 11:43.000
And so the tags are the normalized version of the data,

11:43.000 --> 11:50.000
and then we are able to return products that match the specific query.

11:50.000 --> 11:56.000
It's very powerful. You can do very powerful stuff like require orange juice that are organic

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
and are sold in Belgium and possibly contain no additives, etc.

12:02.000 --> 12:08.000
So the website is in Pell. The business logic is in Pell.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
So ingredient parsing and data analysis.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
We have those taxonomies to structure data and data navigation.

12:14.000 --> 12:21.000
The score computations as well, and importing the data from producers and even a GS1 connection.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.000
GS1 is the standard as ways to share product data.

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
And we also have a knowledge panel system, which is basically driving completely remotely the app.

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
So rich content, images and all of that.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
We've already done...

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
One thing we realized is that we have to make contribution as easy as possible.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
So we dockerized the project. We started adding documentation.

12:48.000 --> 12:54.000
We are also working on a better API. It's not like very restful or API.

12:54.000 --> 13:01.000
And we refactor on the go as we add features, because the food system is currently evolving.

13:01.000 --> 13:08.000
We also want to have a more service-based approach as opposed to the monolith.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.000
So we have introduced open food fact query for aggregated query.

13:13.000 --> 13:17.000
FoxLumniangine for the additional properties.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
And our machine learning stack is called Robotoff.

13:21.000 --> 13:30.000
And we are currently revamping search with such issues and introducing key clock for identification.

13:31.000 --> 13:38.000
We are also trying to better document the API with open API and adding more tests and integration tests.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
Because stuff breaks and stuff breaks often.

13:41.000 --> 13:49.000
Things we'd like to do on the technical side, the API v3, lower the barrier to contribution.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
So probably using a modern web framework, we don't use any.

13:56.000 --> 14:03.000
So I saw that there was a Corina talk. We are also considering Corina instead of hash maps.

14:03.000 --> 14:08.000
Anonymous hash maps. So it could be, or data structure could be more documented.

14:08.000 --> 14:15.000
And globally, we factor the code in smaller chunks, like something for NutriScore, something for EcoScore.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
But one thing, we are not giving up at all.

14:20.000 --> 14:25.000
The core of open food fact is and will remain in Perl.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.000
And then, yeah, also more like design stuff.

14:29.000 --> 14:37.000
Because our interface is still monolithic and people need to be comfortable with Perl to actually do front-end stuff.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.000
So what's next for 2024? We go perhaps a bit faster.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.000
We are going to improve the mobile app, do some more machine learning.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.000
And also do something on open product fact.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.000
So NutriScore is going to evolve this year.

14:54.000 --> 15:01.000
So a lot of computation is going to, we basically have to change the algorithm.

15:01.000 --> 15:07.000
It's still a very controversial thing at the European level.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.000
Italy is trying to block the NutriScore.

15:10.000 --> 15:15.000
And so once we compute, we will make it available to everyone.

15:15.000 --> 15:19.000
We have also the question of prices.

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000
We are launching into price collection due to inflation.

15:24.000 --> 15:35.000
So we want people to be able to compare prices and be able to make sense out of the ongoing situation and also scientists.

15:35.000 --> 15:48.000
And the last and probably more interesting, Perl-wise, is the fact that we are going to merge all of our projects together.

15:48.000 --> 15:57.000
We currently have open food fact for food, but we have also open beauty fact for cosmetics and open pet food facts for pet food.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
We actually launched those as jokes as April Fools a couple of years ago.

16:02.000 --> 16:06.000
But now people are asking to be able to scan anything.

16:06.000 --> 16:14.000
So we have four installation of products opener on four different servers and we need to be able to bridge them all together.

16:14.000 --> 16:21.000
So in terms of architecture, you can imagine that it's going to require a lot of retooling.

16:21.000 --> 16:33.000
So open product fact is all about providing circular solution to augment the lifespan of products.

16:33.000 --> 16:41.000
So ensuring that they have a second, a third life that you are able to repair them, to give them away.

16:41.000 --> 16:45.000
So augmenting the life of objects with open product facts.

16:45.000 --> 16:53.000
So data platform for the circular economy and computing the carbon impact of products and also open beauty fact and open pet food fact.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
So actually work is just starting if you'd like to get involved.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.000
That's just about the right time.

17:00.000 --> 17:06.000
We haven't started actually retooling the product opener for that.

17:06.000 --> 17:13.000
So in terms of helping, how can you contribute?

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
I'm very well aware that you are already maintaining probably a lot of projects.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
So the casual way is basically to scan and add products in your country.

17:22.000 --> 17:32.000
Translation, spreading the word, designing and of course for those of you hacking and hacking the code and fixing the code.

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
The best way is just to try to install the docker on your machine.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
It should be straightforward.

17:38.000 --> 17:44.000
Also if you'd like to mentor, we will be part of the JSOC program this year.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
Hopefully we will be.

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
We will also probably try to submit a project through the Pell Foundation.

17:51.000 --> 18:00.000
So if you'd like to mentor Pell projects on open food fact or actually to become a mentor yourself, it's not just students anymore.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.000
As a professional, you can actually be part of this program.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Be sure to get in touch.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
So how can you get in touch?

18:10.000 --> 18:15.000
Those emails, you can install the app using this QR code.

18:15.000 --> 18:27.000
And if you scan this QR code, you can actually have a link to leave your coordinates and we will get back in touch if you want to become a volunteer.

18:27.000 --> 18:32.000
Either a technical task or non-technical task.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And that's it.

18:34.000 --> 18:46.000
So perhaps if you have any questions or no.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Thank you.
