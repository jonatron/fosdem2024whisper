00:00.000 --> 00:07.720
So, hello, I'm Markus Feiner.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.160
I'm, some of you may know me.

00:10.160 --> 00:14.080
I've been around the Linux and open source world since 1994.

00:14.080 --> 00:20.800
Started really early with Linux and had three operating systems at the time on my computer.

00:20.800 --> 00:27.040
And since the early 2000s, I'm an open source journalist working for Linux magazine.

00:27.040 --> 00:31.640
And the Hi-Zi-X Big Jump Tech magazine also.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.800
And super, thank you.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.920
So, wonderful.

00:35.920 --> 00:38.800
Perfect.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.920
So, I've done a lot of things.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.240
I was also team leader at SUSE, at documentation team lead.

00:45.240 --> 00:50.000
And yeah, having done lots of things, we don't have that much time.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.280
So, I better be fast now also.

00:53.280 --> 00:58.320
But within this talk, I have a lot of links and hints for you where to go to get much more information.

00:58.320 --> 01:04.000
Because all of you that are here, probably are only here because you heard the term conference and you like it a lot.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.960
And like everybody does.

01:05.960 --> 01:10.560
And it's, we started six minutes late, but we have 15 minutes left, I guess.

01:10.560 --> 01:14.240
Good. Okay. You ping me five minutes before we're done. Thanks.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.720
So, this is a presentation that is kind of typical for me.

01:16.720 --> 01:20.000
I'm going to rush through a lot of topics, but there's a lot of links inside.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.520
And you can go and find a lot of things.

01:21.600 --> 01:27.600
If you're not a German native speaker, you will find some articles that I wrote that you have to translate.

01:27.600 --> 01:33.800
But the best thing is that something we did in December or November last year is a large

01:33.800 --> 01:38.480
tabela chart of lots of open source alternatives to Atlassian.

01:38.480 --> 01:46.240
And I'm not going to dive deep into the things that happen with Atlassian and the 15th of February coming up.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.280
I'm sure you're all aware of that, that the support is running out.

01:49.360 --> 01:52.240
So, that's a different thing.

01:52.240 --> 01:56.960
I'm going to talk a little bit about knowledge management and about a concept that we found in

01:56.960 --> 02:02.160
SUSE in the documentation team that I called Agile Recursive Documentation.

02:03.280 --> 02:09.920
And generally the problem in knowledge management, and that is what Atlassian actually is about,

02:09.920 --> 02:14.640
is that we all sort of mis-underestimate the problem.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.360
I'm doing this Bush reference by Bonn-Perlman.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.960
But it's like an iceberg, and this is probably the iceberg that hit the Titanic,

02:21.920 --> 02:23.840
an original photo that I found.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.200
And I've been using it in knowledge management presentations because,

02:27.840 --> 02:31.600
like icebergs, there is implicit and explicit knowledge in companies.

02:31.600 --> 02:34.640
You have a lot of knowledge that is documented, that is fine, that everybody knows,

02:34.640 --> 02:37.760
but there is a lot of Rumsfeld reference, unknown unknowns.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.520
And in companies about, yes, there is.

02:42.240 --> 02:47.440
And about 80% in companies today is assumed to be implicit knowledge.

02:47.440 --> 02:51.120
So, knowledge that is there, but nobody knows that it's there, and people just do it.

02:51.920 --> 02:58.880
And just announcing doing knowledge management now will not help against that,

02:58.880 --> 03:04.640
and will not mitigate that in any way, because you have to take the people.

03:04.640 --> 03:06.720
You have to, oh, I forgot something.

03:07.200 --> 03:12.720
The implicit knowledge is also referring to, for example, people that go into,

03:14.080 --> 03:17.920
yeah, in a longer holiday, or that go into old age pension, and that are gone.

03:17.920 --> 03:22.080
And there are stories of, yeah, I can tell a lot of stories about that,

03:22.080 --> 03:25.920
what happens when the people are gone, and you have to find out what actually did they do,

03:25.920 --> 03:26.880
and how did they do it.

03:27.440 --> 03:31.120
Some people that I know, they had to understand,

03:31.120 --> 03:38.000
and had a Pearl Programmer in the company, and the Pearl Programmer had called all of the processes

03:38.000 --> 03:44.480
and scripts of his whole big setup after figures from the Simpsons.

03:44.480 --> 03:49.440
So, they found a process that was called like APU, and they were like, what does it do?

03:49.440 --> 03:50.080
What does it do?

03:50.080 --> 03:51.920
And then they found out, oh, it forks a lot.

03:53.120 --> 03:58.640
And only once they knew this, they could figure out what the whole Pearl thing does.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.960
But there's many stories like that.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.400
But in the end, you have to inspire and motivate your people to follow you.

04:04.400 --> 04:08.400
So, you need solutions that work in the processes and software that works,

04:08.400 --> 04:10.000
and that the people like in your company.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.520
So, as many as you are here, there will be lots and lots of different solutions in the end.

04:15.520 --> 04:18.400
Because documentation and knowledge management is teamwork.

04:18.400 --> 04:23.040
That's one article I wrote for the Linux Magazine together with my former colleagues from Susie.

04:23.040 --> 04:25.440
It's always teamwork, and you always have to work together,

04:25.440 --> 04:28.480
and you have lots and lots of different people in the company from the...

04:28.480 --> 04:29.520
I once heard that we could...

04:29.520 --> 04:32.560
When I was a consultant, we are the pathfinders, the mountain guides.

04:32.560 --> 04:37.200
We are the ones that find the trails, and then we tell others how to go them.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.960
And as we have different people in the mountains, you have the locals,

04:40.960 --> 04:43.600
you have us, the pathfinders or whatever, you have the tourists,

04:44.160 --> 04:46.080
and the locals and other beings.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.440
So, you have to make sure that everybody understands what you're talking about

04:49.440 --> 04:51.280
when you give them a description about something.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.240
And for that, we have the engineering part or the scientific background.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.040
And this is all...

04:57.040 --> 05:02.560
Every one of these is so huge and a large topic that you can do university studies on some of them.

05:02.560 --> 05:07.920
Knowledge management itself, organizing knowledge, process management, quality assurance,

05:07.920 --> 05:13.440
and then all of that basically combined into some things like knowledge process quality management.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.720
That is K-P-Q-M...

05:14.720 --> 05:17.680
K-P-Q-M, yes.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.360
And at the end, there has to be a presentation layer.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.320
That's what the people see.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.000
That's basically the editor with which we work.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.880
But in the background, you have to do lots of ordering,

05:28.880 --> 05:30.720
indexing with metadata.

05:30.720 --> 05:33.040
Anybody here who knows the term RDF?

05:33.840 --> 05:36.480
Still, the semantic web and all of that stuff.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.600
Yes, that's the background.

05:38.400 --> 05:41.680
And then you have taxonomies, terms, terminologies, registers,

05:41.680 --> 05:43.440
tables of contents, notations, catalogs.

05:43.440 --> 05:48.400
And it's a huge scientific realm that you can read books on each of those.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.960
But for a company, it's important that you do the needful, not all.

05:52.960 --> 05:57.040
And the representation, showing it to the readers,

05:57.040 --> 05:59.920
the customers is actually the mapping of the information.

05:59.920 --> 06:04.080
How do you do this with models, glossaries, how-to's, encyclopedias, documentation?

06:04.080 --> 06:11.120
And you see there's already the type, the form of how you present things is coming in with glossaries.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.560
And well, of course, what I'm going to tell you is the way, the right way,

06:16.560 --> 06:19.440
and found this yesterday in Brussels here, and I really like that.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.840
Maybe some of you remember Magritte.

06:21.840 --> 06:22.800
This is not a pipe.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.680
So, and somebody pointed this on his garage door.

06:25.680 --> 06:26.400
This is the way.

06:27.680 --> 06:30.640
And I still have to dive into the apple.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.320
I think the apple is also a Magritte thing.

06:32.880 --> 06:34.400
But the cloud, and I really like that.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.480
So, of course, what I'm presenting to you is the way how to do it.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.080
No, it's just a suggestion.

06:41.120 --> 06:44.240
Because if you don't have time for all that scientific research and all of that,

06:45.280 --> 06:48.800
maybe, and that is the usual, that is, then you're not alone.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.000
It's usual that companies, we don't have time to do the documentation.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.440
We don't have time for all that.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.280
And then we were at SUSE in the situation.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.760
We had five people in the doc team, and we were told to grow up to 10 people fast.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.480
And the people in the doc team, documentation team, they said,

07:02.480 --> 07:03.920
we don't have time to teach the new ones.

07:04.960 --> 07:09.680
So, what we did was we created this agile recursive onboarding.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.440
That means we have one new guy in the team, and this new guy will be,

07:13.440 --> 07:16.160
for example, the mentor for the next new guy or girl.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.960
And we created a mentor who is in charge of teaching the new guy.

07:20.960 --> 07:25.040
And the new guy would, for example, as an article in Linux magazine that I did.

07:25.040 --> 07:30.240
And some of the, why we call it agile is because only because we're using agile tools and methods.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.000
Like a Kanban board for it.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.840
So, this is what the new guy saw.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.560
Not at this one, but it's structured.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.600
This is an easy tool in next cloud that you can use, for example.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.400
For the start.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.960
This is the task that the new guy had.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.560
Or this is the tasks that the mentor had to do before the first day.

07:47.280 --> 07:50.480
These are the tasks that the new guy would have to do on the first day.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.120
This is in the first week, and so on.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.000
You know, Kanban, very easy there.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.880
And out of this came the first documentation of the job,

08:00.880 --> 08:03.760
of the documentation shop, the description, what he's doing.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.680
And this is an individual board for a new team member.

08:08.640 --> 08:13.200
And this new person was from the start involved in making the team better,

08:13.200 --> 08:16.080
making the documentation everything better, and yada, yada, yada.

08:16.720 --> 08:21.680
Until, and it was recursive because the next one would again start at the same point.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.440
But with the new improvements from the last one.

08:23.440 --> 08:27.280
And that is exactly what you can do with documentation and knowledge management in a company.

08:27.280 --> 08:32.320
You can start documenting things and have people be a part of it.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.080
That is the most important, take them with you.

08:34.400 --> 08:39.120
And there is other things that are really cool, but only larger companies usually can apply it.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.800
There's things that Stack Overflow and Reddit, those companies do really good.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.480
You can have your customers, your readers, the signpost,

08:46.480 --> 08:50.400
a triage by user pane, so the important documentation items first.

08:50.400 --> 08:56.480
And what nobody needs will disappear from the list and topics that are interested

08:56.480 --> 08:58.720
will go up in lists and documentation.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.280
So if you're writing on something nobody ever reads,

09:01.760 --> 09:03.600
maybe you could have invested your time better.

09:03.600 --> 09:08.000
But I'm jumping over to the tools because that is what we are talking about.

09:08.000 --> 09:14.880
And yeah, so in decision making, decision making is also very clear.

09:14.880 --> 09:17.600
You have this important, regular, not important ones,

09:17.600 --> 09:20.720
and thereby you decide what to document on this scale.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.640
But it's probably not you at FOSTA who decides that.

09:24.640 --> 09:28.160
It's usually the management because there's constant risk involved.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.600
So this is the stuff that we need to document because if this guy is run over by a car,

09:33.600 --> 09:36.400
we won't know how to do this process and this will be a lot of money

09:36.400 --> 09:38.640
and customers will be angry at what we're getting.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.880
The team has the expertise, the knowledge or documentation team has the expertise,

09:42.880 --> 09:46.080
but the management knows about money and risk.

09:46.080 --> 09:49.120
So that is why they have to actually define what.

09:49.120 --> 09:55.600
So if you're not, yeah, and the tool, oh, super, good.

09:56.080 --> 10:01.520
The tool that you're using should be the last decision that you take.

10:01.520 --> 10:06.720
Otherwise you end up in technology-driven development or design.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.480
I don't know if you've heard that before.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.760
That is, for example, happening with AI a lot.

10:11.760 --> 10:15.760
We want to do something with AI or we want to do something in Rust.

10:15.760 --> 10:19.680
We want to do something in what is this new framework that we bought.

10:19.680 --> 10:22.320
Oh, in Go. Let's do something in Go or whatsoever.

10:22.560 --> 10:27.520
That's not uncommon that a company buys some development framework

10:27.520 --> 10:29.840
and then they think, okay, what can we do with it?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.040
It should be the other way around.

10:31.040 --> 10:35.040
You should, as in project management, you should see what you want,

10:35.040 --> 10:37.840
what you need, all the needs and then the risk and the money involved

10:37.840 --> 10:41.840
and then in the end look which product does match my requirements the best.

10:43.040 --> 10:47.920
Well, with Atlassian, that's usually not the case.

10:47.920 --> 10:53.200
Also because it's just simply there and for a long time it has been there without competition.

10:55.200 --> 10:59.200
And now in the last years, Atlassian did these moves to the cloud.

10:59.200 --> 11:06.320
This increase of license cost and, well, and they have, of course,

11:06.320 --> 11:10.720
they have a good product, a viable product and it's highly integrated with ticketing

11:10.720 --> 11:12.240
and you remember Trello.

11:13.200 --> 11:16.800
And I like to call them something like the Microsoft of Knowledge

11:16.800 --> 11:22.800
because everybody in the development world uses it and it's hard to get around it.

11:23.520 --> 11:28.080
And most people are not very happy about it and especially since I learned that the price increase

11:28.080 --> 11:34.080
that comes now or came now for small companies can be up to 1,000% that they have to pay

11:34.080 --> 11:37.760
because the small bundles start at 500 users or something like that.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.840
And it's not the usual, you know,

11:39.920 --> 11:45.920
the usual increase is something I think like 10 times more than before.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.120
So not that bad.

11:49.120 --> 11:55.120
And so they did also an article on that that I don't have a screenshot in there

11:55.120 --> 11:58.080
but they're forcing the users into the cloud.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.720
They say no we don't because they can buy a data center license.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.360
That's the one that's like 100 times more expensive than before.

12:03.360 --> 12:08.480
But they reacted also to that but there's other issues also.

12:08.720 --> 12:12.720
But them being an Australian company and thus part of the Five Eyes

12:12.720 --> 12:17.840
which is the five countries that are very closely working together in terms of the NSA

12:18.880 --> 12:19.120
stuff.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.200
So there is GDPR issues.

12:21.760 --> 12:28.960
They even told their customers when in 2018 when we were working with Trello at SUSE

12:28.960 --> 12:34.000
they let a mail came in that told us we shouldn't put business secrets into Trello

12:34.560 --> 12:39.280
because that might not comply with data protection rules in Europe already then.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.960
We're like what the fuck are you doing?

12:41.520 --> 12:46.720
Knowledge management tool and you're telling us not to put business knowledge in there?

12:46.720 --> 12:50.800
And so yeah and then recently there have been more issues.

12:50.800 --> 12:58.080
There have also been security issues and also but that's okay that every software has that.

12:58.080 --> 13:02.160
But then there is also the fact that they are more focused on a global market

13:02.160 --> 13:04.720
than for example on a German or European market.

13:04.720 --> 13:08.880
So we had the situation that we had severe issues at a company I was working with with

13:08.880 --> 13:17.360
Umlauts, the German Umlauts A and they said well there and we opened the ticket and the answer was

13:17.360 --> 13:20.080
oh yeah most of our customers are using English.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.680
We are very sorry about that.

13:22.720 --> 13:30.320
We're like okay good but that's just basics and so last year and that's actually the core part

13:30.320 --> 13:31.120
of this.

13:31.120 --> 13:36.480
I did with Tim Schurman together we did two articles in the IT administrator where we took

13:36.480 --> 13:42.160
a deep dive into the open source alternatives for Atlassian.

13:42.160 --> 13:49.200
Both of them make five pages and a large chart that I have here yeah that's two pages.

13:49.200 --> 13:55.440
That wasn't in the printed that's only online and the link is this is the this is the link to it.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.080
It's in the presentation that will be on the FOSTA website.

13:58.160 --> 14:06.400
Yeah and um nice take the photos tell me when you're done then I go back good so

14:07.600 --> 14:13.840
and we came to the solution that there is a lot of alternatives and a lot of them also

14:13.840 --> 14:14.960
are facing a boom.

14:14.960 --> 14:20.320
Some of them say we have so many calls right now from people that want to get rid of Atlassian

14:20.880 --> 14:25.360
that we can't handle it all and one of the companies is a friend of our friends of mine

14:25.360 --> 14:31.360
from Regensburg where I come from in Bavaria and they say it's most of them are customers that

14:31.360 --> 14:34.960
don't want to use Atlassian anymore they don't want to do the move and now they have this

14:34.960 --> 14:39.600
deadline coming up on the 15th of February when their support is ending for their old product so

14:40.800 --> 14:46.880
yeah so many customers are turning away from Atlassian the priorities have shifted and as you

14:46.880 --> 14:52.720
see in this table I'm going to show you a picture of each of those and hopefully if my brain is good

14:52.800 --> 14:58.720
enough I will say a few words to each of those five minutes great so in this list we have blue

14:58.720 --> 15:05.200
spice just don't worry I'll tell you more about the names just name dropping now blue spice bookstack

15:05.200 --> 15:13.120
it's alphabetical docu wiki fos wiki media wiki open km outline p m wiki wiki js and x wiki

15:13.120 --> 15:18.960
that's the ones we compared in this list I'm sure there's more out there but we tried to address

15:18.960 --> 15:26.000
those that are open source and have enterprise support so that's what we this wrong laptop

15:27.120 --> 15:35.280
and here you the first one of course the big the biggest knowledge management software is of

15:35.280 --> 15:44.080
course wikipedia but wikipedia with media wiki software has one big flaw it's not well it scales

15:44.080 --> 15:51.280
obviously very good yeah it can run the seventh largest website in Germany I think but um what it

15:51.280 --> 15:57.600
it has only one use case and that is not the enterprise clearly it is has the use case of

15:57.600 --> 16:04.320
making wikipedia run and work forever and really good and so I mean you all know wikipedia and

16:04.320 --> 16:08.720
you all know that this is already the editor of you I don't know if you've been to wikipedia recently

16:08.720 --> 16:14.000
last year or so they integrated this wikipedia editor not you don't have to work in in markdown

16:14.000 --> 16:20.880
whatever it was anymore you can really type inside the text and from them there is a there is an

16:20.880 --> 16:24.320
enterprise distribution that's called blue spice that's the guys from rigs book that I've been

16:24.320 --> 16:30.160
talking about disclaimer I they're a friend of mine and I blog for their website so um but that's

16:30.160 --> 16:35.520
you can make your own image about them they have a lot of things that enterprises need for example

16:36.160 --> 16:42.240
something like privacy administration so they add usability and at enterprise features on it yeah

16:42.240 --> 16:49.600
and they're open source they base they're based on media wiki and they have several versions up to

16:49.600 --> 16:56.480
cloud and farm and sars and stuff and um we have then we have x wiki there was just a talk so I hope

16:56.480 --> 17:03.920
I'm not saying anything that's that's wrong x wiki is also very old and they are in my opinion

17:03.920 --> 17:09.360
really interesting because they do a lot of innovative features that go way beyond the wikis

17:09.360 --> 17:17.360
like their crypt pad and there which is sort of like a um end-to-end browser based collaboration

17:17.360 --> 17:25.120
office thingy space that is actually if I understand it right serverless yeah and so they are so

17:25.120 --> 17:32.080
and if and then there is doku wiki doku wiki is um something that is often found in scientific

17:32.080 --> 17:38.400
and or educational realm I have been okay I've been working with blue spice I've been working with

17:38.400 --> 17:44.320
x wiki I've been working with doku wiki and um doku wiki I found at a company I was consulting

17:44.320 --> 17:53.200
that did that is from the space agencies from German aeronautics space uh it was the gaf

17:53.200 --> 17:59.920
the yeah so they this this world somehow yeah and so they have a lot of people that are experts

17:59.920 --> 18:05.920
and I call that that's where the expert systems start I think I think that both x wiki and blue

18:05.920 --> 18:11.360
spice is something that you don't need much expert knowledge to work with yeah but with doku wiki

18:11.360 --> 18:16.720
it starts but doku wiki is actually really cool because you have some features that others don't

18:16.720 --> 18:20.480
have for example you have a shortcut and then the page that you're working is a presentation

18:21.200 --> 18:29.280
just one thing and that's that's really cool and uh then we have t wiki we just heard of I think

18:29.840 --> 18:39.600
was it t wiki that you just heard or x wiki the previous t and that is um well it came from

18:40.480 --> 18:46.720
well the t wiki was the old project and first wiki and q dot wiki are folks from it they have a

18:46.720 --> 18:54.800
lot of extensions and a lot of features also but I I haven't really seen them that much in companies

18:54.800 --> 19:04.480
and they are very um I can how do you say they um you have to look you have to see if they work

19:04.480 --> 19:10.640
for you but they are not like for me they are not like a valid atlasian replacement because

19:10.640 --> 19:18.160
you but these you need to be an expert to use them yeah and other ones there's there's a lot of

19:18.160 --> 19:23.360
more I found these four and I think I'm good in the time there is for example there's bookstack

19:23.360 --> 19:29.600
which is another very interesting project that works with books and shelves so this German here so

19:29.600 --> 19:35.360
bookstack has this imagery of um use the knowledge is stored in books in bookshelves and chapters in

19:35.360 --> 19:42.640
books so they always use those those metaphors from the from from books so they have pages chapters

19:42.640 --> 19:52.560
books and shelves and this is the page of the um uh the access rules and uh
