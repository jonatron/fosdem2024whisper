WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.000
So we are coming towards the end of the program.

00:10.000 --> 00:16.000
We have two short community talks as final talks of this morning.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.000
And I'm very happy that we have Nicola here to talk about Transcorter.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Many of you probably know that as one of the free applications to take public transport information.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
So yeah, it's your state. Thank you.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Perfect. Can you hear me with a microphone?

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Or is it just for the recording?

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
Perfect.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
So yeah, then welcome to my short little talk about Transcorter.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
It's passed.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
The current state and glimpse into the potential future.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
Let me maybe start the talk with asking you who of you is using public transport regularly?

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000
Great. I could have guessed that, I guess.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
But then some of you may know this kind of problem.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.000
You go somewhere, you travel somewhere, there's a different public transport system.

01:14.000 --> 01:19.000
To find your way through it, they want you to download their own app.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Usually proprietary from Google Play.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
And then at some point your home screen gets cluttered with all of these apps.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.000
Some alternatives that you may know is using Debena Vigartra that works quite well in Germany.

01:36.000 --> 01:46.000
They include a lot of regions with decent data quality as well.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
But then first of all, since the new update, I think there's no map inside anymore,

01:52.000 --> 02:00.000
which I find pretty, well, it's a bit sad.

02:00.000 --> 02:10.000
And then there's also some people found out that Debena Vigartra is sending or connecting to a lot of tracking services,

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
even if you declined that.

02:11.000 --> 02:14.000
So maybe that's not what you want to use.

02:14.000 --> 02:22.000
Well, Google Maps, another option, I guess we don't have to talk about why you maybe don't want to use it either.

02:22.000 --> 02:30.000
So as you guessed, a transporter, it tries to be another alternative to these kind of things.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
It was created 2013 by Trosten Grote.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
As you may notice from that picture, that's not me.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
I'm Miko Leguccio.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
I'm filming under Jallochim on GitHub.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
And I started contributing to Transporter in 2017.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
So when you open Transporter, it might look like this.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
You have a list of networks.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
You can choose where you are.

02:55.000 --> 03:03.000
And then you can basically look for journeys as you would expect.

03:03.000 --> 03:13.000
So in this short talk, I will, well, first of all, tell you a bit about how Transporter works, the internals.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
How do we get the data, basically?

03:17.000 --> 03:25.000
Then, as I said before, the past, present, and future of the project.

03:25.000 --> 03:37.000
So first of all, these official apps, how they work, well, they have their data source, usually in some proprietary format.

03:37.000 --> 03:45.000
And they have the apps that talk to some APIs that provide the data.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.000
In the case of Google Maps, it's a bit differently.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.000
They don't use the data directly, but they use a format called GTFS.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
That's a standardized public transport format.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Initiate it by Google, but it's an open specification.

04:01.000 --> 04:09.000
So you can create your own GTFS files and also consume GTFS files, GTFS files as you want.

04:10.000 --> 04:17.000
And that's what Google uses internally for their public transport routing.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, where does Transporter come into play?

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Maybe you've heard of Uffy before.

04:23.000 --> 04:29.000
That's another app that also works on Android developed by Andreas Schildbach.

04:30.000 --> 04:43.000
Even before Uffy itself was open-sourced, Andreas Schildbach also already open-sourced a library called Public Transport Enabler.

04:43.000 --> 04:56.000
And that is basically the wrapper that contains the logic to connect to and understand the data from the official APIs.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.000
And Transporter is using that same library.

05:01.000 --> 05:09.000
So huge thanks to Andreas at that point for him to open-source this and making a Transporter possible.

05:09.000 --> 05:20.000
Then there's also a second part in Public Transport Enabler where you can consume GTFS files by a proxy.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
In that case, you don't use the GTFS files directly.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
You don't perform routing on your phone.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.000
But you use some third-party provider.

05:29.000 --> 05:36.000
What Public Transport Enabler was using is Navicia, a French company.

05:36.000 --> 05:49.000
They provided this service for free, basically consuming the GTFS files and then exposing them as an API to interested apps.

05:50.000 --> 06:00.000
And that's actually how I got in contact with Transporter because when I was spending some time in Nicaragua,

06:00.000 --> 06:07.000
I was working there with some other volunteers to gather Public Transport data,

06:08.000 --> 06:19.000
schedule information, put that together into some GTFS file and then in the end making routing possible for a limited region,

06:19.000 --> 06:24.000
but at least with apps such as Transporter and Auffie.

06:26.000 --> 06:30.000
So now that you know a little bit more about the internals,

06:31.000 --> 06:38.000
I would like to go on with the project itself, how it evolved.

06:39.000 --> 06:45.000
This is the graph of the code frequency on GitHub.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
So as you can see, there has been quite a lot of activity in the beginning.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Initial commit 2013, release 1.0 2015.

07:00.000 --> 07:08.000
And then in 2018 with this huge spike, there was a major rewrite of the app.

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
Most of this was done by Torsten Grotter.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
And as you can see afterwards, activity declined a bit.

07:16.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, both Torsten and me were busy with other stuff.

07:22.000 --> 07:34.000
So this is actually a try to get some more or attract maybe some new contributors to Transporter with this talk.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
Maybe you've noticed that at some point we even got removed from the official after-ride repository

07:43.000 --> 07:52.000
because they found out that some library or the map library that we were using was not fully open source.

07:53.000 --> 08:07.000
And it became necessary to switch to an open source fork of that library that actually didn't include the non-free dependencies.

08:08.000 --> 08:16.000
And another thing that happened last year is that Navicia started to change strategy.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
It's like the new version of their software is not open source anymore.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
And they also stopped serving a lot of regions.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
So at that point, for example, Nicaragua was not available anymore, which is a bit of a shame.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
So in 2023 we also got some new interest from the community.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.000
There was people asking about the future of the Transporter app.

08:40.000 --> 08:48.000
Well, that's got some new energy and we finally finished the migration to the new map library.

08:48.000 --> 08:55.000
And since one month ago, we made it actually back to asteroid.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
We're back there.

08:57.000 --> 09:08.000
But as I said before, we lack some regions that were supported before because Navicia stopped providing them and because some APIs also broke over time.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Well, as I said before, there are some new contributors.

09:16.000 --> 09:23.000
There's some effort to move to new design theme, which is great.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
There are quite some open issues.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
Some of them are bugs and many of them are feature requests.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
And a lot of them are actually marked as so-called beginner jobs.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
That means that they are supposed to be quite easy to tackle.

09:38.000 --> 09:46.000
So if anyone watching this or being here feels like looking at some Kotlin or Java Android code,

09:46.000 --> 09:53.000
feel free to pick one of those and try to work on them.

09:55.000 --> 10:05.000
And apart from Transport itself, it's also nice to see that the whole ecosystem of similar public transport apps is growing.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
So there's Uffy, as mentioned before.

10:07.000 --> 10:10.000
That's open source now for some years as well.

10:11.000 --> 10:23.000
Then there's itinerary, an app that tries to do or does even more things than what Transporter is trying to do, like saving your tickets.

10:25.000 --> 10:33.000
There's another Linux app, GTK-based, in that case, which is pretty new, also looks really nice.

10:34.000 --> 10:42.000
And on iOS, there's also an app that I'm not sure if it's fully open source, but at least there is some variety to choose from.

10:42.000 --> 10:51.000
And looking at this ecosystem that is growing, I think it would be nice to try to combine efforts in some way.

10:51.000 --> 11:10.000
And maybe what would be nice as well is find an alternative to what Navicia was providing before, some kind of shared service that is maintained by the community that can use GTFS files that are available for a lot of places in the world

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
and provide an API that can be used by all of these apps and even more.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
So that's for me.

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
I have three steps for you.

11:22.000 --> 11:34.000
If you haven't already downloaded Transporter either from Afterhood or from Google Play, if you find anything that doesn't work as you want, tell us.

11:34.000 --> 11:39.000
Look at the code, contribute, and have fun using public transport.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Is there one quick question?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
Hello there.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
I tried to navigate to the results yesterday.

12:00.000 --> 12:14.000
Yes, Bajum is one of the regions that was supposed to be broke, the API broke, and I think we would have to look into what kind of API they're using and then maybe

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
feel free to look into that and contribute.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
Sorry, we don't have any time left for more questions.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
Please talk to him, please contribute, and we are moving to the next presentation.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Thank you.
