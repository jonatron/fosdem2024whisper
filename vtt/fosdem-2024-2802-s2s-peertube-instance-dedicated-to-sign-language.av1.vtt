Hello, welcome in Brussels. We are glad to be at FOSDEM with you and we wanted to talk

00:12.880 --> 00:23.280
you about our project which is called S2S and the VAMO is a project to tell everyone

00:23.280 --> 00:33.360
who has sign-in videos that we can put them in the same place. Many videos are very good on

00:33.360 --> 00:39.920
the internet, they are signed correctly and we would like to get a copy of all the videos in the

00:39.920 --> 00:48.160
same place. We use peer-tube to do so and if you go at our website you will only have

00:49.120 --> 00:57.680
videos that are available in sign language or with a specific subtitle for deaf people.

00:58.400 --> 01:07.360
You know the subtitles, the colors for example, and where it is written things that happen in the

01:07.360 --> 01:16.080
movie but that no one speaks for example is a door closes and makes some noise outside as a

01:16.800 --> 01:25.520
camera then it can be written so we like this video too. The better video we can have is

01:26.560 --> 01:33.120
with sign language and subtitles because therefore everyone can understand everything.

01:38.160 --> 01:45.680
This project has no need of funding. It is a very cheap project because it's just hosting a website

01:46.480 --> 01:55.440
and we just use the peer-tube software to host videos so it's about 100 euros per year to

01:55.440 --> 02:03.200
run this project so we really don't need money. We need people that do the same thing in other

02:03.200 --> 02:08.880
countries. We will be glad if someone does the same thing in Germany because we could federate

02:09.520 --> 02:19.200
our peer-tube instance and have much more content available and we also need many people who know

02:19.200 --> 02:24.320
about this project to post more videos so we can grab many many more videos.

02:26.800 --> 02:29.520
Do you have any questions about our project?

02:33.920 --> 02:35.920
Show us the next slide.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.120
Show us because I feel exactly on the next slide.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.120
You can show it.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.120
You can go to the slides.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.120
There's one right there.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.120
Chrome is already open and probably being faster.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.440
Sorry.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.440
Okay.

04:27.680 --> 04:39.680
Thank you very much.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.680
Thank you very much.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.440
You
