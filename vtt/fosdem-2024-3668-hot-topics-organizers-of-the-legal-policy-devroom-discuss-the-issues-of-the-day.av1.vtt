WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.640
Okay. I'd like to invite everyone to take a seat for our last session.

00:12.640 --> 00:16.360
And this will be the REL panel continued probably.

00:16.360 --> 00:23.880
Well, I think that we'll start off with a different title and we'll see how it goes.

00:23.880 --> 00:29.560
So the purpose of this session is for us, your Deverm organizers,

00:29.560 --> 00:36.800
to summarize a number of the hot issues of the day and maybe go a little bit deeper on them.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.920
We've got a little while.

00:38.920 --> 00:46.880
I think that what I'd like to do is ask each member of the organizing committee to say a few words about their thoughts or

00:46.880 --> 00:50.000
what things are top of mind for them.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.880
And then I think we'll open it up for questions.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.880
But let's start with you, Karen.

00:57.880 --> 01:07.880
With me, I've spoken a lot today, so I'll leave more to other panel members, but we're looking for things from the day or just general hot topics.

01:07.880 --> 01:18.400
I mean, I think within the US there's quite a lot of legislative proposals over right to repair, which I think are quite interesting.

01:18.400 --> 01:24.280
I know there was a really interesting inter ruling that came out in this case called Vizio in the US.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.520
That was really fascinating.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.120
So I'll leave with those two.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.160
Let's go over to Alexander.

01:31.160 --> 01:32.520
I'll come back to me.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.520
He wants last.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.520
I'm going to take off.

01:36.520 --> 01:38.960
Okay, that was the longest way to hand over the microphone.

01:38.960 --> 01:45.080
But anyhow, I think for me, particularly the public money, public code card talk was interesting.

01:45.160 --> 01:49.680
So I mean, tomorrow we will also, Lina will talk about interoperability.

01:49.680 --> 01:54.160
And I think that's pretty interesting what's happening in Europe nowadays.

01:54.160 --> 01:59.520
So many countries are deciding to procure more open source software, free software.

01:59.520 --> 02:04.560
And it's interesting how they do this and what ways they're looking for.

02:04.560 --> 02:08.240
And still most of the approaches come as a lot of loopholes.

02:08.240 --> 02:12.080
Also, as we've seen today with the security, a reason maybe.

02:12.080 --> 02:18.360
But still, I think we made a huge step, also this public money, public code campaign,

02:18.360 --> 02:23.120
but also like, yeah, in the last five to two, three years,

02:23.120 --> 02:27.400
I think there was a lot of improvement and it was interesting to see it here in Fosbytsel and I think so.

02:27.400 --> 02:33.080
Okay, I am, I am my care.

02:33.080 --> 02:38.720
So, so I think the first thing for me is that y'all

02:38.720 --> 02:42.520
you're going to miss me to not want to talk about Rell anymore, which was pretty hard to do.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.280
And so congratulations on that, because I really don't want to talk about it anymore.

02:46.280 --> 02:49.860
And I've been talking about it for like 20 years and never stopped.

02:49.860 --> 02:51.960
But you filled it up for me.

02:51.960 --> 02:52.620
I'm done.

02:52.620 --> 02:56.400
But you're probably not.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.720
The big question, ask it.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.800
But the thing really stood out to me was that last talk.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.420
You know, I don't know if y'all saw my talk on the main track.

03:05.420 --> 03:10.220
I had this whole thing about things being politically unviable and certain types of free software,

03:10.220 --> 03:13.180
activism is just politically unviable.

03:13.180 --> 03:19.340
I was literally writing those slides thinking, well, a law that you would have that would require

03:19.340 --> 03:22.940
things to be open source for the government would be one of those politically unviable things.

03:22.940 --> 03:24.220
And the Swiss did it.

03:24.220 --> 03:33.020
It's, it's, it's very exciting to me and I just, I was really glad to see that talk.

03:33.020 --> 03:40.260
So for me, there's one thought that circled a bit around during the whole day.

03:40.260 --> 03:49.380
And this is, I mean, there are a lot of actions we see when some companies or organizations

03:49.380 --> 03:56.780
think that they could make more money when all the people who use the software would

03:56.780 --> 04:01.620
have to give money to them.

04:02.220 --> 04:07.140
That's something we also see in the, in the public sector.

04:07.140 --> 04:17.180
That this is actually an issue that there are meanwhile actors out there who take free

04:17.180 --> 04:21.260
software components and bid on them.

04:21.260 --> 04:28.500
And then they, they get money from the public administrations to deploy free software.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.980
But everything they do will not get up-screen again.

04:31.980 --> 04:39.180
And all the developers that actually do the work for the free software components, for

04:39.180 --> 04:41.540
them it's not sustainable anymore.

04:41.540 --> 04:49.540
And then what we see in those cases are those re-licensing, yeah, trying to solve this by

04:49.540 --> 04:56.300
re-licensing or, yeah, how to in general like what, what they can do about that.

04:56.300 --> 05:02.740
And I think, I mean, for, for me, one of the question is also like how do we as a community

05:02.740 --> 05:10.340
establish norms that those who actually ensure that we get better tools under free software

05:10.340 --> 05:16.340
licenses out there that they can do so and that we enable them to do so.

05:16.340 --> 05:23.460
And that in the end, yeah, also then the public administration gets free software that, that

05:23.460 --> 05:30.660
is successful for them and not, okay, we offer you this, this software components here,

05:30.660 --> 05:32.140
deploy it somehow when there's a problem.

05:32.140 --> 05:33.940
Oh, we don't know how to fix it.

05:33.940 --> 05:39.740
But we also have some proprietary software in our portfolio which we can sell you and

05:39.740 --> 05:47.420
actually we would prefer to sell you this.

05:47.420 --> 05:53.460
So last year when I had a chance to speak on this panel, chat GPT had just been released

05:53.460 --> 05:59.540
and so I was very curious about the role of AI and free software.

05:59.540 --> 06:07.820
And I still am, but I feel like this is a complex issue both from the sort of the intake

06:07.820 --> 06:14.020
side, you know, the GitHub co-pilot standpoint of the data that's mined to train the models

06:14.020 --> 06:20.820
and then also, you know, what are the downstream rights of AI or even, you know, who is the

06:20.820 --> 06:25.180
author of AI, you know, created code.

06:25.180 --> 06:29.100
I think these are really important questions for our community but, you know, today I'm

06:29.100 --> 06:33.100
struck with maybe more pressing thoughts.

06:33.100 --> 06:39.900
I also was very impressed by the talk from the Swiss and it reminds me and I know that

06:39.900 --> 06:41.700
many of you are from Germany.

06:41.700 --> 06:46.180
Am I not remembering correctly several years ago the city of Munich required open source

06:46.180 --> 06:47.180
software?

06:47.180 --> 07:02.220
This is a project which over the city of Munich community has a Linux based operating system.

07:02.220 --> 07:11.420
So yeah, with Linux that was something which was one of those projects which was very visual

07:11.420 --> 07:16.260
out there and always when people talked about free software and public administrations it

07:16.260 --> 07:23.860
was about Munich and actually there were then political reasons and other reasons why they

07:23.860 --> 07:32.500
switched which had nothing to do with the licensing of the software and the results also they

07:32.500 --> 07:39.580
had in several of the studies about this steps was also that this has nothing to do, the

07:39.580 --> 07:45.260
failure which was there had nothing to do with the software but with management structures,

07:45.260 --> 07:52.940
with a lot of decentralization there which was not coordinated at all and yeah, there

07:52.940 --> 07:58.740
are, I think there are some recordings of me talking about Linux from other conferences

07:58.740 --> 08:04.420
which you, yeah, can then follow in longer detail about that.

08:05.420 --> 08:09.540
May I just add another sentence to Munich because it's super interesting and we are

08:09.540 --> 08:14.380
following this a lot and after the Linux case they still continue to do open source and

08:14.380 --> 08:18.700
they are one of the administrations still in Germany that are very like progressive

08:18.700 --> 08:23.700
in terms of how they procure open source and free software and just lately for example

08:23.700 --> 08:29.060
they joined the free software project as a sponsor so they even donate to projects so

08:29.060 --> 08:34.380
they found a way to not only procure software but also support free software projects with

08:34.380 --> 08:38.780
donations and that's something you should also like not forget about.

08:38.780 --> 08:45.860
Well I also think that this clause about not having market disruption by open source software

08:45.860 --> 08:47.780
is a completely bogus argument.

08:47.780 --> 08:49.540
I think that we can easily defeat that.

08:49.540 --> 08:55.420
I think that the European message of public money, public code is great and I think that

08:55.420 --> 08:58.180
there's a lot of reasons that we can defeat that argument.

08:58.180 --> 09:03.780
So I think that there's a lot of promise for public tenders for open source software.

09:03.780 --> 09:11.300
But I want to end my thoughts on how important I think this Neil for Jay decision is.

09:11.300 --> 09:16.940
I was tracking it but only superficially and now I'm actually very worried about it.

09:16.940 --> 09:23.860
It seems like the reason that I'm worried about it is that well we could say there are

09:23.860 --> 09:28.060
all other things that copyright can't reach.

09:28.060 --> 09:32.980
Copyright is still a tool that we use a lot and in particular the AGPL I think is a very

09:32.980 --> 09:37.060
important tool in the world of cloud based software.

09:37.060 --> 09:47.900
So for me the Neil for Jay decision feels like if we were to allow this to go to pass

09:47.900 --> 09:55.100
that proprietary relicensing would defeat the open source side of the license and that

09:55.100 --> 10:02.940
is really for me a very serious concern and I'm shocked that the court would feel comfortable

10:02.940 --> 10:07.700
excluding a part of the license that they didn't like and say that oh you can just ignore

10:07.700 --> 10:08.700
that.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.980
That seems ridiculous to me.

10:09.980 --> 10:16.260
So I'm very concerned about Neil for Jay and I'm hoping that it doesn't set a negative

10:16.260 --> 10:20.820
precedent for all open source software.

10:20.820 --> 10:30.700
I would say it could be a lot narrower than it seems like that decision.

10:30.700 --> 10:33.340
If when you read it it's kind of a mess.

10:33.340 --> 10:38.740
So trying to figure out what it stands for we'll have to see what happens on appeal but

10:38.740 --> 10:46.220
I think it's premature to feel like the sky is falling but it is it is just stressing

10:46.220 --> 10:53.060
that it's in this situation for sure.

10:53.060 --> 10:55.500
Any other thoughts before we open up for questions?

10:55.500 --> 11:01.220
Yeah let's see questions.

11:01.220 --> 11:02.220
Hello.

11:02.220 --> 11:24.260
Hi everyone thanks again for the wonderful DeVroom.

11:24.260 --> 11:38.540
My thought for the year is that we're seeing very much more than previous a complete differentiation

11:38.540 --> 11:45.180
on the way that open sourcing handle whether it's copy left or non copy left and I want

11:45.180 --> 11:46.180
to give an example.

11:46.180 --> 11:53.740
I was in a presentation a couple of days ago that they were talking about AI and yeah we

11:54.620 --> 12:02.260
will develop this wonderful system that will create code for you and we train it with lots

12:02.260 --> 12:09.380
of code that we found and we make sure that we remove all the copy left ones.

12:09.380 --> 12:19.740
So yeah it's a complete separation of how we treat copy left with non copy left while

12:19.740 --> 12:26.740
obligations for open source license are in both.

12:26.740 --> 12:33.340
Yeah I mean I think and one of the biggest problems with code generation systems is the

12:33.340 --> 12:39.580
lack of attribution and nearly every FOSS license copy left non copy left has attribution

12:39.580 --> 12:47.940
and I think you're correct that since there hasn't been any kind of aggressive raising

12:48.420 --> 12:53.700
of failure to attribute with regard to non copy left stuff I think companies who are doing

12:53.700 --> 12:59.100
this kind of code generation don't think they have to meet those requirements and those

12:59.100 --> 13:02.100
requirements are important and should be met.

13:02.100 --> 13:09.900
They're there in the license.

13:09.900 --> 13:14.540
Just to put in a simple find point that you missed is that using things like a generative

13:14.540 --> 13:19.940
model to generate your code your code is not copy rightable.

13:19.940 --> 13:22.820
You cannot copyright that code.

13:22.820 --> 13:28.300
The IP you still have the IP issues which may be involved which may be litigated but

13:28.300 --> 13:31.140
the code itself is not copyrighted.

13:31.140 --> 13:38.140
I'm not aware what decision held that and in what countries but I have heard.

13:44.540 --> 13:49.540
No it's unsettled.

13:49.540 --> 13:52.540
Sorry it's unsettled.

13:52.540 --> 13:56.540
No no but you are saying that there's no copyright.

13:56.540 --> 14:03.860
Just one big thing with the stream we cannot have a discussion with the panel because we

14:03.860 --> 14:10.380
just have two microphones so we need to keep it to a question and then we can try to answer

14:10.380 --> 14:14.620
else we need to put that after the session.

14:14.620 --> 14:17.220
It will not work with the live stream and the recording.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.860
Yeah definitely thank you.

14:19.860 --> 14:28.740
We were saying that the folks that are the folks who are responsible for these generative

14:28.740 --> 14:32.700
models of course want the output to not be copyrightable.

14:32.700 --> 14:40.340
The material they say can be used in whatever manner that the users decide but that doesn't

14:40.460 --> 14:47.460
mean that when copyrighted code is output from the generative model that the copyright

14:47.460 --> 14:52.060
doesn't apply and there are eight lawsuits in the United States none of which have been

14:52.060 --> 14:54.460
settled all on this topic.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.780
It will be really interesting.

14:55.780 --> 15:03.180
I don't know if everybody wants another legal policy dev room next year but if we have one

15:03.180 --> 15:07.180
next year we will probably be discussing the results of some of those cases although they

15:07.180 --> 15:09.500
will take a long time and there will be appeals.

15:09.540 --> 15:13.700
It's very interesting the copyright office in the United States is very very torn about

15:13.700 --> 15:20.500
this issue they just issued a call for comments we had software freedom conservancy gave comments.

15:20.500 --> 15:26.260
The FCC reached out to us about this issue we didn't even reach out to that agency they

15:26.260 --> 15:30.500
reached out to us and then they submitted their discussion with us and others to the

15:30.500 --> 15:34.100
copyright office so we submitted our own comments and then the FCC submitted.

15:34.100 --> 15:39.540
So this is all a discussion that's happening right now and you can see from the questions

15:39.540 --> 15:44.740
that the copyright office is asking that they are really not sure so it will be interesting

15:44.740 --> 15:45.740
to see.

15:45.740 --> 15:51.620
This is actually more of it's a meta comment about the organization of the dev room but

15:51.620 --> 15:53.740
we were actually a little bit surprised.

15:53.740 --> 15:57.180
I'll be frank I was pleasantly surprised that we did not get a lot of submissions this

15:57.180 --> 16:04.060
year we expected to have just like a giant stack of AI and this AI and that AI right

16:04.060 --> 16:06.220
because it's the fad topic right.

16:06.220 --> 16:11.940
We had a few but not as many and many of them were very speculative but if somebody wants

16:11.940 --> 16:16.500
to do a very for example if somebody wanted to do a survey of all the cases that are pending

16:16.500 --> 16:22.820
about copyright ability and artificial intelligence and FOS that would be a great submission for

16:22.820 --> 16:26.180
next year and we would welcome it.

16:26.420 --> 16:31.380
Building on that comment about copyright ability of generated code speaking only for the jurisdiction

16:31.380 --> 16:37.940
of England and Wales and probably British law in general UK law in general it is certainly

16:37.940 --> 16:44.820
the case that computer generated code does attract copyright that's specifically mentioned

16:44.820 --> 16:46.700
in the UK Copyright Act.

16:46.700 --> 16:51.300
What we don't know is exactly who the copyright holder is going to be it whoever made the

16:51.300 --> 16:55.940
arrangements and there is some fairly problematic well there's one very problematic case that

16:55.940 --> 17:02.580
suggests that it's the programmer whoever the programmer might be but anyway.

17:02.580 --> 17:10.060
Okay so your assignment for next year's dev room is for every country submit the cases

17:10.060 --> 17:11.660
that are pending on this question.

17:11.660 --> 17:16.860
First of it we could do like a five minute briefing right from each country.

17:16.860 --> 17:34.460
Yeah first of all sorry for my horrible English.

17:34.460 --> 17:40.540
Of course I don't want to talk about redhead but what is actually the problem.

17:40.540 --> 17:55.580
The problem in my perspective is such companies like Oracle for example maybe and what our

17:55.580 --> 18:06.940
solutions was one of the questions maybe we someone can explain what is the difference

18:06.940 --> 18:19.900
between 501 C3 and 501 C6 and the Linux foundation.

18:19.900 --> 18:29.100
Yeah it's not for public good and maybe that's a problem and maybe Karen you can tell us

18:29.100 --> 18:39.340
why people like you are not on the board and there is no community seat anymore and maybe

18:39.340 --> 18:47.940
something like this is a fucking problem in our community maybe people like Brian Landuk

18:47.940 --> 18:58.860
is talking about that for five years and more and nothing is happening and maybe we can

18:58.860 --> 19:06.340
talk about that and maybe our community can do something to build up a foundation or something

19:06.340 --> 19:15.700
like that maybe or there is one we can join and say yeah you are doing Linux and stuff

19:15.700 --> 19:25.860
like that for money gonna go fuck yourself and maybe stuff like that can bring a better

19:25.860 --> 19:33.820
and more healthy open source community by the way I'm well socialized with BSD but I

19:33.820 --> 19:47.980
love the GPL and GPL maybe is a success model that is getting ripped.

19:47.980 --> 19:54.940
And people say that I'm controversial when I make comments about the Linux foundation.

19:55.020 --> 19:58.860
So I think it's a good question I don't think it's as bad as you're putting it forward

19:58.860 --> 20:05.780
because what I've heard not just in the last year but more over the last two years from

20:05.780 --> 20:10.260
lots of companies that are members of trade associations like the Linux foundation which

20:10.260 --> 20:13.660
are the 501 C6 that's a US designation.

20:13.660 --> 20:16.460
I think 6 is twice as good as 3.

20:16.980 --> 20:28.260
I think companies are starting to realize that the C6 model of the open source foundation

20:28.260 --> 20:35.100
is really just a coin operated model to do things and if what you want is to throw a bunch

20:35.100 --> 20:40.060
of company money together and get a particular project done that benefits just those companies

20:40.060 --> 20:46.300
it's a reasonably good model to get that done but Microsoft is an example of a company

20:47.140 --> 20:50.740
that would want to get that done and if they want to collaborate with Intel and everybody else

20:50.740 --> 20:55.700
they throw their money in and they make a project and I don't really have much complaint about

20:55.700 --> 20:58.780
that activity of the Linux foundation.

20:58.780 --> 21:04.500
My traditional complaints about the 501 C6 models is when they attempt to say their job

21:04.500 --> 21:06.580
is to serve the public good.

21:06.580 --> 21:11.660
Their job is not to serve the public good their job is to serve the common business interest

21:11.780 --> 21:17.620
of their members which is usually quite different from the public good.

21:17.620 --> 21:21.940
In the last two years I think the entire community is getting a much better understanding

21:21.940 --> 21:29.260
of these two different very kind of like US tax geek forms of regulation of organization

21:29.260 --> 21:34.740
and understanding that a 501 C3 is a charitable organization in the US that has to act to

21:34.740 --> 21:38.940
the benefit of the entire public and a C6 is a trade association.

21:38.940 --> 21:44.220
We also have my colleagues from EPSF Europe here are just doing amazing work in Europe

21:44.220 --> 21:49.580
by using an EV structure and I don't know if you want to comment on how that operates

21:49.580 --> 21:54.340
and how you're able to do good things in Europe with that kind of governance structure.

21:54.340 --> 21:56.860
You mean with the association?

21:56.860 --> 21:59.100
Yeah, with EPSF Europe.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.220
Is EPSF Europe an EV?

22:01.220 --> 22:02.220
Yeah.

22:02.220 --> 22:08.140
I mean in Europe we rather have the problem that it's very difficult to create associations

22:08.140 --> 22:14.100
which are then charitable in all the countries so if you want to operate all over Europe

22:14.100 --> 22:15.980
that's very tricky.

22:15.980 --> 22:22.420
Some things might change there at the time when EPSF was founded in 2001 that option

22:22.420 --> 22:27.100
didn't exist so it was founded in Germany as an EV because that's quite easy.

22:27.100 --> 22:32.620
You just need a few people and then it's done and then you can become charitable afterwards

22:32.620 --> 22:39.140
but as an association you are then struggling with getting you have tax benefits for donors

22:39.140 --> 22:44.420
in Germany also in some other countries who didn't accept well if Germany said that you

22:44.420 --> 22:49.740
are a charitable organization then we also believe so but for a lot of other countries

22:49.740 --> 22:57.100
you don't and then it's less attract or you don't get the benefits from tax deductibility

22:57.100 --> 23:05.820
like you get in some other countries but related to that look out at those links over there

23:05.820 --> 23:12.300
so if you want to support organizations that are working on the issues mentioned here during

23:12.300 --> 23:17.900
the day then those are good starting points and of the advertisement and over to the next

23:17.900 --> 23:18.900
question.

23:18.900 --> 23:25.740
Well it might not be surprising that it's more comments than questions coming from

23:25.820 --> 23:32.780
me again and there's two things I have and one maybe from the first talk of the whole

23:32.780 --> 23:38.100
redhead thing people might have gotten the impression that I'm not like anti that I'm

23:38.100 --> 23:42.580
anti capitalist or something like I love money and I love making money and I think people

23:42.580 --> 23:45.900
in free software should be able to make money right.

23:45.900 --> 23:53.420
I think the issue that we see is freedom one or freedom zero says the freedom to use the

23:53.420 --> 24:00.060
software for any purpose without restriction and if we build systems where a for profit

24:00.060 --> 24:08.220
company has a commercial interest to restrict people to use their software they are fundamentally

24:08.220 --> 24:14.900
at odds with that freedom so we need to start building communities and systems where the

24:14.900 --> 24:20.900
code itself and the software itself is owned by a non-profit organization and then there

24:20.940 --> 24:26.260
can be an ecosystem of companies around that that sell support that sell distributions

24:26.260 --> 24:30.420
it's probably not going to be as easy as I'm trying to paint it here right but we need

24:30.420 --> 24:36.620
to avoid situations where a company owns large parts of the software and has a commercial

24:36.620 --> 24:43.300
interest to stop you from using their software without paying them money right that is an

24:43.300 --> 24:47.300
issue.

24:47.700 --> 24:55.900
Yeah to add some controversy there so I mean we at the moment we have some discussions

24:55.900 --> 25:05.660
about public procurement and how to create successful solutions for free software there

25:05.660 --> 25:10.860
and I mean one of the topics there is this issue about there's a procurement and you

25:10.860 --> 25:17.420
want to ensure that those who actually have an interest in further developing the solutions

25:17.420 --> 25:22.740
that they get the tenders they that they have the knowledge to actually fulfill the tender

25:22.740 --> 25:27.620
there and not just the cheapest offer so that is one of the issues and there I would

25:27.620 --> 25:34.900
also be very interested to hear from you afterwards what are good criteria you could add in tenders

25:34.940 --> 25:41.780
that ensure that it's actually the people who know the code best or who contribute a

25:41.780 --> 25:51.300
lot to the programs that you can rather ensure that they are more successful when they have

25:51.300 --> 25:56.860
free software experience than those who don't have any free software experience and whose

25:56.860 --> 26:02.260
contribution might also not end up benefiting others again.

26:02.340 --> 26:10.140
The other question that popped up there is how when you want to break the monopolies

26:10.140 --> 26:20.860
in a lot of those areas in public procurement in public sector software how do you have

26:20.860 --> 26:27.980
to create what conditions do you have to create that companies there can actually that they

26:27.980 --> 26:37.980
would also invest money to further improve the software by yeah by by taking some of

26:37.980 --> 26:43.820
the capital they have and investing that already before by anticipating what public

26:43.820 --> 26:49.220
administrations might want to have and that is a problem which is still with free software

26:49.220 --> 26:56.620
more complicated to accomplish that you make this upfront investments in comparison to

26:56.620 --> 27:03.060
proprietary software but I still think I mean there there are models out there where you don't

27:03.060 --> 27:09.540
need to have the software with organizations there can be models where software is with

27:09.540 --> 27:14.420
individuals with companies with others and I think I mean the great advantage of free software

27:14.420 --> 27:20.260
is that you can have this mixture you can have a company developing the software but on the other

27:20.260 --> 27:24.940
hand you can have public administration paying some employees to also be developers of that

27:24.980 --> 27:30.460
software and you can have other companies also providing services for the same software so I

27:30.460 --> 27:35.060
think that's that's one of the big advantages we have there and we don't have to decide like all

27:35.060 --> 27:43.020
the software has to be owned by foundations or by nonprofits or but you have this this this mixture

27:43.020 --> 27:50.140
and that's the thing that that is important that we can see what models work better yeah I just

27:50.140 --> 27:53.580
want to tease out a really interesting point there which is that historically we really did

27:53.620 --> 28:00.780
talk about like gaining corporate adoption that was like one of the big and individual hobbyist

28:00.780 --> 28:04.980
and individual contributions right like those are what we're focused on and we were a lot less

28:04.980 --> 28:13.420
focused on collective action and so we had some examples of nonprofits that took on big big

28:13.420 --> 28:20.140
software problems the problem that we have is getting is one having the momentum to get started

28:20.180 --> 28:26.660
to solve the really big problems that are hard to solve in a like in a distributed way and second

28:26.660 --> 28:35.660
the the problem is that the challenge of good governance for those nonprofits if you if those

28:35.660 --> 28:42.340
are the ones centralizing that that initiative is extremely difficult because transparency is

28:42.940 --> 28:51.340
essential but not enough you know conflict management is not enough and so I really I

28:51.340 --> 28:57.180
truly believe that we're in a situation where we need to try a much bigger nonprofit and

28:57.180 --> 29:03.620
governmental lead software solutions for really important huge infrastructure solutions but to

29:03.620 --> 29:08.860
do so we have to try radically different governance structures than we've ever done before I

29:09.460 --> 29:14.380
want to add on that I think I think the theme we've heard from you've been saying all day and

29:14.380 --> 29:22.180
Matias and Karen were both speaking to is that the problem of monoculture and software is obvious

29:22.180 --> 29:29.220
in proprietary software but it can also occur in free software and it is extremely difficult to

29:29.220 --> 29:35.980
design a licensing structure or a governance model that is guaranteed to prevent a monoculture

29:36.100 --> 29:43.020
from developing around the projects and I think it's an open problem in fast policy at this

29:43.020 --> 29:47.740
moment so the reason why we were all struggling so much we're like but that's so why are they

29:47.740 --> 29:50.980
doing that and they're all in control and they're doing the wrong thing and it's upsetting me

29:50.980 --> 29:56.860
because we don't it's not like we have a ready-made solution we say oh if you do it this way if you

29:56.860 --> 30:00.700
change your governance model this way we'll be guaranteed something bad like this won't happen

30:00.700 --> 30:04.660
we just don't know how to design that yet and something I think we're still learning as a

30:04.700 --> 30:12.300
community my question was a bit around that if we look at the Linux kernel like it was done by

30:12.300 --> 30:18.940
developers and they retain like even if there is the Linux foundation and so on they still retain

30:18.940 --> 30:26.700
some control like the maintainers can refuse non-free user space do we have model where the

30:26.700 --> 30:33.820
project is controlled by people like for instance in GNU and company can still participate but

30:34.340 --> 30:40.860
the agenda is really set by the maintainer do we have like different models and good models for that

30:40.860 --> 30:50.220
yeah so it's interesting to use Linux kernel as an example is that we've we've actually seen the

30:50.220 --> 30:59.780
Linux kernel drift into more of a oligarchy from what was a truly when I got when I downloaded my

30:59.820 --> 31:05.940
first copy of Linux in 1992 and wrote some patches for it you know it was truly a hobbyist project

31:05.940 --> 31:12.620
and was kind of all the best things about free software and the commercial interest in it led to

31:12.620 --> 31:18.500
this oligopoly you know there's like seven companies or something that are 90% of the

31:18.500 --> 31:26.340
contributions every every year into Linux upstream and holding all those copyrights so so a project

31:26.380 --> 31:30.740
totally drift and it's still under the GPL we still have the ability to get our third party

31:30.740 --> 31:35.500
beneficiary rights under the GPL and Linux so there's lots of good there but the governance model

31:35.500 --> 31:44.020
Linux is it has drifted to a more corporate governance model just basically organically and

31:44.020 --> 31:49.060
it's weird to think that a project could organically move from a hobbyist project to a to a more

31:49.060 --> 31:59.540
corporate project but it kind of did it yeah so I feel it's somewhat reminded to like the the essay

31:59.540 --> 32:04.180
the cassette will enter the bazaar by by this discussion I don't know whether it's general known

32:04.180 --> 32:09.780
but it's it's it's like quite some years old and I generally a good read but I wanted to actually

32:10.660 --> 32:18.420
ask a different question or like bring up a different point which we talked a lot about

32:18.420 --> 32:26.260
legal issues here and we basically did not talk about ethical issues at all no one talked about

32:26.260 --> 32:33.580
freedom and this is something that everyone talked about open source software and like this first

32:33.700 --> 32:42.300
talk free was used several times but only in regards to price no one ever thought about like the

32:42.300 --> 32:49.380
freedom of the users and I make made me a little bit sad because I mean there's like an FSF logo

32:49.380 --> 32:54.820
up there and I think yeah we should talk about ethics we should talk about the freedom that the

32:54.820 --> 32:59.620
users deserve that the users need that the developers need and we should talk more about

32:59.660 --> 33:07.900
freedom and about ethics well that reminds me of yes please applaud flat that that makes me think

33:07.900 --> 33:13.900
of one takeaway that I got from Bradley's talk today which in the main room about third-party

33:13.900 --> 33:21.500
beneficiaries and I think that I think that many of us you know read the open source licenses with

33:21.500 --> 33:26.940
that in mind it's sort of obvious you know that that the user is getting a huge benefit from these

33:26.980 --> 33:35.460
licenses and you know one at one you know if you if you take that thought with Linux you think well

33:35.460 --> 33:42.740
great as a user Linux is open source software but what's a little bit counterintuitive and this

33:42.740 --> 33:49.860
ties into the earlier discussion about trade associations is that the copyright holder for

33:49.900 --> 33:56.460
Linux kernel you know the Linux foundation specifically has the interests of the trade

33:56.460 --> 34:01.620
association in mind and not the third-party beneficiaries so I just wanted to call that out

34:01.620 --> 34:08.340
yeah I just I also want to add that in the first the rail panel you know when we were talking about

34:08.340 --> 34:14.180
the spirit of the GPL we were really talking about freedom we didn't put a fine point on it but

34:14.180 --> 34:19.060
that was at the heart of that conversation you know one of the things about this dev room is that

34:19.100 --> 34:24.300
we wanted to make sure that there is a place to have advanced conversations so not introductory

34:24.300 --> 34:28.300
conversations about the important legal topics that are happening now and I think your feedback is

34:28.300 --> 34:34.100
really astute because I think that sometimes we're so focused on more advanced issues that we don't

34:34.100 --> 34:39.980
take a beat to take a step back and talk about the the impact in a fundamental way so I like that we

34:39.980 --> 34:46.620
should do that next year I've you probably noticed that in recent years I've changed my rhetoric to

34:46.660 --> 34:53.860
talk more about rights and inalienable rights because I think I think that the the way people

34:53.860 --> 35:01.220
interpret the word freedom and free has this ability to polarize people and inalienable rights

35:01.220 --> 35:06.620
are a thing that every light the UN has a UN declaration of human rights there's this idea

35:06.620 --> 35:12.220
that there are certain rights human beings deserve just by being humans I personally think that the

35:12.220 --> 35:16.900
right to copy modify redistribute improve software is one of those rights and I actually think it's

35:16.900 --> 35:20.980
better rhetoric I kind of think we should have had a software rights movement from the start not a

35:20.980 --> 35:25.900
free software but I think I think it's better better kind of categorize that way myself but but

35:25.900 --> 35:32.860
but but terminology matters less than ideas I think and I think the ideas are are aligned in the

35:32.860 --> 35:37.860
ways that you're concerned about I think it's one of the exciting missy so you haven't talked yet

35:38.180 --> 35:49.060
did you did you want to did you want to answer this no there is another question here but okay then

35:49.060 --> 35:57.860
but I think it was a good reminder that we are as we have this deaf room as an advanced topic

35:57.860 --> 36:04.700
deaf room we sometimes forget to remind ourselves why we are discussing all those topics and that

36:04.860 --> 36:11.780
that's exactly what was mentioned there if we call it software freedom or user rights or freedom I

36:11.780 --> 36:18.620
think we should be on the same page there thank you sorry I'm about to change topic but I've been

36:18.620 --> 36:25.420
dev room hopping all day so forgive me if this has been it's Boston and but forgive me if this has

36:25.420 --> 36:30.460
been covered but I was just really interested with the expertise we've got around the panel here

36:31.420 --> 36:38.340
what people's opinions are on the current status of the CRA I was in the presentation earlier on

36:38.340 --> 36:44.420
in Janssen and I'm just wondering if I'm the only person who's terrified and if I'm wrong to be

36:44.420 --> 36:57.260
terrified yeah I mean we at first time I think we discussed it last year and also this year you

36:57.300 --> 37:03.220
mentioned the main hall discussion but there will be also a deaf room tomorrow and we have a

37:03.220 --> 37:09.260
longer discussion starting at 9 in the morning maybe basically we'll talk for two hours on the

37:09.260 --> 37:18.260
CIA I'd say it's a it's a major improvement from the initial draft what we got from the commission

37:18.260 --> 37:25.500
and that was improved a lot by the European Parliament by the Council by the Member States so

37:25.540 --> 37:30.620
that's that's definitely a step forward I struggle a bit to be honest with the wording in the

37:30.620 --> 37:35.980
product liability directive because the commercial activity is not that precisely defined as in

37:35.980 --> 37:43.620
the CIA so I'd say there we made a still an improvement and also compared to the initial

37:43.620 --> 37:51.580
Commission proposal but it's not that super awesome good and this is pretty much also true for the

37:51.740 --> 37:57.980
which is kind of like combined with the ideas of these kind of exemptions and also in all of these

37:57.980 --> 38:04.740
files they will be like covered with a lot of like guidelines and delegated acts and we will just

38:04.740 --> 38:10.900
like learn in a few years how it will pretty much look like and this is I think something we need

38:10.900 --> 38:15.660
to do for the next years is like pretty much monitor the market monitor what will what will

38:15.660 --> 38:20.420
happen there and this is also like pretty much a call so if you if you see companies struggling

38:20.420 --> 38:26.620
because of these files then it would be very important to let us know about this nonprofits are

38:26.620 --> 38:32.820
out for all of them and individual developers are out for for in all of these files so there

38:32.820 --> 38:38.140
shouldn't be issue but there might be an issue if you transform your nonprofit singing into a

38:38.140 --> 38:44.380
start up at one point but this is also I mean on the other hand covered also with the like

38:44.420 --> 38:50.660
what's what's what's what's defined so what does the what's the sanction and this is and there's

38:50.660 --> 38:56.460
also I mean there are different rules for small and microenter prices than for like big tech and

38:56.460 --> 39:05.500
that's that's something where we can say in the whole debate we managed it that we that we were

39:05.500 --> 39:10.500
able to to make our points to what's decision makers and they understood a lot about free

39:10.540 --> 39:14.740
software during the debate in the last year I think and that's something we can build on for

39:14.740 --> 39:21.820
future debates and this will help us I think a lot for next files that they might might come up as

39:21.820 --> 39:29.700
a better proposal there's a better initial proposal let's say and to quickly add there for

39:29.700 --> 39:35.220
organizations like the FSF to follow up on so such issues for decades as well as for other

39:35.260 --> 39:43.540
organizations working in free software like as a CEO or FSF who really are working for for

39:43.540 --> 39:49.140
user rights it's important that we have the resources to actually do that so have a look at

39:49.140 --> 39:54.860
this slide and I was gonna say on a logistical point one of the reasons why you didn't hear a lot

39:54.860 --> 39:59.220
of that content here is that we know that there's the room tomorrow but you know it's certainly

39:59.220 --> 40:03.060
within the scope of the dev room if there are specific topics that you'd like to see in the

40:03.100 --> 40:08.420
future if we put out a call for a dev room and you don't want to present as a speaker but you

40:08.420 --> 40:12.660
really wish that a topic would be covered just send us a note through the system and you can

40:12.660 --> 40:17.460
say I I really think this is an important topic and sometimes we get like sometimes we get several

40:17.460 --> 40:20.780
proposals about a topic but none of the talks are exactly right and that's sometimes how our

40:20.780 --> 40:24.780
panels get formed and we could do the same thing if there's a topic that you all want so don't

40:24.780 --> 40:30.620
feel like like those of you who come and especially some of you who are here you know a couple years

40:30.660 --> 40:34.820
in a row you've got a good idea of what you think should happen here and you can be a part of that

40:34.820 --> 40:42.180
organization I just want to add how how appreciative I work of Alex's work I am and FSEF Europe in

40:42.180 --> 40:49.820
general on the CRA stuff we we saw in the US all sorts of US companies trying to lobby about the

40:49.820 --> 40:54.020
CRA stuff and then of course being in the US organization we get asked like what you know

40:54.020 --> 40:58.500
why is this US company like involved in this and I mean I'm just a stupid American what do I know

40:58.500 --> 41:04.020
about what's going on in in Europe with with the EU regulation and being able to rely on Alex's

41:04.020 --> 41:08.660
expertise and FSEF Europe's was a huge benefit it was it was a really as we've been going through

41:08.660 --> 41:13.020
this process it's a it's a great collaboration to be able to work with the FSEF Europe folks on this

41:13.020 --> 41:17.540
to have a place to go like we have we can we have no idea but we can point you to the people who

41:17.540 --> 41:23.220
know everything about this and are doing the right thing with it. Oh okay I have no idea maybe you do.

41:23.220 --> 41:31.020
Yeah I will take advantage of these two last comments because one thing that I expected that

41:31.020 --> 41:37.340
will be discussed here and I've not been hearing for it about it all day is the Digital Services Act

41:37.340 --> 41:44.220
like we talked for many years with the problem with the platform side stepping all the issues

41:44.220 --> 41:50.940
about you know copyright and free software because they just you know they run the free software on

41:50.980 --> 41:56.940
servers but what they do is collect the data and now we have this very big European regulation and

41:56.940 --> 42:04.620
from what I've seen from the schedule it's a topic that is not being covered. I wanted to to make a

42:04.620 --> 42:12.420
proposal for a talk I didn't manage to to get to it but yeah as a suggestion and I don't know I wanted

42:12.420 --> 42:19.180
also to hear your opinion am I wrong in thinking that this is relevant for a room like this or not.

42:19.180 --> 42:37.980
I've been answering so many things. Yes I thought yes I can with a very like high probability

42:37.980 --> 42:45.260
think about that there will be submissions for next year's call for paper which are covering this area.

42:45.260 --> 42:59.500
So we take this feedback. Another one.

42:59.500 --> 43:13.460
Sorry just a really quick follow up in the in this first talk like literally someone on the

43:13.460 --> 43:20.540
panel said that it is OK to take away the rights to distribute the software from the users and as

43:20.540 --> 43:26.340
long as someone does this on the panel I think yeah OK we need to have basic discussions. Yeah we

43:26.900 --> 43:32.940
need to have a lot of basic discussions because like apparently we can't even agree on like four

43:32.940 --> 43:37.340
essential freedoms that the users of software should always have and be at their users of Reddit.

43:37.340 --> 43:44.500
And you I'm sure you saw my comment during that panel and the reason I made that comment was

43:44.500 --> 43:51.220
because I was like it was Liam who said that it lacked the nuance that needed to be there right

43:51.300 --> 43:57.420
and Liam's Leons journalist for the register we remind everybody and therefore the register is

43:57.420 --> 44:04.620
known for its controversy provocative headlines and I really I really think it is important on

44:04.620 --> 44:09.460
the rel issue and every other issue and the one of the reasons we run this dev room is that there

44:09.460 --> 44:16.860
was a tremendous amount of nuance to these issues right and and I think that too often people jump

44:16.940 --> 44:22.860
to conclusions about them as you saw Liam do for whatever reason Liam's case I think it's

44:22.860 --> 44:30.700
to get people reacting which is fine but but I think it's important we think about the nuance

44:30.700 --> 44:40.700
that's there. So I think we are we're almost done with the time what about we just have a short

44:40.700 --> 44:50.700
round what each one of us some last words famous last words of today. Okay the first last words

44:50.700 --> 44:58.140
yeah thank you for the feedback I'd say this is definitely something we will work on for next

44:58.140 --> 45:02.700
edition I'm really looking forward to next year maybe we get the big room again and maybe a bit

45:02.700 --> 45:08.700
longer so that we can address all the topics you want to see and it was a great fun again thank

45:08.700 --> 45:18.380
you so much. Okay then I just have two two messages one is please take away with you that

45:18.380 --> 45:27.300
it's important that we are paying more for people or organizations or companies that are ensuring

45:27.300 --> 45:32.980
that the software you get is will give you the four rights to use StudyShare and improve them

45:33.420 --> 45:40.660
then you give for those companies that restrict those and the second one is please add in your

45:40.660 --> 45:48.860
calendar the 14th of February and say thank you to some other people in our community so that they

45:48.860 --> 45:58.580
are motivated and see that their work for software freedom is appreciated. When you go back home open

45:58.580 --> 46:04.180
every box of every electronic device you've had and see if there's an offer for source code and

46:04.180 --> 46:12.260
test it if they give you anything go to the use the source site on Ask of Concurrency and work with

46:12.260 --> 46:18.580
us to test whether it actually complies with the GPL test your offers for source all year please. I

46:19.580 --> 46:28.860
love this idea of asking you for your ideas of what topics we should cover in the dev room. If you

46:28.860 --> 46:34.380
go in the FOSTA mailing list you'll see our call for participation that has our email address I

46:34.380 --> 46:45.940
will just say it to you now which is FOSTA legal dash policy at F-A-I-F dot US which is free as in

46:46.260 --> 46:53.580
freedom dot US and encourage you to send us an email with your thoughts about topics that we should

46:53.580 --> 46:58.020
cover in the future and thank you so much for coming. Crap that address is running on my mail

46:58.020 --> 47:03.620
server I'm a little scared now. And what I was going to say is that if you like this dev room and

47:03.620 --> 47:09.300
you wanted to happen next year we did get a very small block of time this year so mention to the

47:09.300 --> 47:14.700
FOSTA organizers that you like it that you want to see it again and that way they'll know when

47:14.780 --> 47:19.380
they're organizing it but I would say overall it's just been delightful to talk about these important

47:19.380 --> 47:24.420
issues you know obviously we would have liked to have talked about even more issues and have different

47:24.420 --> 47:31.220
formats for those conversations but it's really been lovely thanks to Alex, Matias, Bradley, Tom and

47:31.220 --> 47:34.500
everybody who's here have a great rest of your FOSTA.
