00:00.000 --> 00:11.840
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening. I guess the morning is over here. Good afternoon.

00:11.840 --> 00:18.640
Hi everyone. How are you all doing? Any energy in here? The last session of the day? Yeah,

00:18.640 --> 00:24.080
everyone seems pretty tired. Okay, I'm Angela. Great to meet you. This is Madeline and we're

00:24.080 --> 00:28.360
from Code for Science and Society. How many of you build products? How many of you are

00:28.400 --> 00:33.440
working on products? I assume almost every hand in this room is probably going to go up. Keep it up,

00:33.440 --> 00:39.120
keep it up, keep it up. All right, how many of you love operations of those people with their

00:39.120 --> 00:46.200
hands up? How many of you love running payroll every month? How many of you love when something

00:46.200 --> 00:52.680
happens in your bank doesn't actually pay the people? Everyone's calling you? No hands up.

00:52.680 --> 00:59.120
All right, well, so we have the magic solution for every single one of you that put your hands down.

00:59.120 --> 01:08.920
How many of you have heard of fiscal sponsorship? Oh, all right, well, you know the end of the talk,

01:08.920 --> 01:14.280
but Madeline, what is fiscal sponsorship? This magical thing that might help everyone in this room.

01:14.280 --> 01:19.800
Fiscal sponsorship is indeed a magical thing and it leverages economies of scale so that we build

01:19.920 --> 01:25.320
shared operational and administrative infrastructure so that projects can thrive. What that means is

01:25.320 --> 01:30.120
that you get to work under the umbrella of an organization who will handle things like your payroll,

01:30.120 --> 01:34.760
like your taxes, like your insurance, things that take up so much time and energy and take away

01:34.760 --> 01:39.320
from the ability that you have to invest in the things that you care about most. And it's not just

01:39.320 --> 01:43.480
that when you participate in an organization, you get extended some of the benefits of being in

01:43.480 --> 01:48.920
part of a nonprofit. In the US, for example, that's a 501c3, where you'll yield certain tax benefits.

01:49.480 --> 01:55.400
But what else do you get out of a fiscal sponsorship, Angela? Is it just operational and administrative infrastructure?

01:55.400 --> 02:01.640
Boring, shmoring, taxes, blah, payroll. The most interesting thing to me, I'm a people person,

02:01.640 --> 02:07.400
can you tell? I like people. Yes, I like people. Shocking. I think it's the people, right? Like,

02:07.400 --> 02:13.400
as we build all of these open source tech products, like everyone's head down, oh my god, I gotta get

02:13.400 --> 02:20.120
this code out. It's gonna break. What if you could actually come together with other people

02:20.120 --> 02:25.000
as we're doing here, but do it on a regular basis? You talk about the challenges you're facing. You

02:25.000 --> 02:29.880
share best practice, lessons learned. You talk about which funders might give you some money.

02:31.160 --> 02:36.680
The ability to actually come together and build camaraderie and build products that have shared

02:36.680 --> 02:41.800
ethos and mission alignment is, in my opinion, one of the best parts of being under a mission

02:41.800 --> 02:47.640
aligned fiscal sponsor. So we are very excited to answer any questions if you have them. We

02:47.640 --> 02:53.240
represent a fiscal sponsor. We are based in the US, but there are European fiscal sponsors as well.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.960
So for those who might not be familiar with them, they're actually some regional. Regionally, I

02:57.960 --> 03:03.160
think there's one in Berlin, if I'm not mistaken. And so it is an option even if you are a Europe

03:03.160 --> 03:08.680
based. So happy answering questions. Good luck with all your product building. Good luck finding

03:08.680 --> 03:16.760
someone to help you run your payroll. And look forward. She's very, very adept. Thank you so much.

03:21.000 --> 03:27.640
I see no questions, but come find us. We have time for questions. Yes, yes. Questions. Interactive.

03:27.640 --> 03:35.000
Someone said they wanted interaction. Yeah, please. Sounds. Maybe for our friends in online worlds.

03:38.680 --> 03:47.320
Non-profit. We have now founded an US entity and we are about to apply for fiscal sponsorship.

03:49.640 --> 03:56.760
This card that you take, so that's like a 15% cut. Do you consider this expensive or cheap?

03:57.800 --> 04:04.040
The question was, do you consider a 15% overhead charge or fee expensive or cheap?

04:04.840 --> 04:10.040
That's a good question, right? I think that every fiscal host does have some sort of percentage.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.760
It can range from, I think the lowest I've seen is 8%. This is my colleague,

04:14.760 --> 04:22.040
Rhea. Hi, Rhea. Emily Aucou, hey. We all are from CSNS. I think the lowest I've seen is 8%.

04:23.320 --> 04:29.320
And maybe on the higher side is 15. Usually this covers fees, right? So even just as those who run

04:29.400 --> 04:33.960
your own payrolls know there are fees with so many various platform services. And so all of those

04:33.960 --> 04:39.080
cost the labor of the operations and finance team. So I think it's a good question to ask. And as you're

04:39.080 --> 04:43.560
shopping around for your fiscal host, ask what they do and what they don't do. So some of them

04:43.560 --> 04:50.040
are very low touch. Others are very involved. And so depending on those aspects, the fee will change.

04:50.040 --> 04:54.200
Definitely. Anyone want to add anything? Angela, repeat the name of your org again.

04:54.920 --> 05:02.280
Our org is called Code for Science and Society, CSNS. We are based and registered in the U.S.

05:02.280 --> 05:08.440
as a 501C3. And we take open tech and open science projects and are willing to share our menu of

05:08.440 --> 05:21.560
services with you all if you're interested. So please come find us. Thank you. Thanks so much.
