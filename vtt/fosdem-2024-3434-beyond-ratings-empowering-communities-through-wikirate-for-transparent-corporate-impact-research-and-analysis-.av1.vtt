00:00.000 --> 00:13.760
Thanks. Hello. So my name is Vasily Gikazyaki and I'm a data engineer with Wikirate International.

00:13.760 --> 00:20.120
And I'm going to talk about how Wikirate empowers communities for transparent corporate impact

00:20.120 --> 00:27.080
research and analysis. But before we get into details about what Wikirate is, I would like

00:27.080 --> 00:34.680
to talk a little bit about what is the problem with environmental, social and governance data of companies.

00:34.680 --> 00:42.680
So usually when it comes to ESG data, we can say that they are expensive, exclusive and inconsistent.

00:42.680 --> 00:52.480
There are a lot of data sets hidden behind paywalls. So individuals need to pay thousands of euros per year to get access.

00:53.480 --> 01:00.080
Additionally, there are a lot of ratings. There are a lot of organizations actually producing ratings about companies.

01:00.080 --> 01:11.080
But the problem is they don't provide access to the low level data sets. So it's difficult really to understand what they are rating.

01:11.080 --> 01:16.080
And also, yeah, they don't make the methodologies transparent or the sources transparent.

01:17.080 --> 01:29.080
Yeah, finally, the last few years companies started reporting more ESG data in a text format, in sustainability reports.

01:29.080 --> 01:43.080
But the problem is that a lot of company reporting is not standardized and that hinders large scale analysis and comparisons between companies.

01:44.080 --> 01:49.080
So what makes open research so important in the context of corporate accountability?

01:49.080 --> 01:58.080
It actually fosters transparency in corporate practices and empowers different stakeholders, especially people that don't traditionally have access to those data.

01:58.080 --> 02:08.080
That they don't, let's say, investors and they don't have the money to pay to get access of this ESG data.

02:08.080 --> 02:17.080
It encourages collaborations in global scale and promotes data driven decision and policy maker making and drives positive changes.

02:17.080 --> 02:29.080
So Wikiread is an open source, open data platform that brings corporate ESG data together in one place, making it accessible, comparable and free for all.

02:29.080 --> 02:45.080
It's a wiki that means that anyone who has a passion for sustainability and ESG data can come to the platform, contribute to the research, contribute to the available data and organize their research as well.

02:45.080 --> 02:56.080
So our community is mainly comprised of civil society organizations, academics, university students, data and sustainability enthusiasts.

02:57.080 --> 03:09.080
And we strongly believe that in research and in research in companies everything starts with a question and ends with an answer.

03:09.080 --> 03:17.080
So I would like to give you a sort of overview of the structure of the data on Wikiread.

03:17.080 --> 03:26.080
So these research questions we call them metrics and we can have for its metrics several answers.

03:26.080 --> 03:33.080
And its answer is linked to a specific company, a year of reference and a specific source.

03:33.080 --> 03:46.080
So here we have an example about, did Airbnb UK Limited produce a statement in relation to any modern slavery legislation or act in 2022?

03:46.080 --> 03:49.080
And the answer in this case was yes.

03:49.080 --> 04:02.080
It produced a modern slavery statement under the UK Modern Slavery Act and there is a source and citation actually linked to this answer that leads to the actual modern slavery statement of a specific company.

04:02.080 --> 04:14.080
So in Wikiread in addition to research metrics we provide also calculated metrics as a tools for calculations and for analysis.

04:14.080 --> 04:28.080
We can say that the research metrics are actually the building blocks for analysis and the calculated metrics actually are built on top of research metrics and allow users to run calculations.

04:28.080 --> 04:48.080
So we do have namely Wikiread in score metrics, formula metrics and in more strictly formula metrics allow users to run their own calculations in coffee script so they can be quite complex or not complex.

04:48.080 --> 04:52.080
It depends on what the users want to do with the data.

04:52.080 --> 04:59.080
So and this actually, this calculated metrics helps to bring transparency into ratings.

04:59.080 --> 05:13.080
Here we have an example with the fashion transparency index is actually a rating that scores companies, fashion companies based on how transparent they are on different sustainability topics.

05:14.080 --> 05:39.080
We are a partner, we have a partnership with Fashion Revolution which is also an NGO and they're building, they do this analysis in research and we're helping them to actually make the research, the data, the ratings, the analysis, everything transparent available to the public.

05:40.080 --> 05:52.080
So one source of data on Wikiread is of course data that are coming from the ground, from civil society organizations but also there are a lot of data in the public domain.

05:52.080 --> 06:08.080
So it's easier to bring structured data and semi-structured data and building data integration pipelines to Wikiread but of course we do have the challenge of unstructured data and how we are going to bring those kind of answers into the platform.

06:08.080 --> 06:26.080
So for those reasons we are performing research projects and we have called for volunteers to come and research those reports and finding answers to questions on specific topics like modern slavery, greenhouse gas emissions, etc.

06:27.080 --> 06:38.080
So how is the data used? One use case of Wikiread data is building data dashboards that are actually used for advocating for change.

06:39.080 --> 06:55.080
One example is Fashion Checker which was developed in partnership with Klinglo's campaign and actually advocates for worker rights, especially worker rights on the supply chains of fast fashion companies.

06:56.080 --> 07:17.080
We have the Beyond Compliance dashboard that was also a partnership with Work Free Foundation and is a living data dashboard that assesses modern slavery reporting and tries to highlight gaps on modern slavery reporting and puts for new legislations and for new policies.

07:18.080 --> 07:36.080
Also the data is used for writing news articles and producing help CSO, CISO-Cyber-Suside Organization, produce reports and making research findings and analysis transparent.

07:37.080 --> 07:58.080
So it's also used for writing research papers, research some of those and Wikiread data are free, are under Creative Commons license so it's welcome to anyone to use the data, explore the data.

07:59.080 --> 08:14.080
They can do it through the API and through the user interface. We have an available RESTful API and several wrappers that will allow users to pull data from the platform, also contribute data to the platform if they want to.

08:15.080 --> 08:22.080
We also have a GraphQL endpoint that allows users to form more dynamic queries based on their needs.

08:22.080 --> 08:34.080
So where to start with Wikiread? If you're interested in contributing data, you can always say start with the guides please.

08:34.080 --> 08:37.080
Read the guides as most of the questions are answered there.

08:37.080 --> 08:41.080
But of course if you have any more questions you can directly contact us.

08:41.080 --> 08:49.080
And yeah we have several projects that are in need of contributors. You can help us improve the data.

08:49.080 --> 08:58.080
We have verification tasks, we have verification tasks so we ask the help of the community to help us with this process.

08:59.080 --> 09:06.080
And yeah if you are interested in volunteering these links are available to the slides.

09:06.080 --> 09:12.080
And yeah you can contact us if you want to share ideas with us, form partnerships or get support.

09:14.080 --> 09:19.080
Yeah as I said in the beginning Wikiread is an open source project written in Ruby.

09:19.080 --> 09:27.080
You can check out our github repository and if you want to get started with Wikiread and DECO you can do it.

09:27.080 --> 09:33.080
And you can also create if you want your own data dashboards if you're interested in ESG data.

09:34.080 --> 09:40.080
So yeah I think that's all from my side, maybe it was too fast.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.080
But yeah thank you.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.080
Thank you.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.080
We have maybe four minutes of questions.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.080
Hello.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.080
Hi.

09:55.080 --> 10:08.080
I have a question about if AI has helped you in a way in any of these processes for example while manipulating or getting data from the public domain or something like that.

10:08.080 --> 10:19.080
Yeah so yeah we are considering, sorry the question was about if AI helped us in any way obtaining data from the public domain.

10:19.080 --> 10:29.080
So the answer is that we are considering using now AI and LLMs for extracting actually more structured answers from text reports.

10:30.080 --> 10:36.080
But still we are in the test process so yeah hope that I answered your question.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.080
Yeah.

10:40.080 --> 10:44.080
How much of companies are covered by the data set?

10:44.080 --> 10:48.080
Is there specific industries you are targeting?

10:48.080 --> 10:53.080
Yeah so yeah we have about, I'm sorry yeah.

10:53.080 --> 10:59.080
The question was how many companies we cover at the moment on the platform.

10:59.080 --> 11:05.080
So we cover about 1400,000 companies.

11:06.080 --> 11:12.080
The biggest focus on research or the biggest companies.

11:12.080 --> 11:28.080
So more data can be found at a very popular let's say companies and because we did have a lot of projects on the fashion industry we do have a lot of data about fashion companies.

11:29.080 --> 11:33.080
And in total at the moment we have five million answers.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.080
So yeah.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.080
Any other questions?

11:41.080 --> 11:42.080
Yeah sorry.

11:42.080 --> 11:51.080
So it's open to contribution as far as I recall and you mentioned some verifiers.

11:51.080 --> 12:04.080
I want to ask how do you make sure the data is consistent and how do you go through the checks and see if the data is reliable?

12:04.080 --> 12:14.080
Yeah so yeah the question is how we check that the data that they are coming into the platform is reliable.

12:14.080 --> 12:21.080
And of course it's a question also because we are doing crowd research sometimes people do not have the expertise on ESD topics.

12:21.080 --> 12:26.080
And what we do is we have different verification levels.

12:26.080 --> 12:38.080
So we consider an answer verified when more than two people have come to the same conclusion.

12:38.080 --> 12:44.080
And you can see on the platform that we have Stuart verify and community verified.

12:44.080 --> 12:52.080
Stuart's usually are members of the community that they have more expertise on the specific topics that the research is about.

12:56.080 --> 13:02.080
I'm always the person that's like let's squeeze as many questions as possible so we'll do really rapid questions right now.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.080
Very quickly.

13:03.080 --> 13:08.080
I was just wondering if this could be expanded to cover other types of data rather than ESD.

13:09.080 --> 13:14.080
The question is if this could be expanded to cover other types of data.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.080
Yes it can.

13:18.080 --> 13:27.080
It's again about environmental data but one use case that it comes on the top of my mind now we are having companies you can have something similar for countries.

13:28.080 --> 13:37.080
So you can highlight for instance the electricity or water usage or CO2 emissions per country and not focusing specific on companies.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.080
Thank you so much.
