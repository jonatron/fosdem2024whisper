WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.840
Okay.

00:12.840 --> 00:21.640
So then we can go over to the panel in a second.

00:21.640 --> 00:26.960
Next to the people you just already met, we have Jules from the European Parliament here

00:26.960 --> 00:33.160
and Walter who is from Freischrift and also connected to Etri.

00:33.160 --> 00:40.560
And we want to now basically discuss what we've learned during the day with CIA,

00:40.560 --> 00:43.560
but also like in these quick lightning talks.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.360
And there was an interesting question from the Matrix Channel,

00:46.360 --> 00:50.360
and I want to use this to kick off the panel and ask you,

00:50.360 --> 00:53.560
open source is a worldwide and thus also European thing,

00:53.560 --> 00:57.160
one of the few citizens movements that is somewhat European.

00:57.160 --> 01:00.560
And the European Commission is most mostly unaware.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.960
Question mark.

01:01.960 --> 01:07.560
Do you agree on this or do you agree that like the open source community is not around in Europe at all

01:07.560 --> 01:13.560
and that the European Commission doesn't care at all or how do you see the situation?

01:13.560 --> 01:17.560
Maybe also in the Commission, but also in the Parliament and Walter,

01:17.560 --> 01:19.960
you want to jump in immediately.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.360
Then Walter, you have the floor.

01:23.360 --> 01:29.360
I would agree with the idea that it's a global thing and also that's a very much a European thing.

01:29.360 --> 01:34.360
I'm not really aware of any equivalence of FOSDEM elsewhere on the planet.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.360
FOSDEM is in that sense a very unique community event.

01:37.360 --> 01:41.360
So in that sense, it is a European open source community.

01:41.360 --> 01:49.360
Moving on to the Commission, one of the things that is worth to keep in mind when you try to engage with policymakers

01:49.360 --> 01:52.360
is that governments are not monolithic entities.

01:52.360 --> 01:58.360
And I think the CRA itself has proved that half of the Commission was not knowing what the other half was doing.

01:58.360 --> 02:03.360
Also be aware that in large bureaucracies people come and go.

02:03.360 --> 02:07.360
So there may have been wonderful people four years ago in the Commission.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.360
They have moved on to different positions.

02:09.360 --> 02:15.360
So if you're talking to a bureaucrat or a bureaucrat in your own country,

02:15.360 --> 02:21.360
be aware that they have certain powers and influence, but it may not extend to the things you want to have changed.

02:21.360 --> 02:26.360
So that was more the point I was going to make and I'd like to hand over the microphone to someone else now.

02:26.360 --> 02:28.360
Who wants to jump in then?

02:28.360 --> 02:31.360
I can try.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.360
So one question is the global nature.

02:35.360 --> 02:42.360
If you look at the statistics that we got from 1,000 projects,

02:42.360 --> 02:45.360
and it's not insignificant statistically,

02:45.360 --> 02:53.360
you will find that the people that are working in our projects are very well aligned with European policies.

02:53.360 --> 02:59.360
It can be this European declaration for digital rights and principles that was mentioned,

02:59.360 --> 03:06.360
but it's also surprisingly a very good alignment with the policies that like CRA or DMA, DSA,

03:06.360 --> 03:11.360
there is an alignment and the community, open source community we are dealing with,

03:11.360 --> 03:17.360
they are very much impacting the implementation of this policy.

03:17.360 --> 03:21.360
Now for the Commission, yes, it's a large bureaucracy.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.360
There are a lot of departments there.

03:23.360 --> 03:32.360
I'm representing the one that is funding, so assumingly a bit more friendly with you guys.

03:32.360 --> 03:40.360
For the legislation part, I think the CRA is an example of ultimately a good relationship.

03:40.360 --> 03:44.360
The question is how to represent the communities.

03:44.360 --> 03:48.360
There are a lot of organizations at job and level, and I think they did a great job in this context.

03:48.360 --> 03:54.360
Now what is true is that the developers themselves, they are working on what they like to do,

03:54.360 --> 04:02.360
and they are not necessarily very interested in this discussion and conversation at policy making level.

04:02.360 --> 04:09.360
So in that context, there is in my view a lack of representation of developers themselves.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.360
It's also true at the national level.

04:12.360 --> 04:16.360
It was mentioned the legislation at European level is a co-legislation,

04:16.360 --> 04:23.360
so member states and the parliament are key players, and we don't see, well, it's maybe it's a biased view,

04:23.360 --> 04:29.360
but at the national level there is also a need for representation of the communities

04:29.360 --> 04:34.360
so that they can influence a national but also European level development of policy.

04:34.360 --> 04:38.360
There are a lot more to say, but I think we can give the floor to the others.

04:38.360 --> 04:44.360
Thank you. I work for the European Parliament delegation in the European Parliament.

04:44.360 --> 04:51.360
That's why I'm here today, and I won't talk specifically about the commission, but more about the parliament, which I know better.

04:52.360 --> 05:01.360
And in that case, for PLD and CRF, for instance, we've seen that there were slight inconsistencies in the outcome of the negotiations

05:01.360 --> 05:07.360
between the two legislations, which shows that there is also lack of awareness in general,

05:07.360 --> 05:11.360
and we've seen that especially at the beginning of the term where there was a great lack of awareness

05:11.360 --> 05:17.360
on what open source is, what open source community is, and especially how diverse the community is,

05:17.360 --> 05:23.360
because you have foundations, business models, but also hobbyists, which are different persons, different interests.

05:23.360 --> 05:29.360
And that was reflected, I think, in the PLD and CRF, that at the beginning there was this commercial activity

05:29.360 --> 05:36.360
that was very much defined, and anyway, on the general level, I would say that along the term,

05:36.360 --> 05:42.360
the awareness raising has worked, and that, for instance, in PLD, the rapporteur were very much open

05:42.360 --> 05:47.360
to include interesting elements and important elements for open source community

05:47.360 --> 05:50.360
and to better protect open source community, so I would say it's getting better.

05:56.360 --> 06:03.360
Yes, sure. I mean, I think everyone has a role to play, and we see how people organically step up

06:03.360 --> 06:08.360
and how things play for them when they do it. I think it's a very democratic approach as well.

06:09.360 --> 06:16.360
I think the past year has proven that it's possible to influence EU policy, even if it's not organized,

06:16.360 --> 06:20.360
and of course, all the lessons are being made today.

06:20.360 --> 06:27.360
But again, I want just to remind that the European Commission was here at the keynote of FOSDAME five years ago

06:27.360 --> 06:33.360
to mention the fact that there was funding available and other communication passed really well,

06:33.360 --> 06:41.360
and the thousand projects exist today, so I guess a similar approach has to be found for voicing EU policy concerns

06:41.360 --> 06:47.360
to a certain extent, and of course, if some key stakeholders in the community, be it the foundations

06:47.360 --> 06:53.360
or those in the room today, can help in creating some forms of guidelines and templates

06:53.360 --> 06:58.360
just to make sure that we have a good understanding of the future.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.360
Thank you.

07:33.360 --> 07:36.360
Thank you.

08:03.360 --> 08:13.360
It also costs much more of institutionalization at the Brussels level.

08:13.360 --> 08:22.360
Get subscribed to those newsletters, but there's bad news inside of the good news again

08:22.360 --> 08:26.360
because the digital rights groups have more and more become professionalized,

08:26.360 --> 08:30.360
and you end up hiring people with background in law international relations

08:30.360 --> 08:35.360
because you're engaging with legislative processes and you want people to understand law.

08:35.360 --> 08:40.360
But then you end up with similar knowledge gaps inside civil society,

08:40.360 --> 08:46.360
and there's also a need for people with background in development and a more technical background

08:46.360 --> 08:51.360
to keep engaging their nearest digital rights NGOs, et cetera,

08:51.360 --> 08:57.360
and they're quite most welcome to do so because one of the things I find regrettable is that civil society

08:57.360 --> 09:00.360
did not mobilize quick enough around the CRA.

09:00.360 --> 09:07.360
It's more a case of good luck or a happy coincidence that we got where we are,

09:07.360 --> 09:12.360
which I still think is not good enough, but not as bad as it could have been.

09:12.360 --> 09:20.360
It also shows that there's work to be done on the civil society side of these things.

09:20.360 --> 09:25.360
Yeah, absolutely. And I also do believe that with this we can open up the discussion a bit

09:25.360 --> 09:29.360
so that we turn this panel into a fishbowl.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.360
So that's basically the idea and I want to do this together with Karen.

09:32.360 --> 09:38.360
Maybe you first introduce yourself and then we explain a bit what we are trying to achieve.

09:38.360 --> 09:44.360
Hi, I'm Karen, and I have been sort of coming to not fuss them,

09:44.360 --> 09:46.360
but digital events, I was saying to Walter,

09:46.360 --> 09:54.360
I could have worn a t-shirt like his, but a different model, different size from the CCC.

09:55.360 --> 10:01.360
I got engaged in sort of trying to figure out how tech influences society,

10:01.360 --> 10:07.360
and then I got into politics, and now I'm in the European Parliament for the Liberal Group

10:07.360 --> 10:13.360
and was working together with Jules on ensuring that open source was included into the PLD

10:13.360 --> 10:20.360
in some of the last sort of shadow meetings and trilogues by taking text from the CRA.

10:20.360 --> 10:25.360
And it's quite apt that I'm in a fishbowl because politicians have so much going on

10:25.360 --> 10:30.360
that they're a little bit like goldfish, so you need to remind them and keep telling them what they need to know.

10:31.360 --> 10:36.360
Yeah, and with this, so a fishbowl discussion means that normally we have these panel discussions

10:36.360 --> 10:40.360
and then you are happy to ask questions and then panelists address them somehow

10:40.360 --> 10:44.360
and basically we talk about ourselves, but there's this empty seat here

10:44.360 --> 10:49.360
and yeah, and we feel to use it and to take part in the panel discussion with the panelists

10:49.360 --> 10:54.360
and so put your points on the table, but also discuss with the other panelists,

10:54.360 --> 11:00.360
so feel free to join. First of all, but we also have to say that as this is foster,

11:00.360 --> 11:08.360
we would not take the first ones and dropping by, but we will also look a bit for diversity

11:08.360 --> 11:14.360
and so we highly encourage you if you are not quite male men to also take part in this discussion here

11:14.360 --> 11:20.360
and I think it's in particular important for Fossum to do so, so please take this empty chair

11:20.360 --> 11:23.360
and take part in the discussion.

11:23.360 --> 11:28.360
Yeah, so, okay, anyone else?

11:31.360 --> 11:34.360
Then feel free. Yeah, sure.

11:34.360 --> 11:40.360
So the only most important thing is, yeah, respect yourself and please with the microphone.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.360
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.360
Yeah, so let's see how it works exactly.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.360
Yeah, yeah.

11:52.360 --> 11:56.360
Yeah, so and I said it's important to have the microphone for or like.

11:56.360 --> 12:00.360
I understand that, yes, and speak loudly regardless. Good.

12:00.360 --> 12:04.360
And don't worry, I'm not going to stay here for very long.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.360
I'm going to step out as soon as I can.

12:06.360 --> 12:22.360
Anyways, I'm Jonas and I work for Nokia and responsible for open source things there and the kind of like I'm been really excited about the topics of kind of like what has been going over the what is now called the policy week,

12:22.360 --> 12:33.360
starting with the commission thing on Thursday, then the open forum Europe thing and now this the discussions here.

12:33.360 --> 12:52.360
One thing that I noticed that in the in these discussions is that and some of these discussions I've heard before so I have a little bit of a kind of like an dark past so I am and recovering standards person and I have a history and internet governance things

12:52.360 --> 13:05.360
and they there's a lot of parallels into the kind of like where we are now as an open source community where we were in a kind of like Internet community community when it started in like early 2000s the discussions.

13:05.360 --> 13:17.360
So but the good thing sadly that's kind of like that comes with good and bad things and the good things is that people now finally understand that open source is actually something very important for the society.

13:17.360 --> 13:27.360
Bad things is that people get very interested in those things and then things like political interests come in involved as well and all of a sudden we need to get organized differently.

13:27.360 --> 13:40.360
So but I think that the good thing is that we've done this in the Internet community already before and I think we can look at some of the processes and some of the kind of like things what we did at that time.

13:41.360 --> 13:47.360
And similarly like an open source community the Internet community was very diverse community.

13:47.360 --> 13:59.360
So we had big companies like me for working for Nokia we had small people that were advocates and then they kind of like we had the civil society and then governments and so on.

13:59.360 --> 14:04.360
And the thing is also that we need to organize ourselves in a little bit of similar fashion.

14:05.360 --> 14:20.360
So and I think that there is a little bit grass roots already happening that that because for instance for us in there were a lot of people said that the open source community is not as organized as the industry or something like that.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.360
To be honest in this topic the industry wasn't very well organized.

14:23.360 --> 14:32.360
I started to read about the C.R.A. from actually the NL Labs blog post which was very good that woke up a little bit.

14:32.360 --> 14:35.360
Hey what is this and what should we look at that.

14:35.360 --> 14:52.360
And and then the kind of like the overall discussion started to go a little bit and I agree that even for the kind of like industry we had a lot of luck because we had a lot of people driving towards the same direction from the open source community.

14:52.360 --> 14:56.360
As what we need also as part of the open source community.

14:56.360 --> 15:04.360
The other thing is that what we want to start to work work together is kind of like looking at that we are all part of the community.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.360
We have different views.

15:06.360 --> 15:21.360
We have different approaches and stuff like that and we have to focus on those things that what we are in common and then look at it using the different strengths that are and the facts that different people are parts of the community.

15:21.360 --> 15:30.360
Even though that not always sharing the same ideas are also present in the different rooms that might be even difficult to get into by other parts of the community.

15:30.360 --> 15:40.360
And I think that through this we most probably can get into very fruitful conversations and very fruitful cooperation among the overall open source community.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.360
I hope this helps.

15:45.360 --> 15:48.360
Okay yeah anyone who wants to react on this.

15:51.360 --> 16:00.360
I think one of the key point when you reach out to institutions is get organized.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.360
I'm sorry.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.360
Get organized.

16:02.360 --> 16:04.360
Get organized first.

16:04.360 --> 16:08.360
Get on time especially because then negotiations can go fast.

16:08.360 --> 16:16.360
So you have to be there on time so that we can take on board your your inputs on time because then otherwise is very difficult.

16:16.360 --> 16:24.360
And the last thing is especially if you get organized that we can have one single contact point for instance which for us is very useful.

16:24.360 --> 16:31.360
And also for your inputs on the institution side again because you also have the campaigning side but for us what is useful is your expertise.

16:31.360 --> 16:33.360
So we need your expertise.

16:33.360 --> 16:39.360
And in that case we need your inputs on very specific points sometimes on the low side sometimes on the technical side.

16:39.360 --> 16:47.360
And that is why you need to get organized so have diverse teams so that they can provide inputs on low and technical side which is very important for us.

16:52.360 --> 16:58.360
Well I think as Kieran was saying earlier it's really important to get engaged early because that's when you'll have the most influence.

16:58.360 --> 17:06.360
And then also I think what Walt was saying earlier was that I mean it's kind of been forgotten what happened in the early 2000s.

17:06.360 --> 17:13.360
You had the software patents you also had actor and you've had the copyright directive.

17:13.360 --> 17:25.360
And I mean there is forces that can be mobilized that can actually reach the MEPs and now is actually the time to influence people and get it because they're running to be elected.

17:25.360 --> 17:27.360
So now is when they'll be listening.

17:28.360 --> 17:41.360
And the problem is since 2005 is that the big companies and society has gotten more engaged in regulation of technology but not always in the good way.

17:41.360 --> 17:46.360
It's sort of like let's use technology as a magical source to fix our problems.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.360
You have initiatives in the U.S.

17:49.360 --> 17:55.360
You have initiatives in the EU that are not very positive for regulating technology.

17:55.360 --> 17:59.360
You have safer kids online in the U.S. in the Congress.

17:59.360 --> 18:05.360
You have chat control in the EU which is probably going to go to the next mandate.

18:05.360 --> 18:17.360
And be aware that people that you think would be obvious to be supporting inclusion and adapting to open source might not always be so.

18:17.360 --> 18:31.360
We had a lot of pushback from the social democratic group in the parliament against including provisions for open source in the product liability directive because they were worried about protecting consumers.

18:31.360 --> 18:40.360
So you need to like really be able to explain the digital side to politicians that don't always get it and want to sort of regulate tech in a bad way.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.360
It's hard to be more.

18:50.360 --> 18:58.360
We don't really need to step into the middle like this is already a circle.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.360
Even better in terms of forum.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.360
We don't all look to the same people.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.360
That's pretty true.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.360
Yeah.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.360
For the next one.

19:06.360 --> 19:08.360
Okay.

19:08.360 --> 19:13.360
So everybody says get engaged.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.360
Everybody says get engaged early.

19:16.360 --> 19:24.360
And there were really good processes for that within the EU with Green Book, Blue Book, the whole shebang.

19:24.360 --> 19:27.360
And here we skipped a lot of the processes it seemed.

19:27.360 --> 19:29.360
Why did we do that?

19:32.360 --> 19:34.360
Is it not working?

19:34.360 --> 19:36.360
Yeah.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.360
Okay.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.360
Hi, I'm Jordan.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.360
I'm Karen's assistant.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.360
And I think you raised perhaps what is the single most important point.

19:46.360 --> 19:53.360
But I think the reason that we skipped a lot of that is because a lot of people aren't aware that you have this possibility like and it's.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.360
Yeah.

19:55.360 --> 20:01.360
But it's it's it's it's it's also it's also exhausting to have to keep an eye on all of the legislative proposals that are coming out of the commission.

20:01.360 --> 20:07.360
You know, I mean, I don't know how many they come, but it's a good like 30 or 40 proposals every every year.

20:07.360 --> 20:11.360
And I mean, yeah, we should like it's important that we keep an eye on this.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.360
Yeah, exactly.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.360
Exactly.

20:14.360 --> 20:15.360
No, no, no.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.360
I 100% agree.

20:17.360 --> 20:18.360
100% agree.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.360
I'm super sorry.

20:19.360 --> 20:23.360
The thing is we need to keep the microphone for the live stream running.

20:23.360 --> 20:28.360
So that's so please even repeat when you do this strategy.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.360
Or do you want to?

20:31.360 --> 20:34.360
I'll take some of the tone out.

20:34.360 --> 20:53.360
What I said was if in response to the notion that there's like it's busy if you're in parliament to keep track of everything, we're actually as a community are being told we have to be proactive and track everything and it's we're just not set up to do it and it's

20:53.360 --> 20:56.360
Speak closer to the microphone. Interesting.

20:56.360 --> 21:13.360
Okay, so what I was trying to say is if it's exhausting for the people who actually work in parliament to keep track of everything, imagine how exhausting it is for the people that are just in the open source community dodging bullets as they come down from the sky.

21:13.360 --> 21:20.360
Very briefly, but also very importantly, parliament does not have to be a public parliament.

21:20.360 --> 21:25.360
Very briefly, but also very importantly, parliament does not have to write the inshaed legislation.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.360
You're barking up the wrong tree.

21:27.360 --> 21:30.360
It's the commission that has been overwhelming everyone else.

21:30.360 --> 21:41.360
They have a massive tsunami of really crap proposals in the past mandate.

21:41.360 --> 21:45.360
So was that the reason that the normal process was great to skip?

21:45.360 --> 21:59.360
Because if we have to be engaged early for us, this process is ideal because you then have one of these books, you can send it to people like look what's there and then respond.

21:59.360 --> 22:05.360
And because we skipped that formal process.

22:05.360 --> 22:10.360
How can we engage early if we don't see what's happening?

22:10.360 --> 22:15.360
Well, there is an obligation of transparency.

22:15.360 --> 22:18.360
There are processes like impact assessment.

22:18.360 --> 22:25.360
But I know it's something completely foreign from a lot of people.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.360
And here I see a gap personally.

22:27.360 --> 22:29.360
Again, I'm not on the legislation part.

22:29.360 --> 22:30.360
I'm not on the funding part.

22:30.360 --> 22:36.360
But the gap is that we heard that open source is very important.

22:36.360 --> 22:41.360
It's 80% of modern software.

22:41.360 --> 22:46.360
It's a large part of the IT business and IT stack.

22:46.360 --> 22:50.360
And a lot of players are benefit from it.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.360
The question is, so it's important, but there is a gap of representation.

22:55.360 --> 22:57.360
It's not in the mind of a policymaker.

22:57.360 --> 23:01.360
So what you describe is a situation where open source comes after.

23:01.360 --> 23:11.360
But if it would come first, it would mean that decision makers have this understanding that open source is important, especially in Europe.

23:11.360 --> 23:18.360
So this gap, in my view, is the main reason why we are late in the process.

23:18.360 --> 23:25.360
And to address this gap, it's a question of making decision makers that you guys are important.

23:25.360 --> 23:33.360
So it's a question of having people from the community representing, okay, we have European organizations that are doing great job,

23:33.360 --> 23:40.360
but we also need the grassroot people and the process to democratically represent them at the level of decision makers.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.360
That's my impression.

23:49.360 --> 23:50.360
Okay, I got it.

23:50.360 --> 23:54.360
So I was, thank you for all the answers to this.

23:54.360 --> 24:05.360
And I was listening a little bit to what you were saying, but also to the point that we're made throughout the week since we had this event from the commission, the OFE event as well yesterday, the summit, what they call.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.360
And it reminds me of something I used to work on before.

24:08.360 --> 24:14.360
That's called SME policies and this principle that is called the Think Small First Principle.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.360
It was developed by an expert group on SMEs.

24:16.360 --> 24:21.360
Hopefully one day the commission has an expert group on open source so that we can actually reflect on those principles.

24:21.360 --> 24:25.360
And I was reading through the paper that was written in 2009.

24:25.360 --> 24:30.360
And just if you look at the table of contents, it starts with the importance of SMEs in the EU economy.

24:30.360 --> 24:34.360
That's exactly what we've proven throughout the week, the importance of open source for the economy.

24:34.360 --> 24:37.360
The impact on regulations have on SMEs.

24:37.360 --> 24:41.360
We're in the same situation, impact that regulations have on open source.

24:41.360 --> 24:45.360
And then they explain what is a Think Small First Principle.

24:45.360 --> 24:50.360
First, listening to SMEs, listening to open source community.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.360
The second is what they call the SME test.

24:52.360 --> 24:57.360
Why don't we just go for an open source test every time we enter into a digital legislation?

24:57.360 --> 25:00.360
We think, can we apply this to open source?

25:00.360 --> 25:02.360
Does it work with open source or not?

25:02.360 --> 25:07.360
And then after that, it's a bunch of stuff that are way too bureaucratic for me to read them through today.

25:07.360 --> 25:14.360
But maybe if we have an expert group one day, we can actually build us the bureaucratic stuff as well specifically for open source.

25:14.360 --> 25:20.360
So I'm thinking, you know, we've been discussing the processes, but maybe also the policies could be adapted.

25:20.360 --> 25:35.360
So I have just a practical proposal.

25:35.360 --> 25:41.360
There used to be an application that was called Follow the Law.

25:41.360 --> 25:46.360
And then you could just put in like, I'm interested in digital legislation.

25:46.360 --> 25:53.360
And then you would be notified at the beginning of the process that a process was happening.

25:53.360 --> 26:01.360
And you could follow all the way through at what point it was, who you would need to address if you wanted to be part of it.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.360
So maybe this can be remade again.

26:04.360 --> 26:09.360
Unfortunately, it is no longer.

26:09.360 --> 26:16.360
Someone from the panel wants to say on some of these remarks here.

26:16.360 --> 26:18.360
Yes, exactly.

26:18.360 --> 26:22.360
I was hoping someone would step up from the community and said we have a tool to help for this.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.360
So, kudos to you.

26:24.360 --> 26:34.360
Another point we've mentioned that many times in this conference and the previous conferences, software is pervasive everywhere.

26:34.360 --> 26:41.360
There will be software in everything as the world goes digital, and therefore there will be more regulation.

26:41.360 --> 26:51.360
That's unavoidable because software probably will be a commodity, just like we're regulating our air and our water and our electricity.

26:51.360 --> 27:01.360
So probably my question also to the open source community today is what legislation would you like to have to help open source?

27:01.360 --> 27:12.360
I think that would be a valid question as well.

27:12.360 --> 27:28.360
So I would like to respond to the gentleman in the red shirt because he said it would be a good idea to check policy against as a me interest of the EU.

27:28.360 --> 27:38.360
And especially open standards can really help bring forward the position of open source within the EU.

27:38.360 --> 27:50.360
And it would help European SMEs a lot if open standards are at the forefront of EU policy because that helps our sovereignty.

27:50.360 --> 28:04.360
It helps European companies exist in a landscape with big tech and really help small companies to compete.

28:04.360 --> 28:11.360
And if local governments are keeping to open standards, that helps a lot for SMEs.

28:11.360 --> 28:16.360
So maybe take it from the standard side and that will help engage open source as well.

28:20.360 --> 28:35.360
I'm Jason Peccio, I'm a biomedical engineer and I work in Brussels.

28:35.360 --> 28:41.360
Very active in everything regarding fab labs as well, the digitization of the hardware world.

28:41.360 --> 28:52.360
I'm more of a free software guide and the open source because I think this question of public European stuff is really about making the citizen more free.

28:52.360 --> 28:55.360
And what I saw in the digital rights stuff is exactly about that.

28:55.360 --> 29:03.360
And so if we talk about open source in the context of political framework, I think it's important to put the freedom as more core to it.

29:03.360 --> 29:09.360
What I made me take is about the data of the project that NGI supported.

29:09.360 --> 29:12.360
You said a lot of them follow European politics.

29:12.360 --> 29:19.360
I'm a bit surprised because for me politics follow the will of the people and so follow actually the community.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.360
And so this should actually, should.

29:22.360 --> 29:34.360
So my question is aren't those policies following the will of the community and therefore shouldn't the funding go towards funding the policies?

29:34.360 --> 29:45.360
Like we are supposed to give to take all free time to pay for people, like to pay and to use all free time to defend our opinions.

29:45.360 --> 29:54.360
Why should we be paid to tell the commission what they have to do since, well, that's what governments are for somehow.

29:54.360 --> 29:58.360
It's like democracy.

29:58.360 --> 30:00.360
European institutions.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.360
Get into it.

30:06.360 --> 30:09.360
So I will start with a question to the audience.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.360
Oh, you know what?

30:10.360 --> 30:12.360
I will ask a question to the audience to start.

30:12.360 --> 30:13.360
Oh, yeah.

30:13.360 --> 30:18.360
So Thomas de Pierre, what I do does not relate to what I do for open source.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.360
My job is not related to that.

30:20.360 --> 30:26.360
You may, some of you may know me because of my blog post a year and a half ago called I am not a supplier.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.360
I have a question for you and for the audience in general.

30:29.360 --> 30:38.360
Can you raise your hand if you get paid for something linked to your presence to this room today?

30:39.360 --> 30:41.360
Right.

30:41.360 --> 30:47.360
So what you are all telling me is that the people that do the work cannot represent it in this room.

30:47.360 --> 30:57.360
And then what I'm saying is that what we saw is that most of the people doing working on open source and we have ample data on that are not paid for it.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.360
They do it on the free time.

30:58.360 --> 31:00.360
That's what we call our best.

31:00.360 --> 31:04.360
The other people that cannot do the work you're asking them to do.

31:04.360 --> 31:16.360
My total time for open source and I maintain multiple packages that are niche but fully in need a lot of context and knowledge is this niche is two hour per month.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.360
Just reading the law is more than that.

31:19.360 --> 31:28.360
I cannot and people that do this cannot participate in the grass with people you're asking to participate in this cannot do that to come here.

31:28.360 --> 31:33.360
This is my free hobby time for the next three months or four months I have to take.

31:33.360 --> 31:41.360
So I understand all the discussions that are happening here around the fact that we need engagement from these people and we need this engagement to happen.

31:41.360 --> 31:45.360
How do you want us to do it?

31:45.360 --> 31:56.360
This is a part we need to decide as a community and this is a real thing we should probably talk about more than things like digital right and so forth which I already have a quite a lot of organization working on this.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.360
Thank you.

31:57.360 --> 32:07.360
Yeah I think that decision makers answer to these policy remarks.

32:07.360 --> 32:22.360
Well I mean the difficulty in Brussels is actually figuring out what's going on because once it's public the bulk of the influence has already been made because once the commission has their proposal out they've already made up their mind on what they want to put in there.

32:22.360 --> 32:31.360
So that's why I'm saying you need to influence the politicians that are trying to get elected before they get into the parliament and you need to get to know their offices.

32:31.360 --> 32:42.360
You need to get to know the policy advisors in the political group delegations and also like the policy advisors in the groups.

32:43.360 --> 32:58.360
And a lot of companies are trying to influence both the commission and the politicians and we are the and they have the time to do that.

32:58.360 --> 33:13.360
Not a lot are thinking about that the source code that is also at the basis of commercial code proprietary code is actually open source and that is maintained by developers doing it in their free time.

33:13.360 --> 33:19.360
And that is actually a message that was really difficult when we were sitting in the negotiation room to get across.

33:20.360 --> 33:26.360
And that's why we had to push really hard to actually get that part into the text.

33:26.360 --> 33:34.360
So being here taking your free time to talk with us and put these things into the room is really important.

33:34.360 --> 33:39.360
I think Edry has been doing a great job on digital rights.

33:39.360 --> 33:48.360
I mean the commission is now talking about digital rights but I don't know if you remember Maritjha Shaka that was in the parliament for about 10 years until the election in 19.

33:48.360 --> 33:57.360
I mean she read out a speech about digital rights and then told the audience afterwards this is actually from the communist party congress.

33:57.360 --> 34:07.360
So you can have a lot of fine words that sound good but it's how you apply them and implement them and put them into legislation that's really important.

34:07.360 --> 34:21.360
And I mean one of the things that we like was putting our head up against in the negotiation was that the commission has this blue book of definitions and stuff like that that nobody amongst the co-legislators actually had heard about.

34:21.360 --> 34:25.360
And we're like come on this is your own internal standards.

34:25.360 --> 34:28.360
This is not supposed to override legislation.

34:28.360 --> 34:33.360
That's supposed to like follow and be adapted according to the legislation that we're putting in.

34:33.360 --> 34:37.360
So I mean it's difficult for all of us and that's why we need to work together on this.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.360
Sorry for being long again.

34:39.360 --> 34:43.360
Could you maybe hand over to Edry as the representative?

34:43.360 --> 34:47.360
Well, no I'm not the Edry representative.

34:47.360 --> 34:52.360
I would say there's no separation between digital rights and open source.

34:52.360 --> 34:56.360
The digital rights movement was started by the open source people.

34:56.360 --> 35:03.360
We have become somewhat more from our roots in that respect but please do re-engage if you feel it's not sufficiently represented.

35:03.360 --> 35:06.360
You're deeply disagreeing with that notion I see from Elaine.

35:06.360 --> 35:11.360
I would also respond to the notion and I'm one of the people that's not being paid for this by the way I should mention.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.360
This is not a matter of being paid for this.

35:13.360 --> 35:21.360
You as a citizen if you want to be represented it's too much work for any citizen to get represented properly.

35:21.360 --> 35:27.360
And there are more channels than just your political party if you're a member and please be a member of any political party.

35:27.360 --> 35:36.360
Well maybe not a Nazi party but there are a democratic society that does not function solely through elections.

35:36.360 --> 35:41.360
There has to be permanent engagement through other channels than just the election.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.360
And that's what civil society is for.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.360
That of course it should be.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.360
And lastly democracy is not about the quality of decision making.

35:48.360 --> 35:53.360
It's about the non-violence of the decision making and the non-violence of the transfer of power.

35:53.360 --> 35:56.360
So do not be overly disappointed when the outcome is poor.

35:56.360 --> 36:00.360
At least we're not shooting each others in the trenches of Verdun again.

36:00.360 --> 36:02.360
And that's a win.

36:05.360 --> 36:13.360
If I may one comment it's on the question of the representation and the fact that we are professional of the profession.

36:13.360 --> 36:17.360
And we are not representing grassroots to some extent.

36:17.360 --> 36:21.360
I think the question you ask is the question of representation of democracy.

36:21.360 --> 36:22.360
It is not.

36:22.360 --> 36:24.360
Okay well I thought it was.

36:24.360 --> 36:27.360
But the question of money you ask.

36:27.360 --> 36:28.360
No no time.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.360
Ah fine okay.

36:29.360 --> 36:30.360
Time.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.360
Time.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.360
Yeah well time is money you know.

36:33.360 --> 36:37.360
People have used to pay the time without money.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.360
This is not about money.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.360
It's about time.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.360
Right.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.360
You need to keep maintaining the stuff you all used to live.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.360
Exactly.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.360
If I take away from that time to explain the things.

36:46.360 --> 36:49.360
I cannot keep the thing that you need to live and to keep alive.

36:49.360 --> 36:50.360
Working.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.360
Exactly.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.360
So well the argument is time is money.

36:53.360 --> 37:01.360
So you need a way to have the right people representing you and that will have the time and will have the money.

37:01.360 --> 37:04.360
Because they will have to be paid for that.

37:04.360 --> 37:11.360
And so they have to represent you and you have to find a way that you find the people that.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.360
So you have a European organization.

37:13.360 --> 37:14.360
You have OFE.

37:14.360 --> 37:17.360
I will not mention all of them because there are a lot of them.

37:17.360 --> 37:18.360
Well they are not representing.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.360
They are coordinating and helping whatever.

37:21.360 --> 37:28.360
But what you describe I think is a democratic representation of the grass root people.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.360
And you have to find solutions.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.360
There are examples.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.360
Look at IETF.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.360
IETF is grass root.

37:34.360 --> 37:38.360
IETF is people contributing with their own time.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.360
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.360
Not really.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.360
They are big tech.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.360
Okay.

37:45.360 --> 37:49.360
But it's one person one vote.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.360
If you like.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.360
It's not one.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.360
You want to talk about maybe ITU?

37:55.360 --> 37:56.360
No.

37:56.360 --> 37:57.360
Okay.

37:57.360 --> 38:03.360
You can think about organization that organized this representation and maybe take example.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.360
Maybe it's the wrong example.

38:05.360 --> 38:10.360
But the argument is you have to find ways to get a representation.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.360
That's it.

38:13.360 --> 38:20.360
It's not just open source that has to make time because the people in open source they

38:20.360 --> 38:25.360
contribute with what they can do best and it's mostly writing code.

38:25.360 --> 38:35.360
And there's a thing that people in policy roles have this attitude towards technology

38:35.360 --> 38:39.360
quite often that they say we don't have to understand it.

38:39.360 --> 38:42.360
And there's an educational gap there.

38:42.360 --> 38:50.360
And it's not that the people who write codes have to make time to explain all that.

38:50.360 --> 38:56.360
The people who make policy have to understand technology because it's at the core of our

38:56.360 --> 38:58.360
democracy.

38:58.360 --> 39:04.360
So there are people willing to explain it but don't take them away from writing the code

39:04.360 --> 39:07.360
because that's really important for society.

39:07.360 --> 39:17.360
So it's also an effort from the people in roles that are important for policy making to

39:17.360 --> 39:22.360
learn about technology and try to understand how important it is.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.360
So there you go.

39:25.360 --> 39:27.360
Thank you.

39:27.360 --> 39:28.360
Thank you.

39:28.360 --> 39:29.360
Good morning everyone.

39:29.360 --> 39:33.360
My name is Monique and I'm involved in the NGI community since a few years.

39:33.360 --> 39:36.360
I think this debate is amazing.

39:36.360 --> 39:42.360
I think we cannot pretend that we all speak and understand the same language because we

39:42.360 --> 39:45.360
have different skills and we do different works.

39:45.360 --> 39:50.360
This is a multi-stakeholder community and we have to respect each other and we have to

39:50.360 --> 39:52.360
learn to work with each other.

39:52.360 --> 39:56.360
I think the work that we have been trying to do in the NGI community has been really to

39:56.360 --> 40:01.360
talk different languages to different people and it's very difficult.

40:01.360 --> 40:07.360
At the end of the day my job is to run the NGI outreach office and I can tell you it has

40:07.360 --> 40:12.360
been very difficult to reach out to some of the open source communities but it has also

40:12.360 --> 40:16.360
been very hard to speak to politicians, policymakers.

40:16.360 --> 40:22.360
So the fact is that we speak different languages and we work according to different rules and

40:22.360 --> 40:26.360
to different, we have a different pace.

40:26.360 --> 40:31.360
But I think also that the progress and I've been here the whole week attending all the

40:31.360 --> 40:37.360
events, workshops at the commission, open source forum today, yesterday, here at FOSTA.

40:37.360 --> 40:39.360
I think it's amazing what's happening.

40:39.360 --> 40:46.360
We have open source, very high up in the discussions that a few years ago we could have dreamed

40:46.360 --> 40:49.360
of being even mentioned.

40:49.360 --> 40:54.360
So I think there is a cultural change and we all have a different role to play.

40:54.360 --> 41:00.360
So let's not, so I think to go back to the guy from Nokia, I think we really have to work on the

41:00.360 --> 41:06.360
processes and on the ways we can work better together.

41:06.360 --> 41:10.360
I think this should be the core topic of this discussion.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.360
Hello, I am Karin.

41:19.360 --> 41:23.360
I am not paid here to be here.

41:23.360 --> 41:28.360
I have my own company in, I have a background in public administration.

41:28.360 --> 41:33.360
I'm a contributor to RiotOS, my microcontroller operating system.

41:33.360 --> 41:37.360
So thanks, happy to help out on this.

41:37.360 --> 41:47.360
What I was wondering, I heard policy makers speak with a lot of people and groups before they make the first draft.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.360
Who are those groups?

41:49.360 --> 41:53.360
Who are those, what kind of institutes are that?

41:53.360 --> 41:57.360
Because that's a procedure that's already there with whom they talk.

41:57.360 --> 42:07.360
And maybe from that side out, can we then look on what as an open source community can we make or go into to speak with them?

42:13.360 --> 42:21.360
Okay, I'm already getting feedback from the repertoire of the session and so who will also have the, the, the, the, the

42:21.360 --> 42:26.360
I'm going to summarize what you are saying in the last minute.

42:26.360 --> 42:30.360
And he told me we have a lot of questions but no answers at the moment.

42:30.360 --> 42:37.360
And maybe we should like focus for the next minutes on this and to kick this off I would first of all, Simon.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.360
Thank you.

42:39.360 --> 42:42.360
So I'm Simon Phipsen just because I'm organizing the room.

42:42.360 --> 42:45.360
It doesn't mean I don't have opinions.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.360
So I work for the open source initiative.

42:47.360 --> 42:52.360
The answer to your question is in the impact assessment of the CRA.

42:52.360 --> 43:01.360
The impact assessment of the CRA explains that the European Commission went out of its way to approach SMEs for input on the CRA,

43:01.360 --> 43:08.360
but did not make any attempt at all to consult with the open source community or anybody who is a genuine community member.

43:08.360 --> 43:15.360
The reason for that is because that their societal model is a societal model that has manufacturers or producers,

43:15.360 --> 43:24.360
it has labor force and it has consumers and it has no recognition that for the last 30 years there has been a,

43:24.360 --> 43:31.360
there has been commons based peer production and it has no recognition of the fact that there are people engaged in that.

43:31.360 --> 43:37.360
And so the number one thing that needs doing is actually a very difficult thing that needs serious political engagement,

43:37.360 --> 43:45.360
which is the Commission as a whole needs to recognize that society is no longer the society of the 1950s and that people,

43:45.360 --> 43:53.360
that the people are connected to one another and that as a result of being connected to one another,

43:53.360 --> 44:01.360
they are actually doing things that are being harmed by their regulation that believes that unions and MEPs represent the people.

44:01.360 --> 44:06.360
Unions and MEPs do not represent, I believe, anybody in this room.

44:06.360 --> 44:10.360
And as a consequence the Commission completely failed.

44:10.360 --> 44:15.360
Maybe there is one Karen, I don't know.

44:15.360 --> 44:23.360
But as a result the Commission has discovered to its surprise that coming to Fozdem,

44:23.360 --> 44:31.360
Benjamin last year was quite surprised to discover he had a thousand new friends who wanted to share their opinions about his legislation in the corridor.

44:31.360 --> 44:37.360
This year he was a lot more positive about it, although he did ask me if he was going to be egged by the audience.

44:38.360 --> 44:43.360
So the most positive thing that I've got to contribute is a very difficult thing,

44:43.360 --> 44:50.360
which is the Commission as a whole has got to recognize that society is no longer the industrial society of the 1950s.

44:50.360 --> 44:55.360
It is now the digital connected society of the 21st century.

44:55.360 --> 45:00.360
There we are. So we are still looking for answers, right?

45:00.360 --> 45:06.360
Well, for the Parliament side I can say that the question was to who did we reach out to for the PLD,

45:06.360 --> 45:13.360
for instance we mostly talk to free software foundation open for Europe and Debian for us, and Marcel Scolias team.

45:13.360 --> 45:19.360
So I would think that in our team, for instance, if you send an email to us,

45:19.360 --> 45:23.360
we are very sensitive in the parts about the open source community, obviously.

45:23.360 --> 45:26.360
So if you send an email to us, obviously we will answer.

45:26.360 --> 45:31.360
But again, that's also the main purpose of the discussion today, you have to be targeted.

45:31.360 --> 45:37.360
If you're not working at all on the topic, we might not answer because it's not our topic, we're not working on the file on this specific file.

45:37.360 --> 45:43.360
So I think that's the main thing. But on our side, definitely we will answer to open source community almost every time.

45:49.360 --> 45:50.360
Thank you very much.

45:50.360 --> 45:59.360
I am Pablo Correa from PostmarketOS, a small but very fast growing community to put real Linux into phones.

45:59.360 --> 46:05.360
And there was one thing that caught my attention from your NGI presentation.

46:05.360 --> 46:15.360
You said that out of the millions and millions of euros you gave out, you managed to get 80 people to organize a community

46:15.360 --> 46:19.360
or a foundation to establish a legal entity.

46:19.360 --> 46:27.360
And that seems like that's a huge success, but that's also way too small for the amount of money.

46:27.360 --> 46:38.360
Or like my feeling, like I am part of this overworked people working their free time trying to grow a community

46:38.360 --> 46:49.360
to create some sort of entities so that we can at some point make this a viable product because we see people, we see consumers wanting this.

46:49.360 --> 46:51.360
We want this, people want this.

46:51.360 --> 47:00.360
And we are lacking the tools to actually grow into something where we can organize ourselves.

47:00.360 --> 47:03.360
We are lacking, we are all developers.

47:03.360 --> 47:06.360
And we are lacking people with the background in business.

47:06.360 --> 47:08.360
We are lacking people with the background in law.

47:08.360 --> 47:12.360
And the funding does not support us on that.

47:12.360 --> 47:16.360
The funding, like we don't get or we just say, like, can you please get involved?

47:16.360 --> 47:21.360
And it's like, well, maybe I can get involved in, like you said, in my 25th hour of the day.

47:21.360 --> 47:27.360
But if we are all working on something else because we can't finance ourselves,

47:27.360 --> 47:38.360
if you can help us like pay advice on free software, there's people from grassroots organizations happy to do that.

47:38.360 --> 47:45.360
We need help and we need funding not only for development, also for development, but we need funding for more things.

47:45.360 --> 47:50.360
And if you can provide that, that might actually help us.

47:50.360 --> 47:52.360
Okay.

47:52.360 --> 47:54.360
A very quick one.

47:54.360 --> 48:00.360
And these are also then the last words for the panel because then we have to transform for technical reasons with the camera.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.360
Okay, no, just very shortly on NGI.

48:02.360 --> 48:05.360
So we have a new project, NGI Commons.

48:05.360 --> 48:11.360
And there is a special effort to precisely provide business support.

48:11.360 --> 48:16.360
So in terms of what business model could be on top of an open source,

48:16.360 --> 48:24.360
you guys, you are developers who you don't necessarily have the right, yes, knowledge in terms of what sort of business models needs to be done.

48:24.360 --> 48:31.360
So this is included in a new project called NGI Commons Fund.

48:31.360 --> 48:35.360
So that's good that we ended the specifics.

48:35.360 --> 48:39.360
Yeah, so with this, I'm going to end the panel and the fishbowl discussion.

48:39.360 --> 48:41.360
Thanks for the insight.

48:41.360 --> 48:46.360
Thanks for all of you taking part in this.

48:46.360 --> 48:51.360
But now the funny part comes and Enzo will sum it up.
