00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Thank you.

00:07.000 --> 00:23.480
So I'm going to talk about georchestral, a special data infrastructure.

00:23.480 --> 00:30.920
So before starting to talk about georchestral, I'm going to present myself.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.360
So I'm Emilia De Vos.

00:33.360 --> 00:41.080
I work as a DevOps engineer in the geospatial department at K2Gamp.

00:41.080 --> 00:45.800
So K2Gamp is located in the Alps of France.

00:45.800 --> 00:55.480
And I also love about open source, I have a GitHub user if you want to check out my project.

00:55.480 --> 01:04.280
So before talking about the actual piece of software, maybe a lot of people do not know

01:04.280 --> 01:07.160
what is geospatial data.

01:07.160 --> 01:16.160
So geospatial data is the science to process and exploit geolocalized data that can be

01:16.160 --> 01:17.840
represented on the map.

01:17.840 --> 01:26.200
So if you ever used OpenStreetMap, you probably already used geospatial data.

01:26.200 --> 01:33.040
Or maybe I should not say Google Maps, so you probably used geospatial data.

01:33.040 --> 01:36.760
So what is spatial data infrastructure?

01:36.760 --> 01:44.120
Spatial data infrastructure is a framework of spatial data, metadata, users and tools

01:44.120 --> 01:52.120
that are interconnected between each other in order to use spatial data in a flexible

01:52.120 --> 01:55.720
and optimized way.

01:55.720 --> 02:02.000
So why is georchestral a complete data infrastructure?

02:02.000 --> 02:12.280
So georchestral is composed of multiple tools that are open source and maintained by volunteers.

02:12.280 --> 02:19.560
So the first tools, the one that everyone knows is PostgreSQL.

02:19.560 --> 02:27.760
We use the post-gis extension to store geospatial data.

02:27.760 --> 02:34.920
And then we have GeoServer because when you store geospatial data, you want to access

02:34.920 --> 02:36.640
it, this data.

02:36.640 --> 02:49.240
So you have APIs to access this geospatial data, like WMS, WMTA and so on.

02:49.240 --> 02:55.880
And then you have GeoNetwork because when you have geospatial data, you want to have

02:55.880 --> 02:58.520
some context, some metadata.

02:58.520 --> 03:04.960
So you want to know the description of this geospatial data, you want to know who created

03:04.960 --> 03:13.760
it, you want to know the date of the creation of the geospatial data and the license and

03:13.760 --> 03:15.880
so on.

03:15.880 --> 03:19.160
So that's where GeoNetwork comes into place.

03:19.160 --> 03:25.840
And then once you have this geospatial data, you want to visualize it on a map like you

03:26.200 --> 03:28.760
will be doing on Google Maps.

03:28.760 --> 03:38.680
So you use map stores to show this geospatial data on the map.

03:38.680 --> 03:45.520
And then once you have your geospatial data, you may want to control this geospatial data

03:45.520 --> 03:52.320
because sometimes you do not want to show this geospatial data to the public.

03:52.320 --> 03:55.080
You want to restrict it to people.

03:55.080 --> 03:57.680
So that's where the console comes into place.

03:57.680 --> 04:05.000
You have users, role, organization and so on.

04:05.000 --> 04:09.760
So you could think of a geochester like a Linux distribution.

04:09.760 --> 04:15.960
There are multiple tools that are interconnected between each other.

04:15.960 --> 04:21.480
And then you have the spatial data infrastructure.

04:21.480 --> 04:29.320
So I want to remind that all the components in geochestors are open source and they are

04:29.320 --> 04:38.720
actually more component in geochestors that I'm not going to talk in this presentation.

04:38.720 --> 04:46.480
So once you know about the insight of a geochestor, why should you use a geochestor?

04:46.480 --> 04:50.600
Why are the use cases?

04:50.600 --> 04:56.680
So the first one is to manage and share relevant information.

04:56.680 --> 05:06.280
So a region of especially in France use geochestors to store their geospatial data and then share

05:06.280 --> 05:11.200
it to the public.

05:11.200 --> 05:18.600
So here are a couple of names that maybe French people know about.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.240
We have a Lille that uses a geochestor.

05:21.240 --> 05:27.640
We have Haute France, Grand Est, Haute Loire, Brittany and outside of France.

05:27.640 --> 05:32.400
We also have countries like Bolivia.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.160
Geochestor is also used in small cities.

05:36.160 --> 05:43.000
When people want to know specific information about the cities, they can know like in this

05:43.000 --> 05:48.320
example information about a park in the cities of Rennes.

05:48.320 --> 05:53.840
So it's very useful to have a discussion on information.

05:53.840 --> 06:02.920
And there is also the digital factories Dutch Telecom uses geochestor to deploy the rollout

06:02.920 --> 06:09.440
of the fiber optic in Germany.

06:09.440 --> 06:14.280
And I want to also talk about the community.

06:14.280 --> 06:24.160
Every year we have a meeting, a meetup in the community where people of the existing

06:24.160 --> 06:32.120
member of the community gather to share their experience to know a bit more about geochestor.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.560
But newcomers are welcome also.

06:35.560 --> 06:41.760
Last year that was in Paris at IGN, a famous organization that created maps.

06:41.760 --> 06:47.960
And this year it will be in Lille.

06:47.960 --> 06:53.600
So you are welcome to join at Le Geocombe.

06:53.600 --> 06:58.680
It's called Le Geocombe.

06:58.680 --> 07:02.120
So thank you for listening to my presentation.

07:02.120 --> 07:09.160
I displayed QR code if you want to see my slides.

07:09.160 --> 07:16.000
And if you want to know more about Le Geocombe, it's a meeting.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.760
You can go to geochestor.org.

07:18.760 --> 07:22.040
There are all these kind of information.

07:22.040 --> 07:27.920
And there is also our GitHub organization.

07:27.920 --> 07:31.560
And you can also talk to us on IFC.

07:32.000 --> 07:38.840
And we have a special docker compose if you want to test geochestor in local.

07:38.840 --> 07:46.160
And there is also a demo link that I'm not linking in this slide, but you can see it

07:46.160 --> 07:48.880
on the official website.

07:48.880 --> 07:51.840
So thank you for listening to me.

07:51.840 --> 07:59.840
And I hope you will discover a bit more about geochestor because that was quite short.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.840
Thank you.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.360
Okay, thank you for your talk.

08:07.360 --> 08:12.640
And you are available outside for questions about your talk.

08:12.640 --> 08:13.640
Thank you very much.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.640
Thank you.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.840
Thank you.

08:30.840 --> 08:31.840
Thank you.

08:31.840 --> 08:32.840
Thank you.

08:32.840 --> 08:33.840
Thank you.

08:33.840 --> 08:34.840
Thank you.

08:34.840 --> 08:35.840
Thank you.

08:35.840 --> 08:36.840
Thank you.

08:36.840 --> 08:37.840
Thank you.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.840
Thank you.

08:38.840 --> 08:39.840
Thank you.

08:39.840 --> 08:40.840
Thank you.

08:40.840 --> 08:41.840
Thank you.

08:41.840 --> 08:42.840
Thank you.

08:42.840 --> 08:43.840
Thank you.

08:43.840 --> 08:44.840
Thank you.

08:44.840 --> 08:45.840
Thank you.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.840
Thank you.

08:46.840 --> 08:47.840
Thank you.

08:47.840 --> 08:48.840
Thank you.

08:48.840 --> 08:49.840
Thank you.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.840
Thank you.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.840
Thank you.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.840
Thank you.

08:52.840 --> 08:53.840
Thank you.

08:53.840 --> 08:54.840
Thank you.

08:54.840 --> 08:55.840
Thank you.

08:55.840 --> 08:56.840
Thank you.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.840
Thank you.

08:57.840 --> 08:58.840
Thank you.
