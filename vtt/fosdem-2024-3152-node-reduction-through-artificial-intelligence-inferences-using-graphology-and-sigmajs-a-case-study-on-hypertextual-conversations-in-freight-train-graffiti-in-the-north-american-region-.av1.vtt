WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:17.880
I had my notes here, so I'm supposed to read them because my English is really not that

00:17.880 --> 00:18.880
well.

00:18.880 --> 00:25.280
So in some parts I'm going to try to just read the slides and in some others I'm going

00:25.280 --> 00:26.480
to try to improve.

00:26.480 --> 00:36.720
So first of all I want to really thank you guys being here, the Graphology and Sigma developers

00:36.720 --> 00:40.840
because thank you, thank you for your work and thank you for being here.

00:40.840 --> 00:43.200
I really appreciate that.

00:43.200 --> 00:46.320
I'm using that library.

00:46.320 --> 00:55.000
I'm also in one moment.

00:55.000 --> 01:01.080
So in one moment I also used Force Atlas II that Matthew Jacome is also here.

01:01.080 --> 01:11.160
So it's kind of really, really amazing for me being in this chance to at least talk to

01:11.160 --> 01:18.400
somebody that has the same interest and that's why in my own country maybe it's difficult

01:18.400 --> 01:24.360
to do this kind of presentation because I have to make a long introduction.

01:24.360 --> 01:30.320
As I'm going to do right now, but about the social phenomena I'm studying, it's freight

01:30.320 --> 01:31.320
graffiti.

01:31.320 --> 01:39.040
So this is one of the visualizations we can achieve and this is, as you can see, it's

01:39.040 --> 01:40.720
a really hot mess happening there.

01:40.720 --> 01:45.240
It's a lot of stuff and we're trying to get this.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.480
It's kind of a synthesis or maybe an abstraction too.

01:49.480 --> 01:57.760
So in this visualization at the end we'll be able to link the users to the symbolic

01:57.760 --> 02:07.560
forms, the symbolic or the meaning they are using to make a community.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.640
So I just invite you to have that in mind.

02:11.640 --> 02:20.400
We're going from this to this, but before we actually have to get all that information,

02:20.400 --> 02:27.880
gather all that information and make it happen in this visualization, in this computational

02:27.880 --> 02:30.080
visualization.

02:30.080 --> 02:34.960
Something is happening in these train yards.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.560
So we have two different stuff.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.280
We have to break that, this really long title.

02:41.280 --> 02:47.040
I know maybe social scientists were always in verbose mode and we were just talking right

02:47.040 --> 02:53.360
and talking right and I see how you guys are really into synthesis and really straightforward.

02:53.360 --> 02:58.800
So what I'm going to do here is talking about two different stuff.

02:58.800 --> 03:04.360
One, a computational process that is a really fancy name, no production through artificial

03:04.360 --> 03:09.720
intelligence, inferences, but it's just a filter.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.120
We're just cleaning all the mess.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.160
And the other one is about a social phenomenon.

03:15.160 --> 03:21.320
This is happening in physical world, real world if you want to say so, but we're trying

03:21.320 --> 03:28.520
to take that data also and make it happen in our own framework.

03:28.520 --> 03:37.600
So these guys tend to write their names on the freight trains and these trains will always

03:37.600 --> 03:46.360
travel from all the North America region and then some other persons will track them, will

03:46.360 --> 03:50.160
take some pictures and will post this on Instagram.

03:50.160 --> 03:53.640
So this has been happening before social media.

03:53.640 --> 03:57.600
So this is a community.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.200
It's a practice community.

03:59.200 --> 04:08.120
If somebody here know Jenkins, maybe you will know what I'm talking about, participatory

04:08.120 --> 04:09.560
culture.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.840
So that's kind of the same.

04:11.840 --> 04:18.800
There's two, two, that's the same phenomenon happening in two different places.

04:18.800 --> 04:26.120
In the physical world, in the digital world, and that's what we called an on-life phenomenon.

04:26.120 --> 04:32.440
So the case of study for this presentation, as I told you, is the graffiti, the freight

04:32.440 --> 04:35.800
train graffiti in the North America region.

04:35.800 --> 04:43.880
So an hypertextual conversations, I don't know if it makes sense for somebody here.

04:43.880 --> 04:54.240
One guy in the morning make a presentation about his presentation was Cosma.

04:54.240 --> 04:59.280
That's the software he was presenting and he talked about that guy that invent this

04:59.280 --> 05:04.120
kind of linking document idea and that's hypertext.

05:04.120 --> 05:05.680
What about hashtags?

05:05.680 --> 05:11.920
Hashtags may be this kind of hypertext too because they will function like a gathering

05:11.920 --> 05:13.280
point.

05:13.280 --> 05:21.400
People will join in those places through their own publishing, their own post after they

05:21.400 --> 05:29.520
tag them with any hashtag.

05:29.520 --> 05:38.200
This network will be talking about users, Instagram users, that post and mark this post

05:38.200 --> 05:40.080
with any hashtag.

05:40.080 --> 05:47.560
So this can make clusters or clicks and that's what we are trying to look.

05:47.560 --> 05:53.880
These small groups that share something in commune, that share meaning, all these posts

05:53.880 --> 05:56.560
are meaningful for themselves.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.120
So that's I think something happening here too.

06:00.120 --> 06:06.320
This is like this big group of persons that gets together and fuzz them and then we have

06:06.320 --> 06:13.480
these little clicks happening in each room and then anybody will move from place to place

06:13.480 --> 06:19.640
and make these kind of networks if we try to see it that way.

06:19.640 --> 06:25.720
So the other part I would like to talk to you is about this filter.

06:25.720 --> 06:29.560
This filter happens in two different levels.

06:29.560 --> 06:36.720
One with a Python using some other libraries too and the second one through Graphology and

06:36.720 --> 06:42.600
Sigma, I think misspelled, using JavaScript.

06:43.600 --> 06:49.080
So this was introduction guys.

06:49.080 --> 06:57.720
The point here is I'm going to share to you how each step uses different open source libraries

06:57.720 --> 07:04.000
or software and that's one way to acknowledge to all the developers here that all that effort

07:04.000 --> 07:12.560
you are doing is making people like me that is not really a developer.

07:12.560 --> 07:23.200
Trying to make a dialogue, talk between social science, computational science with the tools

07:23.200 --> 07:27.800
that I can try to use.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.760
So there's a word there that is really important.

07:31.760 --> 07:38.640
It will go all the way from the whole slide show, it's data.

07:38.720 --> 07:49.000
We have been listening to that concept a lot and I really feel kind of sad because the

07:49.000 --> 08:05.000
effort that I can see in those talks before was about standard data.

08:05.000 --> 08:13.240
Big platforms make tools to make standard data and this example is the whole other thing.

08:13.240 --> 08:18.680
It's really different because it's a really custom data set.

08:18.680 --> 08:26.440
It's a really custom, it's a really niche social phenomena so there's no tools to study

08:26.440 --> 08:31.720
this study object.

08:31.720 --> 08:36.920
So we have to make them with anything we can.

08:36.920 --> 08:45.360
So data is the key and it's the link between execution devices, between disciplines, between

08:45.360 --> 08:55.480
programming languages, theoretical frameworks, development libraries and social phenomena.

08:55.480 --> 09:03.000
That will help us to make interoperability between all of these different dimensions.

09:03.000 --> 09:10.080
And I think, and I hope you do too, this will be only possible through open source and data.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.960
Data is the key here.

09:12.960 --> 09:16.200
So the journey starts.

09:16.200 --> 09:23.280
I'm going to try to be really fast so I can have some of your comments.

09:23.280 --> 09:29.600
I will tell you this is a master's degree thesis so each step it was way long.

09:29.600 --> 09:35.400
If you think this is verbose, that's some other stuff.

09:35.400 --> 09:45.800
So I'm using the first link between, I want to show you is between conceptual frameworks,

09:45.800 --> 09:47.000
theories.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.560
So we have Thompson, a guy from England that is trying to find these kind of categories

09:54.560 --> 10:01.280
to detect meaning, to detect symbolic stuff.

10:01.280 --> 10:08.800
And we also have the graffiti de firma from Figueroa, that's a Spaniard, another Spaniard

10:08.800 --> 10:15.880
guy that retomb these I exist, I am the SCART, I don't know in French maybe, the SCART, I

10:15.880 --> 10:25.080
don't know the right pronunciation, the SCART, the SCART is to the cart.

10:25.080 --> 10:33.000
To see how graffiti writers broadcast themselves to the world.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.400
So we're making this link, right?

10:35.400 --> 10:39.920
Because data will be the key here.

10:40.480 --> 10:48.920
To make this link between some theoretical point view perspective, to a way we can manage

10:48.920 --> 10:57.160
to just back up at least, we need to make this, look for these terms, look for these

10:57.160 --> 11:06.440
stuff and make it some sort of way to, well to data.

11:06.480 --> 11:14.880
So we at least have these three categories, those things we are looking for.

11:14.880 --> 11:21.480
We are looking for geographies, so we are looking for cities, so we are making a dictionary,

11:21.480 --> 11:22.600
a city dictionary.

11:22.600 --> 11:33.760
We are looking for communities, that's symbolic, shared terms, so this dictionary is about

11:33.760 --> 11:42.560
the words that graffiti writers use to tag their own posts and the freight workers use

11:42.560 --> 11:50.240
too, so we can mix them, merge them and make this freight train dictionary.

11:50.240 --> 12:01.040
And last but not least, we have entities, so we are looking for graffiti writers names.

12:01.040 --> 12:11.320
We are going to scrap, we're going to mine these hashtags, these hashtags, conversations,

12:11.320 --> 12:18.560
these hypertextual conversations and the network, we have that simple structure.

12:18.560 --> 12:26.200
Users post some publication and add some tags.

12:26.200 --> 12:32.160
But we are not only using one user's post, we are using a lot of them.

12:32.160 --> 12:39.320
So we have this seed node, the seed node is the first hashtag scrapped and this Instagram

12:39.320 --> 12:49.600
data mining boat, really original name, will download an infinite number of posts and then

12:49.600 --> 12:55.600
add new hashtags that are found on these publications.

12:55.600 --> 13:04.520
That will give us this primitive kind of network, this is a small one, the seed node was graffiti

13:04.520 --> 13:13.440
bombing, we used a mining depth of only zero, so it will only mine that in this case 30

13:13.440 --> 13:24.720
posts that are using this specific hashtag, but as you will see, graffiti bombing has

13:24.720 --> 13:33.440
30 posts, but this other post is also using different hashtags.

13:33.440 --> 13:40.920
So that is how this network is built.

13:40.920 --> 13:51.880
For making this mining, I'm using Instagram app, it's an unofficial Instagram app for

13:51.880 --> 13:52.960
Python.

13:53.400 --> 14:02.360
I don't know if it's a privacy stuff and I know it's tricky, so I won't talk about it.

14:02.360 --> 14:13.080
But I use Docker, so I can make a Raspberry, we try to mimic human behaviors, so this mining

14:13.080 --> 14:20.000
will last for maybe one week for each conversation and if these conversations are really large,

14:20.000 --> 14:21.800
it will last longer.

14:21.800 --> 14:31.440
So that's why we are using this low consumption computer and then after we scrap this, we

14:31.440 --> 14:35.240
will put it on the SQL database.

14:35.240 --> 14:39.960
So we are going from the publications to the SQL database.

14:39.960 --> 14:44.800
So this will be a really fast way to put it.

14:44.800 --> 14:53.760
We came from reality to Instagram and from Instagram to our own dataset.

14:53.760 --> 15:00.520
But we are now looking for these terms on the dictionary we already made before.

15:00.520 --> 15:10.160
So in this case, this is a writer from my city, Afex, he wrote that train in Mexico and

15:10.160 --> 15:14.400
now somebody else sent him the photo in Utah.

15:14.400 --> 15:22.880
So he will put his name, the place it was found, some other stuff and some slang for

15:22.880 --> 15:29.920
the same community and also his crew, his group.

15:33.440 --> 15:41.720
So if we try to put this text in spicy, we'll give us only one token and that won't help.

15:41.760 --> 15:45.480
So we have to split the hashtag in small words.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.840
So the answer was really cool.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.520
It was already on Stack Overflow.

15:51.520 --> 15:56.120
So thank you to that guy.

15:56.120 --> 15:59.160
I put it in the paperwork.

15:59.160 --> 16:03.400
It's there because we have to acknowledge some others work.

16:03.400 --> 16:13.040
So I have to build this really big dictionary of all the words we know in Spanish and English

16:13.040 --> 16:15.720
to split the hashtag.

16:15.720 --> 16:19.520
And after that, we'll look in these dictionaries.

16:19.520 --> 16:24.600
If some word is inside any dictionary, it will be marked as.

16:24.720 --> 16:34.720
If it's not, we will think about it as a writer name or as a crew name too.

16:34.720 --> 16:43.960
But we're making sure this is real and we will look for graffiti in any part of the

16:43.960 --> 16:53.880
caption to make us sure that that strange string is actually a graffiti writer's name.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.480
So this is simple, but it works.

16:56.480 --> 17:06.000
We have those words, how those hashtags were marked by this software.

17:06.000 --> 17:10.480
So we have throw up calls, bubble style.

17:10.480 --> 17:15.560
And this is interesting, but it will be more interesting when we try to put everything

17:15.560 --> 17:18.560
together.

17:18.560 --> 17:22.800
We do it with a spicy docker on Sorrasberry.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.040
I'm going to be really fast now.

17:25.040 --> 17:33.120
These are two image detection models, ones for Google, ones for IMAID.

17:33.120 --> 17:40.720
And that's cool because this is the same technical process, the same image, but it's seeing two

17:40.720 --> 17:43.720
different stuff, right?

17:43.720 --> 17:49.320
Because the models will see what we want them to see in the training.

17:49.360 --> 17:56.400
So that's really straightforward, but it's really important because the Google model,

17:56.400 --> 18:01.280
it won't be useful for me at all.

18:01.280 --> 18:08.200
So this is the result of using this model.

18:08.200 --> 18:14.320
Also it will be interesting when we put everything together.

18:14.320 --> 18:20.800
We are using Jupyter with Google collab because it's free, so we can make an SQL query and

18:20.800 --> 18:26.080
then it will download the images and apply the model.

18:26.080 --> 18:35.560
So the beauty of relational databases is you can access to these different content from

18:35.560 --> 18:37.320
different sizes.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.640
You already know this.

18:39.640 --> 18:49.560
But the point here, we are going from the database to JSON network and we will get something

18:49.560 --> 18:51.520
like this, right?

18:51.520 --> 19:00.600
We have in the middle, in yellow, the inference notes and purple, the images were detected.

19:00.600 --> 19:06.840
And the point here is to see how users gather using the same symbolic stuff.

19:06.920 --> 19:13.440
That can be the same symbolic stuff, some kind of graffiti, some specific slang word,

19:13.440 --> 19:15.440
some kind of city.

19:15.440 --> 19:23.600
We can see in this point how somebody in Tijuana maybe will use the same...

19:23.600 --> 19:28.200
Some group in Tijuana will use maybe the same style.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.960
I think that's important.

19:29.960 --> 19:34.720
But this is a hot mess again.

19:34.720 --> 19:41.680
It's thousands of notes of different types, so we have to clean this.

19:41.680 --> 19:50.840
Looking for significance, or meaning or symbolic forms.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.920
We know a man is an animal suspend in webs of significance.

19:54.920 --> 19:59.040
He himself has fun, but we can clean that.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.640
We're trying to clean that.

20:02.640 --> 20:07.520
So the note reduction will be the shortest path to the meaning.

20:07.520 --> 20:13.720
We're going from that to the really clean network.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.680
At least I think so.

20:15.680 --> 20:23.600
So the algorithm, the thing that's happening here is that for each user node, we're making

20:23.600 --> 20:24.920
an array.

20:24.920 --> 20:29.040
Then I have another array of the whole network.

20:29.040 --> 20:36.840
And if they have a shortest path that is like an algorithm using graphology, and another

20:36.840 --> 20:42.360
place is two, that if this match some...

20:42.360 --> 20:49.400
If it match three steps, it means that the user has some symbolic node detected and then

20:49.400 --> 20:50.840
it will link them.

20:50.840 --> 20:55.680
If it's not like that, it will delay the node.

20:55.680 --> 20:59.560
So it will change the network structure to this now.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.560
It will be...

21:00.560 --> 21:05.360
It's really different from that one from before.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.760
So I think...

21:06.760 --> 21:10.080
I don't know if we have some time.

21:10.080 --> 21:17.160
If you want to see how this works, and if you have also some comments too, because I

21:17.160 --> 21:24.560
would really love to see if you guys have anything that I can change, I can add.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.360
I think it's really...

21:27.360 --> 21:30.560
I don't feel like there's some questions you can do.

21:30.560 --> 21:36.080
I think it would be better if you just told me what to think about it.

21:36.080 --> 21:52.480
So in this case, the network starts with 4,000, almost 5,000 nodes.

21:52.480 --> 21:58.400
And at the end, it's really small.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.400
Let's see.

21:59.400 --> 22:05.920
I don't even remember which one is the biggest.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.200
Sorry.

22:09.200 --> 22:14.440
We went from 5,000 to only 500.

22:14.440 --> 22:26.400
So I put this example because...

22:26.400 --> 22:35.040
There's a principle phenomenon called divergence that when we mine the whole hypertextual conversation,

22:36.040 --> 22:40.760
it will go for a lot of places that we are not interested.

22:40.760 --> 22:47.320
Like if somebody used red as a hashtag, if somebody used love, if somebody else used

22:47.320 --> 22:55.160
no, it will just move the conversation that we are trying to mine to different places

22:55.160 --> 22:56.640
that we are not interested.

22:56.640 --> 23:05.520
So in this case, macro, it's a really known writer.

23:05.520 --> 23:08.320
Let's see if we can find it.

23:08.320 --> 23:17.400
Well, this one is also a really known writer.

23:17.400 --> 23:31.880
So in this specific example, we can see how the object detection model tagged this photo

23:31.880 --> 23:43.240
as a wild style, as a throw up, and the Google model will tag them like a wheel and a train.

23:43.240 --> 23:50.680
But also, we can see how this hashtag was tagged as a graffiti writer.

23:50.680 --> 23:54.080
So that gives us an idea that...

23:54.080 --> 24:00.480
Well, not an idea, an evidence that this guy is a graffiti writer name and we can see

24:00.480 --> 24:03.640
his intervention.

24:03.640 --> 24:08.400
We can see who is the user that makes this post.

24:09.360 --> 24:20.000
When we can access to the user, the user neighbor network, we can also be sure that

24:20.000 --> 24:26.520
he's using these specific graffiti styles.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.720
Okay.

24:27.720 --> 24:32.000
So I'm going to finish with this.

24:32.000 --> 24:40.880
In this case, when we apply this filter, it's way better, it's way cleaner, and we can start

24:40.880 --> 24:45.120
to see...

24:45.120 --> 24:47.440
I think I'm just talking nonsense now.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.440
Do you want to add something?

24:49.440 --> 24:51.440
That's my answer question.

24:51.440 --> 24:53.440
Thank you.

24:53.440 --> 25:05.440
How did you get inspired to run this as a master piece and continue doing research?

25:05.440 --> 25:09.440
I mean, checking the throw ups and the graffiti on trains.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.440
What was the practical aspect that motivated you to be fine?

25:13.440 --> 25:14.440
Okay.

25:14.440 --> 25:19.440
So the question was, what was the practical aspect of attracting the graffiti and what

25:19.440 --> 25:21.840
motivates you personally to do it?

25:21.840 --> 25:39.840
I had a pre-grad also graffiti as a central topic and I thought it would be easier to do

25:39.840 --> 25:49.840
something that will continue this personal initiative.

25:49.840 --> 25:54.840
But at last, I've been late for two years now.

25:54.840 --> 25:59.840
I shouldn't deliver this last year because...

25:59.840 --> 26:06.840
But it was really interesting to how learn this new stuff and put it together to make

26:06.840 --> 26:08.840
some scholar work.

26:08.840 --> 26:10.840
What made the difference?

26:10.840 --> 26:12.840
What do you see?

26:12.840 --> 26:14.840
Right train, for instance.

26:14.840 --> 26:21.840
How do you know that right train is the background and not the name of the artist?

26:21.840 --> 26:22.840
Okay.

26:22.840 --> 26:23.840
That's a really...

26:23.840 --> 26:24.840
That's a good question.

26:24.840 --> 26:25.840
I...

26:25.840 --> 26:27.840
You can repeat the question.

26:27.840 --> 26:28.840
Okay.

26:28.840 --> 26:33.840
How we managed to difference the freight as a graffiti...

26:33.840 --> 26:36.840
Is not a graffiti writer's name.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.840
So there's a big dictionary.

26:39.840 --> 26:46.840
It's built with all the known words.

26:46.840 --> 27:00.840
So it will distinguish between known words and words that are out of that vocabulary.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.840
Yes, Alison?

27:02.840 --> 27:05.840
I have one question then if no one else has one.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.840
How do you...

27:07.840 --> 27:11.840
Have you had any insights in your graph that really excited you?

27:11.840 --> 27:12.840
Yes.

27:12.840 --> 27:20.840
So the question is if the insight of the network really excited me.

27:20.840 --> 27:27.840
Yeah, I think it does because it was like a kind of a serendipity, you know?

27:27.840 --> 27:42.840
When I start to see like this small notes linked together from the terms, it will pop like how some terms are linked for some graffiti styles too.

27:42.840 --> 27:51.840
So everything's connected and I think the way to get to this is tailoring data to our own needs.

27:51.840 --> 27:52.840
Right.

27:52.840 --> 27:53.840
Yeah.

27:53.840 --> 27:54.840
Okay, folks.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.840
Can we have a big round of applause?

27:56.840 --> 27:57.840
Thank you.

27:57.840 --> 27:58.840
Thank you.

27:58.840 --> 27:59.840
Thank you.

27:59.840 --> 28:00.840
Thank you.
