WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.880
Yes, let's start. Thank you for being here late. It's difficult to go after my colleague

00:15.880 --> 00:23.520
because my subject is more lighter than his. Nevertheless, we'll try to answer to the question

00:23.520 --> 00:31.200
why OSRD, the French infrastructure manager, has started an open source project.

00:31.200 --> 00:37.840
So first of all, this is the S&CF Resort. This is a railway infrastructure manager in France.

00:37.840 --> 00:44.560
That means that this company is responsible for the operation and maintenance of 36,000

00:45.440 --> 00:53.120
kilometers of tracks on which 15 trains are running per day. That means 2 billion passengers a year,

00:53.120 --> 01:02.240
almost 100 million tons of freight per year. This company has to face several challenges.

01:02.960 --> 01:13.120
First of course, we want to be on time for the decarbonization of transport.

01:14.720 --> 01:22.720
We want to increase the traffic and as we are a public company, we want to optimize our infrastructure

01:22.720 --> 01:28.080
investment because we use public money. And I think that's why we are in this room today.

01:28.480 --> 01:37.440
And of course, we want to be competitive to plane and road at European scale. For example,

01:39.200 --> 01:48.640
in May I made a trip from Paris to Berlin. It spent nine hours by train. It's not possible now

01:49.680 --> 01:56.560
that only for a thousand kilometers in Europe, you spend nine hours in a train. We do the same

01:56.560 --> 02:02.080
in France and it's spent only three hours. So we have to do something and to show that at the

02:02.080 --> 02:09.440
European scale that trains and railway can be competitive compared to plane and road, of course.

02:12.800 --> 02:26.000
Or not. Sorry. So we need tools to show this problem and to solve our issues. But S&CF Resort

02:26.000 --> 02:37.040
is not software vendors. And in the meantime, we can't find any software in the market that can

02:37.040 --> 02:42.560
answer to our needs and to provide a solution to this specific challenge.

02:46.080 --> 02:54.640
My team knows well this figure. What S&CF Resort here? We start with mobility needs. We design

02:54.640 --> 03:00.480
the timetable and we sell space time. This is a slot where the train can run. And we produce in

03:00.480 --> 03:07.280
real time by opening the tracks and switch the red light to green and the train can run. This is

03:07.280 --> 03:15.520
what we are selling here. We earn money. And in the bottom here, there is a network where the train

03:15.520 --> 03:23.040
can run. Then we have to build the network and we have to design this network. And it's because we

03:23.040 --> 03:32.320
need capacity to make space time. So it's quite easy to understand. I think this representation of

03:32.320 --> 03:43.360
our activity and where we need some help with the software is on the long-term planning by designing

03:43.360 --> 03:50.320
the timetable here and manage several infrastructures, several models of infrastructure. And on the

03:50.320 --> 03:57.600
real time or quite real time, we need to add some more trains. Even if we have planned all the trains

03:57.600 --> 04:06.560
in the years ago, because here it started 10 years ago, even if we have planned some trains,

04:06.560 --> 04:12.960
we want to be able to add more trains in the D-Day, for example, to be competitive to road,

04:12.960 --> 04:21.520
especially for freight trains. Because when a company wants to send goods to a customer,

04:22.400 --> 04:29.760
it has a choice of a truck on the road and a train. And if we say to the company, you have to ask a

04:29.760 --> 04:36.320
train 10 years before you want to sell the goods, it won't work a lot. So we have to be able to answer

04:36.320 --> 04:46.480
to this need in a very short time. So we developed our software, this is the topic of the talk,

04:46.480 --> 04:52.400
and how it looks. So it looks like we have several infrastructures. This is the French

04:52.400 --> 04:58.320
infrastructure here. It's coming from internal data. And we have a lot of data putting on the map.

04:58.320 --> 05:05.600
And we have all the tracks and all the platform. And we are able to choose a starting point in Paris,

05:06.240 --> 05:12.720
the station. And we want to go to Berlin, which is another infrastructure, but we don't have

05:12.720 --> 05:20.240
access to this data. So we took the open street map data. There is a lot of data in Germany on

05:20.240 --> 05:25.920
open street map. And with our tool, which is called OSRD, we are able to find a path in the

05:25.920 --> 05:32.640
infrastructure and calculate the running time here. And with this calculation, we show at the

05:32.640 --> 05:39.200
European scale that a train is able to take only four hours to go from Paris to Berlin.

05:41.280 --> 05:46.480
This kind of tool doesn't exist yet, except in open source now.

05:49.680 --> 06:00.080
The worst slide I ever made, it seems like a postcard from the 80s, but I just wanted to show

06:00.800 --> 06:14.000
the issue with an example. And can you find the difference between the upper part of the slide

06:14.000 --> 06:19.360
and the lower part of the slide? What is the difference? Not the obvious difference. It's

06:19.360 --> 06:29.440
orange, it's white, okay. I know that. But what? No, no, not quite the same speed.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.120
Yes, you're right, but it's not, it's obvious, too obvious, sorry.

06:41.360 --> 06:41.840
Another one?

06:42.720 --> 06:44.240
I have more trains power.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.000
The power, no.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.880
I have throughput. I have throughput. It's more trains power.

06:51.520 --> 06:58.320
No, there is the difference here from here to here. It's 800 millions euro.

07:01.360 --> 07:05.680
You can't find it in the picture, but if you want to transform your

07:05.680 --> 07:13.360
high speed line from Paris to Lyon with 13 trains per direction to the same track,

07:14.880 --> 07:20.160
or yes, of course, with a new rolling stock, but with 16 trains per direction,

07:20.800 --> 07:26.400
it will cost 800 million euros. I have to think because it's a huge figure.

07:28.160 --> 07:34.080
So, and for doing that, we need public money because we don't have money at the Sensei FrÃ©zot.

07:34.080 --> 07:44.080
So, we need public money. And we, in the business plan, the three trains are part of the cost of the,

07:45.280 --> 07:53.200
can find the cost of the 800 million euros. So, if we missed our studies, and if we, at the end,

07:53.200 --> 08:03.040
there is only 15 trains or 14 trains, we put 800 million euros on the trash. So, we have to be

08:03.040 --> 08:11.360
careful by doing that. We have to be careful with our studies and we have to be sure of what kind of

08:11.360 --> 08:23.680
tool we use and we want to master it. So, as I said just before, we add software from vendors.

08:23.680 --> 08:32.480
They are acting like back box. And we, to explain to the state that will give you, give us hundreds of

08:32.480 --> 08:39.920
million euros, we have to be transparent and say that if we need money, it's for that. And it will cost

08:39.920 --> 08:46.960
money because of that. So, we need to be transparent to explain everything. So, we have to, for now,

08:46.960 --> 08:53.360
we share only maybe data, but now we need to share algorithm because the running time calculation between

08:54.000 --> 09:00.720
for a train, which help us to know how long does it spend to go from Paris to Lyon.

09:03.600 --> 09:09.200
You have several algorithms. Each software has an algorithm. You put the same data. You don't have,

09:09.920 --> 09:18.880
never, you never have the same result at the end. And can you cut the mic? We have 14 running time

09:18.880 --> 09:26.720
calculation algorithm at the S&C Friseaux. So, it's a big mess already internally. So, we have to

09:26.720 --> 09:34.560
explain and to share the algorithm and to be able to explain what happens when you put data in and

09:34.560 --> 09:45.360
what happened at the end. Of course, by the past, we make some worst study and we spend money

09:45.680 --> 09:54.880
to, and we expect result and we never had this result, but we spend money. So, it's not a good

09:54.880 --> 10:02.240
thing for you. So, we need to restore confidence. Reliability as a software, we need to be,

10:03.440 --> 10:10.960
to track all the bugs. And if we share the code to the community, everybody is able to see the bug.

10:10.960 --> 10:20.160
And I hope, correct the bug. And of course, we prevent security flows by opening the code.

10:24.080 --> 10:32.000
By using, by opening the code, we expect that the IT integration will be more easy. And

10:32.960 --> 10:38.480
because every companies, every railway companies, every country that want to

10:40.000 --> 10:47.040
integrate the tool, OSRD, they can, they will be able to do it because the code is open,

10:47.040 --> 10:52.880
the internal data model is open and you can, you take the tool and you connect with your own

10:52.880 --> 10:59.280
database and it's quite easy to do. And of course, this is internally in each company and between

10:59.360 --> 11:06.960
company, as the code is open, the data models are open, we want to facilitate interoperability

11:06.960 --> 11:11.680
between the railway company in Europe and then we'll be able to do a train from Paris to Berlin.

11:12.400 --> 11:18.320
I don't want to insist about that, but nine hours is too much. And of course, if we do

11:20.240 --> 11:26.880
open source and the railway company invest, I don't want to people working for free, of course,

11:26.880 --> 11:32.800
but if you are in another railway company, we can share the cost of the maintenance and

11:32.800 --> 11:45.280
developing new features. And at the end, this saving will benefit to all the rest of the community

11:45.280 --> 11:55.520
and of course, for the railway. And of course, if it's open, it allows and it

11:57.680 --> 12:04.240
makes possible collaboration between companies, between a large community of developers

12:04.800 --> 12:14.880
and we expect that some feature will come without any plan because people will see something and

12:15.360 --> 12:23.040
they give ideas to developers and our companies and then there is an issue which is open and maybe

12:24.960 --> 12:35.600
a proposal to develop a new feature and something unexpected can happen here and always to the

12:35.600 --> 12:44.720
benefit of the railway system. And by opening again the code, we expect and we already working

12:45.440 --> 12:52.560
with a community of possible contributors, other infrastructure managers in Europe.

12:53.360 --> 13:00.640
We are starting a common project with the Swiss company. They have a long-term time

13:00.720 --> 13:12.320
table tool. We try to plug these two tools and to have the possibility to make the timetable for the

13:12.320 --> 13:23.120
train from 10 days before operation until the D-day. And we expect also contribution for

13:23.120 --> 13:28.800
researchers. Researchers have a lot of ideas but they are working on their side. They don't have

13:28.800 --> 13:37.360
access to data, they don't have access to algorithm but they develop very, very good algorithm,

13:37.360 --> 13:46.720
optimization algorithm that could benefit to the railway system to reduce the impact of the railway

13:47.680 --> 14:04.480
on the energy consumption, for example, or to reduce the cost of the operation of the railway, etc.

14:04.960 --> 14:09.120
There is a lot of possibility to optimize the railway system.

14:12.240 --> 14:21.840
So it seems to be nice but we have opportunities and threats. So again opportunity,

14:22.080 --> 14:38.960
OSRD is very innovative in the railway sector and I think with the possibility to be shared by

14:38.960 --> 14:50.080
two other railway companies, it will give some opportunities and we choose to create an open

14:50.080 --> 14:58.160
source foundation around the railway software and it's called Open Rail, sorry, and it starts

14:59.200 --> 15:06.240
last Monday, the operation of Open Rail Association, it's the name, starts last Monday and we hope that

15:06.240 --> 15:15.440
it will benefit to the railway sector by giving a neutral area and give the confidence to other

15:16.400 --> 15:26.320
railway companies to develop together. And of course as we said, it will help to the European

15:26.320 --> 15:35.920
integration by offering European railway infrastructure and to show that the railway

15:35.920 --> 15:43.600
could be competitive compared to plain and we have talked about standardization and

15:45.440 --> 15:55.680
the main goal is to be competitive to other transport means. But we have a lot of threats

15:55.680 --> 16:02.880
or a lot of reservation because people internally think that the running time calculation is an

16:02.880 --> 16:12.240
industrial secret and running time calculation is Newton's second law and numerical integration.

16:12.240 --> 16:18.880
So it's secret since 300 years, it's not secret since 300 years so I think we can share it.

16:21.680 --> 16:32.480
But people still believe that it's secret. Sorry, we have to face a question about the market rules

16:32.480 --> 16:39.680
which is very tough in the railway industry because we are not integrated in France, we have the

16:39.680 --> 16:46.480
rail, the infrastructure manager and we have several railway companies, railway undertakers that operate

16:46.480 --> 16:58.080
the train on the network and there is an issue if a railway company win tender, I didn't remember

16:58.080 --> 17:06.640
the name, win a tender by the use of open source software, what is it possible or not, it's a

17:07.600 --> 17:15.840
legal consideration that I don't manage of course. And there was a question about sovereignty but as

17:15.840 --> 17:24.480
you see I made a line on it and it's over now because OSRD is the first project hosted by the

17:24.480 --> 17:34.800
OpenRaid Foundation since yesterday. So it's good news for you, for us and for you also because it's

17:34.800 --> 17:45.920
not an SNCF project now, it's a neutral project, it's open to the community and yeah you can work

17:46.000 --> 17:53.680
on it, you can use it, you can contribute and we are waiting for you. Thank you, that's it for me.

17:59.040 --> 18:04.160
And I think I have time for questions. We have about 10 minutes before they

18:04.480 --> 18:06.880
start off the video so there's plenty of time for questions.

18:15.840 --> 18:22.480
What kind of technology we are using? The older stack, the two guys that are,

18:24.480 --> 18:31.440
the back end is in Java and Kotlin and Rust, I put Rust in the middle where but

18:32.400 --> 18:40.000
Rust in the back middle and the front end is React and we use also some

18:42.560 --> 18:54.800
map lib for the map and what else? What did I forget? Something? Oh yes, some Python also,

18:55.440 --> 19:02.720
it's all technology yes and I didn't say it but it's a web app so we put that in a browser.

19:07.760 --> 19:18.320
The license of OSRD is LGPLv3 which allows us to open the code of course and allows us also to keep

19:18.880 --> 19:28.160
part of some modules, keep it closed and private if we want to keep it and it allows to the vendors

19:28.160 --> 19:35.520
because we don't want to kill the vendors, it allows the vendors to keep, to take the core of the

19:36.160 --> 19:46.560
OSRD and make business with their own module. That was our choice, yes.

19:49.040 --> 19:49.520
Sorry.

19:56.560 --> 20:03.360
When was the project created? It's very difficult to talk. This version of the project was created

20:03.360 --> 20:13.840
three years ago. We were five, some more five and we are 50 now. We are founded by

20:15.120 --> 20:22.320
European Union and French state and also SNCF Rezo. So that's why we can't be so,

20:24.400 --> 20:33.040
such a big team, yes, we are 50 and we are in a beta test currently and we hope that we had

20:34.160 --> 20:36.720
a V1 at the end of 2024.

20:41.520 --> 20:50.320
Why is it hosted? It's hosted on GitHub and for now it's an OSRD project but maybe next week it

20:50.320 --> 21:00.880
will be on Open Rail Association OSRD. We just have to make the move but it's official. We can

21:00.880 --> 21:04.720
say we are an Open Rail Association project.

21:06.720 --> 21:14.400
So if you use the software to kind of double check or maybe even challenge the calculations of other

21:14.400 --> 21:20.960
competitors? Yes, the question is did we change, did we check or challenge the running time

21:20.960 --> 21:30.000
calculation for example? Yes, we check with at least two big software when it's German,

21:30.000 --> 21:36.080
the other one is Japanese and the difference between the running time calculation was very low,

21:37.360 --> 21:42.240
0.4%, 0.4%, something like that.

21:43.040 --> 21:51.200
And does the data usually, I mean, does the data of the infrastructure actually allow modeling

21:52.000 --> 21:53.200
the real world that well?

21:53.200 --> 22:06.640
So the question about the data, the data that are expected can model yes, the physics of the

22:06.640 --> 22:14.960
train and make the calculation possible. Actually the quality of the data is not so good so we have to

22:15.680 --> 22:28.400
make magic about it or be resilient about the quality of data but yes, almost all the data are

22:28.400 --> 22:36.080
available. It's not very difficult to, there is 13 parameters for the running time calculation which

22:36.160 --> 22:38.960
are very easy to find.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.480
Yeah, I don't know.

22:44.720 --> 23:13.680
What is my activity between Open Rail Association and SNSF Result? That was the question. I'm fully

23:13.760 --> 23:21.920
employed by SNSF Result and I work at 100% for SNSF Result and the rest is for Open Rail Foundation.

23:30.160 --> 23:40.000
Yes, I think now they're supported yes because we have this on Monday we have the first board

23:40.000 --> 23:48.080
of directors and they are high level people they are making nice meetings so it's okay.

23:48.320 --> 23:50.160
Now it's okay.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.160
I don't know.

24:02.720 --> 24:12.800
The reaction of software company, we have no reaction for now. I know that some are interested

24:12.800 --> 24:22.240
to use the core and to make collaboration but that's it for now. I have no direct

24:23.360 --> 24:25.280
interaction with the software company.

24:25.760 --> 24:31.040
The previous algorithm you were using were provided by proprietary software from external

24:31.040 --> 24:42.720
companies or were they already developed internally? The previous algorithm in SNSF Result was a homemade

24:43.680 --> 24:54.240
in the 80s and it died three or four years ago and it has been replaced by a vendor software

24:55.120 --> 25:06.720
and they try to respect the homemade algorithm and we now compare to these two algorithms and

25:07.120 --> 25:12.560
yes and now it's a black box we don't know what happened.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.960
Okay thank you very much for being late.
