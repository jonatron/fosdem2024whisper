WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
All right, so the last tag of the deaf room is about another

00:09.000 --> 00:16.000
PIN 6040 device. We heard a lot about them today, but not much on the PIN time yet. So give a round of applause to Joseph.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
Thank you, wow, so many people here. So I'm Joseph and you probably ask why you should listen to me.

00:31.000 --> 00:38.000
I'm from Bernou. I'm C-Developer. I code in Bash.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.000
Yeah, Bernou is a nice city by the way. We have like those big statues and so on.

00:46.000 --> 00:51.000
In Bernou we have that conf, which is great open source conference. I would like to invite you there.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
Code for papers is still open.

01:01.000 --> 01:08.000
I'm organizing open-out conference in Czech Republic, which is in Czech, so not very interesting for you.

01:09.000 --> 01:18.000
I'm writing NEMU mobile, which is C++ project. I fly with microlight airplane and I did some adjustment.

01:21.000 --> 01:26.000
I'm doing adjustment of Amazfish, which is company on app to PIN time.

01:27.000 --> 01:37.000
I have a few patches there, so I hope I understand the topic a little bit.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
So that's about me. What's about you?

01:42.000 --> 01:56.000
Well, yet another thing. I wasn't sure about if I'm able to arrive because my back hurts and my doctor told me to do some exercise, so let's do exercise with me.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
So I'm C-Developer. Please write your hand.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
Okay, many C-Developers. I'm not C++ developer. Is anyone C++ developer?

02:09.000 --> 02:18.000
Okay. Do you own PIN time? Who have PIN time? Oh, so much. Right.

02:21.000 --> 02:32.000
What next? So do you try to code for PIN time? I'm trying to. Wow, so many people.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
Okay, so I will try to adjust details for you.

02:39.000 --> 02:49.000
And as I said, or I didn't said that I'm working for Gracor Text, so I'm not here on behalf of PIN64.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
And my aim was to recommend you some, or provide you some details about PIN64 PIN time.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
Because you may consider buying some smartwatch.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
And my aim was also to tell you about other options.

03:10.000 --> 03:17.000
So I selected those few devices, Bangal JAS, SQFMI.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
If you remember, BigBerry SQFMI does smartwatch as well.

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
I recently started with Asteroid OS, which is great.

03:34.000 --> 03:44.000
And the main difference is that it is like full-blown Linux and very powerful device if you compare it with PIN time.

03:44.000 --> 03:50.000
Okay, you probably know the specifications.

03:51.000 --> 04:01.000
The CPU is 64 MHz. You have 64 kilobytes of memory and small storage.

04:02.000 --> 04:12.000
You have 240 to 440 screen with touch panel.

04:12.000 --> 04:20.000
You have accelerometer from Bosch. You have heart rate monitor, vibration motor, Bluetooth and battery. That's it.

04:26.000 --> 04:33.000
You have, or there are two editions. I have sealed edition of smart PIN time.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
And it means you are not able to connect to serial line.

04:38.000 --> 04:45.000
You have to debug everything remotely, which is not very comfortable for coding.

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
You can buy also DevKit, which has those things.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay. What about software?

04:59.000 --> 05:03.000
I was speaking about hardware. This is about software also.

05:03.000 --> 05:12.000
On the left side, we have some operating system for PIN time.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
On the right side, we have some companion apps.

05:17.000 --> 05:22.000
If you want comfortable or nice user experience, you probably want both.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
There is infinite time, which is written in C++.

05:28.000 --> 05:42.000
There is VaspOS, which is a micro Python, Riot OS, which is in Rust, if I remember correctly.

05:43.000 --> 05:56.000
I was focusing mostly on infinite time, which is like most advanced project.

05:57.000 --> 06:03.000
It's focusing on good user experience, and it's not like so much debugging and so on.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
On the other hand, we need some companion app.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.000
If you are using Android, you will choose probably Gadget Bridge, which is great.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
But I'm using Ubuntu Touch. What's now?

06:19.000 --> 06:25.000
When I started with PIN time, there wasn't any companion application for Ubuntu Touch.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
I've seen AmazFish, which was suitable for porting.

06:32.000 --> 06:37.000
I started with port, and I'm working on that right now. I'm fixing bugs there.

06:38.000 --> 06:52.000
There are also other apps for iPhone or post market OS for POPFOS, like GTK-based application.

06:56.000 --> 07:03.000
We have many options. I choose those to infinite time and AmazFish.

07:06.000 --> 07:13.000
What is infinite time? The vision of the project is to keep freedom and privacy.

07:14.000 --> 07:22.000
They are explicitly saying that they don't want health tracking features.

07:26.000 --> 07:32.000
But what actually it provides?

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
We have some smartwatch and features.

07:38.000 --> 07:43.000
I would like to hear what features you would like to have on smartwatch.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
Please try to shout on me.

07:48.000 --> 07:52.000
Sorry, time. That's a very good feature.

07:52.000 --> 08:00.000
PIN time and infinite time can do the synchronization of time with your companion app.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
So you have synchronized time.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
Some other ideas?

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
I'm sorry?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Stopwatch.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
That's great. It's there.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
Tracking other sport activities.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
Tracking other sport activities.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.000
I decided to split it into three categories.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
This goes into health monitoring.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
They explicitly said that they don't want to do that.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
But it's a good feature.

08:37.000 --> 08:44.000
With age, I'm also wanting some health tracking and sport tracking activities on my smartwatch.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
GPS monitoring.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Not for sport but for north.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Okay, so some navigation applications.

08:57.000 --> 09:03.000
There is a feature that you have pure maps.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
The pure maps sends, or you set some targets, some navigation.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.000
And the pure maps sends the instruction to D-Bus, to Amazfish.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.000
And Amazfish sends those data to PIN time, to infinite time.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
And it should work nicely.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
But when I was developing that, I had broken legs, so I haven't the opportunity to test it.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
And after that, I didn't test it. Sorry.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
But I hope it works.

09:40.000 --> 09:51.000
Okay, if we are speaking about notifications, you probably want to be notified about phone call.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
And you probably want to refuse the phone call from the device.

09:56.000 --> 10:01.000
Testing works. It has some limitations.

10:02.000 --> 10:13.000
Like the infinite time starts like five rounds of vibrations.

10:14.000 --> 10:26.000
And after that, it stops vibrations, also notification or the vibration stops even the phone call wasn't received or rejected, actually.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
But otherwise, it worked nicely.

10:29.000 --> 10:39.000
Speaking about other notifications, for example, for emails or for instant messaging,

10:40.000 --> 10:47.000
the main issue is that the notifications are limited to 100 bytes,

10:48.000 --> 10:51.000
which is basically content of the whole screen.

10:52.000 --> 10:57.000
Like one screen, but the message can be longer.

10:59.000 --> 11:08.000
For sure. So there is this limitation because of lack of memory on the device.

11:09.000 --> 11:21.000
And when I started with infinite time, there were other issues and I will show them later.

11:22.000 --> 11:34.000
There are also other features such as alarms, but I would like to see a remotely controlled alarm and multiple alarms, but this is not possible.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Similar for calendars.

11:37.000 --> 11:47.000
The Amasfish allows to send notification about event in calendar, but only when you are connected to Bluetooth, by Bluetooth to device.

11:48.000 --> 11:58.000
When the connection is lost, you don't have information about event, which is not the feature you want.

12:01.000 --> 12:09.000
And then you have some kind of other activities like remote control of music and navigation and weather forecast.

12:10.000 --> 12:17.000
By the way, with the new release, which was, I don't know, one month ago,

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
there is a new weather forecast implemented in infinite time, new protocol.

12:30.000 --> 12:38.000
And with most recent patches, which are in master, but wasn't released yet,

12:40.000 --> 12:45.000
you can have the weather forecast also on other watch faces.

12:46.000 --> 12:51.000
So right now it is available only on pine time style watch face.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
Okay, let's continue.

12:55.000 --> 12:59.000
This is how the architecture of system look like.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So thanks for picture.

13:06.000 --> 13:22.000
The important part is that it's based on RTOS and there is some abstraction layer which aims to provide some abstraction for device.

13:22.000 --> 13:29.000
And you can have driver separated from the controller which allows you porting to other devices.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
Okay.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I want to develop that, so I'm user.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
I have some idea what I want.

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
And then I would like to try my idea.

13:47.000 --> 13:54.000
There is something called simulator, which allows me to prototype the idea.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
It looks like this.

13:59.000 --> 14:04.000
You can even record the screen.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
So this is great.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
So I've added that into request.

14:09.000 --> 14:16.000
So my idea was that there is missing some notification or some status of the alarm.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.000
So I don't know if alarm is set or not.

14:19.000 --> 14:28.000
So I have added the icon into status bar and recorded the thing and submitted pull request.

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
It's really easy.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
I hope I...

14:39.000 --> 14:42.000
Okay, it's not good idea.

14:43.000 --> 14:54.000
So I wanted to show simulator a little bit, but it's really easy to compile and it's not possible to share the screen.

14:54.000 --> 14:57.000
So maybe at the end if you have time.

14:58.000 --> 15:08.000
The simulator allows you to adjust also steps and the battery level and so on.

15:08.000 --> 15:16.000
So you can tune the UI to have good user experience.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
You have tuned gestures and so on.

15:18.000 --> 15:28.000
So it is really great and you don't need the device itself to test your application.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.000
The simulator itself has sub repository with infinite time.

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
So you are actually modifying the code which can be run on the device.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
I have...

16:00.000 --> 16:07.000
When I started with Amazfish, I had troubles with notifications.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.000
So my colleague Pavel Kerek wrote me a message which says,

16:12.000 --> 16:25.000
''Cześć Cinać Králu'' and well, due to limited memory, there isn't font for Czech language.

16:25.000 --> 16:34.000
So it was looking like that so some characters was missing and I wasn't able to read it.

16:35.000 --> 16:49.000
Luckily there is something we call transliteration and it allows to substitute some characters to some similar characters

16:49.000 --> 16:54.000
and we are able to read that normally.

16:54.000 --> 16:59.000
So I have added that option to Amazfish and I was pretty happy.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.000
Then you can see that there are some glitches.

17:05.000 --> 17:10.000
So there is a notification, somebody and title.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
So I have noticed that Amazfish is sending those incorrectly.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
So somebody should be in the header.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.000
So I have one more line for message itself.

17:28.000 --> 17:36.000
Next you can see that the teleports string should be name of application.

17:36.000 --> 17:40.000
It shouldn't be the name of the debus source.

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
So this is another thing I was fixing.

17:44.000 --> 17:52.000
Then I was looking how to fix phone calls so it started to work.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.000
By the way my son's name is Adam.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.000
So one character is missing so I noticed that...

18:06.000 --> 18:14.000
I noticed that infinite time doesn't process the alert notification service properly.

18:14.000 --> 18:19.000
There should be A.

18:19.000 --> 18:27.000
So there is a fix in Amazfish with one byte to have proper name.

18:27.000 --> 18:38.000
And there is a plural request in infinite time which removes the byte from processing if not should be there.

18:39.000 --> 18:55.000
If you read abstract of this talk I wrote something like that the community around can benefit from those changes.

18:55.000 --> 19:03.000
So I was making the changes for Wound2Touch but Amazfish still works on Sailfish OS.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
So all Sailfish OS can benefit from those changes as well.

19:09.000 --> 19:14.000
So I like that feature of open source.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.000
Okay here are some more examples I have done.

19:22.000 --> 19:28.000
So one of thing was pairing.

19:28.000 --> 19:33.000
And I had issue also with the universal components.

19:33.000 --> 19:45.000
So one issue was that icons had bad dimensions and there was some attached page which wasn't inserted properly.

19:45.000 --> 19:55.000
So you was not able to click back on the pairing page which was really uncomfortable.

19:56.000 --> 20:06.000
I also fixed some retrieving of information about number of steps on device.

20:06.000 --> 20:19.000
I prepared sampler of the activity stream so the pine time is not storing your fitness activities.

20:19.000 --> 20:25.000
So number of steps each minute and heart rate each minute.

20:25.000 --> 20:30.000
But it can just stream data to company in application.

20:30.000 --> 20:38.000
So I am sampling data and in the end I can paint such histograms.

20:38.000 --> 20:47.000
If you look carefully you can see the time is like to 3 p.m. or something like that.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
So it is just few samples from whole day.

20:51.000 --> 21:01.000
I have also added some charts for battery so you can see that your battery can last for 7 days roughly.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
And also other things.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.000
Yeah let's skip that.

21:19.000 --> 21:28.000
For sure if you are working with microcontroller you want to check battery life.

21:28.000 --> 21:36.000
And you need to be careful to keep your consumption low.

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
I have yet one slide about summary what MSFish does.

21:46.000 --> 21:52.000
Well from point of view that something does infinite time something does MSFish.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
Like they work together.

21:58.000 --> 22:08.000
By the way that picture is like there were some kind of silly joke or how to say that.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
So when I was kid so if you say something like I want to be millionaire

22:14.000 --> 22:18.000
the answer was I want to watch with fountain.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
So this one is it.

22:24.000 --> 22:32.000
So there are many features some of them are limited like synchronization of activities.

22:32.000 --> 22:38.000
Synchronization of calendar are not there because infinite time doesn't do that right now.

22:39.000 --> 22:50.000
There are a lot of poor requests and the main thing is have bottleneck in reviews.

22:50.000 --> 22:59.000
So it is a little bit demotivating to make something and then wait without response.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
But I hope it will be better in future.

23:04.000 --> 23:13.000
And yes it's community project so there is a lot of forks with a lot of ideas.

23:13.000 --> 23:20.000
I have here pictures of some forks from Joachim.

23:20.000 --> 23:30.000
By the way there is a rumor that Joachim he made some next generation of the of the pine time.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.000
So there is more is it will be pine time too.

23:35.000 --> 23:42.000
So twice faster CPU same Nordic semiconductor twice more memory.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
But I'm not sure we will see.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.000
And you know it's open source.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.000
There are many forks many many changes.

23:58.000 --> 24:04.000
And it's developing so I hope it will be it will be great.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
Or it is already actually but it will be better in the time.

24:11.000 --> 24:18.000
So I hope all of you will are motivated to contribute to Amaz fish to to pine time.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
And I'm looking forward to your contribution.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.000
So I think it's time for question right.

24:27.000 --> 24:31.000
Actually maybe one question or so but we don't have so much time.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.000
So maybe one one good question anyone.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
Otherwise give up a big I add a S1 actually but still give up a ground of applause first.

24:46.000 --> 24:50.000
Thank you if anybody has better question than mine please go ahead.

24:50.000 --> 24:55.000
Okay just as more curiosity because you mentioned multiple alarms.

24:55.000 --> 25:00.000
Yes I've never owned them smartwatch that supported more than one alarm.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
Why in your opinion is that are there some kind of constraints.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
