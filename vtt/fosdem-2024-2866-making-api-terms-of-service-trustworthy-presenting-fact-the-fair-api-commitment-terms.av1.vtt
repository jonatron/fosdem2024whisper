WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.240
All right. Thank you, everyone. So we are moving on with the next talk. We're going

00:12.240 --> 00:19.640
to talk about API Terms of Service. Unfortunately, Celia couldn't join us. She's ill at home,

00:19.640 --> 00:25.040
but maybe offer. Can you offer yourself to give the talk? So, yeah, the floor is yours.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.040
Thank you.

00:26.040 --> 00:31.320
Actually, it was a joint talk between Celia and I, so you only had half of the talk, but

00:31.320 --> 00:39.040
100% of the content, right? So, yeah, my name is Medimej Javier. I did many things in API

00:39.040 --> 00:44.920
Space, wrote books, organized conferences, and one of the projects I've been working

00:44.920 --> 00:50.880
on is this one that I'm actually really proud to have started, and I would love to have

00:50.880 --> 00:57.320
your feedback after the session on this. So first, who in the room had issues with Term

00:57.320 --> 01:02.960
of Services of APIs, you know, application breaking or business model changing or stuff

01:02.960 --> 01:13.080
like that, you know, some of people here? Was it Twitter? Google Maps? Other, no, MongoDB

01:13.080 --> 01:21.800
API versus, no? Okay, so we'll explore that together. So the idea was to try to be inspired.

01:21.800 --> 01:26.560
We've been actually highly inspired by a project called Term of Service Didn't Read. I don't

01:26.560 --> 01:30.600
know if you know this project. It's a group of people who read Term of Services because

01:30.600 --> 01:35.800
nobody reads them, right? Except lawyers. But nobody reads them and say, we will read

01:35.800 --> 01:40.840
them and we will tag them and we will show simply if they are risky or not for your data

01:40.840 --> 01:44.680
or if they respect you as a user, right? It's a really hard work. They have been doing

01:44.680 --> 01:49.720
that over the last 10 years and we say, okay, but for APIs actually, there is, for software,

01:49.720 --> 01:53.960
there is also a big risk, you know, when you don't read what will happen to the software,

01:53.960 --> 01:58.600
right? And the policy around the software. So we kind of forked philosophically their

01:58.600 --> 02:03.840
project to do API Term of Service Didn't Read, right? And actually, you can see Celia here,

02:03.840 --> 02:10.800
Benjamin III, owner of the project who is an open source lawyer, as you can call it,

02:10.920 --> 02:16.240
it's like that, right? So just to say the project has been supported by the Ford Foundation,

02:16.240 --> 02:23.720
the Modula Foundation, the Open Society Foundation as part of a grant to make more, the digital

02:23.720 --> 02:30.760
infrastructure more open source and more safe and trustworthy. So just to mention that.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.880
So where does the problem come from? We can take the example of Twitter, but we can take

02:34.920 --> 02:41.240
so many others, right? But just an example of Twitter. 2012, actually it's 2012, 2012,

02:41.680 --> 02:46.640
Twitter has a vibrant ecosystem, you know, thanks to their API, a lot of developers are able to

02:46.640 --> 02:53.040
resendicate Twitter content and make great client applications on web and mobile. But Twitter now

02:53.040 --> 02:58.240
has some investors who say we want to keep the money, we want to keep the ads, right? We want

02:58.240 --> 03:03.040
to keep the ads. So if we resendicate the data to others, we can't push the ads and get money. So

03:03.040 --> 03:08.240
we will kill the Twitter ecosystem by changing abruptly the amount of services. It was re-abrupt.

03:08.240 --> 03:13.840
Many, many, we estimate that more than 300,000 applications died from developers who invested

03:13.840 --> 03:20.000
their time and energy and stuff. So really a big, a big, a big, a big fiasco in the Twitter

03:20.000 --> 03:27.200
ecosystem. But a platform is good as its ecosystem, right? So in 2015, oh my God, like we killed all

03:27.200 --> 03:32.240
their ecosystem, developers are unhappy. The CEO of Twitter said, oh, sorry, developers, right? We

03:32.240 --> 03:38.560
reopen the time of services, right? We'll reopen, please come back. We want to reset relations. Okay,

03:38.560 --> 03:43.120
okay, let's reset relations, right? We, they updated time of services, make it more open, right?

03:44.000 --> 03:51.680
2018, boom, they destroy apps again by killing the API that most of them use, claiming to,

03:51.680 --> 03:56.880
they have to update the backend, right? You know, so that was their claim, say, oh, it's a legacy API,

03:56.880 --> 04:03.280
you know, but we will not offer new versions, right? And 2023, after the long-nest acquisition,

04:03.280 --> 04:09.520
now APIs are extremely costly. And some research, for example, who are used to have an API for free,

04:10.320 --> 04:15.680
now they have, last year they had to pay $100 and now it's more than $40,000 to access Twitter API

04:15.680 --> 04:20.320
for research. So just to give you like how unstable it can be when you rely on someone else.

04:21.040 --> 04:26.000
As for software open source, as for companies opening their digital infrastructure APIs,

04:26.000 --> 04:33.040
when there is not stability trust, you know, it's really hard to trust each other, right?

04:33.040 --> 04:39.280
When an API is not stable, when people break API all the time, you may have known how Facebook was

04:39.280 --> 04:45.280
breaking some of the APIs, how Google has shut down many, many other APIs, how Netflix stopped

04:46.080 --> 04:50.480
their API to developers, you know, so many different ideas, so many different stories

04:50.480 --> 04:57.440
behind that. So we thought how we can be inspired by someone who can claim promises and keep these

04:57.440 --> 05:03.520
promises in the future. Actually, we have been inspired by Creative Commons, so I'm, you're

05:03.520 --> 05:08.560
familiar with Creative Commons, right, you know, CC by, you know, all these licenses. It's really

05:08.560 --> 05:13.600
easy to produce and really easy to understand. So this is where we started, we say, okay, can we

05:13.600 --> 05:18.480
build a Creative Commons pattern for APIs, right? You know, so that's the idea. Of course, it has,

05:18.480 --> 05:22.240
it's not just for copyright, it has more degrees of liberty, but let's see how the

05:22.240 --> 05:28.240
research has been made and what's the result, right? Yeah, and as I said, for research,

05:28.960 --> 05:34.960
now it's really like $40,000 a month, right? Of course, claiming that they don't want,

05:34.960 --> 05:41.600
they want to avoid the AI, the AI to learn from the Twitter data, but still, $42,000 when you're

05:41.600 --> 05:46.400
a researcher doing great stuff on social media information, that begins to be expensive, right?

05:47.120 --> 05:54.160
But it will not be the academics or we'll pay the $44 billion, a little bit of space, right? You know,

05:54.160 --> 05:58.000
so yeah, it's not the academics to pay, in my opinion, at least this amount.

05:58.720 --> 06:04.000
So yeah, how we can leverage API terms of services for more trustworthy digital ecosystem.

06:05.840 --> 06:12.320
So, you know, here I would mostly talk about web APIs, you know, we have the software API, Linux

06:12.320 --> 06:18.320
API, Android APIs, whatever, it has also the same idea that APIs needs to be stable over time and

06:18.320 --> 06:23.840
trustworthy, but let's say this one, there is also the infrastructure behind it. So, when you

06:23.840 --> 06:29.760
rely on it, you want it to be real time, you want to access the data directly. So, I'm talking of

06:29.760 --> 06:37.280
these ones which are, let's say, more tight to instant feedbacks and issues, right?

06:38.240 --> 06:44.480
And the term of services just for the definition, the term of services are the legal contract attached

06:44.480 --> 06:52.560
to the consumptions of these APIs. So, if I consume one API from a software provider, as a service,

06:52.560 --> 06:59.440
you know, that he owes actually the service behind the APIs, he will attach a legal document who say,

06:59.440 --> 07:04.320
you can use this API this number of time, this number of time per day, per month,

07:04.320 --> 07:08.000
this is what you are allowed to do with my API. You know, some people consider

07:09.440 --> 07:13.920
not like an open source, but that APIs can have limited use. You know, for example, Google Maps

07:13.920 --> 07:19.120
does not allow you to consume Google Maps to do another map services, right? Just an example,

07:19.120 --> 07:23.360
right? Can be obvious for business reasons, but this is not freedom, right? This is not the freedom

07:23.360 --> 07:28.000
to consume the data the way we want, right? We have the open data movement that allows that,

07:28.640 --> 07:34.720
but let's say this term of services is really a contract attached to the consumption of an API,

07:34.720 --> 07:39.120
and you should read it. I really advise you to read it. So, this is what we call the term of services.

07:39.760 --> 07:46.640
It has many degrees of liberty on the reuse, on the license, on the specs, on so many, so many things.

07:49.600 --> 07:56.000
And so, the idea is to, and one of our other assumptions is that I've read the API term of

07:56.000 --> 08:01.520
services is the biggest lie of the programmable web, right? Nobody reads them, and it's really

08:01.520 --> 08:06.320
the worst when you know something is wrong by your users and not by your provider.

08:08.560 --> 08:14.880
So, we made a survey across 200 experts in the API industry, you know. As a side thing,

08:14.880 --> 08:19.920
I organize API days conferences, which is the main series of conferences on APIs worldwide.

08:20.480 --> 08:26.960
And so, yeah, 40% believe that 40%, 42% never check if the API changes, you know. They never

08:26.960 --> 08:33.120
check in their code or whatever. They just learn it when it's down, right? So, 42% that's just to say

08:33.120 --> 08:43.680
it's quite a lot. 25% say they have a read approximately the term of services, you know.

08:43.760 --> 08:50.800
It's okay, I have proxy, I read them in 23% like a little bit more, you know, when they have business

08:50.800 --> 08:59.040
constraints in bank or whatever. And 30% consider they never have interactions with the provider of

08:59.040 --> 09:06.080
the API. So, I just want to go there, look at the developer portal, read the docs, sign up, get my

09:06.080 --> 09:10.320
key or my token and integrate, right? I don't want to spend more time on this.

09:10.560 --> 09:17.760
And so, the most of the time when they know when API is broken or doesn't work is by email. 70%

09:17.760 --> 09:22.400
of people just learn that by email. So, there's really this issue, this promise and this constant

09:22.400 --> 09:31.760
communication that's really a problem in these things, right? We also tried a new idea in the

09:31.760 --> 09:36.960
API space, which is the idea of copy left. Of course, copy left is not new in the Apprentice

09:36.960 --> 09:42.720
world, but in the API space it's quite new. Imagine if you consume an API that has a specific license,

09:43.520 --> 09:49.920
all the API you provide should have the same license, you know. So, that's something new in the

09:49.920 --> 09:55.760
API space. Everybody believe that it's digital infrastructure, you know, it's not like text or

09:56.800 --> 10:03.280
software like cold software. Now, it's hot, we have running software on servers. But imagine if you

10:03.280 --> 10:07.920
consume an API from an academic institution, because they have great data, you have to,

10:07.920 --> 10:11.520
all your APIs, even for business reasons, will have, we need to have the same license. So,

10:11.520 --> 10:18.000
it's something we tried. Didn't convince the majority of people, but at least we tried to

10:18.000 --> 10:29.280
explore that idea, right? And just to finish on the context, with all the interviews and surveys,

10:29.280 --> 10:33.760
we've seen that there's a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure from the providers,

10:34.800 --> 10:41.200
because of business and strategic decisions. Actually, when an API product manager and

10:41.200 --> 10:46.880
developers publish APIs in a business environment, the lawyers come and say, look, what did you expose?

10:47.680 --> 10:52.720
What's the license on this? And then they write this really huge and long and boring

10:53.280 --> 10:58.800
Temur service contract. And actually, the lawyers don't understand so much the tech. So, there is

10:59.360 --> 11:04.080
this miscommunication between the two that makes the text really complex with many, many

11:06.560 --> 11:12.480
protections, which is not good when you want to consume something to generate a nice application.

11:15.520 --> 11:22.320
So, we've seen also about how people can be completely dependent. If you build something on

11:22.320 --> 11:28.800
Twitter or x.com, they're the only provider of Twitter.com data or x.com data. It's really hard

11:28.800 --> 11:34.560
for you to compete to go to someone else. Imagine you want an SMS, do you want an API for SMS?

11:34.560 --> 11:40.800
There are Twilio, there are like their Vonage, there are many, many others. There are plenty,

11:40.800 --> 11:45.760
plenty, plenty of them, right? There's also a really important aspect when someone has a monopoly

11:45.760 --> 11:50.880
of their content or data or infrastructure. It's really hard, right? But the only opposite,

11:50.880 --> 11:55.920
I just want to show you also that when you have a stable API over time, it can be part of your

11:55.920 --> 12:02.080
success too. Just example of Amazon Web Services, you know, so Verne Vogels, the CTO of Amazon Web

12:02.080 --> 12:08.240
Services used to say, we had only chance to make it right, so we spent a lot of time designing our

12:08.240 --> 12:13.840
APIs and the APIs actually never really changed deeply. Of course, they're adding more stuff

12:13.840 --> 12:19.200
because they knew people will rely on them. So, this trustworthiness in the digital infrastructure

12:19.200 --> 12:24.880
space is extremely important, you know? So, yeah, but how we can make more people aware of,

12:24.880 --> 12:30.320
of making this more transparent. So, we interviewed like API providers, you know,

12:31.040 --> 12:35.120
when their, the API's product is being developed, when they reach the contact

12:35.120 --> 12:40.160
legal department, when they're, they're reviewed by industry standards, when the thermal service

12:40.160 --> 12:44.480
are documented, when the need, thermal service needs to be updated, you know, there's a full

12:44.480 --> 12:49.920
life cycle, right? So, how we do, how we tell people, so, so we did all these interviews

12:50.880 --> 12:58.640
and then we, based on this, the final result was that 69% people wanted to make more trust,

12:58.640 --> 13:04.880
enhance the trust between the providers and the consumer, right? 65% wanted to simplify it,

13:05.760 --> 13:11.760
mostly to simplify it and 42% believed that it enabled, it's a promise that enabled to have larger

13:12.400 --> 13:18.400
ecosystem, right? And just to give you another hint, Gartner, you know, the consulting company,

13:18.400 --> 13:24.240
really expensive one, but say that company who are able to demonstrate a safe and trustworthy

13:24.240 --> 13:30.880
ecosystem have 50% more chance to attract application developer, right? So, we see

13:30.880 --> 13:36.640
approximate, approximate these numbers. And so, we, based on that, we also, as I say,

13:36.640 --> 13:43.200
was inspired by Creative Commons, you know? Did you already use this, this quick, this quick,

13:43.440 --> 13:49.680
wow, it's not a form, but it's a quick wizard. You know, just check, do you allow adaptation of

13:49.680 --> 13:55.120
your work? Yes, no, yes, it's not sure like, do you allow commercial use? Yes or no? Boom,

13:55.120 --> 13:59.520
you have your license. So, actually, it's really two clicks to generate your license.

14:00.480 --> 14:04.800
Two clicks, just simple. And you have a license for copyright that everybody can understand,

14:04.800 --> 14:10.800
right? You have the logos on the right and everything. So, based on that, based on the

14:10.800 --> 14:16.640
conclusion I shared with you, based also on some other projects like Scriptaminant, OpenEthics,

14:16.640 --> 14:22.880
TOSDR, API Commons from Kinline, a specific expert of the industry, we decided to do the same,

14:22.880 --> 14:27.520
right? We decided to do the same, and this is the framework at the end. It's more complex

14:27.520 --> 14:33.040
than Creative Commons, because Creative Commons has less degrees of liberty about copyright.

14:34.000 --> 14:41.680
We actually, we went at the beginning for 18 degrees of decisions, right? And we reduced it,

14:41.680 --> 14:50.240
we reduced it to actually five, which are, do you access, do I allow access to my API to

14:50.240 --> 14:56.000
some people or to everyone, like what we call API neutrality? You know, like the no-gate-keeper

14:56.000 --> 15:01.280
policy. Do I allow my competitors to use my API, right? Amazon Web Services, they allow

15:01.360 --> 15:07.040
competitors to use Amazon Web Services. Competitors don't want to go there, but they would allow it,

15:07.040 --> 15:12.640
right? Just to give you an idea, right? There is also the specification, you know, the design

15:12.640 --> 15:17.840
and specification, my OpenEpi document, right? Or a PDPS specification. Do I allow it to be

15:17.840 --> 15:24.560
reused, re-consumed, copied, whatever? Another one is what we call the ethical data policy. Yeah.

15:24.960 --> 15:31.680
Oh, I think it's less than that, but okay. The ethical data policy, do I allow reuse of the

15:31.680 --> 15:39.280
content in what context? I allow the reuse of the content. The loyal output policy is mostly

15:39.280 --> 15:45.360
about the breaking change. You know, how do I pre-warn you before I do a change, a deprecator

15:45.360 --> 15:52.560
version? It's important. Most of the company who are fair give three months to warn when something

15:52.560 --> 15:57.120
can change some company go up to one year by contract to tell you, you know, when we make a

15:57.120 --> 16:00.800
breaking change, we will tell you one year in advance. Well, at least we will keep the existing

16:00.800 --> 16:09.280
version for one year. That's better, right? That's better than no notice, right? And the last one

16:09.280 --> 16:15.760
is reference and attribution. You will see some people allow you to consume their API as long as

16:15.760 --> 16:20.080
you say, okay, this data was provided by the University of Brussels, or this data has been

16:20.080 --> 16:26.720
provided by this academia or this company. I offer you kind of the data and the API and the

16:26.720 --> 16:32.960
service for free, do you allow attribution, right? And we believe it's always better when there is

16:32.960 --> 16:39.440
attribution. So we said the type of logo in this. Now, just so you demo about height work.

16:43.440 --> 16:48.240
So you can go on api-tos.org when it's the page of the project. We have a really,

16:48.240 --> 16:56.000
really long report because we have been, the funders wanted reports, but you can start the wizard.

16:57.840 --> 17:03.040
Okay. And then this is the wizard you have. Again, we really try to reduce to five questions.

17:03.040 --> 17:08.640
At the beginning it was 18 questions, so that was too much. So the first, the fair use policy,

17:09.760 --> 17:13.840
the fair use policy and the fair loyal change policy, you can go further, but this one you're

17:13.840 --> 17:22.000
obliged, we consider to be a fair API, to be a fair API, which will fact the fair API commitment

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
trust, you have to accept these two. You can't decide anything, right? It has the fair use policy

17:28.000 --> 17:31.600
and the loyal change policy, which we consider three months, three months change,

17:32.960 --> 17:37.520
three months warning and notification for API change, right? So this is a yes, right?

17:38.400 --> 17:44.560
Then API access. Do you agree? I'll just go full screen. Do you allow a full API neutrality?

17:44.560 --> 17:51.280
Everyone can consume my API. Everyone can access to it. I will not gate, gate, not gate anyone, right?

17:52.560 --> 17:58.880
Do you oblige for share or like? You know, say, look, if you, you will be obliged to do it for,

17:58.880 --> 18:03.920
with the same license, you know, so it's not just, just consumption. You have to do it with the same

18:03.920 --> 18:09.680
license. So we, we tried to, to push to share or like, right? And restrictive rights, which is

18:09.680 --> 18:14.480
low rights, you know, we could, the, the person consider that they can limit the reuse, right?

18:15.200 --> 18:17.120
So let's say I do share or like, right?

18:19.120 --> 18:23.120
API specification, what are the conditions to access and reuse the specification?

18:23.120 --> 18:29.680
Is it a C0 license, which is actually a fork of Kinlain API commands project, you know, putting

18:29.680 --> 18:37.280
the copyright of API's public? Or is it a share like license, you know, like, you have to publish

18:37.280 --> 18:42.800
under the same license? Let's put it CC0, for example. The ethical data policy, what are the

18:42.800 --> 18:47.520
condition, the condition to reuse the data exposed by API? Is it a large data reuse,

18:47.520 --> 18:50.880
but with some restrictions? No, no, non-compete, whatever.

18:53.040 --> 18:58.320
Is it an open, full day, open data contract? Like, no, you can do whatever you want. I will,

18:58.400 --> 19:03.680
this is, this is good for me. Is it a commercial data contract? Anything can be used except for

19:03.680 --> 19:08.720
commercial reasons. So let's go for open data contract here. And the last one,

19:10.800 --> 19:15.200
before the last one, the loyal output policy, what are the conditions to reuse the outputs from

19:15.200 --> 19:20.880
the API usage? If you accept the commercial reuse, you have all commercial reuse, non-direct

19:20.880 --> 19:25.760
competition on non-commercial reuse. So this is really the commercial aspect above, let's say

19:25.760 --> 19:30.320
all commercial reuse allowed. And that's better at least. Reference and attribution,

19:30.320 --> 19:36.640
is it a requirement? Is it no attribution needed? Or is it trademark enforcement?

19:36.640 --> 19:41.040
Just to let you know also about the, some people here may think that attribution requirement would

19:41.040 --> 19:46.240
be green, because this is the right way to do. We also tried these colors to the, to the people

19:46.240 --> 19:51.120
in the community, right? They consider limitation or they consider no obligation, right? So it's not

19:51.120 --> 19:57.360
moral, but it is about like constraints versus freedom, right? But it goes against the, what we

19:57.360 --> 20:02.000
call free software. It's just to say like, this is what people understood. So we try to adapt to that.

20:03.360 --> 20:07.520
Attribution requirement, no attribution, trademark enforcement. So you oblige to put the logo,

20:07.520 --> 20:11.840
you oblige to say it comes from this company, this academia. Let's make some attribution requirement.

20:12.720 --> 20:18.400
And then here, you can click here and then you have your pictograms. Sorry, I don't want to.

20:18.880 --> 20:25.360
And you have the PDF of the license here. So I'll just go there. That actually take,

20:26.880 --> 20:31.120
retake all the selection you got, right? So this is more the lawyer stuff. We tried to make it

20:31.120 --> 20:38.880
simpler with all the exact duration and time and, and, and, and limitation, right? And that you can

20:38.880 --> 20:46.320
attach to your current, it's not a full term of services, but this is a fair API commitment terms

20:47.040 --> 20:51.680
that you can claim to show that for the things that are the more important for the community and

20:51.680 --> 20:58.320
for your users, these are the one you claim and you write and you engage to respect, you know, for

20:58.320 --> 21:03.360
what matters. It doesn't have the exact pricing or exact stuff. So this is a contract as an

21:03.360 --> 21:09.120
addendum that you attached to an existing contract that overrides the existing contract on these,

21:09.120 --> 21:17.840
on these five elements, right? So, yeah, I'll go back. I'll go back to, no, it's not this one. Sorry.

21:31.680 --> 21:37.360
So the fact license, as we call it, it's for fair, fair API commitment terms is to make

21:37.920 --> 21:42.320
API terms fair, transparent, trustworthy. And we think it's a fact, right?

21:44.240 --> 21:48.800
It's, this is why we are now an API task project. So we made this first thing where we have

21:48.800 --> 21:53.760
approximately a few dozens of companies who will begin to attach this to their, to their API.

21:54.480 --> 22:01.600
We're still looking for feedbacks for improvement. The next steps would be to, to make it even more

22:01.600 --> 22:08.720
simpler, put a little bit more degrees on, on the, to be able to write the full license, not just

22:09.520 --> 22:15.920
an addendum to the license on just the fair terms. And the next step afterwards is to even make it

22:15.920 --> 22:21.200
match in readable. So like this, we would love to attach it to open API specification or API

22:21.200 --> 22:26.160
documents as a specific section, you know, but like, if we take a little bit more time,

22:27.040 --> 22:31.200
and there are some, some discussions that needs to be taken. But just to let you know, we would

22:31.200 --> 22:35.840
love at some point it to be machine readable. So when you consume an API, automatically, you will

22:35.840 --> 22:41.200
know what you are allowed to do or not. And that will be a little bit more helpful for the developer

22:41.200 --> 22:44.880
community. Thank you very much. And if you have any questions, we'd love to answer them.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.800
Yes. Thanks for the presentation.

22:54.800 --> 23:04.480
Um, is it the scenario that someone or a company would agree with all of the conditions, but in the

23:04.480 --> 23:10.640
end would not respect the conditions, such as the data policy, for example, or it would change the,

23:11.760 --> 23:18.000
and if yes, who or what would make sure that they are compliance?

23:18.800 --> 23:20.560
There is a saying in, in French, actually.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.240
Can I repeat the question?

23:22.240 --> 23:27.040
Oh, can I repeat the question? So your, the question is, I tried to reframinate correctly,

23:27.040 --> 23:32.080
the question is that it's great that if we write it and we try to put them on the,

23:32.080 --> 23:36.960
on their API, thermo services, but will they really be enforced, right? You know, like at some point.

23:36.960 --> 23:44.800
So there are two answers. The first one, as I say, we come from French, promises are only good

23:44.800 --> 23:50.560
for the one who believes them, right? No. So this is a French thing. So I, I understand. I

23:50.560 --> 23:54.240
understand where you come from, but it's the same for the existing thermo services, you know,

23:54.240 --> 23:58.800
but at least it's what we believe it's like the nudge, right? You know, it is exactly like

23:58.800 --> 24:04.720
creative commons. Creative commons, you can still put a photo and PowerPoint and steal it

24:04.720 --> 24:08.800
without respecting creative commons. But if one day when people come and say, look, yeah,

24:08.800 --> 24:12.720
in this presentation, this is my photo, you didn't pay a license, it was not allowed for commercial

24:12.720 --> 24:17.280
use, or you are this big corporation, this is, this is how much you need to be fine, right?

24:17.280 --> 24:21.520
So it gives a nudge of people respecting more, right? So that's the first thing. When it's easy

24:21.520 --> 24:27.600
to respect, I believe people respect, right? We just make it need to be more easy. So if it's easy

24:27.600 --> 24:32.880
to produce and easy to understand, you know, it's easier as a personal to look, I will make the right

24:32.880 --> 24:38.240
choice, right? Because it's, when it's not known, like, like with pictures, for example, when we,

24:38.240 --> 24:42.960
we didn't know that we were, we had no chance to know the license, it was okay to copy and paste.

24:42.960 --> 24:47.600
Now we see the license say, okay, I take the risk now. And I take the risk of my company,

24:47.600 --> 24:53.920
if it's okay to pay five, six, 10 bucks or more on the non-project or whatever to actually pay

24:53.920 --> 24:58.320
and say, okay, so I'm good, right? So that's the, that's the first thing. The second thing,

24:58.320 --> 25:03.600
which may be later, but, and we, we tried to promote that, but they stopped, they didn't want to do it.

25:03.600 --> 25:09.120
We tried at some point to do exactly like they do on SLA, service of agreements, you know,

25:09.120 --> 25:13.200
if an infrastructure provider does not respect their SLA, actually they have to give you back

25:13.200 --> 25:17.200
money. In many, many contracts, they have to give you back money if they don't respect the SLA.

25:17.920 --> 25:25.600
So now it becomes more contractual. We try to put that in this, but it's a, it's a, it's a practice

25:25.600 --> 25:31.200
that really few companies do and respect, especially I've experienced that many times with the cloud

25:31.200 --> 25:35.920
providers say, you did not respect the SLA, you have to give us money, say prove it. You know,

25:35.920 --> 25:42.160
come on. It was slow. Now it was slow on your application, not on our, our infrastructure.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.760
So, so that's, that's, but we tried, we tried. Like SLA.

25:50.960 --> 25:51.760
Yeah.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.320
Yeah.

26:52.320 --> 26:57.360
So, you say, I'm trying to reformulate you say are two different concepts, the data and the

26:57.360 --> 27:02.160
license with the data and the API itself. I agree with you. Just a example. I was

27:02.160 --> 27:06.880
considering at some point for the French open data government. And I said, look, you can even,

27:06.880 --> 27:11.120
you can give an Excel part, not an Excel file because they tried, but a CSV file, whatever,

27:12.080 --> 27:17.360
as free because it's paid by public money. But if you put it on API, there's no instance.

27:17.360 --> 27:21.280
There's no service. There's no ubiquity, maintenance, API access, security, whatever,

27:21.840 --> 27:28.000
now it's, your data is now a service and you can find a model depending on what you want.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.280
But you have to attach the API to more services with, so I agree with you.

27:31.920 --> 27:38.960
There is the data aspect. This, we talk about the reuse of the API, but as I said, we attach that

27:38.960 --> 27:45.520
to an existing contract where that should include the data license. Again, it's, it's a,

27:46.240 --> 27:50.400
it's a lawyer stuff. There is a law room there with people we worked with who are part of the,

27:50.400 --> 27:55.840
of the feedback. It's, it was really hard at least even for us to come understand that there is the

27:55.840 --> 28:01.360
data, there is the license of the data, the reuse of the data. And there is the API, which has a,

28:01.360 --> 28:07.360
it's another type of software who has another type of license realm where the data can transit.

28:07.360 --> 28:14.320
But if it's transit by API, the license can be arding to each other. So it's not easy to

28:14.320 --> 28:17.440
understand. And this is why we tried to make it simpler for developers. But thank you for

28:17.440 --> 28:24.880
his feedback. And if it's not yet enough clear, yeah, we have to work on it. Thank you.

28:28.880 --> 28:29.120
Yes.

28:36.000 --> 28:40.560
It's based on the, mostly based on the interview. This is why I put some time at the beginning

28:40.560 --> 28:45.200
of the presentation to explain all the people who were interviewed. We've considered the,

28:45.200 --> 28:51.520
it's called FACT for fair API commitment terms. So we, we listen to everyone. We, we know, we

28:51.520 --> 28:57.120
also have our own culture comes from open source, open, open, open digital infrastructure. And we

28:57.120 --> 29:01.920
said, we can't call it fair if it has at least these two conditions, these two conditions are

29:02.480 --> 29:07.440
obligated, are an obligation. And most of the people agreed with that. So the first two one,

29:07.440 --> 29:14.080
which is the fair use and the lawyer, lawyer output policy, we consider this one with no choice,

29:14.080 --> 29:20.560
right? If you were not, not have these bricks, you right. And the question was that there are some

29:20.560 --> 29:23.360
choices that are mandatory and why they are mandatory.

29:33.280 --> 29:39.600
Oh, no, no, it's a, the one that is selected by default is a, an implement, a bug implementation.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.120
No, no, no, it's not, it's a bug, not a feature.

29:49.040 --> 29:52.560
But I agree with you, it can, it can push the choice, right? It could push the choice, right?

29:53.520 --> 29:57.680
But if, when people come to the website, they're, they have already a good vision about what they

29:57.680 --> 30:09.440
want. So they are not tricked by that, but yeah, thank you very much.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.480
Thank you.
