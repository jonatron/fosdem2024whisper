WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.500
Okay, so welcome to the last talk for today about magic and software by the the talk is

00:14.500 --> 00:19.800
done by the software developer Steven Goodman and the magician James Merlin and you decide

00:19.800 --> 00:21.400
who you see.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.400
Okay, thank you all.

00:24.400 --> 00:32.900
As we said, my name is James Merlin.

00:32.900 --> 00:33.900
Thank you for that.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.400
I haven't done anything yet.

00:35.400 --> 00:39.200
So my name is James Merlin and I'm a magician.

00:39.200 --> 00:43.900
Now when I said I was going to present at Fozdem, I went to the magic shop in Brussels and I

00:43.900 --> 00:48.100
asked the magic man in the magic shop who stood behind the magic counter, have you got any

00:48.100 --> 00:52.000
new magic tricks that I can show those lovely folk at Fozdem?

00:52.000 --> 00:55.900
So the magic man in the magic counter had a look around and he looked on his magic shelf

00:55.900 --> 01:01.100
and he saw a little red box and they thought that's a nice little red box.

01:01.100 --> 01:04.900
But I don't know what it's for.

01:04.900 --> 01:08.980
Maybe inside the box there'll be a thought it up playing card or a coin or a prediction

01:08.980 --> 01:10.820
of something yet to happen.

01:10.820 --> 01:13.020
Do you know what's inside the little red box?

01:13.020 --> 01:18.220
It was a little black box and I thought, okay, that's nice enough.

01:18.220 --> 01:20.220
It's a little black box.

01:20.220 --> 01:21.220
I quite like it.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.920
It goes, it's magician-y, it's mysterious.

01:23.920 --> 01:28.880
So I asked the magic man in the magic counter what's inside the little black box.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.520
Maybe there's a folded up playing card or a coin or a prediction of something yet to

01:32.520 --> 01:33.520
happen.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.640
And do you know what's inside the little black box?

01:36.640 --> 01:37.640
Nothing, it's empty.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.560
I thought, oh well, never mind.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.800
I quite like the little black box, it's mysterious.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.760
I don't have a use for the red box.

01:46.780 --> 01:51.540
So the magic man behind the magic counter said, well, since it's false-tem, if you buy

01:51.540 --> 01:57.020
the little black box, you can have the little red box for free.

01:57.020 --> 01:58.020
So I thought, that's great.

01:58.020 --> 02:00.060
I know what I'll do with the little black box.

02:00.060 --> 02:03.820
I'll use it and store a folded up playing card or a coin or a prediction of something

02:03.820 --> 02:04.820
yet to happen.

02:04.820 --> 02:09.380
But for now, I'll put the little red box back inside the little black box and put it on

02:09.380 --> 02:11.380
my magic shelf for later.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.940
Now, that's my trick.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.700
I call it little red box.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.860
But is it really my trick?

02:26.860 --> 02:32.940
I mean, the whole idea of one box that is inside another box and the bigger box goes

02:32.940 --> 02:37.700
back inside the smaller box it came from, that wasn't me.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.940
That was, I think, Leber Friedler, who came up with the idea.

02:40.940 --> 02:46.740
He did it as a stage effect and he had big boxes on stage.

02:46.740 --> 02:51.600
This small version of the little red box, that was an Alibongo idea.

02:51.600 --> 02:55.800
And that box used to belong to Alibongo.

02:55.800 --> 03:00.080
So the pattern about the magic shop, sorry to spoil it.

03:00.080 --> 03:04.040
There is a magic shop in Brussels, but I didn't go there to get the little red box.

03:04.040 --> 03:07.560
I take it some of you twigged that that was all a lie, right?

03:07.560 --> 03:09.240
Yes.

03:09.240 --> 03:14.000
I wrote that, spent some time honing the words, thinking about what I wanted to say.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.740
Well, I can say that I wrote the words to that trick, but I didn't come up with the

03:19.740 --> 03:20.740
trick.

03:20.740 --> 03:21.740
So is it still mine?

03:21.740 --> 03:26.180
And this is one of the things we're going to look at over the next 20 minutes or so.

03:26.180 --> 03:30.380
So we'll start, we should probably start at least by sort of putting out our stall.

03:30.380 --> 03:31.380
What is magic?

03:31.380 --> 03:33.740
What are the parameters that I'm going to be going through today?

03:33.740 --> 03:35.740
Well, it's not magic, the gathering.

03:35.740 --> 03:37.340
No one's walking out yet, so good.

03:37.340 --> 03:39.380
We've got the right audience.

03:39.400 --> 03:43.960
Magic will say is something that maybe we don't understand, the most common question

03:43.960 --> 03:47.680
is, how did you do that?

03:47.680 --> 03:50.120
We like to think of it as entertaining.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.120
And we also consider the allied arts.

03:53.120 --> 04:00.440
So these are things like this chap, Harry Houdini, a scopologist, in what is his favorite

04:00.440 --> 04:03.560
picture of himself.

04:03.560 --> 04:04.560
Is that magic?

04:04.560 --> 04:06.520
I mean, it's entertaining.

04:06.540 --> 04:10.540
There's a process that goes on that you don't know about that the performer does.

04:10.540 --> 04:13.020
So there's that sort of thing.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.580
What about clairvoyance?

04:14.580 --> 04:15.780
Is that magic?

04:15.780 --> 04:16.780
Psychics?

04:16.780 --> 04:18.140
You don't know what's going on?

04:18.140 --> 04:19.140
They're doing something you don't know?

04:19.140 --> 04:24.820
I mean, it is said there are two types of psychic, the fraudulent and the delusional.

04:24.820 --> 04:27.500
But they can't.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.260
For me for this, I say no.

04:29.260 --> 04:33.820
I'm going to focus primarily on the magic magic things.

04:33.820 --> 04:35.980
The debate is open on this fella still.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.320
Uwe Geller, he's the one on the right.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.120
I consider him a magician.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.560
He doesn't.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.200
He thinks he's real.

04:46.200 --> 04:50.760
Hands up if you think he's real and bending the spoon with his mind.

04:50.760 --> 04:56.080
Yeah, he's a magician.

04:56.080 --> 04:59.200
So now we're going to say, now we know the type of magic that we're going to be looking

04:59.200 --> 05:00.200
at.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.440
Let's then start breaking it down.

05:02.440 --> 05:04.120
We start with the effect.

05:04.140 --> 05:06.340
What's the broad strokes of what roughly happens?

05:06.340 --> 05:09.060
What am I trying to convince you is actually going on?

05:09.060 --> 05:14.740
Am I trying to convince you something is appearing or disappearing or changing?

05:14.740 --> 05:19.660
They said there's only sort of seven different types of storylines that you can ever have.

05:19.660 --> 05:22.180
So maybe the same is true in magic.

05:22.180 --> 05:24.180
So what do you think is happening?

05:24.180 --> 05:27.340
That broad strokes, we have the presentation.

05:27.340 --> 05:31.060
What am I doing to convince you that effect is happening?

05:31.060 --> 05:32.300
And then the method.

05:32.320 --> 05:36.240
What is the thing that I'm really doing that you don't know about that makes the whole

05:36.240 --> 05:38.280
thing work?

05:38.280 --> 05:40.280
And the presentation can come in many, many shapes.

05:40.280 --> 05:46.280
And I'll show you just two very briefly.

05:46.280 --> 05:52.920
So there's a typical plot in magic called card to impossible location.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.720
You have a deck of playing cards.

05:54.720 --> 05:55.720
Someone will pick a card.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.120
It will get lost in the pack.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.520
And then miraculously the card is no longer in the pack, but it's over there.

06:01.740 --> 06:04.500
Or it's in my shoe or it's in the back of the room.

06:04.500 --> 06:08.660
Now there are so many variations of this card to impossible location.

06:08.660 --> 06:12.900
You can't possibly have all of them and try and claim a right on every single version.

06:12.900 --> 06:13.900
It's no different.

06:13.900 --> 06:19.420
If the card goes from here to that shoe to there, you can't claim it's a different trick.

06:19.420 --> 06:24.820
Magicians often say, well, if you change any two of these things, it's a new trick.

06:24.820 --> 06:30.220
So the effect, the broad strokes, as a public you generally don't care.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.400
The method, as the public, you should never know.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.600
So if I as a magician change the effect and the method to keep the presentation the same,

06:37.600 --> 06:39.760
I've got a brand new trick.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.240
But everyone else thinks it's exactly the same one as before.

06:43.240 --> 06:47.240
If Penn and Teller were doing this, take a card, lose it.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.120
Penn and Teller will make that card turn up in the fish guts of some fish that you pick

06:51.120 --> 06:52.120
randomly.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.680
They'll make it appear on a billboard.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.800
They'll do something gross quite frequently.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.720
But that's them.

06:58.740 --> 07:04.180
If I was doing a kids show, I might have something like this.

07:04.180 --> 07:08.580
I can say, OK, do you all want to pretend that you're seven years old?

07:08.580 --> 07:09.580
Yeah!

07:09.580 --> 07:12.580
Hello, everybody.

07:12.580 --> 07:13.860
Hey!

07:13.860 --> 07:17.100
My name is Billy Nomates and I'm here to do some magic.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.220
So we're going to start with a book.

07:18.220 --> 07:19.740
Can you see the book?

07:19.740 --> 07:20.980
Lots of blank paper.

07:20.980 --> 07:23.700
So anyone who can draw here, can you draw some?

07:23.700 --> 07:24.700
You can draw.

07:24.700 --> 07:25.700
You're going to draw on the book for me?

07:25.700 --> 07:26.700
Draw a picture.

07:26.700 --> 07:27.700
Draw a picture.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.440
And look, you've now got pictures in the book.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.440
Aren't you clever?

07:31.440 --> 07:33.440
You've drawn pictures.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.440
Now, oh, thank you.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.440
Now, who likes painting?

07:41.440 --> 07:43.040
We've got people who like to paint.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.040
You like to paint?

07:44.040 --> 07:45.040
What colors do you like?

07:45.040 --> 07:47.040
Do you like red?

07:47.040 --> 07:50.800
Take some red, take it out the end, throw it at the book.

07:50.800 --> 07:51.800
Who likes blue?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.200
Throw some blue at the book.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.200
Well done.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.200
Throw some yellow.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.200
Well done.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.200
Isn't it amazing?

07:57.200 --> 07:58.200
Woo-hoo!

08:02.200 --> 08:04.200
But you know what, boys and girls?

08:04.200 --> 08:07.200
When you stop applauding, the magic goes.

08:07.200 --> 08:11.200
And there really is no pictures and no colors in the book.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.200
Also available for weddings, christings and marvits.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.200
Now, that's a kid's presentation.

08:23.200 --> 08:27.200
If I was doing this for a group of sensible, grown-up people...

08:33.200 --> 08:35.200
I would present it in a completely different way.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.200
I certainly wouldn't take it seriously.

08:37.200 --> 08:41.200
I certainly don't think anyone here believes the book is magically changing.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.200
But I would have a presentation that would suit me somewhat better.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.200
I might say it would certainly be comedic,

08:48.200 --> 08:50.200
and it would be something along the lines of,

08:50.200 --> 08:52.200
I would like to say it to everybody.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.200
I would like to do something of mass hypnosis.

08:55.200 --> 08:59.200
Because at the moment, you can see I've got a book of blank pages.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.200
Now, I'm going to hypnotize this side of the audience to see images.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.200
Can you see images?

09:05.200 --> 09:07.200
That's because you've all been hypnotized.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.200
Can you see images?

09:09.200 --> 09:12.200
No, because you haven't been hypnotized yet.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.200
Let me hypnotize you over this side.

09:14.200 --> 09:16.200
You're now all hypnotized to see images.

09:16.200 --> 09:18.200
Can you see images?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.200
Can you see images?

09:20.200 --> 09:22.200
But can you see images?

09:22.200 --> 09:24.200
No.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.200
Okay, you're all now hypnotized.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
So you can see images,

09:29.200 --> 09:31.200
and I'm going to hypnotize you extra special,

09:31.200 --> 09:33.200
so now you can see colored images.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.200
Can you see colored images?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.200
Can you see colored images?

09:37.200 --> 09:39.200
Okay, now you're hypnotized.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.200
Now you can see colored images.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.200
And I better unhypnotize you all,

09:43.200 --> 09:45.200
otherwise you'll still think there were pictures,

09:45.200 --> 09:48.200
and in fact, we're just left with blank paper.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.200
It's exactly the same trick.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.200
APPLAUSE

09:54.200 --> 09:56.200
That's exactly the same trick, isn't it?

09:56.200 --> 09:58.200
I've just changed that presentation,

09:58.200 --> 10:00.200
yet it's completely different.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.200
So what are we actually going to be protecting here?

10:03.200 --> 10:06.200
So anyone remember this song by Steve,

10:06.200 --> 10:08.200
Shave of My Heart?

10:08.200 --> 10:11.200
It was really quite popular a number of years ago,

10:11.200 --> 10:13.200
and you know, good enough song.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.200
I'll read the words for those at the back.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.200
I know that the spades are swords of a soldier.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.200
I know that the clubs are weapons of war.

10:21.200 --> 10:24.200
I know that diamonds mean money for this art,

10:24.200 --> 10:27.200
but that's not the shape of my heart.

10:27.200 --> 10:29.200
The four suits of the playing card

10:29.200 --> 10:32.200
are in the first verse of the song.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.200
Do you not think that every single magician who heard that song

10:35.200 --> 10:38.200
is sitting there in their basement going,

10:38.200 --> 10:41.200
oh, I think there's a magic trick in this?

10:42.200 --> 10:44.200
And then we get to the second verse.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.200
He may play the jack of diamonds,

10:46.200 --> 10:48.200
he may lay the queen of spades.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.200
Do you think any of the magicians were not stupid enough

10:50.200 --> 10:52.200
to have realised there's a magic trick at this point?

10:52.200 --> 10:55.200
Have got a magic trick at this point?

10:55.200 --> 10:57.200
Of course they have.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.200
Every magician had that idea,

10:59.200 --> 11:01.200
and because it's independent of the invention,

11:01.200 --> 11:03.200
they both claim to it.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
But because it's exactly the same trick,

11:05.200 --> 11:07.200
cards suddenly appear,

11:07.200 --> 11:10.200
there were two magicians who were fighting each other

11:10.200 --> 11:14.200
almost physically about who had the rights to perform the trick.

11:14.200 --> 11:18.200
No one bothered to ask Sting's permission first.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.200
So let's head back.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.200
So when we talk about magic,

11:22.200 --> 11:24.200
are we looking at art?

11:24.200 --> 11:26.200
Is magic art?

11:26.200 --> 11:28.200
It can be.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.200
I don't think it's ever going to change anybody's viewpoint

11:30.200 --> 11:32.200
on the world, breathe life into the conversation

11:32.200 --> 11:34.200
about the human condition.

11:34.200 --> 11:37.200
But it's art, probably low art, but it's art.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.200
Is it science?

11:39.200 --> 11:41.200
So ultimately, there is a process going on,

11:41.200 --> 11:43.200
there's nothing mystical here,

11:43.200 --> 11:46.200
and in the case of real magic,

11:46.200 --> 11:48.200
it has to be science.

11:48.200 --> 11:52.200
It's something that TV producers, movie producers,

11:52.200 --> 11:54.200
always like to skirt over

11:54.200 --> 11:56.200
if they're doing this fantasy thing

11:56.200 --> 11:58.200
that has a magic element in it.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.200
They say, oh, magic exists in this world.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.200
Well, if magic is able to exist within that world,

12:02.200 --> 12:04.200
then those things happen in that world,

12:04.200 --> 12:06.200
therefore that is science.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.200
Maybe you don't know what the science is,

12:08.200 --> 12:11.200
but it's a scientific fact that that thing happens.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.200
They just haven't considered it.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.200
And when we say, is magic a business?

12:15.200 --> 12:17.200
Oh, absolutely it is.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.200
One of the biggest parts of magic is the business.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.200
People are creating magic tricks

12:21.200 --> 12:23.200
for the sole purpose of selling them,

12:23.200 --> 12:25.200
not for performing them.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.200
So I suppose we should get to the juicy bits about secrets, right?

12:30.200 --> 12:32.200
So the first secret is we don't call it secrets.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.200
There's no such thing as a secret.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.200
It is always a method, it's a process.

12:37.200 --> 12:39.200
Any one particular trick

12:39.200 --> 12:41.200
might use more than one secret,

12:41.200 --> 12:43.200
more than one method.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.200
Sometimes that method will be

12:45.200 --> 12:47.200
the sleight of hand that's being used.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.200
Sometimes the words themselves will be very specific

12:50.200 --> 12:52.200
to achieve a certain result.

12:52.200 --> 12:58.200
Sometimes these words might be almost inconsequential.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.200
You, as someone that's watching that,

13:00.200 --> 13:03.200
will not think that those words are chosen for a reason,

13:03.200 --> 13:05.200
but they actually were.

13:06.200 --> 13:10.200
So we don't refer to secrets, we refer to them as method.

13:10.200 --> 13:13.200
And there is a lot of method insert some routines.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.200
The second part of the secret is what I call the disconnect.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.200
There is a gap between what you know

13:20.200 --> 13:22.200
and when you actually know it.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.200
So I think most people will be aware

13:24.200 --> 13:26.200
that if I took a deck of playing cards

13:26.200 --> 13:29.200
and I started dealing out perfect hands of poker,

13:29.200 --> 13:32.200
you'd go, well, the cards are already stacked in an order

13:32.200 --> 13:34.200
that gives you perfect hands of poker.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.200
You know about stack cards,

13:37.200 --> 13:39.200
you know about bottom dealing

13:39.200 --> 13:42.200
and false shuffles that don't really shuffle the cards.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.200
But if you see a magician doing a card trick,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.200
you might not actually realize they're doing that

13:47.200 --> 13:50.200
if maybe you just forgotten or they did something

13:50.200 --> 13:53.200
that disconnected that moment.

13:54.200 --> 13:59.200
It's very, very common if you really start analyzing magic.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.200
You'll see there's often times,

14:01.200 --> 14:04.200
and if you know what's going to happen,

14:04.200 --> 14:07.200
I can spot when magicians move their hand in a particular way,

14:07.200 --> 14:09.200
I know what piece of slight of hand they're going to do.

14:09.200 --> 14:12.200
That's just part and parcel of being a magician.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.200
But if you do that and you don't know what's coming,

14:16.200 --> 14:18.200
you forget that it ever happened.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.200
So when you see the actual thing, it's like,

14:20.200 --> 14:22.200
yeah, I know there's stacked decks,

14:22.200 --> 14:24.200
but I thought they shuffled it.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.200
I thought the spectators shuffled it.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.200
And magicians will do this all the time.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.200
They will say, if I give you the deck of cards to shuffle,

14:31.200 --> 14:34.200
you shuffle the cards, it's probably legitimate shuffle.

14:34.200 --> 14:36.200
But if I shuffle the cards,

14:36.200 --> 14:39.200
and then I ask you to just maybe cut them,

14:39.200 --> 14:41.200
at the end of the trick, I will say,

14:41.200 --> 14:44.200
and you shuffle the cards, and you'll say, yes, you didn't,

14:44.200 --> 14:46.200
you cut the cards. I shuffled them.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.200
But I'm just rewriting the rules for you

14:48.200 --> 14:51.200
so you remember it in a different way.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.200
Magicians get stumped by this all the time.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.200
I've had people who have told me about magic tricks

14:56.200 --> 14:58.200
that I have done, which have been incredible.

14:58.200 --> 15:01.200
And I'm going, I can't do that magic trick.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.200
That's impossible.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.200
And it's because they've remembered it incorrectly.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.200
Also, there's a secret in the vocabulary that we use.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.200
Special words that only us know about,

15:12.200 --> 15:14.200
that we can talk about,

15:14.200 --> 15:18.200
IDs which stands for antiti, which is a...

15:18.200 --> 15:20.200
And then a magician will automatically know

15:20.200 --> 15:23.200
what I'm talking about without having to keep explaining everything.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.200
So now we know roughly what we're talking about.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.200
How do we protect all of this stuff?

15:27.200 --> 15:28.200
We could use copyright.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.200
Works for software?

15:30.200 --> 15:32.200
Mm-mm.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.200
Doesn't work.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.200
The effects...

15:35.200 --> 15:37.200
Now, you can't copyright the effect.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.200
There's not enough there.

15:39.200 --> 15:42.200
It is just saying something disappears.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.200
Could be...

15:43.200 --> 15:46.200
We've said this, so there's so many types of magic effect.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.200
There's seven different types of story.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.200
This is every type of magic effect.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.200
So we can't copyright that.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.200
There's nothing there to copyright.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.200
What about the presentation?

15:56.200 --> 15:58.200
We can copyright that presentation.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.200
Me talking about the little red box,

16:00.200 --> 16:02.200
that's a script.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.200
That's a piece of prose. That is copyrightable.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.200
I can do that.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.200
That's fine.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.200
And the method.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.200
Can't copyright the method.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.200
That method is just a list of instructions.

16:12.200 --> 16:16.200
And traditionally speaking, you can't actually copyright a list.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.200
You copyright the expression of that list.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.200
Recipes don't have copyright,

16:21.200 --> 16:23.200
but you can have copyright in recipe books

16:23.200 --> 16:25.200
because you're expressing the idea.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.200
You're creating a presentation for the recipe.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.200
Same would be true with our method.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.200
We can't use copyright.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.200
We could use patterns, right?

16:33.200 --> 16:35.200
I know software patterns are evil, yeah?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.200
Still roughly on that agreement.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.200
So can we patent the effect?

16:39.200 --> 16:41.200
No, it's not a patentable entity.

16:41.200 --> 16:43.200
There's nothing there.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.200
Do we patent the presentation?

16:45.200 --> 16:47.200
No, that's the thing that's handled by copyright.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.200
We've got that.

16:48.200 --> 16:50.200
Can we patent the method?

16:50.200 --> 16:52.200
Yes.

16:52.200 --> 16:55.200
If something is sufficiently advanced,

16:55.200 --> 16:58.200
a method can be protected by a patent.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.200
So you write down the method, you write out how it works,

17:01.200 --> 17:03.200
if it's inventive enough, you file it at the patent office,

17:03.200 --> 17:06.200
and you have a patent, and you've legally protected your trick

17:06.200 --> 17:08.200
from being used by anyone else.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.200
Anyone's got the problem with that?

17:10.200 --> 17:12.200
To protect the secret,

17:12.200 --> 17:16.200
you have to file it publicly where people can look at it.

17:16.200 --> 17:20.200
Yeah, problem.

17:20.200 --> 17:22.200
This is a patent.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.200
This is a patent for a magic trick.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.200
Anyone recognize which magic trick?

17:27.200 --> 17:30.200
No, because there's a disconnect.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.200
That pattern applies to this magic trick.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.200
David Copperfield's flying.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.200
I don't want to spoil it for you,

17:37.200 --> 17:40.200
but if you don't want to let the answer look away now,

17:40.200 --> 17:42.200
that's the pattern to look up

17:42.200 --> 17:45.200
if you want to learn how to fly like David Copperfield.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.200
It's a matter of public record.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.200
You can go and find it.

17:49.200 --> 17:52.200
I'm actually taking that number down.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.200
It was created by George Galvin.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.200
He patented it just so that he could claim it.

17:58.200 --> 18:01.200
We all know he's not really flying,

18:01.200 --> 18:04.200
but he protects it anyway.

18:04.200 --> 18:06.200
Could we use a license agreement?

18:06.200 --> 18:08.200
We have copyright in code,

18:08.200 --> 18:11.200
and we choose to put it under a particular license.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.200
We could license our magic.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.200
Well, could we?

18:15.200 --> 18:17.200
Could we license the effect?

18:17.200 --> 18:19.200
We're not doing the presentation.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.200
Certainly it's a copyright thing,

18:21.200 --> 18:24.200
so you can say, I allow you to perform this presentation.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.200
And the method?

18:26.200 --> 18:28.200
No.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.200
Again, it's not a license.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.200
Magic books, when they're sold in shops,

18:33.200 --> 18:35.200
specialist magic shops,

18:35.200 --> 18:37.200
they are sold like other specialist books

18:37.200 --> 18:39.200
in Clear Wrappers.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.200
So if you have a license in the book that says,

18:42.200 --> 18:44.200
you are only allowed to use these tricks

18:44.200 --> 18:46.200
for your own personal use,

18:46.200 --> 18:48.200
that's a fairly common thing to include.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.200
You have to buy the book, unwrap it,

18:51.200 --> 18:54.200
then see the license agreement you've already agreed to,

18:54.200 --> 18:56.200
even though you couldn't read it.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.200
Anyone say, end user license agreement?

18:59.200 --> 19:04.200
Has anyone ever found that they're actually a good thing?

19:04.200 --> 19:06.200
But they're in magic.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.200
We got them somehow. I don't know.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.200
So how do we actually protect all this stuff?

19:11.200 --> 19:14.200
Well, the simplest way is in doculus privata loci,

19:14.200 --> 19:16.200
because I believe it's pronounced in Latin.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.200
Do we actually have any Latin scholars in?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.200
Good, so no one's going to correct me on that one.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.200
And that just basically means, keep your mouth shut.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.200
If you don't tell anyone what your secret is,

19:26.200 --> 19:28.200
no one's going to find out. Great.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.200
We can protect it with money.

19:30.200 --> 19:33.200
Yep. If someone wants to know how the little red box tricks worked,

19:33.200 --> 19:36.200
pay me, and I'll tell you.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.200
Oscugation.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.200
We've mentioned about having a vocabulary in magic

19:40.200 --> 19:42.200
that the lay public don't know about.

19:42.200 --> 19:47.200
We can protect it through just hiding bits of things in plain sight, essentially.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.200
If you find magic forms online, they do exist,

19:50.200 --> 19:52.200
and they do talk about how these things work.

19:52.200 --> 19:56.200
They will have little initials and little stars removed from work,

19:56.200 --> 19:58.200
little stars inserted into words,

19:58.200 --> 20:03.200
so you can't tell what it is unless you already know.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.200
And ethics.

20:05.200 --> 20:08.200
Ethics is the thing that you do when no one else is watching.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.200
Business ethics is the optimal one.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.200
But that's because it's not a community.

20:12.200 --> 20:17.200
The ethics work in magic because you don't want to get kicked out of your magic club.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.200
You want to go...

20:18.200 --> 20:22.200
It's the only place in the entire world where you can get a bunch of weirdos in a room,

20:22.200 --> 20:24.200
and they all feel normal.

20:24.200 --> 20:28.200
Present company accepted, maybe.

20:28.200 --> 20:32.200
But we've got a little problem here.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.200
This is a magic trick.

20:34.200 --> 20:39.200
It's not a very good magic trick.

20:39.200 --> 20:42.200
It's $15.56.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.200
It makes things float.

20:44.200 --> 20:46.200
Map magician's like making things float.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.200
And this is a new device.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.200
It's obviously not a rip-off of something old.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
It says this new device.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.200
It contains no threads, no magnets, and no wires.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.200
See, you don't know what you're buying,

20:56.200 --> 20:58.200
but you do know you're not buying any threads.

20:58.200 --> 21:01.200
You know you're not buying magnets, and you know you're not buying wires.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.200
So here's another trick.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.200
This also makes things float.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.200
This is called self-vention.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.200
It makes a mobile phone float.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.200
And this one is also a new trick, and this uses no thread, no magnets,

21:11.200 --> 21:13.200
no clear plastic, no wires.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.200
Wait, hang on.

21:14.200 --> 21:18.200
This floating thing uses no threads, no magnets, and no wires.

21:18.200 --> 21:23.200
This floating thing uses no thread, no magnets, no clear plastic, and no wires.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.200
Anyone want to guess at how this works?

21:25.200 --> 21:32.200
That's an online magic shop.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.200
And what do all magic shops have?

21:35.200 --> 21:37.200
A forum where you can review things,

21:37.200 --> 21:39.200
and then someone will post,

21:39.200 --> 21:42.200
the main gimmick came misaligned and the gimmick cards that hold the magnet.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.200
Okay, so there was a magnet.

21:44.200 --> 21:47.200
Popped apart after just a few minutes.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.200
Easy to repair, but there we go.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.200
A normal random magician has just told everyone,

21:52.200 --> 21:54.200
by the way, magnet,

21:54.200 --> 21:57.200
we can't even protect them amongst ourselves.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.200
So how are we going to learn this stuff?

22:00.200 --> 22:02.200
Well, there's lots of ways we can learn it,

22:02.200 --> 22:04.200
and because I'm a magician,

22:04.200 --> 22:06.200
I am contractually obliged to do a card trick of some sort.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.200
So I got these cards, because...

22:09.200 --> 22:12.200
Can you see these at the back, hopefully?

22:12.200 --> 22:14.200
So that's kind of...

22:14.200 --> 22:15.200
I'll come out here.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.200
I do know some people.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.200
Find someone I don't know.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.200
I don't think I know anyone here.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.200
So could you take a few cards off of the top for me?

22:22.200 --> 22:24.200
Lift them all up as a block.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.200
Yeah, any number.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.200
Lift them all up as a block,

22:27.200 --> 22:29.200
turn them all upside down,

22:29.200 --> 22:32.200
and put them back on the top.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.200
Excellent.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.200
Now, who thinks we're in on this?

22:35.200 --> 22:37.200
Who thinks I came to him earlier and said,

22:37.200 --> 22:39.200
by the way, when I do the thing with the cut,

22:39.200 --> 22:40.200
you're not very trusting.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.200
I like you.

22:41.200 --> 22:42.200
Okay.

22:42.200 --> 22:46.200
I'd like you to take a nice big handful of cards off the top.

22:46.200 --> 22:48.200
So, you went to be earlier, right?

22:48.200 --> 22:50.200
Oh, yeah.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.200
Take a big handful.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.200
Actually, I thought I cut.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.200
Maybe we'd do it something.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.200
Big, big, big handful.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.200
Turn them all upside down and put them back on the top.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.200
Okay.

22:59.200 --> 23:02.200
Now, who thinks we're in on it as well?

23:02.200 --> 23:04.200
I think you're in the hoose.

23:04.200 --> 23:05.200
Yeah, we possibly are.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.200
Anyone?

23:06.200 --> 23:08.200
Do you think we're both in on it?

23:08.200 --> 23:09.200
Yeah, do you want to come up with me?

23:09.200 --> 23:10.200
Hold the cut.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.200
No, no.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.200
Do you want to come up with me?

23:12.200 --> 23:13.200
No.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.200
Who wants to come up to the front with me and hold these?

23:14.200 --> 23:15.200
Yes?

23:15.200 --> 23:16.200
Hold them.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.200
Don't let me.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.200
People think I palm these cards.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.200
I'm not.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.200
Bring them down to the front.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.200
Somebody might even give you a bit of a pause for that.

23:22.200 --> 23:27.200
Yeah, if you hold it for it.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.200
Okay.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.200
Come up to the face so we can see.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.200
So, you took some cards.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.200
Turn them over.

23:33.200 --> 23:34.200
You took some cards.

23:34.200 --> 23:38.200
So, somewhere these cards will go from face up to face down.

23:38.200 --> 23:39.200
Yes.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.200
Can we find out where that is?

23:40.200 --> 23:42.200
Can you move through the cards?

23:42.200 --> 23:45.200
Somewhere that we should see the first face down card.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.200
No, not that one.

23:47.200 --> 23:49.200
That's face up again.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.200
So, it's somewhere there.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.200
See, there's only cards stuck behind them.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.200
Okay, so it's this one.

23:53.200 --> 23:56.200
So, if you'd have picked a few cards more, we'd be this side.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.200
If you'd have picked a few cards less, we'd be this side.

23:58.200 --> 24:01.200
If you picked a few cards less, we'd be this side.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.200
If you picked a few cards more, we'd be that side.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.200
So, it's this one.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.200
So many ways this can go wrong.

24:07.200 --> 24:08.200
Could you take that one?

24:08.200 --> 24:12.200
If you take the card and hold it up to the audience and get ready,

24:12.200 --> 24:16.200
I've got my prediction here.

24:16.200 --> 24:19.200
Show everyone what it is and shout out in a nice loud voice.

24:19.200 --> 24:23.200
The name of the card is the Eight of Hearts.

24:23.200 --> 24:28.200
No, okay, so it's not.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.200
Oops.

24:30.200 --> 24:31.200
Hang on.

24:31.200 --> 24:35.200
Is it the Three of Hearts?

24:35.200 --> 24:37.200
No.

24:37.200 --> 24:39.200
Hang on, I know what I can do.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.200
The name of the card is a heart.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.200
Is that correct? Is it a heart?

24:44.200 --> 24:48.200
Okay.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.200
I don't need this anymore then.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.200
What is the card, by the way?

24:51.200 --> 24:52.200
The Ten of Hearts?

24:52.200 --> 24:54.200
Not the Eight of Hearts.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.200
Not the Three of Hearts.

24:56.200 --> 24:58.200
It's the Ten of Hearts.

24:58.200 --> 25:06.200
I don't need this then, do I?

25:06.200 --> 25:07.200
Thank you very much.

25:07.200 --> 25:13.200
Put the cards back on the table and we take a seat.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.200
There we go.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.200
Brand new magic thing.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.200
I learned that.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.200
I learned that from a book.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.200
I could have also learned it from a DVD or the internet

25:21.200 --> 25:22.200
or from lecture notes.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.200
I could have learned that from anywhere,

25:24.200 --> 25:27.200
but I happen to learn it from a book.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.200
What about the copyright?

25:28.200 --> 25:29.200
It's a book.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.200
It still has a copyright.

25:31.200 --> 25:36.200
That particular thing was done by this guy, Ted Anaman.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.200
If you're googling on your web pages right now,

25:39.200 --> 25:41.200
you can find books by Ted Anaman.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.200
I'm not telling you which book by Ted Anaman.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.200
You've got to spend the time and effort finding it.

25:47.200 --> 25:51.200
I can tell you that I've read his book and that comes from his book.

25:51.200 --> 25:55.200
Instead of a dry erase board, he used chalk on a chalkboard.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.200
The difference between the permanent marker and the dry erase marker,

25:58.200 --> 26:00.200
he used paint and chalk.

26:00.200 --> 26:03.200
Who else reads Ted Anaman's books?

26:03.200 --> 26:04.200
That guy.

26:04.200 --> 26:09.200
Derren Brown and myself, the right resident, James Merlin,

26:09.200 --> 26:13.200
have both learned these cyber things from these books.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.200
Incredible.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.200
And yes, there's a copyright,

26:16.200 --> 26:19.200
but Ted Anaman died about 80 or years ago.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.200
So even if you say, well, I'm going to buy the book,

26:22.200 --> 26:24.200
I'm still out of copyright now,

26:24.200 --> 26:27.200
you could quite literally just copy it freely.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.200
But it doesn't matter,

26:29.200 --> 26:31.200
even though that secret could well be out there,

26:31.200 --> 26:34.200
could just be disseminated by anyone for free,

26:34.200 --> 26:38.200
it's a 100-year-old trick and it still gets a round of applause.

26:38.200 --> 26:42.200
So does it really matter if the trick is known?

26:42.200 --> 26:44.200
So how are we going to go on about sharing it?

26:44.200 --> 26:47.200
Well, all of the aforementioned things.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.200
We have our own little number of patrol that we use,

26:49.200 --> 26:51.200
our nice little words and phrases,

26:51.200 --> 26:53.200
that everyone has in every field of endeavor,

26:53.200 --> 26:57.200
every person has got their own private in-jokes,

26:57.200 --> 27:00.200
every industry has got their own special jargon.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.200
Magicians have it too.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.200
We have the names of gaffed and gimmicked decks.

27:05.200 --> 27:07.200
Everything's got a name for some reason.

27:07.200 --> 27:10.200
Again, I'm not telling which book that trick comes from,

27:10.200 --> 27:13.200
but you try searching for that.

27:13.200 --> 27:16.200
What are you going to type into Google?

27:16.200 --> 27:20.200
Trick with a tenor heart that gets wiped out on a board.

27:20.200 --> 27:23.200
That's not going to come up with any search results.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.200
Unless you know the name of that trick,

27:25.200 --> 27:28.200
you can't actually search for it.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.200
There's no way of just gripping it.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.200
I can't remember the name of the trick.

27:32.200 --> 27:35.200
I've been doing that for 20 years now.

27:35.200 --> 27:37.200
I can't remember what it's called.

27:37.200 --> 27:41.200
I can barely remember how to do it.

27:41.200 --> 27:44.200
So the naming of things throughout,

27:44.200 --> 27:46.200
the naming of slights, for example,

27:46.200 --> 27:48.200
some people, if they've got a slight

27:48.200 --> 27:50.200
or something with their hands,

27:50.200 --> 27:52.200
it will have a name, often named after the person

27:52.200 --> 27:54.200
who came up with it.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.200
Fine, name things after yourself if you want.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.200
It doesn't make you egocentric at all.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.200
But if you know the name of that slight,

28:00.200 --> 28:03.200
you can look it up, you can find out how to do it,

28:03.200 --> 28:06.200
and you'll probably find YouTube videos explaining it,

28:06.200 --> 28:08.200
usually by some 12-year-old kid

28:08.200 --> 28:10.200
who's doing it better than I can

28:10.200 --> 28:13.200
because they've actually got time to do this stuff.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.200
We also do this by tipping the methods.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.200
Magicians are like computer games

28:18.200 --> 28:20.200
in as much as they have levels.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.200
If you don't have enough health points,

28:22.200 --> 28:24.200
you can't get through to the next bit of the game.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.200
If you don't have enough experience in this part of the game,

28:26.200 --> 28:28.200
you can't do the next bit.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.200
The game locks you out of content if you're not good enough.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.200
Magicians will lock out other magicians

28:32.200 --> 28:34.200
if they don't think they're good enough.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.200
The mechanics of some of these things are very, very simple.

28:37.200 --> 28:41.200
I'll show you that and I can talk you through it.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.200
Yeah, great.

28:43.200 --> 28:45.200
But it's more than just doing a set of steps.

28:45.200 --> 28:48.200
It's about knowing how you're doing them, why you're doing them.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.200
Funnily enough, there is a certain level of skill

28:50.200 --> 28:53.200
in standing up in front of a load of people doing this stuff.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.200
How do you teach that?

28:55.200 --> 28:57.200
Is that actually learnable?

28:57.200 --> 28:59.200
And if I don't think you're good enough

28:59.200 --> 29:01.200
to put a good version of that trick on display,

29:01.200 --> 29:03.200
I won't teach you what you need to know.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.200
I'll wait until you are good enough to be able to do it.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.200
And all magicians are like that. It sounds very cruel, but we do.

29:09.200 --> 29:14.200
Just that little hook into the secret, the method.

29:14.200 --> 29:18.200
Just like a foothold. Just enough to get you started.

29:18.200 --> 29:22.200
So we say it's the end, but it's not quite.

29:22.200 --> 29:26.200
No one has put up a board yet, so I've got time for one last thing.

29:26.200 --> 29:30.200
Some of you may have seen this, which I put on the table earlier.

29:30.200 --> 29:34.200
So you see here we have a series of, they're called Xena symbols.

29:34.200 --> 29:38.200
They're created by Professor J.B. Rine, Duke University.

29:38.200 --> 29:42.200
And these symbols have nothing special about them.

29:42.200 --> 29:47.200
Actually, I could be asking you to just look around them,

29:47.200 --> 29:50.200
model them up or something.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.200
But make sure that there are five cards there,

29:53.200 --> 29:55.200
and the symbols on each of them are different.

29:55.200 --> 29:58.200
I'll come over to this side, because these are the same,

29:58.200 --> 30:00.200
these are the ESP symbols.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.200
And on this side we have numbers.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.200
Numbers were not invented at Duke University.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.200
They are quite a bit older than that.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.200
Would you actually ask you to mix up this?

30:08.200 --> 30:10.200
How many cards have you got there? Three?

30:10.200 --> 30:12.200
Mix up those other two as well.

30:12.200 --> 30:14.200
Count them, make sure there are five of them,

30:14.200 --> 30:17.200
and make sure all five symbols are different.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.200
I'm going to come back to you.

30:19.200 --> 30:22.200
I've got to get my steps in today.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.200
Can I have those for a moment?

30:24.200 --> 30:26.200
You're happier or different than that?

30:26.200 --> 30:28.200
I'm going to put these here, and you're going to watch me,

30:28.200 --> 30:31.200
and you're going to make sure I don't palm these out for other cards.

30:31.200 --> 30:34.200
So I'm going to put one there.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.200
One there.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.200
One here.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.200
One there.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.200
And one there.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.200
Okay, I'm not completely sure.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.200
But those are the cards that you check, they're not...

30:49.200 --> 30:52.200
So over this side,

30:52.200 --> 30:55.200
you have five cards, and they're all different.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.200
Okay, would you give me the first one?

30:58.200 --> 31:02.200
And would you like this to go in, sort of, number one, two, three, four, or five?

31:02.200 --> 31:04.200
You've got five choices. Where would you like?

31:04.200 --> 31:06.200
Number three?

31:07.200 --> 31:09.200
Exactly right. Good.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.200
Next one. Where would you like to go?

31:11.200 --> 31:15.200
You've got anything from one, two, three, or four?

31:15.200 --> 31:17.200
Four.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.200
Okay, have another one.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.200
Actually, let's try reading someone else.

31:21.200 --> 31:23.200
Can you give me a number? We've got one, two, or five left.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.200
What would you like?

31:25.200 --> 31:27.200
Five.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.200
And two more left.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.200
Let me try and mind read someone right at the back.

31:34.200 --> 31:36.200
Yes?

31:36.200 --> 31:38.200
One.

31:38.200 --> 31:42.200
So, can we finally have someone who's very bad at making decisions?

31:46.200 --> 31:48.200
Exactly.

31:48.200 --> 31:52.200
Now, I say I don't do mind reading, and that's kind of true.

31:52.200 --> 31:55.200
I do what we do as programmers.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.200
The easiest way to read someone's mind

31:57.200 --> 32:00.200
is to put the idea in there in the first place.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.200
So when I say there's a free slot,

32:02.200 --> 32:05.200
I'm not actually saying there's a free slot, I'm saying it's a free slot.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.200
What did you say first?

32:07.200 --> 32:09.200
Of course you did.

32:09.200 --> 32:11.200
And the same for the other ones.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.200
When you said four, I double-tapped the card onto four.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.200
Who spotted the two I got wrong?

32:16.200 --> 32:20.200
Two of these are on the wrong way, so I need to swap two of these over.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.200
Who hasn't had a chance to shout out anything yet?

32:22.200 --> 32:25.200
Once I shout out which two of these I need to swap?

32:25.200 --> 32:28.200
I see a random number.

32:28.200 --> 32:30.200
Which one do you want to go?

32:30.200 --> 32:32.200
If I choose one, then obviously it's going to look fake.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.200
So what ones do you want?

32:34.200 --> 32:36.200
Three and one. Are you sure you're happy with that?

32:36.200 --> 32:39.200
Is everyone happy he's not a stooge, and I haven't stoogeed them and them and everyone?

32:39.200 --> 32:42.200
Three and one. So that's number one, and that's number three.

32:48.200 --> 32:51.200
Now, some of you are probably good enough at maths

32:51.200 --> 32:54.200
to work out this could happen by chance.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.200
There's a five in one that these are going to match.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.200
Which means there's a four in one that these will match.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.200
So that's five times four, that's 20.

33:03.200 --> 33:05.200
There's a three in one that these are going to match.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.200
So that's five times four times three.

33:07.200 --> 33:10.200
There's a two in one, so that's five times four times three.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.200
So that's 120.

33:12.200 --> 33:16.200
There are 120 possibilities for this, and that's just by chance.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.200
That's just pure luck.

33:18.200 --> 33:22.200
But 120 on one chance.

33:22.200 --> 33:26.200
I've done this trick 119 times so far.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.200
So I'm really lucky this is full-stem.

33:29.200 --> 33:33.200
So here we have two circles, two stars, two pluses, two wavy lines, and two squares.

33:41.200 --> 33:45.200
Now, I said I don't do mind reading, well I do mind writing.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.200
I put the ideas in your head.

33:47.200 --> 33:51.200
Who saw what I was doing to put those ideas in?

33:51.200 --> 33:53.200
I mean, where did we end?

33:53.200 --> 33:56.200
We ended up on chapter five, right? How did chapter five start?

33:57.200 --> 34:00.200
Here, we talked about sharing the magic. Let me stand this up.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.200
What's the very first symbol on chapter five?

34:04.200 --> 34:08.200
The symbol next to the word chapter five, the symbol next to five, and the symbol at the very end.

34:08.200 --> 34:11.200
Five is square.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.200
Who remembers chapter four?

34:13.200 --> 34:18.200
When we have the title of chapter four, what's the symbol of the beginning, middle, and end?

34:18.200 --> 34:20.200
What's the fourth symbol?

34:20.200 --> 34:23.200
Chapter three. Who remembers chapter three?

34:23.200 --> 34:27.200
The fourth symbol is around the title on chapter three.

34:27.200 --> 34:29.200
There were a lot of slides.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.200
It's a plus. What's in the third place? It's a plus.

34:31.200 --> 34:34.200
You've been looking at these slides for the last half an hour.

34:34.200 --> 34:36.200
How are you not going to pick that?

34:36.200 --> 34:38.200
You're always going to pick the plus for number three.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.200
What about number two?

34:40.200 --> 34:42.200
There's a star. Chapter two, star, star, star, star.

34:42.200 --> 34:45.200
And finally, chapter one, what is magic?

34:45.200 --> 34:51.200
Well, it's having a circle, a plus, a star, a plus, or wavy lines.

34:51.200 --> 34:54.200
All because of that. What is magic? This is my name is James Merlin.

34:54.200 --> 34:56.200
Thank you. Good night.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.200
If there was time for questions, I can take questions.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.200
Forgotten.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.200
Thank you.
