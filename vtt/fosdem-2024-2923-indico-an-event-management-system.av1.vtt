WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.360
Okay. Thank you very much.

00:10.360 --> 00:13.720
Yeah. Hi everyone. I'm really happy to be here.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.040
I'm Pedro Freira.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.760
I'm a software engineer at CERN.

00:17.760 --> 00:24.040
I'll be talking to you about Indico together with Dom.

00:24.040 --> 00:27.080
He's going to do the second half of presentation.

00:27.080 --> 00:29.480
First of all, it's a pleasure to be here.

00:29.480 --> 00:34.880
It's our first time at FOSDEM and it's really nice to see such interest.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.080
Thank you.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.960
So, yeah. As the title of the talk says,

00:40.960 --> 00:42.160
we'll be talking about Indico.

00:42.160 --> 00:46.080
It's an event management system as you may have realized by now.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.840
Well, all of the things that are being presented here today,

00:53.840 --> 00:58.040
collaborative effort and open source project and the MIT license,

00:58.080 --> 01:01.560
it's developed at CERN mainly with

01:01.560 --> 01:05.640
contributions from the United Nations and the Max Planck Institute for Physics.

01:05.640 --> 01:11.360
It counts with contributions from more than 70 developers

01:11.360 --> 01:15.120
over the last more or less 20 years.

01:15.680 --> 01:23.440
So, Indico is probably the most popular event management system you have never heard about.

01:23.440 --> 01:32.120
There's something like 300 servers around the world most belonging to educational,

01:32.120 --> 01:39.360
research, scientific institutions serving more than 350,000 users.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.720
So, it's a tool that you,

01:41.720 --> 01:46.920
yeah, as I said, it started out in the research world.

01:46.920 --> 01:51.280
Since, as you know, CERN is a research laboratory,

01:51.280 --> 01:56.640
but then kind of spread out to different environments and there are,

01:56.640 --> 02:04.720
yeah, a few examples of organizations from different domains that are already using it.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.600
So, a little bit of history starting in 1999,

02:08.600 --> 02:11.840
the physicists working at the Large Hadron Collider,

02:11.840 --> 02:14.680
which back then still didn't exist.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.920
They were still sort of projecting it, building it.

02:17.920 --> 02:23.280
They needed some sort of application which they could use to manage their meetings.

02:23.280 --> 02:28.480
So, what would normally happen is that you'd have a meeting,

02:28.480 --> 02:31.040
you'd exchange a few emails with their slides and so on,

02:31.040 --> 02:38.200
and then this would get kind of lost at some point because it'd be kind of spread around

02:38.200 --> 02:42.320
a few mailbox of different people and disks and so on.

02:42.320 --> 02:46.640
So, they wanted to have an application which they could use as

02:46.640 --> 02:52.400
like a focal point for this sort of event and as kind of an archival platform as well.

02:52.400 --> 02:57.040
So, this was the first attempt that it was a CDS agenda back then.

02:57.040 --> 03:02.160
Then in 2002, the opportunity came up with a European project which was focused on

03:02.160 --> 03:04.520
having a conferencing platform.

03:04.520 --> 03:11.680
So, they kind of put the two ideas together and then that's when Indica was born.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.000
It went into production in 2004.

03:15.040 --> 03:19.320
In 2007, we've added a room booking system to it.

03:19.320 --> 03:23.720
Then in 2008, a full interface overhaul.

03:23.720 --> 03:32.920
Then 2013, first workshop, word of mouth starts spreading and in 2015,

03:32.920 --> 03:40.720
the United Nations adopted it and we started a really nice fruitful collaboration which goes on to this day.

03:41.160 --> 03:45.640
2017, we did a full rewrite of the application.

03:45.640 --> 03:50.160
We were working on an aging software stack.

03:50.160 --> 03:54.480
We changed even database system, moved to Postgres.

03:54.480 --> 04:02.680
So, that was 2017 and 2021, then we moved to Python 3 within the code 3.0.

04:02.680 --> 04:08.960
2023, last year we surpassed 1 million events only at CERN and 2024.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.600
So, this year we celebrate our 20th anniversary.

04:15.920 --> 04:25.600
So, you may have heard about CERN, the big tunnel which we have underground, the LHC.

04:25.600 --> 04:29.200
You probably heard about the detectors and all the things that go,

04:29.200 --> 04:34.120
you know, that happen 100 and so meters underground.

04:34.200 --> 04:39.360
But a less known facet of the organization,

04:39.360 --> 04:42.440
well, maybe not for you because you're all tech people,

04:42.440 --> 04:47.640
is that the World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at the organization back then,

04:47.640 --> 04:50.560
in the late 80s, early 90s.

04:52.080 --> 04:58.400
And CERN is actually producing a lot of open source,

04:58.400 --> 05:05.280
also using it but really producing a net contributor to society when it comes to open source production.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.480
So, open science is really at the core of our mission.

05:08.480 --> 05:13.480
And we have a series of software products which, you know, to this day,

05:13.480 --> 05:16.920
I use around the world and which are developed mostly in the organization

05:16.920 --> 05:19.760
and then with collaboration of several labs.

05:19.760 --> 05:26.360
So, that's Invinio, Zenodo, there's also Roo, White Rabbit, a few other things.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.760
There's also the CERN Open Hardware License which,

05:29.760 --> 05:38.360
which, yeah, goes on to show how the laboratory was a bit of a pioneer in this whole open hardware movement.

05:38.360 --> 05:43.680
And like last year, we also set up our own open source program office.

05:43.680 --> 05:47.680
And yeah, as I said, we're also using a lot of open source software.

05:47.680 --> 05:55.440
Many of these projects are represented today here in the stands.

05:55.480 --> 06:01.800
So, yeah, thanks everyone also for your help.

06:01.800 --> 06:07.920
A little bit of publicity, there are three other talks from CERN in this conference.

06:07.920 --> 06:13.040
So, if you're interested in, you know, storage or research management with InvinioRDM,

06:13.040 --> 06:16.560
you guys are invited to pop by.

06:18.240 --> 06:22.440
So, yeah, coming back to CERN, we have around 17,000 people on campus at any time,

06:22.440 --> 06:30.960
around 230 meeting rooms, organizing more than 100,000 events a year between meetings, lectures, conferences, all sort of stuff.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.920
And many of these meetings are highly distributed.

06:32.920 --> 06:39.560
So, yeah, when you come up with Indico, the objective was actually to solve this problem.

06:39.560 --> 06:46.080
How do we get, you know, super big collaborations of thousands of physicists to work together in a distributed environment?

06:46.080 --> 06:55.440
And, you know, how do we conciliate that with the organizations also, physical presence?

06:55.440 --> 06:57.120
So, this is, yeah, this is a science gateway.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.840
It's a pretty recent addition to the laboratory.

06:59.840 --> 07:09.560
It's a super fancy project by the same architect who was responsible for the George Pompidou Center in Paris.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.760
But, yeah, just a disclaimer, we don't work in this building.

07:11.760 --> 07:17.080
We obviously work in the Brutalist buildings back there, where is the IT department.

07:17.080 --> 07:21.280
So, but, yeah, it's, you should really visit it.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.960
It's a really nice place.

07:25.640 --> 07:34.960
So, at CERN, Indico became quite popular very quickly.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.680
We've been growing year after year.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.480
This is the number of new events per year.

07:38.480 --> 07:43.400
So, we still kind of accelerating.

07:43.400 --> 07:53.880
And these are just examples of a few events, a few meetings, conferences that we currently hosting at CERN's Indico server.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.760
There are basically two types of events.

07:55.760 --> 08:05.600
There's the conferences, which are a sort of, you know, the more traditional workflow where you have a call for abstracts, paper reviewing.

08:05.600 --> 08:15.120
You have workflows which allow people then to interact, do the, you know, the reviewing of papers, refereeing and so on.

08:15.120 --> 08:23.920
And then there's the meetings, which are more, a bit of a simplified view in which you can upload, you know, your slides and share it with other people.

08:23.920 --> 08:28.080
And you have a common shared schedule.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.680
And now, I'll switch over to Dom.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.400
All right.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.200
People call me Dominic or Dom.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.240
I don't really care.

08:36.240 --> 08:39.000
So, this is Room Booking.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.680
It's a module which is part of Indico.

08:42.680 --> 08:50.240
As you can see by this nice screenshot, you've got the leaflet-based map on the right, which shows you rooms.

08:50.240 --> 08:55.040
On the left, you've got a timeline of, you know, the rooms which have been booked.

08:55.040 --> 08:59.040
Very, very, very simple stuff.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.560
But it's not just that.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.440
So, we're going to go into the technical aspects of Indico.

09:05.440 --> 09:07.920
So, at its core, it's a very, very general purpose.

09:07.920 --> 09:24.920
So, just because we use it at CERN to handle our conferences and meetings and also everything else, is very, very, it's not set in stone with, you know, what you can use it for.

09:24.920 --> 09:30.920
It's, you can use it for almost anything, pretty much, while in that realm anyway.

09:31.680 --> 09:35.920
You can also go through plugins as well.

09:35.920 --> 09:43.920
And also, you can customize it with, you know, standard CSS or what have you.

09:43.920 --> 09:51.640
So, under the hood, yes, it is a Python application, specifically a Flask-based.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.840
So, that handles our back-end.

09:54.840 --> 10:00.320
For the database, Postgres SQL, I believe they have a booth here.

10:00.320 --> 10:08.080
Then we have other stuff as well, such as a Celery, which is handling our tasks as well.

10:08.080 --> 10:12.680
And SQL Alchemy, which is essentially the ORM for Postgres.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.680
Again, that is a Python-based.

10:15.680 --> 10:19.840
And also, that's for the UI, well, the front-end, we could say.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.960
And a semantic UI, which is just the styling of this.

10:22.960 --> 10:27.840
And we've got a lot more services on top.

10:27.880 --> 10:34.360
Okay, so, as I said, plugins, extensions, so yes, Indico has them.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.640
You might be interested.

10:36.640 --> 10:39.720
So, yeah, these are just a couple of our plugins.

10:39.720 --> 10:42.880
I'll get into a lot more.

10:42.880 --> 10:50.040
But yeah, video conferencing payments, conversions to PDF, search via Alasah search,

10:50.040 --> 10:54.520
storage and URL shortening and, you know, a lot more stuff, which we can,

10:54.560 --> 10:58.560
which Indico handles under the hoods for CERN.

10:58.560 --> 11:09.560
So, for example, we've got a nice one-click Zoom join plugin here, as you can see there.

11:11.560 --> 11:17.560
Payments, so yes, CERN does handle payments for the conferences.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.560
Apologies.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.600
Apologies.

11:19.600 --> 11:25.600
So, CERN does handle payments for the conferences via its own plugin.

11:25.600 --> 11:30.600
So, you can see there, we can handle payments via the post-finance plugin,

11:30.600 --> 11:34.600
but also for people running their own instances.

11:34.600 --> 11:40.600
There is a third-party integration out there for collecting payments via Stripe.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.600
And a PayPal also.

11:44.640 --> 11:45.640
Workflows.

11:45.640 --> 11:49.640
So, when you come to CERN, you probably might go to a conference.

11:49.640 --> 11:58.640
So, we have our own internal workflow for handling your access and other stuff as well.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.640
That relates to it.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.640
And also, yeah, this is a bit more into the access.

12:04.640 --> 12:10.640
So, yes, Indico can also handle printing of your badges and also actually your access

12:10.640 --> 12:13.640
onto the site.

12:14.640 --> 12:15.640
Recording of events.

12:15.640 --> 12:22.640
Again, this goes back into a little bit of Zoom, but also Indico handles the entire life cycle.

12:22.640 --> 12:24.640
Conference and events.

12:24.640 --> 12:28.640
So, yeah, so here's just a quick screenshot so you can record an event.

12:28.640 --> 12:37.640
And on our side at CERN, the event will go to our CDS archive.

12:37.640 --> 12:42.640
So, it can be played back on the maintenance, you know, and that is the archive for our events.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.640
Okay, so you probably saw a little bit about room booking.

12:48.640 --> 12:53.640
This is our internal spinoff called a bureau tail.

12:53.640 --> 13:00.640
So, room booking, as it says on the tin, it's for rooms, bureau tail, bureau, it's for desks.

13:00.640 --> 13:09.640
So, at CERN, we do provide a modified version of Indico, which only has this specific module,

13:09.640 --> 13:13.640
which has been modified, and that is via a plugin.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.640
Again, going back to what I said earlier, you can also customize it.

13:19.640 --> 13:27.640
So, here is my screenshot of the International Linear Collider Indico instance, which is hosted at CERN.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.640
And, yeah, so nice and feel.

13:32.640 --> 13:35.640
And it's not just, you know, the front page.

13:35.640 --> 13:40.640
You can also customize your meetings with the same CSS rules.

13:42.640 --> 13:46.640
And also one more of the conference for Higgs 2020.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.640
Now, one last thing.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.640
We have a nice checking application.

13:54.640 --> 13:58.640
So, previously this was a React native application,

13:58.640 --> 14:09.640
but I think around last year we rewrote it from scratch to act as a, well, to be a PWA, a progressive web application.

14:09.640 --> 14:19.640
So, basically it's like in any other conference, you might have someone at a door scanning your badges, scanning your tickets, what have you.

14:19.640 --> 14:25.640
So, just an application where you can use your smartphone.

14:26.640 --> 14:33.640
And then, yeah, it gives you the all the functionality that you would expect from a badge scanner, so a QR code reader.

14:33.640 --> 14:38.640
And also lets you bring up details of who's attending.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.640
You can check them in.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.640
And also, you know, other bits and pieces on top.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.640
Okay.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.640
One last thing, I guess.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.640
So, it's a very accessible event management system.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.640
It's open source and we have a pretty nice and thriving community.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.640
So, it's a screenshot of our forums.

15:01.640 --> 15:03.640
You know where everyone is welcome.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.640
And, yeah, so, I guess you have any questions.

15:10.640 --> 15:14.640
I'll be sure to follow us as a shout out, I guess.

15:14.640 --> 15:16.640
But, yeah, that's all.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.640
Thank you.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.640
Thank you.

15:33.640 --> 15:37.640
I was wondering if you also had some kind of back end for budgeting.

15:37.640 --> 15:47.640
Like, when I organize a conference, I want to make sure that all the money that we receive from the thing then pays out for the Dora sun and things that I'm going to spend for the conference.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.640
So, should we repeat the question, right?

15:50.640 --> 15:56.640
Yeah, so the question is whether we have some sort of back end for budgeting to kind of budget different aspects of the conference.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.640
And the answer is no.

15:58.640 --> 16:07.640
I mean, you have customizable registration form where you can kind of assign prices to items.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.640
I don't know if that's what you need.

16:09.640 --> 16:16.640
Then, yeah, in terms of them doing, you know, financial data analysis and so on, then we don't have anything like that.

16:16.640 --> 16:22.640
But, yeah, but you can extract everything basically to Excel and do that stuff on a spreadsheet or, yeah.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.640
Okay.

16:23.640 --> 16:36.640
The question, I think there is some space for integration with the Giante de Nuit or GCNit or Viglovap for conferencing.

16:36.640 --> 16:44.640
And is there a way to manage Wi-Fi every password distribution for participants?

16:44.640 --> 16:45.640
You...

16:45.640 --> 16:48.640
The tokens discount for social events in the night.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.640
Repeat the question.

16:49.640 --> 16:50.640
Can you repeat the question?

16:50.640 --> 16:51.640
Yeah.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.640
Yeah, yeah, you have to repeat the question.

16:55.640 --> 17:01.640
Well, yeah, so the question is if there is some sort of way to distribute Wi-Fi passwords to participants.

17:01.640 --> 17:02.640
That's it?

17:02.640 --> 17:03.640
Yeah.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.640
Wi-Fi passwords or tokens for social events?

17:06.640 --> 17:10.640
Not built-in, but you could probably implement it through a plugin, right?

17:10.640 --> 17:11.640
That could be...

17:11.640 --> 17:14.640
I mean, this will function as it would be plugin-based.

17:14.640 --> 17:19.640
So, yeah, you probably would have to write something yourself or probably hire someone to write it.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.640
Sorry?

17:21.640 --> 17:26.640
Made it not for tokens and not for Wi-Fi passwords.

17:26.640 --> 17:27.640
You have to do plugins.

17:27.640 --> 17:30.640
Yeah, no, there's nothing built-in for that, no.

17:32.640 --> 17:33.640
Yes.

17:33.640 --> 17:34.640
Is there...

17:36.640 --> 17:45.640
Is there a time of the attendance registered for participants?

17:45.640 --> 17:51.640
So, the question is whether the time of attendance per participant is registered.

17:51.640 --> 17:55.640
Well, not the attendance because I think we don't have any mechanism.

17:55.640 --> 17:59.640
Actually, if we have people say, you know, I'm attending Nali's talk and so on.

17:59.640 --> 18:06.640
But we have the checking time, yeah, that the app that Dom presented before, that one, yeah,

18:06.640 --> 18:13.640
if you check a person in, the time is registered and you have like a log of who checked in at the event.

18:13.640 --> 18:18.640
But that's more for kind of the reception part of the event, like to give maybe the...

18:18.640 --> 18:20.640
There is more to check out or only check in?

18:20.640 --> 18:21.640
Only check in, yeah.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.640
So, it's like Hotel California, if you want to...

18:27.640 --> 18:28.640
Yes.

18:28.640 --> 18:34.640
Are there plans to have like a progressive web app for participants or partners, not for the organizers,

18:34.640 --> 18:39.640
for example, to schedule what is happening with these...

18:41.640 --> 18:48.640
So, the question is whether there are plans for a PWA which targets the participant's side of the event,

18:48.640 --> 18:50.640
not so much the organization like here.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.640
The answer is yes.

18:53.640 --> 18:57.640
We are planning on getting started still this year.

18:57.640 --> 19:06.640
There are some funding issues to be addressed, as you guys probably know very well, is often the case.

19:06.640 --> 19:10.640
But yeah, it's on the plan for this year.

19:12.640 --> 19:13.640
Yes.

19:13.640 --> 19:17.640
What priority has accessibility in the UI as you showed?

19:17.640 --> 19:18.640
It's a very good question.

19:18.640 --> 19:26.640
So, in terms of accessibility in the UI, currently in the code...

19:27.640 --> 19:34.640
It is currently going through a phase where we have in collaboration with the UN.

19:34.640 --> 19:35.640
There's basically a...

19:35.640 --> 19:36.640
We have...

19:36.640 --> 19:43.640
The UN has hired a developer to contribute back to Indico, some improvements to the accessibility.

19:43.640 --> 19:44.640
And that's about it.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.640
So, it is a thing which is, you know, it's a work in progress at the moment.

19:47.640 --> 19:51.640
And there are some features out there already, which are going to be released soon,

19:51.640 --> 19:54.640
or they're already available in mind of releases.

19:55.640 --> 19:56.640
It's already...

19:56.640 --> 20:02.640
Many of those have already been merged into our main branch and will be included in the next release.

20:02.640 --> 20:09.640
But yeah, there's a lot of work which is currently being done in making sure that we pass the WCAG.

20:09.640 --> 20:10.640
Yeah.

20:12.640 --> 20:13.640
Yes.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.640
What's about developer documentation?

20:16.640 --> 20:21.640
Is it well-documented so people can easily access and contribute to the project?

20:21.640 --> 20:23.640
Or it's kind of more...

20:23.640 --> 20:29.640
So, regarding a question on the developer documentation and how someone can contribute to it,

20:29.640 --> 20:31.640
yes, there is documentation out there.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.640
So, on...

20:33.640 --> 20:34.640
Change of slides.

20:34.640 --> 20:35.640
Yeah.

20:35.640 --> 20:43.640
So, if you go to getindico.io, we do have a couple of pages on how you can contribute back to the project.

20:43.640 --> 20:48.640
And also, we've got a pretty good ReadMe and some ReadTheDocs pages on how to contribute back.

20:48.640 --> 20:54.640
And it also covers stuff like how to set up your own developer instance and everything from, you know,

20:54.640 --> 20:58.640
how to probably write a half-decent comet when you...

20:58.640 --> 20:59.640
Or a PR.

20:59.640 --> 21:00.640
So, yeah.

21:00.640 --> 21:07.640
There's also some API documentation, Sphinx documentation based on the code documentation.

21:07.640 --> 21:11.640
And it's not as complete as we'd like, but yeah, it's a work in progress.

21:18.640 --> 21:19.640
Any other questions?

21:19.640 --> 21:20.640
No one?

21:20.640 --> 21:21.640
No.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.640
Well, thank you very much.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.640
Thank you.
