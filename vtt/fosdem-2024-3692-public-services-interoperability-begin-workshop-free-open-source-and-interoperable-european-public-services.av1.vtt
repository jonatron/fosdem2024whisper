00:00.000 --> 00:10.460
Okay, good afternoon everybody.

00:10.460 --> 00:13.760
We're going to start our next session.

00:13.760 --> 00:18.340
Everybody has found a seat so we know how many people can come in.

00:18.340 --> 00:21.960
That's up to the people at the door.

00:21.960 --> 00:22.960
My name is Gai Selenius.

00:22.960 --> 00:31.120
I work with the European Commission Open Source Program Office.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.720
This is for the recording.

00:32.720 --> 00:36.200
Okay, I will amplify myself.

00:36.200 --> 00:42.040
I will quickly run through the ground rules which you have seen already.

00:42.040 --> 00:47.840
We would like you to make sure that everybody gets a chance to speak.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.880
Me and Lina will be handing around the microphone.

00:50.880 --> 00:53.640
This is for the people online.

00:53.640 --> 01:00.040
We want to focus on finding solutions for the problems that are coming to you soon.

01:00.040 --> 01:02.360
This is the third workshop.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.600
The title is Public Services Interoperability.

01:04.600 --> 01:06.320
It is made out of two parts.

01:06.320 --> 01:11.080
We will first discuss the Interoperability Act and we will then have a presentation on

01:11.080 --> 01:15.320
the Commission's Open Source Strategy.

01:15.320 --> 01:26.760
And the reporter is Axel who I think is still outside so somebody should get him in.

01:26.760 --> 01:32.760
And with that, we are almost ready for our first session.

01:32.760 --> 01:48.160
Welcome.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.560
Okay, so hello everyone.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.840
Just a very quick introduction.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.160
My name is Lina Cevajos.

01:56.160 --> 02:02.440
I work with policy at the Free Software Foundation Europe.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.600
I just want to make a little bit of introduction about this session.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.480
If you have been here before, you have seen that we are trying to try different formats

02:10.480 --> 02:13.200
doing workshops, fish bowls.

02:13.200 --> 02:18.200
And this format, we kind of imagine it more as a discussion, kind of like what we have

02:18.200 --> 02:21.200
had so you don't need to move, you just need to raise your hand.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.080
I will bring the microphone to you.

02:24.080 --> 02:31.600
And I also wanted this to be not like a technically like a Q&A but more like let's chat and let's

02:31.600 --> 02:33.640
try to find common ground.
