00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Thank you so much.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
Hi everyone.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
My name is Emmie Tang.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm the Engagement Lead at Invest in Open Infrastructure.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
And my name is Chris Wu.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
I am Product Lead at Invest in Open Infrastructure.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
And today we're here to introduce InfraFinder.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
But before that, if I can just take a minute to introduce what Invest in Open Infrastructure is.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.000
We're a non-profit initiative.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
We work to increase the investment in the adoption of open infrastructure

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
to further the equitable access and participation in research.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
We do this in a couple of ways.

00:38.000 --> 00:43.000
We build tools and recommendations based on our research and evidence

00:43.000 --> 00:49.000
to help decision makers and funders make informed decisions about their investment into open infrastructure.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.000
We also catalyze investment into the space by running funding pilots.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
Well, this looks like in practice for us.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
Our work currently is centered around three core programs that you can see on the screen here.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
We are catalyzing investment into the space.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
As I said, running a couple of funding pilots at the moment to look at how we can diversify the funding mechanisms and players

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
into getting them to invest more into open infrastructure

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
and to build towards a healthy, resilient and sustainable future for research and scholarship.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
We also partner directly with open infrastructure service providers and funders and adopters

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
to provide tailored recommendations and engagement based on our research.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.000
And last but not least, we have something called the Data Room,

01:32.000 --> 01:38.000
which is all about tools, actionable tools and recommendations that, again, institutions and funders can use

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
to help guide their investment into open infrastructure.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
An Infra Finder that we're about to share with you is part of the Data Room.

01:47.000 --> 01:53.000
So, Infra Finder, why are we building it? What is the problem that we see?

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
So, we know that open infrastructure can really advance open values because it's customizable

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
and it can be adapted as the community's needs grow.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
And we also know that it is recognized to be important by international policies and recommendations

02:09.000 --> 02:15.000
like the UNESCO Open Science recommendations and also in the US, for example,

02:15.000 --> 02:20.000
the Nelson Memo on open access publishing and infrastructure for that as well.

02:20.000 --> 02:26.000
So, the question is then for us, how can we increase effectively the adoption of open infrastructure?

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
To start thinking about this problem and this question,

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
we decided to first look at who we want to solve this problem for.

02:36.000 --> 02:40.000
And so, we chose the target audience of institutional decision makers.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.000
So, these could be libraries who are choosing to adopt a certain repository service.

02:46.000 --> 02:50.000
It could be library publishing teams who are choosing a publishing software.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.000
We choose to work with this audience because we want to really make an impact at scale.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
So, institutional level adoption of infrastructure means that all the researchers within that institution

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
is then using that open infrastructure.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.000
And we also have had long-standing relationships with institutional decision makers.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
They are some of the strongest supporters of our work and we've had years of engagement with them

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
so we do understand them a little bit better.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
So, that's where we're starting at with Infra Finder.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.000
To start understanding how our audience see the problem,

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
we took months to do user research and focus groups and interviews to try and understand

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
what is going on in their heads, what is going on around them as they make decisions

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
around adopting infrastructure like repositories and publishing software.

03:39.000 --> 03:46.000
And we find that actually finding the right infrastructure for them is a really, really hard and slow process.

03:46.000 --> 03:51.000
They need a lot of information, information related to costs, for example,

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
how much money will they take them, how much staff time will they take their team

03:55.000 --> 04:02.000
to be able to maintain the infrastructure, to upgrade the infrastructure in the short, medium and long term.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
They are also trying to risk the purchase so that they don't want to understand

04:08.000 --> 04:14.000
if the infrastructure service is going to be maintained and continue to be in existence

04:14.000 --> 04:21.000
for a foreseeable future because you probably don't want to buy infrastructure that will stop existing tomorrow.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.000
They also want to see if the infrastructure will fit into all the other things that they've already got in place

04:26.000 --> 04:29.000
within their own institution and libraries.

04:29.000 --> 04:35.000
And last but not least, there are some institutions who are thinking about how can we use this infrastructure

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
decision to advance their institutional vision for openness.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.000
So what I'm trying to say is that there are a lot of considerations and every single institution we spoke with

04:46.000 --> 04:51.000
had a different priority in mind. They all rank those differently.

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
The information, but for everyone, the information is scattered on the Internet

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
and it's very hard to piece together the information that they need to compare different surfaces.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
And also it's just really, really time consuming.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
It's easy, someone's months of work to be able to pull this information together

05:09.000 --> 05:13.000
to put it into a comparable form to show it to their management

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
and to convince them that they are making the right decision.

05:16.000 --> 05:21.000
So this is the problem that we've defined for this first release of Infrafinder

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
and the one that we're trying to address right now.

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
And I hand over to Chris to elaborate what we've built.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Thank you, Amy.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Okay.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Let's see if this works.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
All right, so thank you for your attention so far.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
It's my pleasure to introduce what we're calling Infrafinder to you.

05:41.000 --> 05:48.000
This tool is meant to help folks navigate the complex landscape of infrastructure services and standards

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
that enable open research and scholarship.

05:51.000 --> 05:57.000
So what we wanted to present to you folks in this first iteration was up-to-date verified information

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
about various infrastructures.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.000
We also wanted to make sure that the key information that they had told us

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000
that they were really looking for, that pragmatic information we'd shown you on an earlier slide,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
was in one place.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
And then also we wanted to provide that easy to use comparison view.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
So I'm going to show you designs and the prototype.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.000
Right now we're still in progress, so this isn't quite live yet, and it's a little bit buggy.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.000
Subject change, but it is still my pleasure to show you this preview.

06:29.000 --> 06:35.000
So this is an example of a page that we're calling the Individual Provider Service Page.

06:35.000 --> 06:42.000
So an individual provider is invited to give us information that we are presenting in this way.

06:42.000 --> 06:49.000
You can see it allows the provider to show us mission, their key achievements, technical attributes,

06:49.000 --> 06:55.000
and as well as information about community engagement, which is so important to the open vision.

06:55.000 --> 07:02.000
They can also tell us about policies that they have, as well as additional information about the organization itself,

07:02.000 --> 07:08.000
and at the very end they can also describe their own funding needs.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
So this is the Individual Provider Page.

07:11.000 --> 07:24.000
We have worked, we invited 87 partners to work with us, and we received responses from 57, 56, yeah, 56 or 57 of them.

07:24.000 --> 07:33.000
So we've already collected this data that is shown, this will be presented when people first come to InfraViner to be able to see what's here.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.000
We also have developed a nurturing process that will allow this listing to grow over time

07:38.000 --> 07:47.000
and also will be doing our verification process as well, checking against publicly available records where they are available

07:47.000 --> 07:51.000
to ensure that the information is both up to date as well as verified.

07:51.000 --> 07:56.000
And in the end, users, when they go to the site, will be able to pick services.

07:56.000 --> 08:04.000
We're choosing to give people the option to choose three at a time, because three is a good number to compare against.

08:04.000 --> 08:13.000
So this is the comparison page, and it kind of boils down all of this information into a way that people can see this high level info side by side

08:13.000 --> 08:23.000
so that, for example, they can see, is there an open product roadmap of the services that they've chosen, which groups have them, and which groups do not.

08:23.000 --> 08:29.000
So again, high level overview, but I hope that this gives you a taste of what it is that we have in mind.

08:29.000 --> 08:36.000
We are aiming to, so most of you who are working here on what we would think of as the provider side.

08:36.000 --> 08:45.000
So what's in it for you? If you are interested, being part of InfraViner allows you to showcase your key achievements and highlight your funding needs.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
In addition, you'll be able to reach more potential adopters as well as funders.

08:50.000 --> 08:54.000
And finally, you can learn from and connect with other infrastructure services.

08:54.000 --> 09:09.000
In fact, when we sent out our initial invitation of those providers who chose to respond to us, they actually were telling us as well that in seeing and hearing about what kinds of information users were looking for,

09:09.000 --> 09:20.000
it kind of sparked this idea that maybe they themselves would want to start to work on some of the things that they had put off, knowing that potential users were in fact looking for that info.

09:20.000 --> 09:29.000
So you can, in fact, complete our expression of interest form if you meet our criteria.

09:29.000 --> 09:35.000
You can add your service to InfraViner by going to this URL or the QR code.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
I'll give you a minute for those of you who've got your phones out.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
Okay.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
And yeah, in terms of next steps, this is a beginning.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
When we release this, it's not the final product, it's not the end of the conversation.

09:48.000 --> 09:56.000
We are aiming to release in a few months' time, and we'd love to start and continue the conversation from here.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.000
So one of the things that we've been wrestling with with regard to this is how to ask about interoperability.

10:03.000 --> 10:13.000
So as we mentioned earlier, one of the things that we discovered users wanted to know is, like, does your thing work with our situation?

10:13.000 --> 10:20.000
Most people would call this interoperability, but not everyone understands interoperability in the same way.

10:20.000 --> 10:32.000
So I'd love, Emmy and I would love to talk with you about, like, how we can ask the question about interoperability in a way where we can collect data that kind of essentially, like, helps us understand,

10:33.000 --> 10:41.000
you know, understand how you think about it in the context of how users think about it and collect that data in a way that we can then standardize.

10:41.000 --> 10:51.000
So yeah, so users want to know if your technology will work with the other things that they have running and the answer isn't always, we'll just use our API is what we've discovered.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
So please come and talk with us afterward.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.000
We're going to be here for the rest of the day and as well as tomorrow.

10:59.000 --> 11:10.000
So anyway, I'd like to thank you again for your time and you can sign up for our newsletter for updates about all of the work that Iowa is doing as well as the launch notice for Infra Finder.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
And should you want to email us, you can reach us at infra-finder at investingopen.org. Thank you.
