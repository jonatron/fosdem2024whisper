00:00.000 --> 00:12.360
So thank you for your coming. It's quite early, 9.30. It's difficult to start, so I will

00:12.360 --> 00:19.080
try to push energy to this session. So just before to get started, I would like to know

00:19.080 --> 00:26.560
more about you. So with three very simple questions. First, who has ever locally run

00:26.560 --> 00:35.920
LLM on his laptop using Lama CCP, VLLM or LLM Studio? Please raise your hand. Okay,

00:35.920 --> 00:47.120
right. Second question, who has ever fine-tuned a model? Fine-tuned. Okay, let's find 10. Okay.

00:47.640 --> 00:58.720
And the last one, who has, like me, dreaming to have one-dred open-source model in here? Not

00:58.720 --> 01:07.080
only one, not only open-weight model, but really open-source models. Raise your hand. Okay, you are

01:07.080 --> 01:16.680
in the right place. So we will do the job. Okay. Yes, my name is Michel Marie ModÃ©s. So I have a

01:16.720 --> 01:23.560
co-founder company, a software company called Inagora. So we started in 2001. So as the first

01:23.560 --> 01:30.960
time, we will be very close to our 25 years. So it will be for next year. And our mission with

01:30.960 --> 01:40.560
Inagora is to invent and develop good tech for good. So what I can sum up as ethical open-source.

01:41.440 --> 01:51.240
And for AI, we do the same. We do ethical AI. And to come up to achieve this goal, so we started

01:51.240 --> 01:58.520
a community, a very large and a brand community called Open LLM France. So we started in June

01:58.520 --> 02:09.000
2020. And we have two main goals. First, as well to build trusted sovereign and real open-source

02:09.600 --> 02:18.280
generative AI technologies. And the second goal is to build a strong ecosystem around LLMs and

02:18.280 --> 02:27.520
generative AI systems. So for the second objective, so I can say that we have success because the

02:27.520 --> 02:37.720
community right now is more over 450 active members with a strong support from the academic and

02:37.800 --> 02:45.520
public research in France. So it's very important because, for example, with the GenC, we can use

02:45.520 --> 02:57.240
freely supercomputers like GenZ. And it's very useful for us to give freely GPUs to train our

02:57.240 --> 03:04.360
models. So it's very important. And at the same time, so we have a lot of corporates, corporate

03:04.440 --> 03:16.840
private company, who have are using AI technology or many to build with us AI solutions. So and all

03:16.840 --> 03:24.480
this track for today. So I think there is a lot of important things to build ethical AI system. But

03:24.480 --> 03:32.920
my talk, I will talk with you about three topics as well, what we could consider as open-source AI. So

03:32.960 --> 03:41.840
this is my first part of my talk. The second part of my talk will be related to diversity and the

03:41.840 --> 03:49.720
underrepresentation of our culture, our language in these models today. And the third part of my

03:50.720 --> 03:56.800
talk this morning will be related to data quality and the evaluation of this model. Okay.

04:03.840 --> 04:14.840
Under. Okay. Right. So to be very clear, and to start on the biggest problem, so the most popular

04:14.920 --> 04:23.200
open model that you are using today are not open source. They are open wave model. So this afternoon,

04:23.680 --> 04:33.200
Stefano Maffuli from the OZ, open source initiative, we have a talk to report to their progress to

04:33.200 --> 04:40.360
this definition of what we could consider as open source AI. So I'm very proud because I'm part of

04:40.360 --> 04:49.360
this small group and private group inside the experts from external from from the OZ to try to

04:49.360 --> 04:56.040
define and to get this definition because it's important to clarify the situation because as you

04:56.040 --> 05:07.360
know, and I'm not alone, but Stefano and probably some of you's have used as a published post to

05:07.800 --> 05:15.400
raise the problem to the misuse of the open source term today by some players on the far work

05:15.640 --> 05:24.960
ecosystem. And so and I put in this slide, you know, the OZ definition of open source. So to be very

05:24.960 --> 05:33.320
clear, if you have limitation on the use, the license and the term of use of a lease license, or

05:33.320 --> 05:43.640
if you don't have the artifact, the element to train again the model or to make a derefited work on

05:43.680 --> 05:53.080
it, you can't say that you are doing open source. This is very clear. And today, the main part of the

05:53.080 --> 05:59.720
popular model we have, you don't have a view and access to the data set used to train the model.

06:02.960 --> 06:13.600
For us, for this community, what we open source AI means three things. First, as well, that we are

06:13.600 --> 06:22.000
able to have the open source of the model. All the tooling system used, for example, to train the

06:22.000 --> 06:29.440
models to evaluate the model of the pipeline to do the evaluation of the model. And so for different

06:29.440 --> 06:37.960
things, it's not very easy to find this information on an open model today. The second point is related

06:38.040 --> 06:50.960
to a license. So if you have for us our license, we don't have this license, we have to have, we thought

06:50.960 --> 06:58.520
in the limitation of who and what we are doing with this model. And the most important is the third

06:58.520 --> 07:05.600
point is related to that asset, open corpus, open corpora. But you know, it's very interesting because

07:06.000 --> 07:16.200
probably if you follow the news related to AI, you saw during these past days some new models with

07:16.520 --> 07:24.560
data sets published under open source license. So, and I think it's very important and I think that

07:24.560 --> 07:34.840
for 2020, not only the year of open source AI, but also for data set publication, open source

07:34.880 --> 07:46.920
license. So I changed my presentation last night, just after the talk of Joss, the co-founder of Next

07:46.920 --> 07:55.360
Cloud, because he present an ethical rating system. And I'm very glad to see that we share the same point

07:55.400 --> 08:05.040
of view. And it's very simple for also for the Next Cloud community. If all these conditions are met,

08:05.400 --> 08:13.840
the three conditions, so you are in the green area. If you have only one, two conditions, so you are

08:13.840 --> 08:21.880
in the yellow, only one orange. And if you are using, for example, open AI, in fact, ChabGPT from

08:21.920 --> 08:30.400
open AI, zero condition are met. So you are in the red area. So if we have today this morning

08:30.840 --> 08:39.000
developers from this beautiful Next Cloud community, thanks for your job. It's amazing and we love it. And so

08:39.000 --> 08:49.120
for us, by the way, we are in the first green area and we try to do the job. The second part, the second

08:49.160 --> 08:57.040
topic I would like to underline this morning, it's the problem that AI generative models are more and more

08:57.640 --> 09:06.560
representation of a picture of what we are in terms of culture, in terms of society, in terms of language. So I

09:06.560 --> 09:15.840
think that's figures talked by the by themselves. So in the left, you can see that since 2018, less than

09:16.120 --> 09:27.640
8% of LLM has been created in Europe. And on the right, what you can see that it's the volume of

09:27.640 --> 09:43.520
language used to train LAMATU model. So 0.16 for French and 0.17 for German. So percent. So I don't

09:43.560 --> 09:49.440
know what do you think about that. So but in my point of view, we can say that we are not really well

09:49.440 --> 10:03.240
represented as our culture values in this model today. So we have a problem, I think. And we have a

10:03.240 --> 10:17.920
community we try to solve. So first, first try we did, it's to adopt a data first, drive an approach or

10:17.920 --> 10:26.200
quite a quality first, drive an approach. And because the small also is beautiful. And we try to get the

10:26.200 --> 10:35.920
proof that quality of the data set is more important than the quantity of data you have. And to demonstrate

10:35.960 --> 10:48.440
this this point, we release a first model in October called Claire. So Claire like the woman, the

10:48.600 --> 10:59.200
show name in France. So I'm not against I have nothing against a podcast, Albert, Alfred, Mr. But you

10:59.200 --> 11:08.160
know, we prefer in our community to promote women because by fact, it's our little contribution to have

11:08.160 --> 11:18.120
more women in our AI ecosystem and a global unity. So I will, I will not go deeply in Claire because

11:19.320 --> 11:31.440
Julie, the real one. Yes. Julie will go deep and tell you all about Claire what we did. Oh, we did this

11:31.440 --> 11:41.680
model. But just for very, very, very, we just gave the proof that it's we are able with a lot of amount of

11:41.680 --> 11:52.000
French tokens to give a very, very conversational model. Conversational means that Claire is able to

11:52.000 --> 11:59.880
understand dialogue between people with their realization. And the second part of Claire, the second

11:59.880 --> 12:09.400
features, it's that Claire is able to talk like, like you, to make a dialogue, human like dialogue with

12:10.040 --> 12:20.680
defluence, hesitation, because we train Claire with conversational data. So we continue to collect a lot of

12:20.680 --> 12:33.560
data. And today, so we are around 140 billion of token in French. So and we I'm very glad and happy to

12:33.680 --> 12:46.840
announce that we started to the training phase to train our new model called Lucy. So Lucy, the main goal of

12:46.880 --> 12:57.520
Lucy is to fix or to yes, to improve the under representation of the French language in generally in

12:57.520 --> 13:08.440
LLMs. But at the same time, we put in our data set some over European language, the German, Spanish, Italian,

13:09.240 --> 13:21.640
some code to some some some source code to make our model to have a capacity of reasoning. And we try to

13:21.760 --> 13:34.960
build some new features to make this model efficient, not only in French, but for over language. So probably you

13:34.960 --> 13:45.120
will be interesting to follow this work and probably our custom tokenizer and so on. But the most important

13:45.200 --> 13:51.560
things I would like to share with you this morning is that we are not the only one community involved in this

13:52.360 --> 14:06.840
goal to build this sovereign LLM in Europe. So I'm sure that this list is not exhaustive. If anyone knows

14:07.520 --> 14:16.480
new or other initiative, please call me just after the presentation. I will be very excited to discuss with you. But the

14:16.480 --> 14:27.240
most important is that we are strongly believe that we have all the capacity, all the technology, all the GPUs in

14:27.240 --> 14:40.960
Europe to build our models. And it's why I'm very delighted to announce you that today, during the first day, we

14:40.960 --> 14:51.280
changed OpenLLM France to become OpenLLM Europe. So you can use this QR code to inboard yourself in this in our

14:51.320 --> 15:01.560
Discord server. So we all the content we produce during the six months in French is still available, available. But we have

15:01.560 --> 15:14.280
created the channel for each European language. So please welcome. And if someone want to be part of the community

15:14.280 --> 15:27.480
management team, please contact us and we will be very pleased to inboard you in our initiative. So that's my tool for today.
