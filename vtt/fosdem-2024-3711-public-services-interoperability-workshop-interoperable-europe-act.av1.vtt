WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
Yeah, so about the topic.

00:08.320 --> 00:14.120
So this is a, the session is on digital public services and interoperability.

00:14.120 --> 00:23.280
There will be a session more focused on, like that is not the digital public services later

00:23.280 --> 00:24.280
on.

00:24.280 --> 00:30.040
And because we're talking about this, we're going to have two parts.

00:30.040 --> 00:36.280
One is a focus on the Interoperable Europe Act to serve as an example of what's happening

00:36.280 --> 00:40.560
at this moment when it comes to digital public services.

00:40.560 --> 00:44.160
And this is an act that, you know, happened last year.

00:44.160 --> 00:50.480
And I personally have to say that I had the feeling that it was a little bit underlooked.

00:50.480 --> 00:53.200
So not so many people pay attention to this.

00:53.200 --> 01:00.080
And I think it is a very crucial piece of regulation because we're talking about interoperability

01:00.080 --> 01:02.400
in digital public services.

01:02.400 --> 01:07.680
So to start the discussion, or to start this, let's talk about what is interoperability.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.880
So like the definition, you know, is like the ability of information systems to speak

01:11.880 --> 01:13.320
with one another.

01:13.320 --> 01:19.320
And now we want to make use of this feature to deliver public services or to make public

01:19.320 --> 01:22.200
administrations to deliver public services.

01:22.200 --> 01:27.240
And this can have so many examples in practice.

01:27.240 --> 01:33.720
One that I can always like to give is that imagine you're going on a road trip from here

01:33.720 --> 01:38.000
to Paris and then you go with your car and then you want to park on the street and then

01:38.000 --> 01:41.800
you get to this machine and then you want to put the car plate off your car and then

01:41.800 --> 01:45.560
it turns out it doesn't recognize your plate because it's from Belgium and then you just

01:45.560 --> 01:49.800
end up having a park in another country that you can't park.

01:49.800 --> 01:54.160
So is this, you know, like we're talking about things that affect us all in the EU.

01:54.160 --> 01:58.800
I mean, it has to do with freedom of movement, but also with education, with health.

01:58.800 --> 02:02.640
There are so many aspects that are so important when we're talking about interoperability

02:02.640 --> 02:05.000
and digital public services.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.080
And of course, for these to work, we're talking about critical infrastructure.

02:09.080 --> 02:12.280
And this is where FreeSoft plays a huge role.

02:12.280 --> 02:16.480
And that is the reason why we were trying to be active last year and still trying to

02:16.480 --> 02:22.360
be active to make decision makers understand the role that these, that the FreeSoft and

02:22.360 --> 02:26.200
OpenSunders come or have in this regulation.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.880
I also have to say that, I mean, the commission proposal already acknowledged this.

02:29.880 --> 02:33.560
The commission proposal already came with some of this wording.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.320
And there were different things that we were trying to get active.

02:36.320 --> 02:45.160
So I guess we're going to learn more from this, from Issa, from Calvin, from the commission.

02:45.160 --> 02:51.080
But there is like a very interesting inclusion of a governance structure.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.680
So we will learn more about it.

02:52.680 --> 02:57.680
And we were trying to push to be there because that's where, you know, the decisions are

02:57.680 --> 03:01.400
going to be made and so on.

03:01.400 --> 03:07.200
And of course, I don't even know what I had this slide, but anyway.

03:07.200 --> 03:12.200
And then the second part, then we're going to focus on the European Commission efforts

03:12.200 --> 03:16.720
that are happening when it comes to the direction of FreeSoft.

03:16.720 --> 03:24.480
And for this, then we're going to have a discussion with Heis and with his colleague

03:24.480 --> 03:28.000
also from the OSPO, from the European Commission, OSPO.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.200
We're going to discuss all these efforts because there have been some of this coming

03:33.200 --> 03:38.120
from like years back, but just bring an example, the open source strategy.

03:38.120 --> 03:42.320
After that, the decision that came with it, the code repository that another European Commission

03:42.320 --> 03:43.880
is having.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.760
So we're going to learn what has been done.

03:46.760 --> 03:52.480
But what I want us to keep in mind, and I think along the day I've been seeing, and

03:52.480 --> 03:57.720
I think it has been a very fruitful discussion on how we can get engaged and how we can

03:57.720 --> 03:59.800
interact with decision makers.

03:59.800 --> 04:04.200
But it is also important that we keep an eye on implementation because of course it is

04:04.200 --> 04:10.720
important to advocate for FreeSoft for when it is possible with decision makers.

04:10.720 --> 04:15.520
But once the text is done, such as the Interoperable Europe Act, we had the opportunity, we did

04:15.520 --> 04:19.200
what we could, we would discuss this during the session.

04:19.200 --> 04:23.680
Now we have this piece of regulation that we need to make sure that it is implemented.

04:23.680 --> 04:29.760
And let's make use of these words that we struggle and we fight so much to put in there.

04:29.760 --> 04:33.760
And let's help them as well to figure out how to implement this.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.080
So let's look at the future.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.320
Let's look at examples.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.640
Let's see what has worked well, what hasn't worked well.

04:40.640 --> 04:47.520
And let's try to find ways where we can all collaborate and we can make use of all these

04:47.520 --> 04:51.280
efforts that are happening at the moment.

04:51.280 --> 04:55.120
So yeah, and I also want, yeah, again, like the structure.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.160
So we're going to have this presentation.

04:57.160 --> 05:00.640
And of course we're going to open the floor for questions, comments and so on.

05:00.640 --> 05:03.480
Remember that you have to wait for the microphone for the live stream.

05:03.480 --> 05:08.120
And it would be also nice for you if you could introduce yourself, your affiliation and so

05:08.120 --> 05:09.120
on.

05:09.120 --> 05:14.960
So decision makers also know who you're talking to, who they're talking to.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.720
And I think that's all from my side.

05:16.720 --> 05:21.320
I really hope we can learn a lot on this conversation.

05:21.320 --> 05:26.640
And again, let's try to keep an eye on the future and how we can monitor implementation

05:26.640 --> 05:29.440
of all these amazing revelations happening.

05:29.440 --> 05:34.080
And yeah, without any further ado, then I'll hand over the floor to Issa from...

05:34.080 --> 05:35.080
I'll bring this...

05:35.080 --> 05:36.080
Oh, cool.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.080
You got it?

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
Okay.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
Yeah, from the...

05:39.080 --> 05:40.080
Yeah, from the...

05:40.080 --> 05:50.360
Yeah, thank you very much, Lina.

05:50.360 --> 05:54.400
Okay, here.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.400
And thank you very much.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.400
Thanks for the slides.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.960
I'm very happy that Issa is with us on behalf of...

05:58.960 --> 06:05.240
She's one of my colleagues in the Commission, Digit B2, our recent new unit.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.080
And Issa is also very much informed on open source.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.080
I'm happy that she's here.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.080
Thanks.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.080
And me too.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.800
I'm very happy and thankful to be here because I think it's a great opportunity.

06:15.800 --> 06:19.440
Also very thankful for Lina introducing the act as something that is important and should

06:19.440 --> 06:25.640
get more attention because I'm completely unbiased after working four years on this.

06:25.640 --> 06:30.800
But of course, I also believe that this is an important piece and that...

06:30.800 --> 06:36.520
But for now, it's a piece of paper and it will only get to live when...

06:36.520 --> 06:37.520
And this...

06:37.520 --> 06:39.400
It will also be on you to make this...

06:39.400 --> 06:40.560
Fill this with life.

06:40.560 --> 06:45.240
And I think there are some opportunities in there and this is what I'm going to focus

06:45.240 --> 06:46.240
on today.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.160
And then I'm looking forward to the discussion and to your ideas.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.960
And yeah.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.440
So let's get started.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.440
What's this act about?

06:54.440 --> 07:00.360
And I mean, the first very maybe disappointing news for you, it's not an open source law.

07:00.360 --> 07:01.360
And it's not...

07:01.360 --> 07:02.360
Nothing that...

07:02.360 --> 07:05.340
Now we can say, yeah, haha, it's clear that it's not an open source law, but it's something

07:05.340 --> 07:09.540
that has actually been discussed and has actually been discussed from often very early

07:09.540 --> 07:15.060
start when we did the impact assessment, should we have a law that is on GovTech, the open

07:15.060 --> 07:17.060
GovTech.

07:17.060 --> 07:21.380
But then we saw that there was no majority for this path.

07:21.380 --> 07:27.260
So now the Interoperability Policy evolved into the Interoperability Europe Act.

07:27.260 --> 07:31.100
And maybe I just quickly why no majority.

07:31.100 --> 07:33.020
This actually came from both sides.

07:33.020 --> 07:38.340
So from those who are very much fan of open source but said, but if we want to do an open

07:38.340 --> 07:44.100
source law, it should be made in a different way and shouldn't build now on this interoperability.

07:44.100 --> 07:45.100
Then it's too linked.

07:45.100 --> 07:46.260
It's too much in one direction.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.740
We should do it properly.

07:47.740 --> 07:49.380
So let's not make it...

07:49.380 --> 07:52.940
From the back door in open source law, that was the fans of open source who were against

07:52.940 --> 07:54.620
making this an open source law.

07:54.620 --> 07:59.300
And then there were the ones that said, yeah, but we are not there in the public sector.

07:59.300 --> 08:00.300
We might...

08:00.300 --> 08:02.660
This might hinder than digitalization of the public sector.

08:02.660 --> 08:04.340
So a bit...

08:04.340 --> 08:05.340
This is what we found.

08:05.340 --> 08:06.340
We put something in the middle.

08:06.340 --> 08:08.300
That's the compromise that we found.

08:08.300 --> 08:09.860
This is what I'm going to present now.

08:09.860 --> 08:12.940
And what was the main objective of the act?

08:12.940 --> 08:18.820
It was to help EU and member states administration to deliver connected digital services to citizens

08:18.820 --> 08:21.820
and businesses across Europe.

08:21.820 --> 08:26.180
And I think I don't need to tell you that open source can contribute to this.

08:26.180 --> 08:27.860
I just strongly believe it.

08:27.860 --> 08:33.380
And I also don't need to talk to you about how interoperability is linked with this

08:33.380 --> 08:35.500
objective and with open source.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.980
What is maybe interesting is that the European interoperability policy has always focused

08:39.980 --> 08:45.860
not only on technical interoperability, but has this four dimensions of also legal, semantic

08:45.860 --> 08:48.700
and organizational.

08:48.700 --> 08:52.140
And that was very much in the negotiations that we've talked a lot about.

08:52.140 --> 09:00.700
How can we actually make stronger mechanisms to help also legal and organizational interoperability?

09:00.700 --> 09:05.500
And this you might also find back when I now go into the components of the act.

09:05.500 --> 09:09.540
Because we say the act is structured around these four components.

09:09.540 --> 09:17.540
So a structured and co-owned EU cooperation governance, mandatory interoperability assessments,

09:17.540 --> 09:25.220
recognize your reusable interoperability solutions and strengthen interoperability support.

09:25.220 --> 09:31.700
And now I'm going to tell you more about what this keywords, what we mean with this.

09:31.700 --> 09:35.620
So I start with the solutions.

09:35.620 --> 09:41.660
One of the mechanisms that will be established is that the EU public administrations in Europe,

09:41.660 --> 09:47.060
and they are the ones that are actually the act is addressed to EU administrations from

09:47.060 --> 09:51.460
EU level until a member states local level.

09:51.460 --> 09:57.380
And it's all the binding requirements that are in the act go towards these public administrations.

09:57.380 --> 10:01.500
They don't go towards private parties.

10:01.500 --> 10:06.660
And those ones will decide together on certain solutions.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.980
And solutions is in a very broad term.

10:08.980 --> 10:14.540
So solutions can even be a framework, can be an architecture, can be guidelines, can also be a solution,

10:14.540 --> 10:19.100
can of course be software.

10:19.100 --> 10:22.580
Like the definition that is in the act is quite broad.

10:22.580 --> 10:28.620
But the public sector will agree in this interoperability governance on some solutions that will become interoperable

10:28.620 --> 10:33.620
Europe solutions so that everybody will not be, they don't have to reuse it,

10:33.620 --> 10:37.460
but they will at least need to look into the reuse of such solutions.

10:37.460 --> 10:45.740
And this I think is an opportunity for the open source community that wants to know where is the EU public sector moving.

10:45.740 --> 10:51.940
Looking into the interoperability Europe solutions might help them to see, okay, if this is here in the catalogue,

10:51.940 --> 10:56.540
this might be something when I built my software that it fits with those interoperability Europe solutions,

10:56.540 --> 11:00.580
that might be easier for public administrations to reuse it.

11:00.660 --> 11:10.020
And then another thing around the solutions that what we've managed to get into the law is that sharing is a default.

11:10.020 --> 11:16.380
And for now, between public administration, sharing is not a default and proper territory solutions are a default.

11:16.380 --> 11:24.780
And if you want to share among the solutions, then the IT people go to the lawyers of this world and I'm one of them so I can talk better about them.

11:24.780 --> 11:29.180
And they will ask those people, yeah, can we please, can we share?

11:29.180 --> 11:30.900
There's somebody else wants to reuse it.

11:30.900 --> 11:35.300
And then the lawyers come and say, yeah, but this is problematic and there might be this and this problem.

11:35.300 --> 11:42.260
So because, and we hope that by just putting in a law that normally if somebody asks you, you have to share,

11:42.260 --> 11:45.340
then the lawyers already need to argue why can't I share.

11:45.340 --> 11:53.180
So we hope that this changing the default might already be a push in the right direction to make public administrations that are,

11:53.420 --> 12:03.220
and they also have to be risk, very risk adverse to be more friendly towards taking this risk and being brave.

12:03.220 --> 12:09.780
And what come in the negotiations, also, and that's what Lena also talked about,

12:09.780 --> 12:17.340
is that there is also a small thing about priority to open source solutions when you are doing interoperability solutions.

12:17.340 --> 12:24.660
And this is something that is now very new in the text and that public administration will need guidance on how to implement this and will need help on.

12:24.660 --> 12:33.620
And this also, I think, where the community has an opportunity to help them, guide them on how can we really make this work and put this into practice.

12:35.980 --> 12:43.580
As a second component, there is this governance and there is, the governance is composed, as Alina already said,

12:43.900 --> 12:46.300
around the board and the community.

12:46.300 --> 12:51.940
And in the community is, we were thinking about you, also as part of the community,

12:51.940 --> 12:55.620
of course, also the community of local public administration in the board.

12:55.620 --> 13:04.860
Actually, it's only the member states represented, but IT is very, sometimes very federal and some scattered around all public administration levels.

13:04.860 --> 13:12.300
So the community is really about putting many different actors in the field together and then giving structured input,

13:12.300 --> 13:21.220
and channeling this input also maybe with digital platforms, digital tools towards the board to take the decision to have always a sounding mechanism towards the board.

13:21.220 --> 13:28.180
And another thing that I haven't seen when we were drafting the law, but when I talked with open source people who said that was interesting for them,

13:28.180 --> 13:41.460
was the clear points of contact that with this law, we are having now responsibles on member states level and in EU institutions who will need to implement the law.

13:41.460 --> 13:49.820
So when you have anything that is linkable to the law, you know who to reach out to and that this is something that is actually important for the community.

13:49.820 --> 13:57.220
The third component, the mandatory interoperability assessments.

13:57.220 --> 14:07.820
I think this links back to the discussion I heard here before on the fishbowl where you said, but it needs the right processes and how do we get into the policy making.

14:08.180 --> 14:13.380
And it's very hard to bring the two worlds together actually.

14:13.380 --> 14:24.380
The interoperability assessments will be something that when public, when the public sector is setting any binding requirements for their digital public services in the future,

14:24.380 --> 14:31.660
before taking a decision on these binding requirements, they would need to do and publish a mandatory interoperability assessment.

14:31.660 --> 14:46.940
And I think this interoperability assessment report will for the community create a lot of transparency and help them actually then also engage in policy discussions afterwards because the policy text is already translated into concrete requirements.

14:46.940 --> 14:53.140
Maybe it might not always be technical requirements because if you look at the law, it might be requirements on business level.

14:53.140 --> 14:56.380
And now we are looking into how to really make this work and practice.

14:56.500 --> 15:10.380
I think it's a very interesting tool that can actually help bring and that's why we put it in the law because it's about illegal interoperability, bringing IT and policy together and helping to have this conversation early in the process.

15:10.380 --> 15:20.860
And not when the law is already written and then you sit there with the law with requirements that are actually not implemented in a user-friendly, citizen-friendly, engaging way.

15:21.860 --> 15:28.860
So that's definitely something we need to talk about in the community and to develop in the coming months.

15:28.860 --> 15:45.860
The fourth component is what is also in the law. It's around GovTech cooperation. There is innovation projects and it's the first time that there's a definition around GovTech also in the law.

15:46.860 --> 16:04.860
So just that the recognition that this is important, even if there is no strong legal requirements around it, I think this is an important step because it helps to argue that this is important if you say it, because it's an law.

16:04.860 --> 16:33.860
Then we have a spot on regulatory sandboxes and here also for me that they are an enabler for legal interoperability and they have to involve also the GovTech and have, but create a way when you do innovative stuff to have the York legal questions channeled towards the EU level and have the EU regulators already predescuss on how can we tackle this, how can we have this innovation also rolled out in a legally safe way.

16:35.860 --> 16:51.860
And last point is upscaling of the public sector and this might also sound a bit vague and lame that is in the act because it's nothing, it's not something you go and the police can come and say you have to upskill.

16:51.860 --> 17:07.860
But I think if there is, it's mentioned in the act that there is the public administration have to skill their stuff on interoperability and I think you can't skill them on interoperability without talking about openness, without talking about open code.

17:08.860 --> 17:23.860
So I think that a lot of these trainings will be created in the next coming years so together then look into what can we push, what messages and then you can talk in the public sector to people who know about open source and are not afraid of open source.

17:24.860 --> 17:33.860
So this is an opportunity for me and one opportunity that I don't have on the slide is that this is going to be evaluated.

17:33.860 --> 17:47.860
So everything that is not in today, now if we talk, get the right questions in this evaluation then it might be that in the next version this can also get into the text.

17:48.860 --> 18:03.860
So this is the entry model and we will see where this takes us but this also needs early involvement, this needs actually, yeah, that the community reaches out as soon as possible and say this is our ideas for where it should go and this is the question we should ask.

18:03.860 --> 18:14.860
So I'm very, as I say, now maybe you understand why I think it's very relevant that we are here and that we start this conversation and looking forward to the discussion. Thank you.

18:17.860 --> 18:19.860
Thank you.
