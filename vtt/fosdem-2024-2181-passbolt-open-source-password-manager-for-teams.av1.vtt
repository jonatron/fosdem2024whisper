00:00.000 --> 00:16.160
Next we have Remy Bertot with PassBolt open source password manager for teams.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.160
Thanks everyone.

00:17.160 --> 00:22.480
I just wanted to maybe we could give a little round of applause to Elina and David who has

00:22.480 --> 00:24.880
been running this room.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.680
Thanks a lot for volunteering and organizing this.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.920
It's really nice for me.

00:29.920 --> 00:30.920
So I'm Remy Bertot.

00:30.920 --> 00:36.240
You may remember me from other open source projects, minor and horrible contributions

00:36.240 --> 00:40.440
to mail-village, open social and some other events that we do.

00:40.440 --> 00:46.160
But here today I'm here to reprise my role as the co-founder of PassBolt.

00:46.160 --> 00:50.640
Before we start I just wanted to show you this picture which was taken 20 years ago.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.960
I think we can appreciate the amount of swag in this picture.

00:55.960 --> 01:01.880
If they are GenZ in the room, 20 years ago Facebook didn't exist so we didn't know that

01:01.880 --> 01:05.520
this picture will come back to us.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.720
So is anyone not using a password manager at work?

01:09.720 --> 01:11.520
Can you raise your hand?

01:11.520 --> 01:15.960
Okay, I can see the PassBolt developer raising their hand.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.400
We need to have a little talk about this after.

01:18.400 --> 01:23.240
But for the other ones that raised their hands, I would like you to meet with me after because

01:23.240 --> 01:29.240
I want to learn how you do to live without fear.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.760
So this is what we did.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.280
We built an open source password manager that is designed for collaboration.

01:36.280 --> 01:39.760
So you can share secrets with your teams.

01:39.760 --> 01:46.560
So you have granular access and permissions to every single resources and folders.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.280
It's available by default in the browsers.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.280
So it's designed specifically for collaboration.

01:52.280 --> 01:58.120
So as many password managers, we also have a quick access so you can basically see this

01:58.120 --> 02:02.760
little annoying icon in every single form when you browse the web.

02:02.760 --> 02:06.480
We also have Android and iOS applications.

02:06.480 --> 02:11.080
So it works with biometrics and you also have multi-account.

02:11.080 --> 02:14.960
So for example, if you have a personal account and a professional account on the same phone,

02:14.960 --> 02:18.040
then you can basically use both.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.600
They work with the autofill as well.

02:19.600 --> 02:25.880
So it's like automatically fill the form for you based on the API that is available by the

02:25.880 --> 02:27.400
phone.

02:27.400 --> 02:33.320
And since you guys are most likely developers, we also offer command line interface and SDKs.

02:33.320 --> 02:38.880
So if you have KERL and GPG, you can pretty much talk to Passbolt and like pipe the output

02:38.880 --> 02:44.200
of the KERL request to GPG and decrypt the content.

02:44.200 --> 02:49.760
So like it's pretty low footprint when it comes to like working with the API.

02:49.760 --> 02:54.800
We also have like Ansible plugins and like tutorials on how to integrate this into your

02:54.800 --> 02:57.480
GitLab pipelines.

02:57.480 --> 03:02.720
So basically you can use it as a secret manager, not just as a password manager for your team.

03:02.720 --> 03:09.720
You can also store like credentials for machine to machine authentication if you want.

03:09.720 --> 03:15.440
We also provide, one of the goal of Passbolt is to make sure that administrator of a Passbolt

03:15.440 --> 03:17.960
instance do not have to do a lot of work.

03:17.960 --> 03:25.560
So like we provide native packages for Linux distribution, pretty much all major distributions.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.600
And we keep adding some of them.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.440
Like this year we did the end charts.

03:30.440 --> 03:35.240
So if you're one of the cool kids and you use Kubernetes, you can basically get started

03:35.240 --> 03:37.320
with Passbolt as well.

03:37.320 --> 03:42.200
This really low maintenance, we have like people running Passbolt for years and not updating

03:42.200 --> 03:45.440
them and then updating them to the last version with just one command.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.800
So like we try to make your life easy.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.400
Obviously, we are not the only password manager in the space.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.800
So like a lot of people come to me and are like, oh, how are you different from this

03:56.800 --> 03:57.880
and that.

03:57.880 --> 04:02.200
So main difference with KeePass is like KeePass is a file.

04:02.200 --> 04:06.960
So like we are like an API and we do user management.

04:06.960 --> 04:12.360
So KeePass is great if you basically want offline access or if you don't want to share

04:12.360 --> 04:13.600
data.

04:13.600 --> 04:17.200
If you share with KeePass, you're going to have some issues with concurrent access and

04:17.200 --> 04:19.400
versioning.

04:19.400 --> 04:24.320
But it's great if you do not want to have any metadata and you just want a file and everything

04:24.320 --> 04:25.320
is encrypted.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.840
So like KeePass is really great there.

04:28.840 --> 04:34.280
With compared to Vaultwarden and Bitwarden, we have like basically different security

04:34.280 --> 04:38.760
properties like we use a completely random private key.

04:38.760 --> 04:44.280
With Bitwarden, for example, the encryption strength is depending on the password that

04:44.280 --> 04:46.160
is selected by the end user.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.960
So there are other password managers like one password that use a private key, but basically

04:49.960 --> 04:54.920
we are the only other one that does this.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.840
We require the browser extension.

04:56.840 --> 05:03.280
So this is also a key differentiator is that you must install Passbolt browser extension.

05:03.280 --> 05:08.720
Why is in case the server is compromised, an attacker cannot change the application.

05:08.720 --> 05:15.480
So they cannot change, for example, the cryptographic functions or like add some code to extract

05:15.480 --> 05:17.600
the decrypted materials.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.320
So this is one big difference.

05:19.320 --> 05:24.840
So when you access a Passbolt instance, you feel like it's a website, but it's actually

05:24.840 --> 05:25.840
not a website.

05:25.840 --> 05:30.920
It's an iPhone that is inserted in the page and the server cannot basically access what

05:30.920 --> 05:32.360
is in that iPhone.

05:32.360 --> 05:36.080
So it's basically a change of architecture.

05:36.080 --> 05:40.600
And we support, as I said, like nested folders with flexible permissions like in Bitwarden,

05:40.600 --> 05:43.440
you basically create collections and you put items in them.

05:43.440 --> 05:48.520
We basically support granular sharing and granular secret management.

05:48.520 --> 05:54.200
So for example, the secrets in Passbolt are encrypted once per person so that, for example,

05:54.200 --> 05:58.600
if somebody leaves the organization, we are able to provide a revocation.

05:58.600 --> 06:03.240
So it's not like we order Password Manager, which will have like a symmetric key that

06:03.240 --> 06:07.920
is shared with many users and they will not rotate that key for the collection.

06:07.920 --> 06:12.040
So obviously Bitwarden supports features that we don't have.

06:12.040 --> 06:15.120
So that's why people adopt Bitwarden.

06:15.120 --> 06:18.480
But what happened in 2023?

06:18.480 --> 06:27.320
So one of the major events of 2023 that we had is our site of the head of site reliability

06:27.320 --> 06:29.400
management at Passbolt got married.

06:29.400 --> 06:33.360
So we thought it will never happen, but like maybe we can give him a little round of applause

06:33.360 --> 06:37.480
for getting hitched.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.480
Well done, Diego.

06:38.480 --> 06:45.400
Now seriously, this year we shipped a single sign-on with OpenID, Microsoft, and Google.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.240
And I'm very pleased to announce that the OpenID connector will be soon available in

06:49.240 --> 06:50.760
the community edition.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.560
Both community edition and the Pro edition are completely open source.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.720
So they are both under AGPL.

06:56.720 --> 07:02.040
The Pro edition will require you to pay something, but obviously it's open source software, so

07:02.040 --> 07:03.560
you can do as you please.

07:03.560 --> 07:12.280
So we also shipped another interesting feature, which is like TOTP, which allows you to store

07:12.280 --> 07:15.200
your TOTP code into Passbolt and share them.

07:15.200 --> 07:20.720
So should you put your password and your TOTP code in the same application, it is up for

07:20.720 --> 07:22.160
you to decide.

07:22.160 --> 07:27.680
It's interesting, for example, if you want to share them, but if you don't want to put

07:27.680 --> 07:30.840
all your eggs in the same basket, I will understand.

07:30.840 --> 07:35.640
But the same way, like you need to look at all the risks, for example, if you use the

07:35.640 --> 07:41.560
Google Authenticator, if you have the sync enabled across device, your TOTP code are

07:41.560 --> 07:45.960
not end to end encrypted, so you might want to have that as well.

07:45.960 --> 07:49.360
We did also Passbolt.exe.

07:49.360 --> 07:57.200
It's not like my pet project, but like the 80% of the users of Passbolt are on Windows,

07:57.200 --> 08:00.280
so obviously this is something that they wanted.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.960
We plan to support more OS in the future, but we started with the biggest chunk.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.160
So it's a native app.

08:06.160 --> 08:12.760
It's not like a JavaScript application, these guys as an app.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.720
It's a native app.

08:14.720 --> 08:18.400
We did that for security reasons, because there are some properties when you use Electron

08:18.400 --> 08:25.960
that are not so great, so we basically spend a lot of time building that app last year.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.080
We did also a lot of other things.

08:28.080 --> 08:30.400
So we did some performance improvement.

08:30.400 --> 08:34.560
We changed the grid so you can select which columns are there or not.

08:34.560 --> 08:38.080
We introduced some role-based access control for UI.

08:38.080 --> 08:42.040
So for example, if you want your users to have less features, then you can just remove

08:42.040 --> 08:46.720
everything and feel like it's 2005 again.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.600
Then we have also suspend user.

08:48.600 --> 08:53.680
So you can, for example, if Diego is going on Honeymoon and you want to disable his access,

08:53.680 --> 08:55.880
then you can do that.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.600
And we have a lot of policies that were rolled out.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.840
So you can control what is the strength of a password by default, how long should the

09:02.840 --> 09:07.000
passphrase protect the private key, that sort of thing.

09:07.000 --> 09:13.840
So we also had four security audits, one on LDAP, one on SSO, one on our network, and

09:13.840 --> 09:17.080
one on our internal controls and processes.

09:17.080 --> 09:21.400
So we didn't have any major issues, but if you are curious, the reports are available

09:21.400 --> 09:23.080
on our incident page.

09:23.080 --> 09:32.360
And all the audits were made by QoP53, so basically it's legit.

09:32.360 --> 09:37.720
So what's cooking for 2024?

09:37.720 --> 09:41.840
I mean, it was supposed to be released in 2023, so this is coming next week.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.040
It's password expiry.

09:43.040 --> 09:49.400
So when somebody, for example, leave an organization or leave a group, or if you remove a permission

09:49.400 --> 09:55.160
on somebody's access to a secret, then this feature will mark automatically a password

09:55.160 --> 09:57.400
as needed to be rotated.

09:57.400 --> 10:02.120
So this way, as people come and go and access systems, you know which credentials needs

10:02.120 --> 10:03.120
to be rotated.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.800
I think it's a pretty interesting feature when it comes to security.

10:06.800 --> 10:12.160
And for organizations that are like masochists, you can also set policies and, for example,

10:12.200 --> 10:16.920
say, I want all my credentials to be rotated every 40 days and make my employees life a

10:16.920 --> 10:17.920
nightmare.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.640
You can do that.

10:21.640 --> 10:24.360
We also redesigned the admin panel.

10:24.360 --> 10:29.440
So, well, I mean, it's not like a lot of work, but I still think it's neat.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.720
And we have a lot of stuff coming.

10:31.720 --> 10:36.440
Also in the 4.6, we have SSO with ADFS, again, like Microsoft.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.800
But all right.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.160
And then we have a bunch of performance improvements.

10:41.160 --> 10:47.680
So we have people telling us, OK, I have 100, I have 12,000 secrets that are shared with

10:47.680 --> 10:49.560
200 people, and it's slow.

10:49.560 --> 10:50.560
All right.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.280
At this point, is it really a secret?

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
I don't know.

10:53.280 --> 10:59.160
But yeah, we're going to try to make your life a little less miserable.

10:59.160 --> 11:04.400
And we're going to have icons, custom fields, a bunch of other things that are missing in

11:04.400 --> 11:08.800
the software right now, like file attachment and nodes.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.120
And we have seven babies scheduled.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.720
So for a team of 40, we have like, I don't know what happened last year.

11:14.720 --> 11:19.680
I think like the summer of love of Passbolt.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.880
What is it made of?

11:20.880 --> 11:23.280
So the secret ingredient is love.

11:23.280 --> 11:30.560
I'm not going to spend a lot of time, but it's basically a simple PHP LAMP stack and

11:30.560 --> 11:32.560
with a web extension on top.

11:32.560 --> 11:37.240
So the application is split into multiple projects.

11:37.240 --> 11:40.760
The Passbolt API, which is based in PHP.

11:40.760 --> 11:46.240
Why PHP is because any administrator in their life have hosted some PHP, so it's pretty

11:46.240 --> 11:50.200
easy to use and like low maintenance is very stable.

11:50.200 --> 11:53.360
And we have the web extension on top, which is like split into two.

11:53.360 --> 11:56.360
We have a React app, which controls the UI.

11:56.360 --> 12:01.160
And we have what we call the background page, which is a separate application.

12:01.160 --> 12:06.960
And the front end and the back end to talk through a series of API.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.520
This is to make sure that anything phishing and happening on the front end can be controlled.

12:11.520 --> 12:16.320
So we have like a choke point where we can define like, is it normal for the front end

12:16.320 --> 12:18.480
to do these kind of things?

12:18.480 --> 12:23.760
So if you want to look at the JSON API, we have basically documentation online.

12:23.760 --> 12:28.120
And if you want to look at the style guide, it's based on storybook.

12:28.120 --> 12:35.040
So basically you can add or customize your teams without having to build the entire thing.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.760
And this is how we split the work.

12:37.760 --> 12:42.720
We have people working on the front end and we have people working on the back end as well.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.320
So I'm not going to take questions.

12:46.320 --> 12:50.640
But one of the things I wanted to tell you is that at 2 o'clock, we will be next to the

12:50.640 --> 12:54.600
bar and we will be like spinning the wheel like we did last year.

12:54.600 --> 13:01.360
And this year, the price is a picture of Mackey, which is our office dog.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.720
It's my price position.

13:03.720 --> 13:08.320
So if you want to come get it, it's at 2 in front of the bar.

13:08.320 --> 13:08.920
Thank you very much.
