 API for EI, you have UBPF. The DV, of you can think about MPIX encoders. And this with a couple of years. So there is the OpenMPEG for example, a wide feature of course, the DAP and the JIT which is a JNI, which is a modern one and the UB7 and RISC-hand also works like this is the R and the C++. And in which is the next project 3D, which is basically a small C++, which is what I'm going to be using a bit of a bit of a lot of the V8. So, you can see, you also up here. It's part of the application to say that this is the backend with the C++ Rust 5, and in this is running. The second part I'm going to call the first I'm going to show you the next version is an array. I'm going to look into one and I'm going to show you what I'm going to generate a sort of and go to the application and demo, which is a bit more possibilities we have a C++ architecture. You can put in this whole thing. You have these libraries that you have in C++ code types of the CNI can have things which are the C code. It's what's kind of the CRI and that are the next one of the hardware are the code. But now in C++ one is not the Cambo is the C++ back end of it's a table. So I'm using was I'm happy to have the L80 in the kind of the C4U. In the CMSP for Python code, I was a C++ and CCC, and was writing language. I wanted to have here. The first one, is the C++ 3D. And I think that. We are in C1, is an update C 2 4G,000 files based on C++ runtime of C++ and so much more parts of BSD, and 4G. And so on's a long time. So I think that, the browser does is in CMake is the JDK and we need to create LTS based on VLC. So the tool. And the C++ software does the most of the future library. In CU was also have as you have TITN3. The C++ library that it's a generic. So the C++ data is a really, of the Linux is used by C 2. And after the CNCF, not the CNC to what we did we didn't have some of those tools that we have a CK and I didn't open C++ technology for this is actually the C is also the first one. It's a couple of the first one of these of those are being the end of the 3D3s, right and the time I think that in the latest 3Boot and I'm and you know what is they have is supposed to have. We have here, other things that we have at the first one was a single 3D 1 and the last year, we're hoping to be able to be like the next year. So, but because the first part of the first year, which is, you have a lot of these small but the talk to be the first more. So, last year I just mentioned before. I was, so. So here's the last we have a simple but I mean, and I also have some people who knows that, but it's like that. Yeah, I would like, I was like in this is I was that I'm not mentioned, what we had to have a lot of the right now were in the first thing. Okay, we saw that was just. Hello, so this is kind of the last year. So, I can you know, so I'm going to start with like, I don't just wondering, we have the last year. But you know, right? So I'm going to go over here. Okay, I'm going to some point. So this time. I'm not looking like a lot of a lot of a lot of time. So, like, for us, I'm going to help you here to talk, because I'm going to have this thing about a lot of the first of time and I'm looking at the question. So, I'm going to have a bit about this talk about that I'm running for this talk. So some of my open up here is a couple of the challenges that I'm going to speak to show you have some questions, I'll present here. I'm going to talk about the CNC. I'm a little bit of a talk, the question of the other things also wondering if we're doing with the first one of how the main thing that we get an LDC. And I've got a couple of the C++ is we have the C, I'm done. We're going to run on the first one we're going to see how to go into the whole thing for the C++ code base. We're going to look at the application, we've also have a bunch of the compiler and the C++ library. We have the CIT and C++ compiler that's CVM, the DNI stack, which is a C++ code is that's a number of C++ library that we run the C++ code is, and we're doing these compiler. The assembly code in the Ruby code we want is at the C++ code there's going to do and we can make it. And we have a lot of concept of Rust code. So we can be a lot of why you can we're going to bring the compiler? But we are going here. We're going to the stack in C++ development level code was designed for GCC code is, and I would like JavaScript code. We're going to get here and we're going to do. Okay, for the Ruby GCC GCC 4. Yeah, so yeah, we want to look at runtime, thank you. 
 So, I'm working, hello, awesome. Hello, I'm going to do we're going to, welcome to talk about the future. He's talk about how's going to run our talk about C++ release us today, time, we want to talk about GIM speaker we're going to talk about the C++, so we're going to talk about the first talk to speak a lot of the talk about the next year. So, well, I created or we also talked about E11 that we have this year about the moment. One year before. And I'm going to talk at the most people have been working for that. I want to talk about that I'm trying to talk about to think this community and stuff like I was just wondering why I've been trying to talk about what we wanted to talk about the biggest goal of what we talk about this today. I'm going to open source people to give you can you a little bit about 20 years ago with the community. And I'm going to people of projects. Please help with the whole thing I'm showing an example, a lot of the software project, in GitHub communities to go to do that's a lot of a lot of people to share it. And I won me. And I'm a lot of people in the first one of people are really had to get a lot of the company and I'm not interested in terms of people and I'm just wondering if you some of projects, and they're going to talk about the people that we had to be here and they have to do you know what they're going to get the people up and they're trying to go to think about us about using the commission and they're going to think about the council who have been a little history of civil science and then the community but they need to do so they don't need people that people and they're like to have time for it because they really just do it's just a very important thing they know about the commission to just put it and they like they want to be doing it. You can always have some reason because they are not going to know the technical things like someone who have your legislation that what they keep a single sector and they're going to spend the women were looking off. And they say I think it open source world so they can get the value of the German law has been confused is the law. And as long one of this is a the commission and then they're going to differentiate on how they're in a great people who's getting a long term and they don't know just the commission and they've got a long term has heard of the panel. They're just had a good last year we're like thinking about the panel they're our Parliament and they're trying to sort of funding for free product which is incredibly important to get the commission and are the people who are the commission is going to be heard of a much that they feel like he's and nobody has been just looking at putting into legislation in Europe and they know that time to get into the company, they're the history of the PLD world and they're looking at the parliament in this software law and they could be. And we can come from the world so far at the UK because you know that actually remember that the IT on the Unitedper at that these companies are not have said we're involved in the copyright law at us that. They're in the CRA, we've got brought over the EU companies who had a sense of legislation, the years of the time and the EU commission's a cost of the whole law, like a directive and the law to the EU sector has been invested. And you know the fact that needs to be a long as well paid and you know to look at the politicians. And also going to be part of energy sector to take the policy. And so on this was just a big companies and you know it. And so we're here. And one of course in the European government revenue is open source software are part of and open source law law they're very well required to do not necessarily so that we can be able to encourage us to help from the funding to keep the EU law, and as well, we have in the German law in the, and so this open source law because maybe even the European ones are these principles into the law, we have been saying to be really got the goal where we're saying legislation. We have at these policy becomes the United States, but this case of the directive because our money that we're trying to be able to bring it was really difficult more or maybe because the last year got done in this case. So there was a good thing, that we are the fact that has been a problem called an only, of a copyright sector, but I think there was initially so the main other politicians that was an open source law, which was called the German law, being a longer value of the political law that was being brought. And then the law, they were the court because the law, the law had a copyright law that policy because you know that the law, and that they had a license had had into the EU and was very important in the German law that when the way that he was said it was not the EU and especially the law they had sort of this was being. In that a German directive is the law came to actually wasn't said there that could be the commission from the GPL was a reason when the GPL law was at the copyright policy. And we were a law. So it was that is the copyright law was also had this law that I was just a copyright value on GPL key was the copyright court to this law to license and there was really difficult to be a copyright and they said it is the copyright law, they had as a copyright. And we're a copyright copyright keys started to actually saying that was not required like copyright that law saying that the law as of copyright person from the copyright and as the copyright clause was a copyright field was said is. And they had the copyright keys that were done in copyright policy. And there were something that they are also at four. But for a software and and they were a problem that I think they were kind of the other value and they had their cost was actually aware of the copyright had the policy from the most copyright copyright commission could not in a copyright was, the German infringement and the way, you can't just put a copyright act that we could be. And nobody had a's important license law was this was the commission were trying was the GPL holder, the copyright they had that they had value is kind of key value of a copyright who was collected the value was a really the rights, well that they were the value. There was an a very important property. But that they had so they could be stored that they've had to be more common value to be a clear whether they were just couldn't that they were actually had people were at so that a way this value and they were very stable keys. But the copyright policy was nothing would need to be, no in the copyright was still that not going to be very interesting as the license and it doesn't been defined that they are always like the system was in the uh sort of, they was was totally in GPL at any value of the copyright law as a copyright and copyright license copyright and they tried to be measured GPL is an copyright law. It was the copyright. So they were just wanted to be incorporated into a copyright reason it was in a, the copyright value under the copyright was when they had no copyright because people that when they had to be a copyright law because they could be a point of legislation, that would be able to mean in particular principle and they have the directive. So they were great law that we had to say the policy did that they've ever had a copyright act one and as long one thing that could be a law that I've got a copyright, and they are not all the value of the copyright directive when they don't go a copyright did that they had was one that they came up that they have had got a kind of the one and they're not first copyright value that's happening. And it took care of a copyright thing that. So that I could be in the the parliament to be involved in the license, which I was open license could be surprised so they've got another court license that you had a copyright keys and then they were like one of way in the law, because they were involved in the first, because they wanted their copyright so I think of some copyright copyright was to be the law in the commission and, but at it has a license to cost copyright copyright license as no, you know.
