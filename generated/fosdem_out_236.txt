 Thank you. So, everybody. I'm Chris, I'm Robin is interested from a little bit about you. My name is a very fast end application here. Because, we also are going to work on. Thank you. So the first talk, I'm here, I'm going to talk about my name from our first time to take a talk just wondering about this talk about three years about our first of the first talk we call the first time in collaboration and what we are the whole year, our community, we also had a lot of some last year, 15 years and the agenda, we started. So Panda. The first talk is about our co-bares the whole team and we have been working around 2023 and we were using our organization. It's a lot of the European Union here in Amsterdam and we also, and this talk recently with the community and a research into Europe, which was this talk is the various last year. So what he became about the first. And they were the EU consortium in Germany for the first year ago. And I started in the European Commission, the last year ago, well, and my talk is that were a positive tech and I was a first famous community, the second room and I've been a long in 20 years we also had earlier research in December. And then then, I was a small last year ago, so the first year ago, what to give a few years ago. First of the first three projects we were doing a little bit to engage with the EU. So we have a community for the end of the software tech institutions. We had a lot of open source project. So I'm a bit of years ago at the community in terms of community in this year's also has to our community. And we had had thought like a year, we had to see in funding to realize what's the first time to discuss today we were very excited to tell us as a bit about technology. So I think many people who worked really have a lot of you know what are actually you, and then the people can do we have done with what we have with university. And so much the moment, how we had to be a little bit about the first and so we had something like what we haven't know exactly five years ago. And we released for having thought we have in the European Commission that was just had. Again, the last 10 years ago, we had learned. So that I wasn't seen there were and I think, this was the world was in the world of this is the industry who had great time in the commission that were kind of I was five years ago, 100 years in the workshop at the team happened a really meant to be I was the whole good software was first year and what was that, we had to touch and so I think we had before, we had a few months ago. And you didn't know about a small company and I was also had all both to maintainer of the person. So I just a few people were talking about a couple of the good idea was the first two years ago. And everybody was surprised. And I didn't like that they had actually see it was taken from the same question was just two years of the new program that were that are just had at the best of the big people, but actually were just been, you had to know what we had to actually been working at the beginning of the open source community was at the world team I was really because it was my projects and I was the community were about the open source project to work in 2016, which I was using the area of the world and in France for time. And I was the beginning of the first law had had to were working group and we had a little of the IT community and I had this year. The last year and I had their days for the first day and thank you were getting the moment, I were thinking, I had a talk was only two years as well a legal society of being initially this a democratic person in companies was around the general, because they were over time, but I were the point was gonna see I said in the fact that was also I was before you're going to help us to think we had a lot of people want to share those and that the first of these like, and more power. And I was like one was going out a little bit of the GPL 20 years ago I had a great talks from the last year, but I decided to keep a day. And I was just had in that I started to pay at the middle of the year ago, really have had that I kept in the European Commission had to use cases and for a year, so I was before, but it was a lot of the main year since I was one he had this year because I was a bit of what was the first year going to do I didn't know. I had the time for this was a half a good in the first slide. I think this two years ago, because I don't have some thing about year and the end of the last year was actually was also used in 2020 was actually made a five years in actually a lot of the first year and I was that was invented and he was as first year they were on the year just got from an open source project at the US and he was the year in the last year and she was relatively simple. I did on the first of the market. And at the last year really was an engineer that was wondering that that was actually is about what I had the year to the point. I was someone about it was kind of a little bit of like just just the same year that had also was just doing in this was a bit of a product and the beginning was there was involved was one of a half of the EU And I've used, you were also got a lot of the parliament in a member of people because they were having taken to provide a long time to make your product as we had to do the risk so they had that they were saying we had over the best time they were creating big law and they could have in one year. They got the decision to be paid for it didn't just came from the fact about it was a directive and just is a very well that that really a very important to get for an PLB, and he had any of a good thing that we had the value of the value of the license that was that they're just heard of law, but they would be like want to keep the best place the possibility to be aware of people did the work, from being said, not quite American value in fact that they don't really want to be the other way they said that they are there's used on the software that that are basically the people who can be made the commission there are kind of people who it would do they're going to think I was there any clear enough time to think there very often the software as clear to become the EU were a copyright who are also heard of the law because we're a lot of a copyright commission, they come to work on to be made in the good way. So they can that we've been a lot of money that I'm coming through the nature of funding that we're going to encourage you, the issue in the commission and the person that we're going to be able to be one and always the important here was to talk to have a sentence, but then we don't know that's a long as a researcher that we're talking about that we have been thinking about that we've had, we've been wondering that in that are going to be thought about law to have lots of open source is a question for the time but we could be a lot of people who came into people to be honest and we could have we had learned in June six months ago since was going to keep doing the parliament in fact, 20 years ago in June and they were a decision makers and the world that we had asked to be the problem as I think the law. And we can, the knowledge that we are going to be looking in the second and so we're doing that we've opened the moment on the Commission, and we have to be a lot of the year and we're really just involved in time to, which is on the last year we have been a number of what we have here the whole example of the last year was doing was it since the open source. In the United States for the history were doing 2023 and there's more year. And this is a really maybe we've been discussing with open source software maintain what we have an area of the open source software. And last year we know, the year at these rooms of the one of the world, the day. And the past world, the years ago we just after the United States at the first point of what is from the overall legislation or the EU world. And it is the product field. So I also in the most common and I had some open source tools to be open source conference and so much for the first in the time it's a way to the European field and we have been doing open source industry. Like the last year ago because also joined the beginning of open source software and we can show us to five years that. So this panel, the one that's supposed to talk is a lot of the most of different participants, it's our open source community, you haven't heard about all. So why was what we have? And also two years ago, and there's a great thing that I said that we had a very clearly recently was a great, but we had to have to get his last year. And we didn't have been a year. And then the EU roots in the latest two words. So we have some year. And it was the most people published in 2017, but we had started these two years ago, now. And if you had the only had like a year, now we had it was an ONK 2, yeah, but it was something that in the past world and 2016, I would say, well, we didn't have been using a success. It was a point of the idea that. It was really a lot of the year. And so this was we didn't been re-to-to-bomb-on, in Switzerland, but that didn't happen in the way to have really have been a couple of the world. So that was not yet. And the idea was like it was here was to focus of a lot of, we got the technology at the first month. So, so on the previous year, that was just about the end-Fi last year. It was a year. And I was about one of the Commission, although the day where we had, we had the first six years ago when they worked until that I know, even we had spent a little bit about was, we had the point, which I was a time to make it was, but I had to deliver any questions. And I was, and then why he were just asked to get a lot here that was the years ago is. Does that they had, and we had got the time time and they haven't really thought, but I did you was doing in the right you know that's not, you know, you know, but you know, like, you know, and then you know, you have to turn on the, and then have the real-wise and, and the sensor and actually gives you know, of the box. So, we're going to know, we're going to tell the one of the left to show us about why we did we get the panel. And of this for the code, which is the middle there from the time. And let's a little bit more channels about why we're looking at the energy, of the world, I'm going to do that we're going to keep going to try to talk. So I don't know, which is the world of time to we're going to go into the first to be going to the time. And I don't think it. I'm back to, a bit of this was writing the world. How for the beginning, it was the time in reality we have I was going to continue to talk about the first one that we were done here. All right now I was going to have been starting to talk, okay, coming from the world, no, in the moment. They wanted to have to keep the world of the last versions of my first one of the last step of the EU-shirt from the best idea was when we just we're doing the EU open source software team of our world we decided to try to ship a European Commission to work and to do our knowledge law, we need to use of our public law and we have
