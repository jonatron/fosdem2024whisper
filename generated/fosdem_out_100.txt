 Okay, hello everyone. The second we tried a user interface to create the LLMs and use. Can you call a command to the command to have a request that we will be able to the server via a server. See, okay? Just to configure the server to go to some configuration because we can go to the server and set the server, we have this particular connection is used to declare. We have it. We can integrate this. We need to export our server and look at the server in an application for this box, but this way very simple. And I'm using a node to file a command base and load your cluster is a server is your server. And if you want to sign the server to create the server, in a deploy that is using and that's a user if you're using your server, create the server to open user, this this we have the process. So like the server can only node is here with the prompt, it's going to be called authenticate. We have to find the server. We need to, put it to think we also need to do our server. That's a server. You can do other services. And if I want to add the server. Everything is going to deal with an I want to be able to store this if we have the server. You can have a server to create a server into a server. You cannot call the server. And to start API for example. You also a DNS or server provider. You have a server, and then send the server. And then you don't want to the client. And because you want to create a client IDP server, for in, you can, you don't have to start to download it. And if you have to use it's already want to get a server, you need to go to go to it. Also we have a config and then run any server. So if you all of the server, if your server will be very important back to go to the server for that's going to the server. And also like a server. So the room. You need to have to see in this conference. You can see that. There's a user has a server. So now it's a web server that in this client page to be. You have the client, the server, and you want to go ahead and add it's a server to, you could be available to the server, then have a certificate to download server to the server. So, you still the server. And then it's going to also a server and the server. So now you want to get there's going to turn to the client client to the server, and then this's going to enter the DNS server, you have to open to show them in the server. So you some methods on server server's going to continue in the server that would be using to stop it. What would like to the server up. You don't have the client? So it's going to have the server for back to be able to send the server to the client. It's going on the client now. So this server. I'm going to try to do this. And, I'm going in this side. I'm going to start to do that I'm a client. So I'm going to write it's going to start. Okay, I'm going to do the server, some demo because I'm going to be building server to show people. We want to create a server client and then we want to get a user side where you guys are going to the server is going to create a server if you to start that. You need to start with a service and so that's going to do. So what's going to do we want to start to give you, so we want to start people using client, and you want to have some of the server and you all of the server that we want to the ID encrypted server, so do you want to have to create a server for that are trying to have to be an's going to modify my servers, but that you want to add, the server to start the server, it's going to deploy everything. And then somebody else you want to, but it's going to keep the client? If you can run that, if you can want to do those who's going to have to go at the on, I'm just plug to this. And of the client to that was happening and then we have some room, okay, you have a client with most people. And all the services to make this service's the app, in that the server, we're the server and we need to get your user needs to be using the server. And to look at the client side, we also focusing on the server to interact with the server, but you're going to do is going to talk about this. But okay, this is going to start up the server to happen in a server and it, just the server, we have a, we have a server. So, good to be copied on, okay, I think we are also need to show you a laptop to keep a very quickly. Let's what you basically for, I think this project? Sorry, the server we have been working on the page and there. We're going to be able to talk about, I'm going to start in the next speaker here. The room as I'm not sure, come from the server? Yes. Okay, the server and I guess that I'm good. No, let's what I'm going to do in the room. Yes, I am we're going to keep your server to like a your app, I'm using GitHub, I'm going to have some questions, the Ophono, but now. These are going to be, one server, your server, have some links to do. But that's going to use. I think that's going to look at a server for the server. So, we're the time. We have a bit more questions, I'm a talk about the room. So, we're going to that we're going to be talking about the client. And I'm going to talk about the server at the server, I can be here. Okay, I will have to be the server, if you can be able to think about the user. Okay, the client will start up, go to go to the server to the DNS server, and see, your server, you can just want to,. So, you can also use a client to deploy that you can not, if you can see that you can be messed up and for it's just be really like login is getting a server. I see that. And the client has the server, you're welcome to do I'm going to now about, you're going on and we're going to follow the client's the server, this room to do we have this, I'm going to remember. I would like a next session, what you're going to explain a first presentation in the open, because I'm going to this talk about the presentation, that I'm going to present a slide. I spent the first time. Okay, we have very welcome our meetings. And he's welcome to talk for free to the meeting and I'm going to be not going to be wondering, really a huge for listening, so I'm just wondering. We have the beginning. And I was wondering the end, I have seven years. We need to present this to start because when we're going to introduce power, we're going to talk about this issue that we never thought we're going to show you. And it was going to do this is this. So I'm going to try to highlight, with a short. And he's going to talk about the last year we're going to review the big one of the whole talk. And then. So our projects are going to talk about and we're doing the last year. So I'm a couple of the last year. I'm going to talk about Mozilla as we talked about it, and the German ITs was that can we have a lot of two years, four years ago. And for free. And we have a very, we keep thinking about the way that we have a challenge. And then we can also know what are going to discuss. So I'm going to do we will like the PLD and we want to have the context and we're going on the challenges, and when we are going to be talking about the people to be working on the first one and we're going to be able to scale in the presentation. We're going to introduce our year. And as this is in terms of the moment we've been integrating a topic where we're going to be talking about this is also a good and we're going to look for this question. So we're going to think about just about another question. So of the only kind of the last year is we're a little bit of open source world because we have been using the first eight years ago before. And the founder of the best. And we're building a great open source projects and there are building people about open source projects are the world are talking about the projects of the future users are some years and researchers so we are really know that open source community. So for the EU organizations who are in the goal we have maybe a lot of the world. And we may not just have been thinking about the projects, since we want to talk of open source community act free software and we want to be the world and we have two years in France in the world. And so I had 15 years ago the reason it was just in general and we're going to try to introduce you to make a big one of some point about this talk to start with our community. And we have a couple of the community engineer at the things they're going to have been heard about the first thing. Because we've been doing something that we're going to be a half a lot of the people to have this, but there is in the challenges based on the first-source community can be a long term of their rights and the world has been out there there in January, but the last year and so the project at the German world. And the world that if we did we're talking about the world, we talked about our research from the world. We've got in June 10 years ago. So we've got to ask you know about the beginning of a community model that we've been doing the technical product. So basically have much more money in the world. So I know, I think we do we know the first question was thinking about the world here, the technical terms of the negotiations, we can we started to share our organization, we're going to our current EU. And yeah so many people think about the EU is we've been doing it that people who was trying to do is sort of EU organizations that exist here today, so much energy is the EU standards alliance is a European Commission? How would be energy is really important for the world, what we're going to do we don't have funding to be here from the Commission and there, so. Yes, so just as well, they are basically for being so that we're going to get up and we are going to solve the world to work on a pivotal project that they're going from the product, I think, but the time to present the time to be even for the current source and a knowledge of a community in the world. But I'm going to be going to be going to be there that this is our goal to that were a very important to learn from us in this point for us to have done in that we're going to look at the very old world. And so we have already got to show that little bit of its first one person would be a good saying we should be able to be in some people to start to try to let's think that for us were the idea so the main point. So he's see all the second and we have all have as we're a single decade to really big question a lot of the world. So we're going to have a little bit of the last one of the time to have the European Commission and we try to be aware of the way in that you that we just showed a bit of what we were doing this year if it was a professor in Norway were trying to be on the time so we're not going to do in a little bit of the last year over a bit of the last year ago. I'm only two months ago. I have been in the first year. And I was talking about us at the first ones and I think you are at the time but I said okay when coming from the panel that we're starting is also going to be talking about the technical people because and so we have going to be sorry thank you know that over to present alone like 10 years. And I'm saying I'm just wondering that we have happened to start by this year and I was wondering what you so I was wondering? So I'm going to be wondering it was wondering if you haven't know that, you have been introducing me again see how much as a power or if you have been asking like in the microphone and it's also works in the questions. But we did I'm able to ask. So, you. I'm going to accept this question. So I'm going to do we're going to highlight it and as easy to talk about this talk here but this is kind of the right now we want to talk. This is a very important question but the question was it is that I was to be a year was the whole slide you know the microphone. So first two years ago. And I'm going to talk about a little bit because this is a few years ago is that was not the answer is the first of how we are our question was saying that every week we haven't have a little bit of the work. We have some people who we know what we have present on over the next slide? Hello. It was just wondering about how to talk about the question. The question was. Thank you heard about a question. 
 Hi, before doing that was, that you. I spend the question was moving to me, if you. I'm going to my talks to work with my presentation. I was speaking here. I just wondering, so we had to give a power. Okay, we had a little bit of this and he was the screen. It brought a little bit of doing, and the internet to have been a bit of the screen, and I ended up three years ago was very, and the computer. I was not just asked about the challenges. We've
