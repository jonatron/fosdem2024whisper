 We talk about how it works for us. So it's already a little bit of a test that you run. We take a minute to try to build this kind of thing that we see there. We're not going to be running. And that was the new run into a project within containers. We have a container image that actually the top of that we're going to do something that. And that's a lot of these in the container is going to be going to have to build us there and stuff. We're going to work that is we really the package that we're going to be going to work in this project we're going to be able to do this because we need people who have to buildable and doing this is that need to work. And we just kind of work for the last day, but we want to actually kind of the work we have a lot of code. And when we have to break our work, it's going to be very important for it out to be just a new version of a project and we're going to do this and we're doing. We're going to get these new people going to start. Because we have our GitHub community that we're going to do that's going to start the, where we need to our community project that we're going to actually a side to we're going to call us and we're going to do our research and we're going to do it forward back to do that we'll discuss our community into the project and we want to encourage people on the other government there's going to look for a lot of our community and we have a general that. We are in the context for all the product community's what we're going to do we do we're going to start to keep working on them and we're going to talk about a lot of people are going to ask me about that. We're talking about our questions? So we're going to we don't just a bit about our project for those last week, what we're going to look at the number of this person who will be very often we're going to just coming out the communities. And we're going to do our first of the first one of a community that I'm going and's going to get to talk about that it in the slides. So the people can come off and so much more about us for somebody who speak about it for the world, so much. So we're going to be the years ago. And so the last year were in the last year ago we're going to focus on that we are going to talk, but how do we had in the workshops and we've been seeing this thing we don't know this? So we have all, our talk about 10 years of the community engineer, we'd like you can jump to talk and we've been getting this on and we'll be for us in the world. So if we are trying to our goals there. So we have a society's a whole software project to get to work on the Drupal but we're talking about technology at the organizations I said. They can't have a person to have a young people who ask about people, so. But when they have been the law and they also for a project and they've seen a lot of the beginning of legal product. So for people were a great companies, we have been working at some of time at the world and they don't know what we've been talking about was we're not going to get a whole organization in the software. We're going to start the CRA, they have a bad to be in this year years ago. It was really you last year. And we've got a lot of the moment about a lot. We've had a lot of time at our first six months ago on all the company of us had three weeks and we were able to do was had a year and in Germany in the CRA and a lot of the world where there were being a lot of time. We want to have been working year. And we want to get a few people that they're going to get the German States and then going to go into their product away against the law are we had so we had a good law that we've got spent the moment last time and we don't want to do we've got a German product on the good answer that we're going to get a good thing to make a long time away and we're going to understand a member of the history to do that very quickly want to get a lot of an open source world in the railway so on the world and we're going on the source law and we know exactly the first the EU law. Like we're going to be an court directive and we need to see what the law is the market of saying that the world. It's going to do is probably have a value of a question. We're not able to be able to assume that they're going to find each year for their knowledge about in the commission or at the license is not about in the commission and they're sort of being known as a question that the world to have taken the best thing that the product that are in the copyright law. So therefore that's a law and it's the court that you know what was really you know what you can do I think it's important right of what you know if you know we started because you're going to have to look at like that the first question and what we just had that's like the regulation so I think we would like at least looking at the possibility to be in the time so I ended up to you to be just like you know that's about the most clear and we probably for joining the law that they just how we do the most important thing and I had to get an end and in that the other product perspective because they already are not that they were very challenging to work and they actually the licenses and so they have to do they just they've been just the company from the market to be in the copyright has even harder to be so he's like a representative of money for us as well for more people and they know that they're generally in the commission and they know this notion and sometimes we still have the person and they're three answers how do not just what they know there and they're doing what they can be the person that I'm going to be taking the way to talk to keep the issues in i think people that but they're doing and they can be kind of the software i think they're involved in that they're like to make the German CRA who've heard but they have like it's you can be the commission and they have the copyright thing that many people know and that they're like the I think that you're not as the GPL license should be what they know is the moment I have had their copyright so I think the in the key and so far I think they know to have not only one thing we don't know the fact but they're going on the key in the city but it is the copyright law but it means that the way to be in terms of the law to think yeah we don't have the German law right as Mike but you know but it's here and I think I think that I know about the third laws is it's going to uh different legal things that bad for the copyright would be in the GPL but yeah there's important what is the licenses so just very interesting because the policy the copyright policy is that it was that I think that like when they could be a decision? Because this data from the policy. I have a cost that are so I think of the law and the law was very important part that society is that they are related to be interesting issue saying but not. You have to these mechanisms and they need to actually to think that the political license and this is actually the reason not the licensee is the copyright because the reason that we have is going to know I want to have a commercial or less energy and they go and there was a policy that most of that they have as clear people that we don't looked at the fact that we have heard and they are doing so they may be the last decade of the CRA was very important in the copyright law was so with the court and that just so you know exactly if you know the current law and they also was useful in the EU act as far it has for free software rights and we need to have learned at the community in most important then they have more people who says that they are really need the CRA about the civil copyright law and they wanted to know what we was we've said last one of the commission the fact that we're not least on the only one and the world the German law in the copyright law from the scope is from the directive over the law to this panel, the value clause came in the uh and they know we were they're asked in an law and they were kind of sense that the EU law and people is in the policy as a very copyright policy being organized in the EU law and they said, I would be the law no good so other regulation rights and they were made down and to the directive of openness in the value in that the commission so there might not only one year that they would be kind of open market say in the law and they know that they said that they are also to really do the value and they have this copyright and the time's to be aware of big issue of the main uh that is that was making is very easily to copyright holder all at an regulation because they have at the policy and they had some copyright clause is the law will be that is long that they have not aware that they heard more important to the commission court that they were here but I don't think the commission and they are not too much always means that the law effect of that the decision the EU agencies were a representative and they were always means there were to be linked the law and in the act laws that they exist in each court and they have heard that's value that I know of court that they have always been the fact that they're useful in the fact that we had had to actually been in the political value in the main value of the value of the license of law then they were told the commission only law law of the German law they didn't seem to German copyright google are in June law is good the directive in the law and they could be the law but they had any law and the best copyright law or law is still the public the violation in the court was a directive that should be removed the act in the license as long was given copyright license and say no license law was a law. They would an rights and they often in that they would be aware of law to be in law so right law not as I want to take this value of law court for the energy law in just is at the law is no infringement and third to be mandatory work that the copyright policy and cost parliament to uh law law and if they don't think of public law be the copyright act in the impact. I was always know that was very good no source no cost so far that law so can we've been aware of the last was totally. And then what the fact I guess I think in the court law did I thought that was putting a copyright law that I think we didn't think it was it was saying there was not sure I didn't know the person that I know exactly right and i had a law and you know absolutely and you said I'm done a court has been this. Okay the copyright since I was asking and the law we had been paid to make it so it was the law's not needed the American, first thing because not just sort of the copyright holder. Well that's a law now. I think people was like it was wondering from the law in the market so I was saying that she was why it was to say the law and the world and the GPL. And I was the idea of the software a the value who is that because he was essentially that he was in German law that we had exactly, so we are. So in clause was that there was how we were a policy is going to make a value in Asia and when people have organized you have that decision now have a law said in the law and then that you have to be the term of the copyright industry no copyright right thing of the directive. And that the copyright really matters that, but the rights in space when we do a license of a GPL government, but you're not do not only. Thank you're being aware. I'm not heard in fact that point is a value and the license in terms of a copyright law is actually the parliament are going to throw down to be able to be an German law and the commission law happens to be in the best world. I also in Europe, because the law was just a way. So I was really glad and for him the commission is not very bad problem that the legislation was doing their copyright would be a value in that the law. When you a value to have a copyright idea of the company, I was we wanted to speak the idea. I think that in the GPL initially just don't know, that they got a copyright law, right, okay, but I'd have no matter of the German commission, so of then a law that he started. I've been an law that they did, so they've discovered that was now they're going to the copyright in terms of people were thinking that we need to be asking that a copyright. I'd like, are they would really worried to do a very interesting thing to be spent the license? So we was the fact, one of an effort would be a clear industry of the way to be this issue to do that they would be a closed source policy and they just not just don't have a license, but they're to get a value to be a value or but you know I didn't think there was not a license, no copyright, you know what they should be what they don't have been having a law they were the end? No, like that's not the copyright value. Of course in that's a great thing that people, I think it was an impact of the copyright that we know that, like, oh, no, maybe yes, I said it'm really, and for your certification that I think it's that like no has some of a copyright and there are the license law and they said and they're the law and many copyright was a they know that they actually exists. So there's right? And so they had worked because they are a court law and they were still they're not to follow those right then they could feel at the copyright, and they're trained in the law and they were no so they were added their parliament are doing always taken a license legal law, right to the law. And that they
