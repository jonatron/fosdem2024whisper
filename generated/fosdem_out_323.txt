I'm welcome to work in the first talks regarding his next stage and I'm very first year, the agenda, and then talking about the first time, I am last year we have like I'm Ku, and here, even a year. It's wondering. I'm going into 20 and what was wondering. So. I have a talk is today we talked about the great. So, these are today. And I'm going to start at a very late community. I'm going on it is very high-party project behind the previous talk about a long time. I'm moving to I'm sorry, I'm going to my phone, the University from the presentation. So, I'm going to take me for the best challenges. I'm going to talk about one of the talk. He's going to open source, who was going to be a little bit what I was? My name. I'm going to talk about this presentation that I'm calling a great. I'm just wondering to run this talk about the community that my radar from the University of data were supposed to see. So I'm here's going in the journey, I can I'm going to create a researcher in the open source project. So, I'm going to speak about, my background of my first story. So I'm working on my first one's an open source software. And I'm going to introduce a little bit of examples, I'm going to talk about the creator of the year, and I'm just wondering, but I'm you to introduce you a few minutes ago. I'm going to be having to see your talk about this is wondering and I'm going to use on what I'm going to be looking at the workshop who we have also going to get. It's go to be an hour to be able to the panel. So I'm going to talk is, I'm going to talk about is exactly why I'm coming out on how I'm going on the community and about this. I'm a developer and I'm going to do I'm going to be talking about the first of projects. I'm going to be very curious about different things. And I'm going to get some part of this conference in the product, I'm going to kind of the engineer at the goals, but I'm going to introduce the talk about what I'm going to get to work about it, of the money, I'm doing. And so I'm happy to give some of a little bit to this to come back to the end of the day at the European Commission. Sorry, everybody. I'm also we're not using the moment. So maybe I'm, I'm the first one of our first talk to give you need to the PLDox and I'm going to have the best to present I'm more on the parliament in the EU initiative for the European Commission and the market, I am I'm just sorry and I'm going to discuss a last year. So I was wondering about the panel and the one who we're going to be talking about the day in the world. We're going to be looking at the European Union. I'm going to keep the public team? So I think I'm a public sector. It's very much of the last year, we've been doing a European Commission. That was about the European Union and we had a really seen that would like, which has been in Europe. We have the first one of my first plan to talk about the most of the EU product of a national tech so that we had for the European Commission since a company, and the commission, or the impact of the EU and we had half a part there were trying to present I was the various Commission. The commission. The most interesting talk is the Parliament. Unfortunately, how we had a few months to tell a good thing that we've got in the EU Union were using the first, so we have been created and especially for the technology and we had said, okay, we have the European Commission also have also have to be able to be used in policy as well as the foundation of the European Union, but we have been working year. And so many the whole foundation and and a thousand years of the time, we had basically have that's the year then we are using the previous year. And then to have been doing EU society, but of the European Parliament, each of the end we are the EU and the money, now we have a full German federal Commission with our railway. And then these open source world as part of research, it's the EU that we have been working for open source is a huge, but last year. So in France, you can we have a high level government railway sector, we have research and we have been because in the co-profit is about the definition that we've been doing Open Source. And we had been saying these two years and here is the European Commission at the only one main Commission and we had as a lot a very happy to be in terms of open source at least another German rights of open source companies are quite difficult to think, but not the year to do I think we're not using the world. And that decision so we have is that the EU-called scientific institutions as well, when we were the EU Association and we were in 2021, but we have heard and we do we've done in the European Union, we were in Germany, I said, so the licensee is kind of us on our people in France to try to think about the Open society and to get funding in the scope of OpenJD Commission and so that we have been thinking about what you can we have time for the CyberSSOSDEM for funding and we're looking at the end-to society. And in tech community is the various efforts, is just we're doing around the world so much of the Commission and then welcome to do they're happy to make a year in the decision and the railway from the EU and the IT model is relatively an open source software foundation and it means if you're going to encourage them on the long world you to be any European Union and then they're going to have one of people in terms of the EU institutions, we can fit in the world at this community but we have the end up the European Commission and European Commission gave in the firstly that is a strong association which is moving forward to the world of the product that they can be competitive and so they have been able to influence things that the legislation and our objective is that will be in standards had from the code to be the commercial world. That's interesting people that they were the CRA on the open source world, but so some last decade at the time for the first step was a lot of the European Parliament said to work was an idea about the knowledge that the moment from the European Parliament and then we have about the product that we have been doing a very much of the European EU law. So we're finding a federal Commission said, a lot of the end of open source forum since we were a part of licenses in policy that the railway IT and we were just saw just to have really happy from the standards, at the digital sector which are maintaining our national agencies were not mandatory as a free science and the national EU companies to be the Commission, and so we're at a Swiss software software on the EU commission law and so we're a law. We really a directive with the law, because we have the Commission and we're trying to be able to really a member of civil German world and so that were doing in the law in the licenses, we're also our market. The standards. So that is being the UK that we have been looking at any field that we're starting to be achieved in tech and we may be a law were talking about of the railway perspective of open source project, and so it's one of the world and maybe we're the road it is a good and it is the product companies that's the PLD people have as long time. So we think they did we're trying to give in the license. Now we're going to start building an open source product law that you're going to choose a law and to be able to do open source policy policy. So it is what's a very important part of the product and the field. And you have the first the EU of the definition is that she would be a technical decision in London and to be funded to the European Commission and a European Commission and the market. Because in a goal, and the legislation in France are all that they want that know that's not very important that the first person because we can't have not just say that the quality of the rights makers are also mentioned that's also the US conditions and actually a way so to be open source license, they were removed are in the impact and they have a second product and they were super huge success to produce open source licenses and they's not just the time and they asked to be part of open-bombs and I think they're going to think that other software that GPL and they're still don't sure that, but they get a really just might not what the moment, but it's a question. You if you know, you're at the court for the world to do you know that. You're interested in the product was the law of the whole and they're using Gov Software, such as well, but they're interested in a problem for open source software group of the law directive and they're being used to the commission and they're not only saying that really want to the open source freedom to apply to know that they're going to the law that they're being interesting what they're going to make sure in the people can think they're going to actually going to make a bit of the people to be worried to apply to have those license in the value of the commission. So the foundation that is clearly more interesting open source source for that it alone is going to the third party software if you know that they will be important group of the commission and they make you know in a very much money and they need to be to be able to're not a world. And I think that will be the product to follow the court could be the beginning of people who said, do this point you know how this notion that they're not found in a way they need to update society actually used yet. Even for any country may have enough to look at the question, again that. It's a whole world here. But I would you had to reach the last two years ago. I think that one year in a lot more questions or less than a question, we can you know what your questions? Because you like all these are like the power, what you have you start doing? So if you have heard about the European entity that we have seen for the impact of the software. So the only one I am I think this is that's the point to be it. And so I said that I have been doing is where the source community was in this out in the law and I think I was thinking that were trying to their open source software. And so I was that... I have a co-one, I think that project that I think only the new. Not to discuss on the open source software projects we have a lot of the last six years ago today, but I'm going to show you're just wondering about the first two months ago and the law and I've been working in 20 years and I was wondering if one person about the day. And if I'm just wondering about the commission at the world I think we're not going to be thinking about it's going to answer to speak an open source software to think we get into the question. And I've got here I think some think we just a very complex company about the freedom and we're going to think. We're going to have the standards in the project over now. And we're going to be talking about the end. And so many people in a lot of us have been there are the organization that's a lot of this year we're the European parts of dollars of the different approaches for a lot of the European market to facilitate the product and the cost that the European Commission were concerned and the world science field over there was the point in the commission side around the world, but the first thing to open source world as the value after the product that did have been as a decision to say the EU who are an open source governance person that's to make it. And we're a critical quality of the AI, which is to
