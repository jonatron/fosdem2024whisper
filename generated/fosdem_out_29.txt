 Fos. Ine, we're going to try to implement the HTTP server to implement the server and we'll try to set the API for our users that very important. Okay, good talk about the back to the LLM protocol. So first place to use our API configuration, we're able to debug this or other parts and at all the details that because it just the CRI because this is happening. We have two, the other requests that we're going to build the LLMs are doing this. And the same configuration is then available by adding a specific thing for LLM that this to our internal library. And it on the Java Mambo, we have the data from the different. And we have to be able to create the API. We want to verify that we actually put into the tools and we want to add to do this kind of built, which are actually a nice concept of how we call the Nixy and will be familiar with an object, which means that we have a simplified API to generate our API that we can start using this. There's a single API which is a better and what we have. We just allow, but we don't have our API that we are doing this, we need to implement our Hbernetes to know that these way we're doing it. Okay, and we want to do is our API. We want to support our API for our application. And we have to make LLMs. We need to provide tools. This thing we need to provide our tools that we can allow us as a first open source libraries and with a bit about a framework and also in the API. We have some functionality on the end user itself in. We have a problem in open API that. Okay. It's the solution to use. Okay, we have the description of the API. We have a deployment. And this part of the API, okay, we have done. So, this case, okay. So, we're going to see the most important is running on the main. We have the next page. As we are currently trying to talk about the API, like, which is this one of the nativeI API, we also in Kubernetes and we can also use this time. So we are here And it would it's a real API, I can see on, some, yeah, we have a lot of the whole thing to make a lot about how we will be talking about this kind of open source or we started with the part of a lot of how it. So I think about a good good question is already have we're going to ask for the latest project that I didn't know why we have time to share in a lot of the model. We're going to make a lot of talks about here in the main success with the front end of the code at the current standard to make it. It's gone into the most important thing. I would like a better in my experiments in this one of the best thing we've been doing this case in the first of the future. Then we've been doing some most important things we have heard about the level, the next step of the most of the first three other one because we have a feature and I was just mentioned before. But I would like this is a lot of a lot of the first step up to make it was that time. I'm going to keep up. So my point, I'm not saying the best thing I think about the question was not sure that this one is that the current thing where you remember is the past and I was that the code is the actual ones that I was going to do we were making a first of the code and why I had to know, and also made a lot of a lot of things which was that you know that we were just decided to know, to do this work with that we found out what we just said that we're using this going to see is where this work the time. Because we've got to look at the ones are actually did. So there are sort of people who was a couple of decided that was something that these things that it was the whole thing, but like far of people who agreed on the description of, we made the knowledge because we have said that we can be in some of fun, especially in September at the time and we had to look at with the previous year and so we tried to figure out there's the 80s and the thing called a lot of the latest version of the first one that was that we've got there's just a lot of the issue. So when we sort of the software was we can see, we build. The end up the first one person here was to start up in the last talk was used over and I came to continue to be just to the left to a value of been going to go to be able to 20 years ago. So how I'm going to improve the time until the right now we don't have time, but still keep that is going to go. I'm going to do we've been doing that we have a thing to have to our product because this work well, but they had to the next year and then on the day to do we had a different ones and really want to look at the big step point of those people in being able to be able to actually need to do some stuff in the data and they want to go to have to go to do on it because they don't have to the more complicated thing that you can't want to clean up and they're just want to be able to do that. However, if you've got to give us to the question that was in the question. It was, it was the open source code. And so what they're going to have kind of the product. The most people were trying to look out of the open source code is going to have. So I made this open source code that you have put a good opportunity to run for one people that the right now. And in the ones in is that's a little bit more than the end of the second. They're going to this code and they've got that are very important to have. And that they're going to think that you want to focus on the things like our product that's the community, the product. But at the community, very important thing that we need this and they're going to think that people can open source, but you're going to do it to be the code for people. But we're just to know, but you're going to be going to be super much money back to be able to be a work on the term. So if you're seeing more comfortable with the world, and we're going to focus on a lot of the community. I think that we can be quiet or less than I will be doing those things that are we think about it's how they're going to mean, like to be kind of what people to do in the world of the first time. We're going to pay away from the people have a time to try to say, well, also have to do that, right? We're going forward to be a long time in that we have a new product, like we're going to do this. So what we're a lot of we don't have to have anything, first one of the beginning of the world is, we're going to solve the challenges and we're going on a small product. So people who are there's made the IT. And Open Science and I'm going to talk about the first thing to start to try to get a nice things and so we're going to introduce, and talking about how do we want to say, I'm going to set up in the energy in my current world. We start the European Commission, to be really heard about the European Commission will speak on the OpenAI. And there are the community projects. I don't know about the European Commission and funding, I'm like a political thing about open source commission. So I was one of the world today, we need to talk about the last year. And this is, we don't have to make those open source world so many people and they talk about research and open source projects which are like a project. It's a big big people and they have thought and they're going to get the product in open source software, but they have a lot of open source software group and they're going to take back to go to know how they want to work on. And we're talking about the first open source community organizations can tell the majority of research, what we're going to do is that we're going to talk about the next thing that the day we've been using the last six months ago. And we've been the last year that we've shown the beginning and the CRA worked together, where we've been doing. I've been doing that. So that we've been using Open Source in the funding around the German market we've said, the world, we're going to think in our open source project, people and we've been going to have been going to also to have a young funding to have a corporate product and they've been quite kind of science. I'm going to be quite an end talking about ten years ago, but we're saying, who are working with their world can do this, the technical investment, right, as much know what they're not really just a long to think it just. And I think in this will be a little bit of open source software we're going to be a good to be long as open source code. Then we're gonna be aware of the human issue in advance to be there the code to be a problem that world. And this requires people that open source software that it. And I think the first thing is to say for that we have to maintain and we might be a huge opportunity to mean that the best source code has been translated into the open source code? So I think when I'd say, does we're going to make it's important to be an open source code, and the software code, which is that they know how good and it's open source code model, but they have five years, but it's not really the fact that are the product work that was to work-implement the first thing it has been around and I could have been a lot of the community-D is, which has a software that you know that they were just had their open source and they really about that they're just grow as well aware. They're just need to happen and they're using a lot of a real-source code, they don't have that they're looking at one place. And they don't have to go to get that point there's like, we need to the product description of a lot of the money to be great open source world, but they're in Germany that. But I see the, in the question was actually you know, but we write a second goal of it's going to look at the right? Where we are it's open source community, but this point, but we're going to tell a broader world. I should be the technology in the other world in the good, right? Or I'm actually have your work, in a great. This is not only on this and how? How does you how these countries, am I mean, we can you want to work on this kind of the actual license perspective, but we are there is that are some of interest in the community on the way to be in those open source project that we have funding to have a very best to be able to do this, what they're doing is what that provide the open source community and they don't have these companies are the EU projects that we're we are very good thing that we're going to do. And if you're going to use as being able to work to do it, I'm going to make it to be the idea actually one of the last two projects that's what we have there's going to say but we're going to do is what we're going to be going to work in the requirements in the customers right now. And I'm going to be wondering about research in the product and so we call this in mind. And I'm going to go here. I're going to about a little bit of what I'm going to explain to talk about a few people can you see about the overall work on, we're going to ask. We're talking about the most of interest out. I'm going to write a few of the great thing that you are looking at the way I'm going on open source software engineer at the projects and then we're going to focus on the left and we're trying to be able to stop them for the way in a lot of development, but the last one of course we have to speak to be very thankful to talk about about the open source project with digital services and about software and I think about building this ecosystems are the last versions of course in our cloud project for the world, which is also open source. Everyone has been talking about it's a topic and which are done with AI and so that they were done in Europe. That's only in the last few people who'm a year in 2016. And I was a community of people for the last year. And that last year we thought that the 90s are the fact that were quite an open source world. We have, but I think that was like by the last year of the slides, but the way to talk was my community was like to get started to the first person who was to co-to-profit issues of the future, the project which is the people and the company and she has been done a good because they and we were doing energy. He's a bit of what you know. We have got a long worked on collaboration and he was a weekend. So I've got a lot of the last year, we had to share a bunch of projects and they've got a good friend. I wanted to you to put it, and then in the first week, we need to make sure that a lot of the last year. But I think that last year was. And the talk was no, right now we will explain the FOSDEM happened with a little bit easier to a very few years ago, well, but this year, the tech, like I'm going to people to solve the way to work for the staff and you. And so. And I have two years ago. So in the last year, in September. So, we've got to talk is a lot of the years ago. We do the year ago, I was also happy to probably been working with a huge idea of people just thinking about
