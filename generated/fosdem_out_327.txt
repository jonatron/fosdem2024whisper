 FOSF 3D 3G. And when you want to use or an end of the two months to set that information. And I started to discuss this and then I'm just wondering. I started wondering about that. And I'm just wondering that this thing was I am I am thinking about it in the question, I didn't make a long time to be able to implement the first one of the question was if I was better than using the question. I'm going to set about to clean the more about the DMA to have to be able to do and how. I'm going to do you are going to talk about this on our own program and add this talk about what you just be there. So, it was trying to know of the most important one of the best thing is the data between the problem that we are set of those things that are going to talk about how these ones and another approach actually the question. What about the question is like a already? The thing is that the question is about the question is some question was about the question is a the this is that you had is just so it was that you would find in a question specifically on the question, I was about this question is the question. I'm gonna use to get there but I've seen what I think about the question. And the I'm one question. And this question is you know, because I know, very important to have was but, is that I'm going to be done. And that. I can I could be talking about it's going to think I'm wondering about what I'm just wondering if you we have like one of you are using this question, again. For example, we already see here right now that, but I will the question. So if you know what happens because I think it's that's happening on the question. All right? We need to discuss is the question for the question. I just for the question to ask for that I have, okay, which is this question. In fact, but this question was this question, sorry, as I have some of what is, I want to address is the question. It's important to start open source in the implementation? I've got some performance. Okay, right? And we're not have this is why I think this. What you, the question is what I don't know, not necessarily know, I'd like this is going to do we have. So this question, I'm going to see the question. I think that I said is. But the question, this talk is really, the question to the question. And why we go back in the question is part of the question is you are already use cases of the question, and the question was the question. What that the question is that we have I have talked about the question. So why it's what the question. I think that it's what do is possible. I said that I think I didn't know exactly. I don't know I'm going to do. Well, if we need the question about the question, the question. So the question is there's going to do you, and what we have are trying to look at the question, why we have, we are the question that the question is, or what is everything that the question? I just the question is the question is important. I'm saying, I think there's it's a good to be like so that the question was a question and what is currently the question. So I know in PDM, to look like more likely going to be in the question. It's the question that the question, the question about what we have that? But I think this talk was for you thought of here in the question, for these is the answer in case the question was that actually, when you know the question. So we're doing the question was different types of my, for the question. And the question about a question that are right? And when we are connected to ask for the question, the question, I know it's like what we need? So I think about this is that an question is what is the question in here? And I'm using this question to do you know, you have it's what you think about? So if there are usually something that's the idea for the end, we have is a security as far, but we are only question before that we have to do we have an open services to understand that one of users have to start and more or you have the question about integration, but in the question and is, I think this is the question. But this there is the question, they have the question. It's some very important one of the question, and as you know I think this is to know really interesting, but if you know if you have to keep the security or you want to know, to start through the, you know what we have, the question, you know that people, and so we are now need some questions, because that is not correct, but then you shouldn't have any question, right? So I'm going to have a question, but also have time was, but we are you know, so you know, I think about those things that most of the question, but the features, we don't think that the question is the question is you don't get into a problem, but in the good news, right? Well, so we're about there were like, but we're not having to think also a scope of the right? No, like, yeah, I'm there is this and the question. I said, this is always there are the right? Yes, I think, as I said, so I think I think, we are some information in these are that there, right now or like we have the question, right? So this is the question. If we are in, I'm using this? I need to see in this information. I'm going to say, right now to be the developer space of course. So I think, I'm thinking about, you know, you know, I thought I need to be talking about saying, yeah, it? Okay, so that's a question. How we had happened is? Are we are about, right? Yes, there any questions? So, I think I didn't know, we have you have any questions? And there are some of these guys? How far, we would you know, but just put here in your question. I did you know, if you can you are doing it? Yes. Thank you know, to note, if you very much. So, this is a question. Thank you know, I wasn't, I'm on here. Thank you. I mean, I'm going to talk is going to have time to be going to be talking about the question for this? Because I didn't. I started. So, thank you, so I don't remember, that's all open source code in a long now that you. And I'm going to talk about the idea. Thank you. I'm going to talk. We have so much for the question. 
 Good, I'm going to talk, but I'm a few questions, if you today, you said, if I'm going to thank you so. Thank you. Thank you. I'm something you. So I'm just wondering. Thanks. 
 Okay, well I'm here. Thank you guys. Hello everybody. I'm going to my name is all. So today we have a talk about the first one of the first step of all started with Sail Zan about how I'm going to help you can we have only got a good questions? I'm just put a couple of my laptop at the phone. So I'm looking to speak to be part of the last year too much about a talk about the first year. Okay. I'm showing about the end of the next speaker. But I'm going to talk I'm going to be wondering, I'm going to let's going to thank you about a talk in the presentation. It's start being at this and so I'm going to introduce a long time the panel and we have it. We're going to be there. I'm concerned by talking about the other talks about how we've been going to be trying to do a good? This is, I'm going left at the company engineer and I'm trying to introduce the last year. So as a little bit of I'm going to have a little bit of our software in Brussels and the long time was wondering. I'm working on a minute. So these year. So, I keep the CERN is a little bit of a little bit more interesting in our own project. It's the project for the only thing that's the work as a real-V community. I'm not going to be quite a platform and they were the company. So it was one of not a lot of the community. But that was, yeah. And I was the project was the largest community was going to actually very small open source community. But we're going to think he had this we've got the co-Fi Foundation, so he was just had this is the organization to have been a decision's got a long term in the first year, but he did I didn't get it was mostly been talking about this back to a little bit of the last year where he went to be going to the open source software engineer and sort of the community. It was pretty much better. And he was in the open source community. I was a while this was something at the co-founder in the commission. I haven't really did a lot of Issa was also been used to be released at the world, as a long as it was really a lot of computer, the community was when it was a few years ago, he wasn't been a time and I have been showing a new community for a lot more popular, and because I know, we've been that was a lot of people know what we have worked in the first years ago. And I had this was going to use 2023 in the years of the community was you know. We were just made other software of like, often hired by the sense of people who actually know, you know that came from the beginning of things. I've been here an open source of the same work in the way to think this. We're going to spend and we've worked on a couple of the US is the same side to the time. And to actually I'm going to be the maintenance was going to be I'm going to be a lot of what was going to be a little bit of this thing that we just a bit of us. You know is, that there were just a good situation, like sometimes a lot of like, you know about the past and do, but there was always learned to know, that I tried to think they are just doing, but they had people the right? So there's the future world. I'm just saying there's a few years from a long time. But I think there was so much at least three years ago, uh, the code was a lot of the world to make a lot of time and not the right now but they've seen that they knew in the world. And I think there are the time out there's a lot of like some of a number of people in the developer. And I'm coming up at the ecosystem and they had really don't need to get many people. But if they were some I just say at least just come into the community engineers and they'll talk. And so they're going to the community so many people like, like what they were going to look into the community, we've been working on and they were getting a right away from the community like we've got the ones. And I've been doing that were funding in the people who was happening and they went stuff that the right now was somebody got their team and they're just heard he had to being done there were in it was thought that they could be very excited to dojot and they were like they've got lots of you see out on people know what was really have the end of people that in the very good thing. And I said there was going to say was it was we looked at the fact that was kind of the end of building. And since he would actually got it was to be going to write and he was like to get people who was now just kind of people in the developer went out of thing. That was that had is the rest of the community was a little bit of my mind. So as excited was very first of like a community. I was a good thing to get this was this whole project which is that also an idea. So that had a project was the last one of the ones that was involved was how you to do the work. It was that I think it was actually being a little bit of the moment. So the only one more of the like the tool was actually a lot of the question of them like a little bit more details here. So the work was running five years ago. So what I ran into the folks have you could show of the people in the code went into the idea of these that I was kind of the team and these things that. And we were doing. So I would keep doing. And they keep doing. So please know, we wanted to think the next presentation of the end of the last year, the community was about 2000s. Let's my understanding I was whether it. So I was coming from people are the community and the community. So that I was doing is that there started, so that also very angry and the community was that, really like a very important for the community. So we were with the project was in the project called the moment. We had to give that we needed us a company in the community. We have that had to say that were saying, but they were like their science is a legal people and really working group and they had had out of my research of people to do more and we thought, but it was you need to look at it, but that you know, if you know all, you know, you know, you get a larger, I'm doing this software, you know, like, and then you know, you know, that, for you know, and then you know, right, but you know, and, like, I will get this. You know, you know, like, but you know, you know, this was talking about, like that most people probably about the time out of the way, was open, but they are a lot of a
