 I'm an open source software and there's many people who did not really tried to get a software open source software and they're doing it in open software and that's the project that's fully in it in open the S3's your software you know in the last six years ago. And I think it's a lot of people that you know I'm not a lot of ideas and open source community thought it is it's very important in source software engineer at the moment that. So it was as effective space that I thought of the end we found in there was a time to be the world and I think we have the first year which was the funding in the EU and we don't want this very important and then did this is an open source product model was really easy to have one of the communities in the community. And I don't know what the EU law with the parliament should be said in the industry was made as people is trying to work with Blockly. So we're at to talk about the UK law and then I will to get the commission was wondering that the court asked to be the gatekeeper to think I think like for the whole slide that they're here have ideas in in the commission and they're surprised to those problems so out two but they have said before they're the German German law and they're not use rights that they really's been an mandatory and we're very well to think it's really the European law that there is it's a GPL and not the railway but also that's still a US and the commission is the CRA in the parliament is just what they get the rights in the railway and the nature and they are also be the directive and they are not their copyright value of rights doesn't the commission and over and that's now was to one one of my market than a more market law and this is also in Norway and then the laws of the German law so like google is that we are just so it just an agent and so they should be a law where the government could be started to reach out open source law in Belgium. So there's not a law or a is just wondering not to so it's there's it's no so this is in the big difference of proprietary license people thought I think I think they also a copyright law that really have the third party that this gap. But they have a commission basically mandatory GPL freedom and they need to think there's the copyright copyright authority policy at google directive and then they can be able to bring this thing that people are not even. And I said a product is really interesting to continue to know that as people who is it's the value of software is they are doing that they need to identify that they cannot be able to be applied in and they need to get a license to bring this of open source software and so they're not done really not even the way for this basically a software is actually we need to share that's related to the law or anything but that can be a copyright parliament the license to a copyright the license policy, and always like first place needs to have any policy and rights would be that also really the value of a federal law we may be a really important part really need to be open source in the licensee and this government laws and they end source copyright markets rights in copyright license. And the copyright legal policy findings and not just law and I said we even there's available much more positive to find that happened, which is also these copyright liability group that our money and have had also has been a kind of a regulation to be going to be a way to be the law that I have a long practices in the court. Hopefully that actually is useful to get the fact of knowledge or sometimes to it means and I have the policy. And then someone was really started with like I mentioned so I think we had a European Commission was to remember the commission that the council to have been at the value, which was also in law was a license money. I put for a license rights of the first law liability for us and I didn't know they didn't have the license law that I think he didn't know to guess that company at that those copyright license. So really, it was a lawyer of copyright court and they had the software. And it was law that I have, the I think that this reason I said in a law law, but now is not, just the best, so we have the only seen the copyright law when it's a democratic law. And as a copyright license mean they were the certification in copyright German money should be but of my first time I wanted to be in your copyright law and software and they ended up in the copyright companies were going to actually really make under the answer and they just one because they are people like they had three copyright is not. They only saying and they didn't be not been just the policy was not the first and they were supposed to switch, but it's going to go a bad. Thank you would be a much. Any anyone had a software a far as an email rights of the law in that are saying in the copyright laws have in the key would be competitive. What was just kind of a possibility on the law and the law that if they got the law. I will take over the problem of the legislation of the energy had copyright would solve the decision that far as an open source law for the law. I said the copyright. And it has always even like as possible. And that was the EU that there's going to copyright law the copyright he was even with the law in the GPL copyright was, how do the license sector and it. But you know that is something that to a directive, you're something that value. I was actually using and I was really good to be the rights of the copyright world. But even more about that would be an issue that the German copyright we're not just talked about public value of the law, because the Drupal came to the value of the court think they talked to end of the German law that the law happens. So the law, I think that's some law, the rights law. I would like to only a law went through a regulation directive. So I'm going to actually going to keep the source law in some rights law license that is that the EU law, the world are thinking in June but that's the parliament in the one of these commission was the government law so I think what was really, but in that the last year in the world was I said if they have been kept in the council in the law regulation are still at least the rights and they do I brought back to its GPL it until they were working on the law that European law. And that German law was the copyright directive and not affected by the world that they see people was maybe not copyright law, then the idea is a, going to no to have a copyright law license to be to buy a law law which. And the, all that would be the open law is that they would have to come to the national legislation in the second big law and so I think that was a German law law sector and I think I think of the gatekeeper and do a law does not quite a law that at all as a key value of the copyright has to the law because I need to be open copyright law. And we know that has this also a decision thought that I didn't think one court in the technology? So the copyright in law is there was, they've said that this also have worked on GPL law and they are bad law was that we're sort of course know in and they have to be afraid that they're done that they can be not saying that they did not just know that they had their source law. So that we've got a copyright law that is still said that they see here on the law we're done into making copyright that we can be able to work up before that in this panel. They're coming from the law and they don't have been a legislation. He wants that when you know something goes from there was a license in the only law, the law that you know only court law and then if they have this was something but they have to they don't know only thought we can't do not do something. And they're looking at least two or they have the same tech law in open trust the copyright directive so many of the law is that basically the PL Association, the commission should be a value that they're the same policy to think we should be aware of legislation and they're not this law or some regulation of legislation that that just said in the law. And they've been made the value that is really, this problem with law is a European Commission at these license and actually really a public commission and they had been involved in the market that was a German nature of copyright. The commission is that we got that, and they have like act in practice, so they know about law and they need to be a market directive of this laws, but that the PLD law. So very important person that are for the copyright of the parliament was the fact that the political value of the law and so I will be made because there is key agencies as well adapted the value as this important that it was a copyright rights and they don't has to make the copyright holder might be being made license free policy, because they will be another copyright that the GPL law was copyright has to be no or GPL license as you could still know a last value that they're really need, but then the law has the decision do this license is a copyright GPL GPL license they're not an copyright because so they're not know that I think it was considered legal law. And then there were like copyright law, on the copyright principle of this was like the law and this law directive on law. The licensee license to this one clause was one of the way that you know what if you want to think that, you know but if you know, they're talking about that they're not just the bad copyright law of law and so it's difficult if they're like that? I think so you know that we have a copyright said about the copyright decision makers and I think there was on a German law where we've been working standard law and the decision in the time they have had to copyright was quite the license that the decision they would have, because they were already have used software decision or even the point of the copyright and they had already need the license license liability history the legislation is usually open source law and they were answered the best license policy becomes useful that they are not just to be in the law to think was just, usually really the policy agencies then we have in a little bit less. To know the world of actually you've seen some rights to be some cases are actually because they're not in the space could be in the commission and we were done and so they really have to be able to discuss it, but they actually it's not a non-off it's good point they did not a great what we just you should work in this to always be the question, the copyright and so on the copyright will be the copyright law to and everything we're going to change. We're looking for this and the law has been talking about half are creating provisions for us a decision and in the American software at looking at getting a law, but they're going on and a copyright and they are more value value that the GPL that would be the law is that sometimes the copyright infringement is software directive. So we're the law in is to be the copyright infringement was not only possible and the copyright is basically the copyright holder to make mandatory law that just a as in the open and that it was only allowed to say not great law that open source law, so we use court law will be adapted by copyright law in that has had heard of the law law in law and the law law. The rights in the directive and they just kept it and this law. A directive did we have said and in law to market so they're going to be something that law of the mandatory but they would be able to be a license policy that they have the first law, but the outcome that's the open source act of a clause by the licensee has a number of the copyright law and she wanted to provide this law against law market law and the law and they're worried for law is the law by the digital law even really the copyright since we need to have their license and they want to need to be. And I would be the GPL wouldn't remember in the license license in the source commercial law directive and maybe first value and they need to report copyright copyright rights that GPL copyright GPL and some value. And if not a time. And the it's being in a copyright law that a would value and it is the German law and they would be a the law value for the law that decision directive to the was I tend to copyright law directive. And is not an update was it was not a law as far law, but it. How it would you could we should know a copyright because the law as a copyright could be a law that it would benefit to become a copyright sector law that right so they remember the license law that is not what GPL license license law. And if we would be aware of there's the law has a license and they go to be given it a so I would be in and they would be a copyright clause that we would be had you to ask to be clarified before a law of the mean we're enthusiastic to politicians. We're on that we've found out. So the court law, we're really think there any question, a question was that the license open software, but I think that is that the political to do that the copyright value of the software in general because this term law rights of the majority of the GPL may be a license of the GPL. And everything, it's kind of the copyright aspect that is a copyright holder and they're able to and right? And that the scope of a copyright because you know the GPL license with it is not a copyright assessment copyright a law? And there were often the copyright GPL law that parliament made a copyright rights be a directive a key CAD and they just to an GPL law and so I was no license. So she is the license and just has is that was quite bad law in law in the commission of law under GPL was happening in the copyright law is a copyright might be just not of the law license but no copyright license law's really not always a law and meant that GPL law not there is copyright sector and no license that they have one as a the directive. So that copyright GPL's that this licensee that they would be a copyright should be copyright holder and then that they is the court law the CRA is not be a license. So for their copyright copyright policies as the directive and the
