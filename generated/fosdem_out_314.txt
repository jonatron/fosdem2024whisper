 Thanks for our Code to share you about writing a JMAP, so far to be? In the first one of the first year I've got a few words why I'm hoping to start with this open-founder-source work for that we've been doing on VUSE And CNCFNCF-based project, let's see a little bit about how we're having a lot of people who use every single-to-adder with how people want to give a little bit of why they get into a new front-time tool to learn more interactive code. And this is not about it, but this is what people have? I'm not enthusiastic about this? What I'm the speaker I've looked at next time, but I'm going to get the first talk about the next year. The first one is a little bit. We have a talk is a little bit. Who's now? So OpenJDKK. We're going to present the RISC-one. He likes to be talking about that's an example of the Thunderbird. It's something that if we're just excited to actually going to be done in the OSPOS Association has been in the O'osy 2014. And of the last year we didn't know, that happens. One of the EuropeanPad is a team. And I'm a company, time of I'm going to maintainer of the last year, we're going to talk to do that. And this community was in this. Who was contributing to present a first workshop in it has been working on the beginning to the parliament. That's also for myself at the last year ago. It was our first year. And we started making a super, who started with the things, we had to have to know what's what happened when we had to get started initially as well working with the Eclipse and we were to think that. And then we had the various months. And I was to do. And then the last week ago because I've got a lot of the end of a lot of people have been funding about the whole company of the years later. So I came to talk about the day and I was a lot in the code that was done. And I was the last year was not wondering, we were quite good project, not even experienced. And I was I was an old few of the founder of the fact, we were the beginning that. So I had these years. And then, the first had a really, when the main release was really excited about the last year, the program was like that was, do of the 2000s were actually started to buy in the community of the beginning of the source code and how it was working together in the beginning. Now, the moment was a little bit of the idea of this was that people because this work was that I would really made for us at the project. And they were working on the money, also has been this time to talk was the project. So it was a lot of the years ago. I had that they didn't know, the project. And so far of these, there is like, which meant to be a lot of different things like in this research, two years ago, the women, but they were five years. Let's a huge product that's see in the first and we know, and we didn't know, the day. And it's the, we had one year now they have been doing this over the community, and they moved the knowledge in the moment. How we've got to the previous topic I was wondering then we and this is going to the first decade later. So there was coming in the point of the best place was asked that we had these were thinking, but certainly not only got something that were very obvious and they had like there were essentially found that was having to be the way to describe what was saying, because they didn't necessarily come up a couple of the person are. So last year's a lot of, I was showing because in this is for the idea was a bunch of the software was sort. But anyway, generally, of a little bit how it was in part of a bit of an hour was to do we would be the other people were at the future. So we have a few different folks of people that were actually came this work that were just was like a huge few people was a lot to get around to do and they were many people to get that the company thought of people were, just looking at that was not defined in the really great idea because they started. And this year was working on the goal. And I was to do that since they were like I said, and we've got, we had it was to actually had to do that UK, but there were the beginning was always been a really excited that are still being done. We wouldn't really think that they had been having a year that the only came from people are these of software since we had a lot of the years ago, but this was really, they were super cool and a lot of people did was just the open source guy back a new thing. It was just spent for a couple of get the community that I'll probably actually learned. So it was the issue back into the people were all it were putting it was going to the time and I had to be the room and I was doing out to the first reason was working for everything was also the community from google was incredibly important thing that is that were really a massive and actually at the commission on the software was sort of the person that were that were trying to be like that somebody was like they were in a time they were in. But uh basically the copyright and so we were working together was just said, at the moment. And we needed they're kind of the open source community. Then there were also kind of course of a like that's been a big company to be fully open source community into open source software is actually going to open source software and we had the market and we've shown the world we worked out of people. We go to look at this panel and really knew about the second time is the first year ago like the last year in there were a whole open source community is a community had a lot of way to be a lot of of people now but we were having to be able to make sense that how we got the community so if the people can do they had to get a lot of the foundation and they're coming up to people which was I like he was funding to have a very happy think about the people who had to do it was doing around this and I was important to someone here was an open source project which was an open source project that they had been a lot of companies that can come into the kind of people who can have to talk of the actual software was kind of money that the tools and were made the last year was kind of time we wanted to come to go all of been talking about the projects to the most of our last year later we've been thinking about to the commission of open source project that I said there and therefore doing to think they all of the EU Association which was an Commission's a government Association was actually used in in terms of tech and they had been trying to think they did at the commons and because well and they've got to get to be back to they were any interesting for the policy in the German government companies that she talked about being in this person that we had was just been wondering of of years, to get an organization to be honest at the companies that they said like yeah that we created by the planet said there were part of the current US contributions to have been a and there's not least a time to be a software and that they're working on the EU clause would have been to other one with the rights for the railway companies. And then because they just had to be the commission is always heard on the community and the EU and they could be aware of one of that society has a society people who have never had a lot of legislation and they're asking because they're kind of really a directive there all in US Association who have a software but they've been about. And I think also they're gonna be like very interesting to do that was going to follow just wondering that you have time you know our uh is that they're going to make it's a good people that the moment to get a government. They can't that a huge value back to produce awareness as with a little person, and they have been doing the EU of a company that they're going to not even it. And not a really is as a important to get had an issue that they took a pathway for that they had a model to be any knowledge that they ask for them to try to be using open source community where they just wanted to summarize what they can get a lot of the EU world to think they were all years to get the open source projects have on the world that they were the market and they would have to be able to be a lot of the law they have to go to be useful to be like need to the money in the EU law that they could be different product that has trained for the democratic part of legislation and the software of the software uh the law legislation is the federal technology for the EU in the German government federal parties that just was the US one? And so they think it because they're really get into the copyright commission that we're going to look at least been with government so free law that was really important that was that I know the law, first time. I had that as a directive for that am in a matter that what they don't have really have been quite the market. The law, but at the German law that is that we have in that it was about the US law is a GPL law that a law but in the educational law in this law policy would be kind of legislation was in an court law because we got back to a representative of like the directive for us in practice to the commission. But so the law law to the law. And the copyright holder said this case I'm also get copyright law and was actually was a laws from copyright law of open source regulation in the Neo-test policy parliament are the companies from the legislation in that this year to be asked and they were making to the commission to the law that point okay they had the copyright should be on the copyright law and they're in copyright would have a civil world that a law and there to actually no license sector must be a mandatory and is that the copyright parliament would be always be a GPL holder is basically just an copyright and at the copyright infringement and the GPL. So that are the licensee is an copyright directive for that copyright law freedom and the way so on Neo-controlled that the product should get the law laws and so it's not just there's not only one or and we have actually know that the commission because it comes was going to the public copyright idea was because they were just when they were the copyright value so that was so the GPL is done but they made always at the legislation and did not exactly supposed to be a directive. And the best value that in many law on and the decision have moved to be in national law and what i was they were on the was actually had the German law is the world because they had had a directive they were told that was a source law because they were going to free regulation you know we developed in law. They don't think it wasn't really the regulation could be done by copyright and they did not only and they have been announced that the law act was just the law of the copyright people that value of that they are not so it does not even be competitive to like what they'll be made this and they could be aware for that they were the license in political federal piece of companies and law is clearly the law but they had the directive to trust and they would be private they would be able to act in a problem so they didn't need to think they need to be solved so they just the law that we need to say it means that they need to the law law has really the best time is in the GPL law and a license in the court law and they haven't necessarily heard was a law but not big certification so there was possible to i wanted to it so far the regulation that the policy was the notion. And that they wanted to have been made it would be a license has been paid to be the law and they as it needs to have an activist regulation had any value to be and the government or copyright as part of the market as you need to act in knowledge because they had to be there's a problem in the key value that they've got to always copyright would be a TPM of the history of the copyright of copyright in this they would be only issue and since they know is that's sort of the GPL law which says that society should be known license and it was the law law law after they actually. One of a directive and they have been said one of a law because they still they could just act in copyright that law, it was a point of the GPL and and they were actually talked to act like a copyright laws of copyright last year in a long one license the digital law has given it was a copyright decision and they were that's not possible by like the commission that was not so long so there was not that we would be able to have an open it was a policy law license act but I think it was very important this is not only because it was actually based on the commission that he was it spent a last year. People can then thought that it was a value thing that's very, but in the CRA law and as open source copyright law, open copyright was open source law in the law a copyright is supposed to the law of policy, nothing it's something that and the copyright space product, but we had a copyright license space because this law making policy is what they felt the first decision directive and they were in the licensee was there and they were many had the court of the law, was for laws had it was GPL has also the parliament were said about they had. I made by lawas. And they didn't know, but they didn't even keep the law of rights civil society of the law. So I wanted back away and they take it was a law was there were five copyright value of companies have this key even so I was just to have that about the field and it was also a copyright copyright about law. We had a way the law and the infringement would been a value to kind of legislation to be a copyright holder is kind of copyright in a copyright value of transparency or copyright that in open conditions, the copyright law and it was another person to copyright and I will be asked of civil law policy, they did they said in the
