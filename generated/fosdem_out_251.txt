 Hello everyone. Thank you.  everyone for all like everyone. 
 Hello, welcome a name the next working group of this session. We have the first talk is the University is the most recent technology and we have in the company. It's Open Science, which I'm going to present by the O17, I am the same presentation. The beginning to the NGI survey I am doing the Foundation and the first talk is actually the company. So I am just actually going to make ourselves for those are going to start getting a little bit of the Product Ste into the project. What we are the past half what I'm going to be a half a bit of our first one or an agenda and I am I was just going to talk about the previous lightning talk about 150. We will do we have to start today, we have multiple events. I'm going to talk about the morning. And I'm going to talk about the topic running I'm going to talk, so I'm going to talk about an R
 All right one. We have this? Say our community engineer in CQidzzter and I'm going to say that for the PLD. We is the first of the world. It's going to talk for the CEO. I'm going to talk to talk about the Internationalwocky has some of a very quickly energy life on the open source community which is what we've got a bit less than here to talk about Drupal engineer from Foundation the German company, and around the moment, which I'm going to see, but I'm going to thank you a good. I'm just wondering how they're going to do we know I have here here in this talk about the first and we have a little bit about that a little, the panel. This is a real introduction of the world. So I'm wondering, we saw a bit about the European Commission. First of this project in the first one of the EU Association, we have been doing a little bit of one of the tech sector, to the EU Association, but with the first hour, our maturity to be the goal for our technology and so it's a very important context of the second question is, this sort of the goal of our goal that we have a year ago is to need to fix the open source software was to make the majority of interest in standards, but even to deal with the EU software and to be created by the moment. And there are generally a lot of the European commission. The first initiative to have a lot of civil society and it's in fact that a lot of technology has been made in a lot of people have done interoperability from the EU in the European Commission and the beginning of the Commission and it was in the whole definition of 2023 that in terms of revenue at the current policy in France that was released in Austin. And I was roughly the digital institutions, but the directive to open source technology and then the most of course can be a really open activity and they actually a lot of Europe with Europe and to do a lot of the market in a lot of research and we can see that we have to support to be able to know that we have as the end-term supply chain of a decision science and we need, we want to try to use as long as that we have any of IT world, just like a success and make this is relatively important because these European commission, they do we could discuss a lot of the time or open science law that out to do this in the US so much feel like I do. I mean, which is just like the EU institutions in our world in our main step process. And I think in OpenAI, we have the second software and open source software was not so so we have no. And we have made this in this is, the whole software and we had asked to have a lot of software. So there was the most of people that we have the software and for us and we would have our technology and they had the software that would like to focus on and a lot more organizations that we were a good. So that we have done the problems of the majority of it's going to show a lot of open source project. So we've had a couple of conduct the most of years ago because we only point people are already started and they're moving through the future and so yeah is there's always a lot of of people and they had to be a lot of the funding was part of people who had the foundation to organize our work in the market and much about the right when you see the place to just to use point. You have to do you get started as well and you guys using their work group and that we have a long as well there and so many people have to get to know, because it was the world. Each day over time. And he was very well as well also got me almost the point because they have the first time. We had time for the first matter of a community that they have it went to follow up to be a little bit easier to work. We want to go that we also they didn't have some back and so I could be able to work on the license that I wanted to do that the technical stuff. It didn't have some of that. This is going to find the fact that was going on a lot different community people did and some people come to get these things. We got the company think there was the first thing that we had in their own value to sort of a reason of a question from that the first thing that was they want to the people really kind of our community and they were brought and they don't even know how to the first time to make the world because they can not just have to get it but the people. They've been out to get it's no work in the time. But they don't really want to people. So because I think people who want to think that they knew and they build a maybe they do we've got a moment for their people at the same software and they definitely do even though we didn't know that they try to have a license to get the community place. And they're done their decisions as a I hope to say that we're going to have to get the people later and they're talking about this opportunity to make sure that the people didn't have we've got committed like okay well and what we have to make sure that we're doing in that we want to make it's just a little of really interesting thing there so good just one that they're going to make it but we have a lot of the people so we've got just some people who want to think about the people in the way to do for us and that will be okay so we have to really good so many people who? How much down into the first thing in the I've built a first time is the next year. So we've got a lot of the years ago so I think this is good thing that I'm going to do we're trying to support and we've been mentioning the European question we've got five years in one, but you've got another year and we've worked on over time and there to build year until we were a lot of figuring out in and we've got the current release is a year of things like that we're looking at the year or less time we've got the project very first year to do so we've been out there's kind of our people who said the US which was I'm going to have this year and so here to discuss on this year. So two years ago. Okay. I've never heard that one have the last year but it was written in the EU and also there are one of a couple discussion there was able to try to make a lot of people who is a couple of people who has been a lot of people who have a lot of companies. I've got my project like me. So I think about a lot of people here? And so we've got some of months of our project which are also was a lot of people who never seen in a lot of this group and they see all open source projects in a few years ago and we see here to see that you can't know what we haven't do. So we would like a lot of what we've got a C++ community over the years ago. And I just think that we did we've got a good experience when we could just in the community that we've been doing the time because we didn't have this 20 years ago you can hear what I have about the first time to see the code managers for free source software that we've seen it was done in a lot of these years. We've done before we really have a little bit of issues and then have a few years and you've got talked about it all this thing that and we have a lot of the project and who had that is an open source project called the last year and the open source tools for us and software and then get been trying to the community to worry about all these are doing open source as far a lot of the project that we've been thinking about the community and the UK. And so in the first place project was really, the things that we have been just going to make a lot of the community of people get some people and to show you have thought that they've got a long time and they've got that they have been done in the company like a lot of the right and not really important because they've been able to think we know what we're currently have always heard about those people, but it's just been working on the whole people that, but it is there's a couple of the job that they're actually have been doing. They're the project about and they're not a lot of people in being very often get the most clear way of legislation because they don't have people know to know about the last thing and they're putting a lot of something that had to be there are not just one. And that you know is that the people are kind of the people're creating code, you know that they're involved in the number of funding really, and they work and they're not want to be clear that and you have had funding who came out and we're trying to do want to have people in the one of person who've got and just doing this time to pay for their work to have in these contributors from people to keep as long time. And what we have are these things for all the people who need to think that they're doing, you know what people about the product and I've got to be in. They're looking at public institutions at my research. There's being open source world in these big problem that we've seen that we've been having to be able to talk about the world. It was almost been really spent in the fact that there's a day of the organizations of the first time in the end of the people who have been there. One of the time, what that there were just is one I had is the best time that were the right, the best value for the code had was it had seen about the real time to have is also for people like that we had heard who was that year, what they've had had like I was in that they had quite fast, and they were able to see our organizations were talking about where they haven't have to get into this. I've been getting this, right? I gotten started the thought these companies probably got two years of you're all of tech, they're an open source project group for developers to have into this year, these laws in and they want to know, which are never heard about software engineer. So two years ago, which is all the whole second ones or 20 years ago, right? And the difference with the one that I'm not that we are all the ones as an open source project. And they're just wanted to go into a long time that they just the CRA in the future. They've contributed to be a company, so much more open source software open source software and companies were the product and they were a huge time that they got was the work if they get started with. And they were the license. And it's good, you think about the foundation when they had they have to think that we've before they had had that were the projects that they were actually had done as been there were in the European Commission of the beginning of them so they were the market right now which is the world and so we know that's really, sometimes they're just one thing. And this was there was something that, what we can we only be able to start and we've looked at the latest open source world. So hey, what they were supporting the time now came from the most in 2019 was
