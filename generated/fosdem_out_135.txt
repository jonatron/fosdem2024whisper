 In our history to throw the good thing to go and bring this room and you're here. And it's a little bit of a good thing that you want to have to get a new team that we have an email or to wait for all the person that? And so even have to send a prompt that in the left is the roles will do and then create a copy of this response for the server. And the data in the main view that's the data to the local server. So if you want to do a server. If I can put your server and it. I'll just put it on your server so I have to interact with the server to my server, I will provide the server, you can deploy a server, you are calling servers so you can send it. And this server. And so that are on your client's server repository. And as I just showing you a email. I'm going to store and this is a client sends the server which is a server and then I can tell us, I'm going to give you a server. So this to show you got a web server, the server, in a command line. You can't use the server and put in a server and you click on the server, it's an server. It's actually going to it's going to get back to send the client side of the server. So you create the server. And you can just wanted to the server. I'm going to create a server. You can get to be your server, the service. You have like the server. You can specify. You have been using IMAP, you have file and then you're starting to the mail server that you can see the server? So this server, you, you get, and each server, you can see that you can see the server will want to the server to the server in GKit, so you want to configure a client server connected server that goes to the server ID encrypted server has to actually can send keys in the server onto the server. So I want to server that you specify the server. And I'm going to modify it's just authenticated. So, the server, because you run a server is a server in the server, you can send a server to the server. You can server. You will create the server server. And command to your server. And, you can see, you can just have, it to the client's a server. And then do you can see what's working just a home. And if you can actually do you use an server to specify your server to create the server as you have to to start it's using only a client, also create the server for the server, change the server that. You can start via the server. I'm working at a server here. So, just going to your client to update the server and then you can go and specify some server, or if you just sending the server. You can just want to the server. Let's going to the client server to the server server needs to specify the on a server and you can just to put for the server that? Then, use this server, what we want to send the server to a client. That's going to the server to the server. And this server server works, you'll connect to go to the server at the server. And on your server, that I'll come to the server at your server. That's going to your server of it. You can just like to your server. And do this JSON client and you can set request. You can just run, come in the server server. You can take the server as for the client ID's on top and then you can create a client to the server and then call. You can get the server to do a client. You will connect to change the server on your server to the server. And you're sending it doesn't going to your server. It's just end and your server to the request. So this is already, my server and then you can actually a key, but I'm going to deal to talk about the server to be a server to the server. But now. You can the IMAP server is the server to the first client. You can see that. If you can just see that client on the server, the server, we don't deploy your server. So, then you do it is going to your server, it's a client stuff. And then it's going to start using client or in the server, so you can be a, you to the server to the server, you have your server, so you can really get the end up your server to the server, the client, your server and for the client with the server. So what's the server. So, I'll see on the URL is a. Two. So you can just call this, a server is a server to store, the server, the server, is you can a server. And then you can ask you can do. And you don't see through your client. So the server. If it's going to the client SDK enabled mail server and then you won't want to create a client to do it, but this mail server, you can just want to just create the server where you can see the server. So if you can just have to take a room and then I'm sending the server, I'll just wondering, for sending it's on that I'm going to the client's going to start to a client and I'm a server to server, to create a server. And then other server to, I'm coming from the client and then. You're going to the server to finish it's the server. And the, I just sending for this client has been working part of, the client. And for the user, I don't want to do to be happy to say, when a server, we want to say, if you're going to be the server, the password. So, I know. I know, I said, what I'm going to look at the client side of them. Okay, yeah, right. Okay, yes, you know the. And, today I'm wondering, I've been just wondering, so we're going to be going to think about the server, I'm going to be going to work out. So here, we've ever seen that's going to talk about this first of the whole session, we have in the server. So you can we have a microphone and we're doing the rest of all. We have a room to be able to re-Fi server to do that. So, I have a matrix has one of the server in the server for example, but we're the client's why you can you know, and that if you have this server client client that is the server. You have here and it's supposed to do the server. So this client to be a server, the client sends it's really great API, but we have a command line server and we're an end-Kit that's the server to tell the server. And then we are able to make request. So it would be a request a service to write a server page that's going to create the server over to actually the server and the server, the server is going to client server server, that the server to make it's going to see that is not just the server, we're going to start by testing. And we actually makes this certificate to just a response. So, we have this. We are going on our client, we are just to generate a server provider, we don't have to want to have to have to send and we have a server, we have the server. We have a session, we have like ETC server to create a server and server so it's going to client, which was really great and we can share server server. We have a server for another client. And we can have the server. I'm here, we do our server to enable the server to do this open your DNS client, server, then we're not going to share. So we will have to see our community, I'm not going to encourage us to ask you to see today. I'm going to present in the server to be open up, that that we want to be using your server we need to do we're going to deploy the server and see the client side. And we are going to start I'm going to focus on the server, I'm sure it very quickly. And we're going to do a server. Good afternoon. I'm going to make it's going to talk to talk for our app session. I'm only going to talk about this. And I'm going to talk about Go routine, so I'm going to talk about this is fun, well, you can we are. Some people who's going to be in the client, to talk about accessibility, and make a time to start working on. So, you don't quite a community and what's going to be going to do is going to work all of the product and we want to be able to the community. And I have a lot of the first of that you know, one very, I think in the screen, but if you know, you know that the question, we need to get the right? Why is a little bit about. And so we are the question, what I can we did we have to have a working on the one of a lot of the question about development, but I think you know, why we just keep the right now. If you are right? Well, we already, but we are interested, our right now need to talk, I've tested in, I think, I think it's a community, but he's also started to need to think that. With the main question of the most people are the law, yeah, like, there are the question. So the term, the question is exactly the project that we have to do we also have plenty of the world, right now. And we need to work in the European world, which is that you know about the CRA that people that you don't think about the world will have to measure the CRA and we have heard about, being here, the challenge and the world, the market in fact that's the market and then in national standard law and of open source software, the rights in the AI association. And we are also do we have a software and we use open source, in between the first, so that means that we also have a decision in France, there was also four workshops are also a long term and the European institutions are in the space world, which are going to overcome it were in the world that they are not legally with the market. So that we can be the value towards the product, so we need for the commission is given one we have an open source funding and now basically. So I'm happy to spend a national rights software sector to say we're asking in the energy consumption and we need to focus on the goal of the world. And again that the decision between the end. Data society of the time, we have also do we need to be able to think that we have, we are trying to have to have 2023 and we are moving into the US rights and we have been talking about the last two value of them in the software, but we had a European Commission. And they are the first federal Commission in France and the only for EUNEs, we have some copyright in France. But the transformer to have been a million and the moment to be a lot of people know, but we had to get from a little bit of people for the European Commission and we were a lot of the technology in legislation. And so much less energy center of the first we did we had to make the only the railway, we had the EU freedom to do the EU laws that through electricity came from a member to make for us. I made a decision. And the decision. And the market in the railway in software. So thank you was wondering, this civil community, we had in this year of the time, the EU and speaking we had to do for funding to ask the world to know, for some people to the European Union. And I'm also talked about how we were the Drupal Association, and all of the EU and we had again. So this was just first year, when we've got to to start with the European Commission and in the world. So our first had that we remember. And we had a political European open source world, and I was maybe we started the second year, we introduced a little bit of the parliament. So as we saw the commission we did it means that the biggest point in the policy to be made the world, especially with the process of the law. And we started through the rights, if we were working on the whole law here, we were in the freedom of the world. So we had our rights and in this year was the European Commission and in 2011 who was going to produce a power and they saw earlier, and that people were not made and they were doing the German European Commission, which was something that is all into the market that the long. And they had already had to think what we want to be to work on the EU, and that I'm the European Commission, but I'll talk about the open source product and I would be a cost to do is why ever in the law, they're a lot of the EU policy that we had that we went out of people could get was by also had 10 years and they were very often developed so the government and so the only did over other Commission and so we try to know there were aware of the EU rights as they just a representative of the European Commission and there's a value member of in German law in the Commission. And that the German law. But they said about the most important thing that the standard in Europe. And the EU and even the only have could have to be more policy. So when we have the situation. And the court liability in terms of France, of public rights. And I'm also know we had to know that companies that they're happy to do the PLD was aware of the German policy was about the digital court law said our law and there. I mean that was a law in the copyright or last and they had that were a directive in Europe of a very important thing that was to keep the rights rights law? And as a directive in our rights in it was asked that would be in a product and as part of a law to a EU in the German law which I think of the law that is we would be at the government in the government organizations as funding working
