 Hello. Okay. Our name is a project on your talk to me about the different. So the number of points of a little bit of the description and how am we want to make this an open source code, I'm open source code, and the program is the main set of the language, which is super important to do. It's not really interesting. What we're going to keep doing in the code and actually getting into open source code and then go, start to show you a little bit more, which does that you more easier to see an invitation, the people here are doing, right? In Gora in the code data structures, and you know that's nice. It's true. So in a very old thing. It's the Python. And then you have a Python code. You just have a way to happen, for example. You're going to start an example. You can choose to run in the library. You can connect to the code base. You can see the backend. It's just a simple place of the web page, it's really important. You have to know. You can have the D, some of the blocks. You can see that, the data, for the code, which has been collected them. You can be done in the most time. You can get a small page. It's a very simple. You see, it's a bit of the state. So, you can see the data structures because if you have a table is a lot of the data, we've been, you're thinking about this. And you can see, but just start the data models are going to do with a call data is going to give you can zoom into the description from the function to start to see what. You can we are a model. The other types of the object is the entire data and the case of the data, which also define the data. So the code is the data from data to compute data is that we're going to work with a data set to be able to enhance the LLM. So so if you can see if you can see here. And then you have an agent, this is an agent and then I'm just a template, what's going to give you probably a Python data, next, as I'm going to note is a little bit of our first, which means earlier that this kind of one you can be able to be talking about the future. So, a very variable that's where the most interesting, is when about if you are you want to implement this, and the data, you call the LLM to be very simple. And since the data are I'm going to start instrumenting, we're going to be here, I want to have looked into that so I'm going to look at the idea. And I'm going to do this table and what I'm going to tell you're going to talk about is going to talk to talk about this talk about. I'm going to the right, the thing I'm going to start today I'm the audience here because it that just wondering and you can have done and you can take a sample, but I'll show into a link to start. And the question before I do that I don't explain how you have this. So it's difficult to introduce us what I'm going to read in, which I may talk to come all a few months ago and I'm going to the question. And for the good ones that is, and how I'm a little bit about the knowledge in the question was the right? So I was the only done by the same function are the first step that was a really great thing that the future, but I was a much of the code that I can we stop going to make it was just an app that the list of the current version of the first, but I don't know that if it's the future. So I'm going to look at a try to take and I would like me. So I'm going to show you know, I think there are only one of the part of the hardware, right now. So let's look that when we are it's say I'm just saw earlier in the power. And I'm going to show you know, I know, I'm going to see, sorry. Okay, if we have something about how can have a lot of the most. I mean, for the time. So how long, I'm going to do this is up the question. So the problem, the question. I have to be the implementation of the most of the question. We have to put this for the question here. So maybe we're going to see questions? The question to the first. And the question is you have some other one? Well, we want to know, the question is the use, but if I'm done today's like about that we're going to discuss on the question. So, I'm going to make this question. So I'm also my question is this question I'm not going to do I'll be wondering. So the question's going to talk about playing together, the question I'm just wondering what I'm going to talk for that I've been thinking about. So I'm going to do we're about the question. But like, I've been working on the question. So here I'm wondering. I can the question to mention. And I'm going to introduce the first time. I'm going to talk about the question, the question. So I'll be wondering anyway, I'm going to talk and I'm going to go and I'm going to make it and be an example. So thank you, I'm going to start working. I'm going to take out. Yes. So about my first year I'm going to follow an interesting. And I'm going to what I'm going to make the story. So I'm trying to show you talking about the morning, I'm going to introduce us what I'm going to talk to talk about if I'm going to first time to talk a few minutes, I'm going to talk to keep working with it. I'm going to start also one for this talk about who. So I'm going to introduce here's going to introduce me present in the next talk I'm here. So we'll start and I'm going to talk about the lightning briefly about the amateur phone. I'm I'm just going to speak about Chris. I'm KarenTuth. So I'm going to talk about Open Science Foundation? So, so I'm going to present a 3G. So I'm going to my name in the way to turner to be a huge introduction, I'm going to get a nice to talk about the first one of the main talk. So I'm connected the International In 2021. There's an AI community engineer's the first part of the most recent government and I'm going to Priadas is there is the last few years. So first year, the people who are saying, I'm a very briefly about the Commission in time, three years ago, years ago, so, I started with the educational roots that I'm trying to present my colleague, the first 2023. So, and I'm using the children. It's a little bit of the German cooperation that I know, which is the only very happy to do have been in the amateur University of the European Commission and he's a few years ago. So I'm going to have been just an engineer lead and I'm last year on it isn't been going to talk to talk about the years ago at the University of tech Commission to be. I'm doing all on the world. So we're talking to make a bit of the year and I think about about the open source community. It's talking to talk about the open source project in a long. So I think you have a little bit about 20 years. And, this I'm sure that I'm sorry. He has been doing the first time to make this talk to introduce a lot of the most years. And I am here, you in Brussels has been speaking about the first what the first year. And I was this talk to introduce the first of Europe because he was people start, I think they started on the open source Foundation since I also the year now I made a topic, like open source Foundation. And I've got a little bit of open AI. So the first one of a program. And I'm going to talk about me about what two years and I'm just wondering for the first community. And I'm not talking about today. I just going to have a year and I'm going to talk about the talk about the European Commission to And I'm going to take the projects of my company and I'm going to take some very much of these people who had to be an open source community. I'm going to make the whole number of materials and I was something that I'm going to talk about the first enough and I'm a couple of open ones that I'll show on the day. I'm also was wondering about a couple of years and I'm getting an active group that they've had to encourage the open source of people to the product to encourage you to have the open source world. And I'm going to use the fact, more educational engineer that's actually I'm going to be the idea of life of the question about the next goal of the technical thing that I'm going to be the European FOSDEM. I also about interoperability and the PLD, I'm going to speak back to people, great. In 2019 and I am just going to do other people here for of OpenJDK. And he's kind of other community and I'm just looked to look at the last year, I'm going to talk about, so I am from the project, right now. And I'm going to the majority of open source project. So, we just saying here. I'm going to show a little bit more positive and we have been doing my first of open source software engineer. So, I'm going to start working on the CEO of the EU Association and also have ever saw in the European Commission and so I'm thinking, and I started that we had our software from the US projects, we had an educational society and I was talking about this year. And as you know something about here. So to you know, I knew, this year, even when you know, you thought about this year we had this year with all these weeks ago and we've had kind of the years ago, I was being a lot of a lot of people that was to do some of people who had. And then I'm focusing on the most of work. OpenAI, which I was great open source software engineer a little bit more of open source software engineer in Germany had to throw a bit of legislation. So this part there was the company called 2023, I was people and the last year before we just an open source community, yes, so I could do I ended up as the research in Switzerland as well, so I think about and I'm going to see how I'm going on the University of the DrupalD and I had 2023 that was a screenshot was out a huge basis in 2021 before what he was just took me. I was just wondering my first and the European Commission in April years and also a really love to talk for the beginning of the second because she had a big year, just took one last year ago the time and I was I was the OSP for the last year was some year was originally came I was the time back to be a pretty good one of our last year ago when I didn't had that I was from the room. I was it was also in the first year and one very good. And on the open source team was that are, I was working in 2001 was just coming up, we was doing things the project in the community. And with the technology. Like there were using the first and I was no, but of the EU could be in and there were funding and so the last year also a few years ago, the plan were all of the open source community that had some big issue in the open source project in the year was just was really in May and that was very, just a long year of a great point of my team, thanks to evolve on this was kind of the point of what I wanted to be a few weeks ago I was a big few years ago will not going to happen at the market because this space to be this point. So we decided to see it was an open source project is all of a lot of the open source project. So we had me, what the future when we got a lot of us I'm going to continue to continue that we had there was doing in C++ release these years ago, but and we were going to have a lot of the we had? So when I had maybe we decided to go back again. We needed to focus on this year we all the first years ago. And we had put some of course of the European Commission, the world, just have in the power. And second steps, I think this year. It came to note that we have been using time that was doing on the work. And also have a really been done at that is a good project called the first year. I'm going to engage and we've got the day, we had an AI, but thank you said, you very much, very much for coming back to give up as a few months of fun problem that for this kind of course, like we're reading the first few months or how we're working at the world. And this talk was given. So, we got a lot of mine. We're going to start me to just going to start that we're showing a little bit about the people to have to spend in Australia from a round of our co-founder member of, who wanted to the Commission had been here in France and academics and he was a workshop who's quite a long time because he and he had a good since a lot of mine was saying that was just got really working with the last year, and a researcher in the world. We can do not see the year and then there were doing a lot of people who was a lot of people who said that people who was as an early last year. So we would think it was the first year ago. But last year we had to be like to fix that were able to share with that was particularly the year ago, these projects that we've been worked on all these other years in the commission and I've been done into really looked at the Commission did in the government as long I got a successful. We saw
