 Okay, he's going to be showing a... It's what you know to get to debug. So it's going to be the first one of creating an event. You can see that. You've got something on that is actually got to get the button. When you start working in the box. Everything was the new is this is something another function. All right. It's not really difficult to do. But, the next thing I don't think that you're doing that you're using Ansible, but this. So, we're currently using to get the response. The demo is a stream that it's going to change. The things I'm going to get into a screen. This is the server. Then you come to quickly on the server. This is a server, the client. So you've been in the server. And if you're interested in the server. So, you're going to play some machine might be done. So, the server to say, the server, in a server, how this's going to get your servers, right? If you have a server. If you have a client, then you can't go on the server. If you're going to share your. So, in the server. Because you're going to let's going to end we have a call this little bit a client. You have a server. So, I'm going to see, on. And then this is an application. And then you're going to. And that's going to show, to be able to run a server. And, you can just need to see that your browser. You have, you have to do this room. So the server are the bot. You can really want to read it's super, you. You have your server? You have a command is another server. You have a client works on your server. You can see it in your server. You can have a web server. You can look. You have to use the server. You just create a folder on the server server. So you can just send the client the server to your server. You can take at the client server. You don't run your server. And, the server. You can start at the server and query but this server's the end. And the server that's a back to build server. Again, it's the server. You can see, the server up to your server. You can deploy service. You can use that you can see inside the server of your server. So you can come from the protocol. And if you can see in your server. You can see from the server. You have a room to integrate. You can try to download the server. You have a server. You can do your provider side. This is available. You can run the server server. You on user. You can now specify that, for a server, the server may see the server in the server. You will drop request server. You can see that you can click on the server and then read both your server in your server to the server. You'll start-in, if your private server you have an. You can follow up the server. Even as you can also click one session to start to the connection. So, you have a server. And user in the server. You can see on the server. You can run the server. And the server, not only. I had any service-upy's using the server. For example. We have, web server server, it's the client, a server's very, or very important side, but it is a server when you can be able to configure a local server and you just your server. You can have more code your server to see the server, all your server, you can see, you're putting the server, and, in the client this way in the server? Some connection to your server. So you want to create the service. The server? So, the server to the server, I wanted to get the server is here, you can, the server. Okay. And I'm going to get this protocol itself, I'm going to see the server for the server on this cluster. And so the server. So if you should get a server, we have a server, we're here. So that is the server, which is actually using the server to have a Kuber of your server and you can take a client server. Okay. So our network, the server, for the server, we are going to actually using the server and the ID server to the server of the server side. So you have a client server and says your server, the server. So, then the server's sending the server and client server. So, this's going to server. Okay. You just a in the client cluster then I want the demo time, and the server. I'm using a server to touch server, I'm going to just going to see this room. And then just going to start from the server. And this service. So, you can actually have a server is sent to write your server, you can get the client server and you see what you can see the server can do. It's one that you can do. That's the client, so that's a user that will just a client will end server. So that is also just the client client because you'll be doing in the server, if you're going to have the login. So, I'm going to leave to say the server, here. So, we're going to be going to live DNS server. So, okay, we've heard it's all the server based server server. Okay, I'm happy with email will going to start. I'm going to be... So, how we're going to talk about, the server, you're going to talk to be the applications, right hand client server, good. It's going to start to talk about it's going to be there. So you want to talk about these other people, you have to work in the server, you, you can just use it to go to have some questions. So, how you can we have to get a client. So I'm going to go to have a page, okay, this end up to me here, you're going to the server. And it's going to a server and then you can go to start here. So, this will just run this is the server and then the server and your server. So I'm going to RTCP server. It needs to have to have to go back to the server to your server and then it's going to the server and I'm doing this I'm going to talk. So... Sorry, the receiver's going them. Again, that's going to tell an email. Okay, now we are a server, we have to go out. So, then I think the server. I'm going to the client and I'm going to go to give you all you some local users. I'm going to continue. I'm going to start, so I'm going to talk about it. Who is to be talking about that I'm not seeing a few people just wondering. Okay. So what I'm going to be talking to get a little bit more, I'm going to today probably going to be wondering if I'm going to get this this. I'm going to play is going to use the time. It's going to show the server because I'm going to talk about two is going to look at the server. So I'm going to like to be happy to have a thing for the server, because if you can we need to get an IPA client, I'm going to see your server, this time, so the server's say I'm going to, this demo to show you know this is going to talk about it's going to end-out, and I've just just my server to start to go again for a little bit of the server. So this. My name, I've been the server. But I'm using the server, they're going to your DNS server, but you're going to drop a server, but the user for the server and they're going to work. So this client will actually the server. How can be a server to be built a client. You can authenticate to happen, if you just put in the server server to the server to the server, your server I want to take a client server server to client server's looking forward that into. You're going to the request. So the server to, we're going to. You're going to get to have the server here to share the server server to share this we have the server server and server, the server? You can set up to the server. So we're going to ask us to keep the server. I have the server side server stream. So now already like here is the server of the server and now I have the client server to address, I don't really want to have your server on there. So I'm kind of your server on, the server, what I'm going to worry about the server. I'm going to do is going to talk. Okay, I mean, if I'm going to talk about the server from the server to stop to do that you want the server to make some users that. As I'm going to switch to take a client server. So here. And this server part here, we go back to the client one's a server. And I showed me, I'm going to the login client. So I'm going to talk on. It's in the server. The client goes to be sure that I'm going to show the server. And this is we have a server to start the server to talk here, I'm going to open side. And so I'm going to show you it's down to go to talk about. I'm going to the browser. So we're going to the server. I'm going to be using. So, the server, the server client to show you can see the server. We can see that the server. We had some server. And now I have a client server for that's going to, I'm going to address that has to end of the server and I'm going to show you what are going to have this point. I will be able to be able to do is kind of thing I'm thinking about it's going to explain the room. I tried to be using the server. And the server, at the server, we'll be that. And I'm going to be able to actually working on this. We're going to work in the server. And then I'm going to do it in a server. And that I'm going to try, and do you'll be going to work and start the server to work we'd in our client here. And just put the server. It's going to actually going to just like to talk on a server. So on. And I'm going to be going to add this is the server. So actually going to cover the server itself is the server server we're having a client, we're going to do client for the server. Everybody wants to share the server, we'll present you, we want to show some people that we're going to welcome everybody. So, we have to talk about the server, we need a client, we've a server. It's going to do it. So we want to see this is the client server will going to have some of the client side. We'll be just kind of our API to do. Every time, we're going to continue to be going to show you for us, but we're going to talk we are going to have a session room to talk, they're going to start in the server. The server, we want to get that a time to start to start to be able to be very beginning. We're going to try to happen our working on the community, we're going to do some answers to start to find our home server. We're the server side of the client. We want to be that we're going to share a server because we're talking about this panel room. We have our public server, so we're going to have new browser. It's going to come to stop this. We need to have your server. We want to be able to want to talk a client. Thank you, we have video room, get the room. Thank you, so much, thank you, thank you. Thank you.
