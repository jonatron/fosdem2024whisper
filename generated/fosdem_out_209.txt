 thank you very much for everybody. I'm very wondering. I have to I'm mistaken. So I'm going to be open source team. So thank you very much for the next couple of stickers. 
 Hi everyone for our GitHub who we're talking about all in the last year I'm I'm all thank you very much for attending. I'm Martin, Chris. I'm going to have grown to be here to start a few times for this week and I'm very exciting to give you a little bit about this last year at the year, little bit about today. I've got a few years. I'm curious about our engineer at a year. And I've been going to work on what we have to talk about myself. The first thing is we can be looking like you can see. And what are now, a talk's going to create the first one of the founder of the CERN just a company. It's an hour science, who have to be the German Commission and the main goal to keep getting into the panel. But I'm going to be the problem. Okay. So I'm going to talk about the last one is to be a few weeks ago in 2023. And also open source contributor. I'll show you that I'm going to start at the years ago. I'm going to get back here. I'm going to have a talk about myself in in the Next year. I'm just one year to talk about a slide. I'm like some stickers. It's a little bit, why my name of the European year and I'm going to show you very happy to go here. We have here to have a good on. So I'm having a little bit about the talk about the last year. So the moment you today in 2017. So I'm going to talk about the previous talk to start the world is a little bit of open source projects, as a long as Mike said, and how we also, like the last year. So I think I'm working last year I'm just using a year and I have the first year, the room, in the European Commission at the room. And, and I'm going to a few years ago. And I'm also saw at this talk about this at the next year and I, so I was talking about about the last year. I'm also saying about a bit about the future. We've been about the previous year from CNC, European Commission Alliance engineer. I was a bit about the first year ago, we used to do some of the project around the first release of the world. So I was a couple of the work at the founder of months. And so, yeah, the first I gave us, I've said, there is the problem in terms of the beginning, but most of the Commission, yeah, so I've been started to my last year. And this is the project that's the International Next year last year ago and we are when we have been doing this year, so I'm really have been writing a thousand years and as the CEO and I will have been a lot of a big things that we have been working over year and for having to talk some six months. And the first year, the moment. Okay, we have one year we have a couple of the last year and we had a lot of years to make this year now. Because, and all of time to talk about the point, thank you today. Thank you very much. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much everybody. 
 Okay. Thanks for everyone, I'm going to introduce a live in a little bit later on our next speaker and so much much. Hello, we did it. So thank you hear me. You saw a little bit about the last year. So I'm my talk about the panel, I'm RBC 2 and I'm going to Manuel. So I'm the start his presentation. So, sorry. I'm going to talk about the next year ...8th Alian because I'm going to show up with a few years so. I think I'm going to present a day. I'll talk about the first year and I'm going to about a little bit about the last year ago and I'm a year. I'm going to talk about about an first year. I'm wondering about, so I'm going to talk on the main part of the first. I'm going to talk about the moment. The idea is a new talk about I'm looking over there. And I'm going to talk about something I'm going to have to be a lot of my slides. And, and the first time to talk is that I'm going to present you. And I'm an educational engineer at the most of the latest development. I'm going to talk. This is going to talk here a very first day. And I'm going to be talking about and I'd like to briefly about the University have to this project that if you. Yes, this? I will be here, I think I'm going to show you're going to be at the video on the year. So I'm going to talk about it's going to present a lot of my presentation. I'm going to run my power panels on the year. So our talk is the fact that she's the background part of all the first idea. So we've had a few years ago. We're going to go for our talks to attend. This is before I'm here. And I think they are the top of the co- Source Foundation. He's the children and the challenges of the tech, we have heard about accessibility in the biggest world. And I'm doing that we've got one of the first 20 years ago, the first time, the first year and I'm going to show you got a lot of the time to see. And but I didn't think in the year ago, there was really talking about what I moved to highlight that we've got a technical colleagues at 4G of this project. And I'm just wanted to do that we did because we have been doing a program when we have been mentioned earlier and we ended up with a little bit about the last couple of the talk about 10 years. And I also had some talks on the main thing, that I'm just said, so I'm going to talk about energy. So I'm going to explain a little bit about the technical questions, a job. I know what I'm getting, to the first time, and I was interesting thing to mention, the summary of this is we had the majority of the same time. And I think that we've got fun. And in the last year ago, I'm like we've seen this really excited about energy, the women in the presentation that in our product was Andrew was the first time, which was the year. And we started in the idea for a lot of companies and I had an open source world, the current community of their career to know how that the last year and I had been the first thing that I've been doing was an introduction to focus on the public community and after we've been talking to do we were seeing the software, is the open source law. And I can be a lot of the community and so many companies were in the thing that I was done, that they had said, but people and the company do after that group of the political on the open source can't think of the moment, they know. And we'll talk about the last year, and finally, and they give the US, they can't just do anyone has a co-source license and that for open source software, I think about the years of it was the tech that became almost being used in the company was on this, right? And since we had the OSSEC is great point in June, so the fact that there were because I was made the Cyber society has been then quite a first thing that is I felt, but also taking into the last three weeks. So it was the market and the European UK to make an Australian Commission has been that was a big decision, but also developed out and the companies have been 2023, but he had on a point of the last year. And I was there is that was also I was a bunch of the most people to the world now and the CRA started to know and I got any extent that the ITF rights to the world because they was working group was asked and they were going on the government of their government in the same commission and it was I think, so they were not, and they have the government in Europe was there isn't just the beginning of the open source community to be the only enough and they also that they are not enough and you know what they really want to think about the people have had to be there, but they've been kind of the market and they know, they're a matter when they're looking for their EU company and they're going to be really good economic field that they have to take a single challenge of the world to be affected by themselves that they're all of the act as well. So in the knowledge are the European Commission had been developed over to be part of the world. So therefore they're going to learn some of the EU countries that I could be a long time to do we've seen this panel and I don't know so i think, like the most interesting thing that's true is not the whole aspect of the reasons but we need to solve just focus to fix the commission that they just don't do so we're going to have the workshop to do that you should go. My question. And I think is going to speak to sit out what we're going to give a few months ago, like a year bit of all the reason to try to be the market to you what they get to be a bit of the policy that is to be from copyright act on one of an important. So that is I have the moment the law. And then. And right? So before we see the Drupal world are the CRA and then the year, is going to have a Drupal, we're going to keep going to allow us going on the first one really think that the EU staff is a skill into free standard, and we've been using a lot of the first time we can think we want to give us about this open source community. We have. We said that we're going to be a lot of law we're going to look, so in the year. And when we've been released our plan for the organizations are we decided to do this over and we need to have to be trying to be aware of all, what we've got a lot of the companies and we're going to know the end to have an engineer, the women who are the first term of the value that we have seen why we have been talking about what he's what we need to speak about the idea that we have the community as the product, and we're thinking about that we have to, we have to say, which is the market and we're hoping to think we need to keep the day. We have been doing that technology. You know what each hour of those really want you know about this knowledge will have could do with this, not open source community and we had them. But we've got to focus on the person who would have done this to do. It's fun to achieve on open source and the foundation at the other thing. There's called OpenJDK, we're all the world. But this is the beginning of the end of the challenges, in the people who have been in this year. It's the first of the last line to present in the OpenBLA and we're the co-Spy in Airflow is Tomias, I also for open source software engineer at OpenDesk. So this case, we have the same end of the foundation, who is the technology in which is used to be a software. It's a company for open source implementation of the first of VEs. He's a bit more important to be a community to do of open source code that is working group of ethical people on their goal of the world. And last year you know, we had to talk about the most open source community of the other countries in the challenges. The first one thing that we have is to have heard of these two years ago. So I think of a member of the University of what are a long term that the world, but in the beginning of the main issue of the ones that we've been working on the world and companies already mentioned open source world of the EU projects of these open source software is the years the panel, first half months. We also a first sentence to be able to the idea of the community perspective was to get involved in with the code. And the first thing that was like I'm the first part of data and the way of the people're asking about the community. So the big one is the open source project was not. And so that that was very important and the EU. We've been discussing this talk was the world, I think I discovered it was here was like to pay for the US and we need to think it was to have to know the state that I think about the ones there was a lot of the future in the effect of the future for the question is in the challenge. So when we have one, we have a lot of us. So we had to speak about the open source software to the only office was we had a positive point of the technology people in the moment, we also did we were talking about open source software in our organization and we were in the overall. But we had to be aware of us for the world and we have to hope to do and we move over time we would like to the software. There might be more, the first time and there. So, we've got a good thing is the first one I'm a bit more important to that we've ever heard about the question. And I kind of the answer is the question. So this is still a little bit about and because that we have, we have been thinking about like I mean, we also don't think about the interesting ones that to have like we want to do this information about accessibility, the question, the question was about the question when we made some of this talk and a question, when we understand about whether we have seen to have to people from the question was there are the question to understand the thing where we do we had to bring the good stuff and that we have. You can do something, but this, we have to use, well, but we do we're talking about that like the question was in a question, which is that you think about
