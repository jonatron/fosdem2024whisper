 Hello everybody. So start this work. Hi, thank you very much it's first thank you very much for the applause for the largest talk about us in the first talk first talk today in the new open source community and welcome, thank you everyone for everyone, Daniel we. And, just to we are all here, so Thanks everyone, everyone for the core guys, I'm just on many questions?  everyone for this talk. First, that next year in here is Aless Room. And today, I'm mostly a talk about OSP Association. We are the next talk about the talk from the Science. And I was contributing to the big talk to the European Commission were doing. And I am Alexander has. I'm gonna give this talk about Google Summer of this year to the most of CentOS Foundation, you a couple of the European Commission, and IMS Association work, including the United States. So KMS 2G. And so I'm going to work on the lead and I also my first thing I'm I'm Markus Tina in the O Science Leome, the last member to I'm here in all last year and we were on open source community since today that was a few euros for the EUs for the other companies were working work at the OSP, as the big knowledge over the EUjo. And now the European Liability. And I decided to present as we are the idea as we have the PLD-based 3GG energy rights and also been working on the European Union. And when we also, we present for us. And we have some of course, our question was that we built on our Commission, but I was like a few years ago, and we had the CERN, which is in the organizations, which were one is where they were really going to reuse the EUEs in Europe. It was thinking in this year. And that's what we also kind of the world, what happens, this is quite, how can we did we have the European Commission, but we had the goal of the European Commission and we set up to make our first-end protocol where we are we had to think about the European Commission. We started showing the US decided to start a bit about it and the European Commission, if our first step happens, how they actually we're going to look at least last year. What decided to do I did a very much time, I wanted to ask a lot of course, so this day the German Act and the last year ago, the UKI was I'm going to be in the Open Science, which was a talk was a long as much more of more important for that the European Commission started. But I told you had something that I know what we had a few years ago, a software and a major issue a lot of the project. And so that had, you know there were talking about the fact that were a set up and a lot of conducts and they believed in the world, the ones, we were not just tried to figure out that you know, but it's when you and they were using the world, so they know, they were getting the way they were going to bring the open source code. So it doesn't just wanted to a lot of us to look at the beginning and I think it, and it was actually been doing the years ago. And the outcome is a lot of actually that the moment and they didn't provide its software and they were about the moment. So this was the first time was a lot more important and we had to worry about the moment, but they've worked on the one and especially when you had to know, and you were wondering, but I've made a lot of the thing to find the license in there's the license in the license and the people who were not just wondering at the, so that market in the same time, they were very talented law and they had some people to make a person who had these uh, we've always remember out the public law agencies. And a clear we have said, the internet was a software was a time. So of that you know there were people to get two rights and they were two more and they found a little little bit of their work on the law, they were interested in the market of the companies that the company has only way to be aware of the European Commission to do that were still and they had from the copyright law, and they were available to the law in the parliament who were no law that was interesting? The government there was originally had two laws in the law, at the law. And they thought they been a decision or the policy and they try to be in that they have a law and they would be a GPL law between the risk a court law when they were I had no value of copyright and they were not had these kind of the licensee would be the copyright open license and they were the world the license becomes often were not what he had happened there were moved. So and they were actually they already learned even a copyright agreement was actually not a law that in one was the copyright policy to not the law. And they were only had been that they kept going to the first, but they actually as it was always be actually had to give that was sort of the world. I just wondering that they were the UKists didn't know the value and that they did going got the policy of the commission had the law and decided that had it was done about copyright was done was not when he didn't know, but we had one of the same is just had to accept and also did not. And I made this was not a copyright knew. I'd be the first time. And after that were at the term being collected the last year was a year or in a long time when they were done the companies got this law and they were also they had a given us were essentially they have had is it would seem to look at the commission but they were super money we had to grow the value because those world were more countries that they was just is actually there were asking you were a solution. But at the copyright law actually very difficult to train the moment the commission and when they had this time in the beginning in actually had had had the public sector and we had a problem. The of the law came up and he was we haven't actually got a law, what we were doing was another law that was just had a problem about the really was that was just learned were doing was just a GPL and for the law that can't been doing was trying to do an energy is. And we had a clear law decided to the most decision to do they were seeing these laws and that is an issue was the GPL and did not good good year that not really in law and I had a law that I just had like an open source law then you know that something for an court of legislation is that came up and they were doing the law and as well didn't quite a copyright rights would have in the commission and they were the GPL is involved in and they could be had then it didn't understood before just they got a decision and I think they were a copyright value. They they knew that they could tell you know what they had to be able to report policy policies, because they made the copyright value of what I said in my opinion in it was the law that nobody could be the court on the parliament was only value of the license that the copyright of the law they were that I didn't need to be not so the law or to open law because that still because they were in the case that we had had said in legal act were captured by the GPL GPL license so um because they were trying to in and not at those decisions because they were well again a copyright mean government don't that they were able to realize that were a copyright law, we are here was saying that the keys was just is not very copyright policy and they had and the google law and they were a license in law the infringement is not the value. And that the law was in copyright law. But that they were in the issue and they had already had a value. But there was the copyright product in the fact that is a but they had nothing two licenses that, which was on the law was quite beneficial to do that was doing the law to be there was that they saw that were that. With copyright license. And it was here was now. And I could be interesting thing. In my EU. You don't know when you know what we had to know that it was the license, but they're not just saying they can't know if they thought just have these the policy and they have more in the license that at on certain law that they know and they didn't have been given away that was also so they did that. They're just were copyright so what were the GPL licenseability mechanisms for the copyright law law. But it was the human is sort of copyright is an law and they could be the GPL GPL license license and like an law and they are some they are not as a regulation. But what the really happened because the copyright clause was the reason, like it only license and after the money to do you said is we have no, right software, there is a copyright on the license and was an copyright and there was that a copyright licenses as well, in fact, they were the law that they had a no clear the they are still actually not used in the first policy could be no known in the copyright holder was still interoperable knowledge in copyright then we thought to pay a GPL? I think that they mean, they can be the license policy should be perfect act in the copyrightability in open money, but still the people to open license away from time they only only for doing and they know that they would not have at the security and they just kind of in their scope they asked for the GPL. I think that I think wasn't know that. But if you know, the fact I thought the software's, you know, you think about doing is definitely need to know, but on the source software space had given problem in the copyright law in the law that we can go into the way one that when they were to the GPL v4jos. But the license is organized. It's so we're following any aspect of the possibility to say it's an obvious in a law and so that's the license and this the copyright law, okay, and is the German copyright. But of the law and the directive and a GPL law law has the directive and she said, because they just be a and um, the keys for copyright law, and the value of the court will lose their value is only thing. It's like the law in the law was that are not just GPL law directive. The license has copyright act in this product that an injunction and that the legislation because they have not just a copyright. So the best that's a copyright law mean the question was a law. So that open source copyright we're typically have a copyright value of the GPL law in the licensee that law rights will actually an open license, but of legislation are that it's a GPL and they would happen to be the German law that I think that nobody would be any copyright law, and they not even more license and it's it's in the law law is the law directive in legislation and they know and they're even be always a open trust though they don't so they want to open license market not GPL was that they don't have like GPL being no they may also respond into GPL is clearly, they're looking at least wanted to it. They should be a very far as far. And then they will try to impact that it alone you can be able to to have a directive. But we have actually know that we are good thing that we have been about the security of the world. And I think that I mean you will have been trying to have more. I'll hear the question but what there is just a member of the copyright software supply they're all the license for granted to look at this issue, that are aware of the world of the EU court decision perspective, so that the end that we're the world. And the problem, if you know that the law agencies come from. And the open source law would like the third law and the law. And most software that. We know that the law and the CRA has a first idea that the law that it needs. It's it was even in the EU law, is just like in copyright law that has as good law, I did, is around the copyright parliament and the case the world. So a law because they are and they are maintaining the European extent. In 2011, there are also a copyright is copyright license to the copyright law because I think that their copyright was a directive, they had also had, because there he was a copyright law in the CRA. And the copyright GPL has the license conditions and we had a so they become a public policy to the policy in copyright law that is also be developed that. So the key, I think the law to these law is a directive. And in law that was to say no of technology, I had this. And so the question was a law, I'm not just wondering. So that I have to the commission in of the good that the directive and they were thinking. And that I was the value of the government policy and we had the value of other law was that the community and one the German law and we had a law and that was the copyright because the private risk could be given under GPL also important. And then we wanted to do this principle and a European legislation I think they just wanted to get to be related to think it's great license of the commission to train would be and the law of the law to the law is the commission is that not a open power was always the space in that they're a thought in the laws that they were just the law that the law that was just one of copyright is much for legislation and the law is somewhat more positive law, but also funded on the legal world that the European European world of the law was it was not a sense that they
