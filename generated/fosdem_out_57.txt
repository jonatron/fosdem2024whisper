 Hello everyone who can be our research at the technology and hopefully. So the name is PNAT. It's an overview of how much energy is the actual power. We've seen a month to take a grid program in the grid. So today we can optimize a small impact that can see that a power during the bandwidth, the satellite is the future. So I'm going to be a lot of the second. We have a lot a lot of the grid, an open power. We don't have a power we have to have our world. We have what we see the power energy transport energy processing, the transformer. This is the whole, the transformer that's the energy, we saw after seven, that we see what we start to be addressed in advance, in the grid. In this power is one, we are going to be quite late in a larger in Norway, which is the power world. And it is fully difficult to look at the wind, faster and also our software. So what was, we did it was, basically the beginning, how to work on energy and we need to see how we're going to be introducing the energy. We have to use it. I'm happy to introduce a huge level. So we are going to be going to talk about that we're going to talk about the power details on the power we're going on the battery. We have a very large number of the transformer, we have some time in the energy consumption, and we'll have solar power quality that we saw that we have a time to have to have a month and the world of light. The second we're looking for those energy energy energy. So the energy, I can do we're going on this lightning talk about the transformer. And this is back by the grid power energy is what we are we have the grid of energy energy energy energy meters in the network power energy will be good enough energy for the impact power on the energy but the power, the energy energy communication over the energy for energy. We have the power, and to energy is real power energy consumption into energy energy sector. And also the power period, what happens, those energy of power power power energy energy power time, energy energy. And I will give in zero a bit enough. This one, I will energy energy latency one the energy power lasting energy will give a energy and in power. And it are a state in the. I think we all the energy energy back to power energy energy energy panels. And the energy protection and I have to energy term energy energy. And I'm going to, as long energy power compared to energy, right then we're going to energy consumption of energy energy energy energy energy and energy. Nobody may mention the energy power. So the energy energy and revenue is going to energy so on quality and most energy energy energy of energy of energy energy energy energy energy energy consumption will not part. My world, and, in energy energy power cycle energy and energy, a energy is the world. I'm not connected to energy energy energy energy between bandwidth energy. I will introduce the energy consumption. And, the energy energy energy energy in energy power that ago, that time, it's that energy energy energy energy power grid energy. And this is being, because energy. It means. Here, long energy to energy energy energy energy energy energy energy as power. And this energy energy energy, well when much distance is not energy energy, this energy and energy energy energy. And in power energy we are for more energy energy, still competitive. And, it's going to power, a wind energy energy, and energy energy power, and of energy energy energy consumption, and in energy, because energy energy for energy power, energy. And as energy power is giving power processing energy energy energy energy energy power power, the energy power was open energy in energy energy energy energy, energy energy. I was the panel. This power or energy and much energy energy energy. And we showed the energy energy. And, in energy, you the energy as again, we all energy to as energy energy channels is open energy moving. And then we have speed hardware. And it's briefly for energy energy energy, this energy energy and in energy power revenue in energy energy. And in energy power in energy quality energy period, while, for power, we talked to energy power, we decide to the energy power times in energy energy, in energy, but we will be able to power energy energy energy sector and in how this, as much energy. The energy energy energy energy consumption of energy energy energy the energy. So there energy energy is also energy energy energy before not energy impact energy, energy. So it was also, it is important for the energy in the energy. And we were, we could, because we used to energy energy transition bandwidth by energy energy energy. And it is the energy power energy energy energy energy power energy, you really energy, but less energy power. And, and energy, as power power is a term cost in energy power energy energy energy and now is concerned, will power energy can power here, we understand energy. It's not free power energy and energy power energy power energy energy energy energy energy energy energy. We, energy that energy energy energy energy energy energy meters energy footprint would not energy energy in energy- energy bandwidth. And they will. This power energy energy energy energy power energy energy solar power energy data energy energy energy energy energy software science, energy energy energy cost in energy energy. And this, the power energy. So energy energy energy the energy, the energy energy energy energy energy the energy is first. It is the energy energy sensor energy energy energy calculation. And we can energy power energy energy energy. We also faster energy time back in world, and energy grid, and power energy energy energy energy power energy we also integrated power energy energy energy energy to energy optimization as energy. It is digital energy. It's clear energy energy. I have better, we introduce energy energy energy energy power, due to energy energy energy energy energy. So I think of power energy energy energy energy, I was, in energy energy energy, the margin it, for energy energy energy power. It's more energy energy energy energy is very funny energy, but, in energy energy to energy energy energy energy, less energy power meters with energy energy consumption, energy energy of energy power to energy first of energy power energy energy energy and the energy as electricity consumption. When energy power power and energy energy power, when energy, a power energy energy energy energy, as energy term, the energy and and energy energy power power energy consumption. And in the energy meters for energy energy energy energy power that, as energy. The energy energy energy power for energy energy energy energy. But we as energy and by time to energy energy energy energy power energy renewable energy cost time electricity energy energy power energy electricity energy as well bandwidth. And as energy energy can clean energy power and to solar energy energy energy energy energy back data, and of energy. And until so much energy energy energy power energy. And in energy train, better energy. And first as in energy energy discussion and we will, we will. And we will be supporting energy power and energy energy power world energy energy to energy on energy power power energy energy, that energy is because the energy energy energy power energy, when energy energy, we might will, and energy power energy. In energy speed, you will, for energy. And we have energy energy energy power energy as we are about the energy energy wind energy energy energy power power and less power bandwidth, power energy energy energy in energy time. And in energy power energy energy. The energy energy is we will, the energy energy power energy energy saving energy energy. So a power energy time, I have a energy forecast energy energy energy energy power energy energy energy energy. We will. And more energy power, I have a time. The energy energy energy energy energy power energy will to energy power. And as energy energy energy energy energy. And at we have the energy energy grid decision. We we may be a time to energy energy energy. And as energy energy energy. We have the energy energy. And there you see you power in peak power effect of energy signal. Because in energy energy, if you go. Here we have energy, you are a grid. So in the latency. But then power level. So here we have, we, we have to freeze energy. And, we also for example I had to take time in energy power the energy a bit less energy. So, at the energy energy level energy energy energy energy energy energy energy and as compared to energy energy energy. We have and, and energy energy energy energy, I was much for energy. And it is it was a low energy. And, the science consumption is how first time, this energy technology how to energy on energy energy energy. And it was very power energy, but we built in the digital and to energy meters that, then, the energy consumption in law. We have time, first time to also a energy energy power science and energy energy energy consumption of electricity power energy power sector. And the energy. I'm from energy power. And this energy energy story I just a research, here is a question is a energy energy energy energy power when I'm going to fast, many energy is the energy and energy level. And during the good energy energy. So if you have a energy energy power in energy energy energy is going to energy energy. So the power energy power power? So if what happens now we did we already choose, we have just before first time, open energy in our grid is the energy, it's going to energy energy energy energy consumption at energy energy bandwidth. See. And that, you have to the energy power or energy energy up, I'm just in energy. You the power bandwidth, and the energy energy to energy signal. You can, a. On energy movements, but the impact faster faster and more energy. You will not, more energy revenue, but, the energy happens for power energy, so a energy level, but you. But when you only, you have to recover the power. You have time to energy power. And what's what. So I'mateurs, I'm going to speak to give for energy solar energy consumption. I'm, I'm a power, and energy was saying, but I did I'm going to give it. Now, but I was wondering, here. And I had to introduce a power science science of course I'm just wondering, I was actually going to this one of the presentation. And I got, like please, well. So, three, the only going on this panel, where I would you can tell us, I'm going to keep going to get this time and what we'd say it? There are the energy, they're the future of the energy energy life. And maybe not, if the data is good, what they're going to be doing the energy is that, not trust with energy power value, but I'm not all for each event to be in the energy management, so I first time to increase average energy energy supply back to electricity. And I'm just going to the energy. And the maintenance, the impact when you can we get from the energy in real-bombs, well, we add as we're just talked about having the energy. We also did that we have to start the open power meters, but, we're going to continue to present a seat. And in Europe, we're going to present you know, right? I'm going to have much, if everything, we're going to say I'm going to be going to think a little bit of the science. And we just wondering, what I would be talked about some of people like to that. So the panel? But it's what I'm my presentation is the energy channels, you know that's really important. So, the first open source community, again, you know, the slide, I'm going to talk about 20 years ago, but I'm going to be an impact here, but I'm going to be going to talk about, for collaboration and love I'm going to talk about the end up. All right? So, people were about the beginning of the people, the last year, where you know, we're talking about our years on the 90s. And I hope it's a time. And then we're wondering why I'm just decided to, we know if I know. I'm just wondering, thank you very much. Thank you guys a very much for everyone. Thank you.
