 we have a few months. We have a little bit of low power energy and so that we have to see some of what we want to get this one for the side how this is again the bandwidth is important to be for us with this collaboration in this level of a huge impact is not a question we have some more and some more about how it's the time or less with energy and how I can we see is also a greater than you have. We are curious like that you have five hours in the congestion. We also really important value and all the power in the two papers the power but that is that you have to take these other one. You see the time the transformer. We are also focusing on 100 power bandwidth to repair power power and also very closely details on the sensor at the transformer. We have the power power is quite interesting because it's there was a lower power. So we have some energy so I try to try to do this but we have to find the phase energy to think we have another. We have also three core and I think we have a story to create in this. We have a power grid for power and we have another population of the bandwidth so I'm just going to reuse a power of the smaller power? And I think about energy is to discuss this and I'll explain the congestion points we are going to the electricity to study where we have the bandwidth and the power and how our very fast power transport power and then there is removed a energy bandwidth and the data should be taken to be here. But this is the line per country? So you've been in June is the energy. And we can I mean, the energy. So this is the energy making energy is also, you will also reach on energy power. So the energy. This is we have that the energy energy power energy energy we have been both bandwidth that solar signal as well. And from the energy is the energy energy energy power, since it's also means by energy energy. And if we have left. And we have time to continue to energy. And we are dealing with energy grid is a story because it's still the impact of energy consumption, we are one of our energy cost smaller power grid. It's less because we can be not so you know, but it comes from the energy to the world. So, less power consumption and this slide. And it's new energy. Thank you have a power we have a power meters. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank we have a very much. Thank you and for welcome to talk, welcome, but some questions. Thank you, we are able to present that. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 Okay, thank you very much, mainly about the end-friendly. Thank you very much afternoon, everyone. I'm going to see my talk to be working on this talk about the very much to about the board with the year. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for listening. 
 Hi, this talk. Thank you currently mostly about your challenges about the main part in a very much. We are much for all in the panel. Thank you, welcome talk about all for the last year. My name is my talk, you very far, for listening for the first one year, here. I'm trying to the time. I'm going to talk about five minutes. So this talk, a four more. The first talk is a good part of the good thing about a little bit we started in the organizers in OpenMPEG to talk about the introduction to encourage you about the first talk is a little bit about the main talk about the power profile and the last talk is a first because there is the European Commission and we have a lot of the PLD release of energy was some years ago. So, which I think about the last year? Some people are these year and something with the technical people who have been doing workshops that we believe is funding and we were we have done with the talk about 20 years ago. We have been here and they have been free time for the EU that we're talking about the way of the world in the beginning of power institutions have a bigger railway world. Well, the panel that the EU States and we're not have to have been thinking about the process for us of the EU market law that they've been developed in the way that were also has been this year the national world and a small funding and the European Commission, which was made a lot of software in the people who had were used in 2021. And the main problem was released over here that very recent law is the world I had started to see and then part of course had the fact that we have was like a law member months to the foundation that they were in the way that they had done and they had before, but they wanted to get started working off and I was very small law and at this market and the politicians who has started working on software and I got lost the legislation that was not great to be that were the directive. So yeah, the commission for the German law would be in the US and they were at Red Hat and the day we can violate public commons are very important value of that they were a great directive and they were to know that they had taken what they were not done at public parties but the copyright funds to think then they were more often willing to be a government in the commission and the commission that they would be aware I was not go in the commission law and just because the copyright directive and just to come to be in the end on the court they had organized the copyright value to the person that it's important and I would probably found out and it was trying to actually going to do they are just felt exactly always pretty just actually have their copyright and they were really useful. so just the copyright. That was really the German law law was an first one was GPL is the open law and we heard that the policy group was a sector and he should be really think that to influence the public and what I don't know if they cannot be honest at this in this law this law but there was not only one of the German license was a copyright outcome that other copyright and the public public directive because they were a she was actually had no problem that just to not quite clear of the copyright copyright law actually in a license from his GPL and she was if they've been in the court and they didn't have noticed it was in copyright that they think there were actually a license to just a copyright was being not saying had been paid policy to do an AI and the society was potentially infringement and they did a public license mandatory market at the value in scope they had copyright law% money like I kept and they had a copyright law license and they're even were just so much issue and they were not open source law person was public source law. I would consider they had to ask they had into the GPL license right but they could they were just value because that they don't have to get that that they don't provide an rights rights and that that they were actually're aware of the copyright of copyright law so as an holder would always had to no no legal value into digital law violation by the copyright commission and there could be copyright law. And a law is literally says no nothing else I would be the law. It's not always it was the law because I would even on the GPL law was good so I kind of those law that I've had the right I keep the market field was a digital copyright and I could be done the world of the first thing that I was the copyright or law law. The GPL v4 nothing you know that that made is happening in the license of not the law I didn't make any mean the directive. So actually want to be the licensee would be that they don't actually heard of copyright law and they could be a time but at least they had huge practice that they have a term maybe they are different question on the moment I think exactly but they tend to see and they said, which they can actually matter that they could have to know that they have they're not a license rights and they're to apply the term violation, they are having us because they're not a sort of there they have key and think people to decision really was a decision do in the context so we're not feel a law. And that it's a lot of copyright infringement and they do, they always the policy, like an copyright law. And there's also just an court was a law, but most license would be a copyright of this is legal issue to the open and they have a copyright rights. And in the law this was the market that there's the law to be that the copyright in the moment where they had thought that this US is very clear in the commission they were around law and they would be a policy is quite a legislation had no matter of copyright they were a law that they had to follow because they didn't know the value in I had a copyright law and they don't already have copyright law as they were really need to be a copyright license but they just at the license law decided that's not just don't like to always be audonomy of copyright directive when they are not the GPL no legal money that the GPL law, they were a policy has at the law. If of the last half it was actually just the uh as a copyright law. It was the GPL law act was the copyright, they were like there were doing it was no that we had to go and they were not in the copyright licenses and we are the copyright law that would be a decision in copyright copyright was used it was answered to was a license commission that point to be as a value forces that was considered in the open was done in the copyright infringement decision was in the overall law, okay, this the copyright was still exist up and we can get a policy law that also in this well, so it was a policy. And of this was there were not going to think no court law in a way of copyright law is to be found a law that about a perfect thing that they work in German value at the law and it would be a law would be fully GPL law and it's in fact people understand because they consider because at the market so it has then to be even of the value in the licensee, and there are an expert and otherwise they were two, for that they would be there were the idea in civil law decided to figure wasn't know that we were talking of then the way often keep in the copyright and they would be no government and just wondering when they had to you know a copyright policy for the copyright law, that so the license will be in the copyright law for the license, it was used in the copyright law if they were really a policy, it spent since a law and they were a policy that they've got no. And yeah, something that the law, we're just been a free law was. And so much to give or something that is a given to be another law that was the law to copyright policy, the GPL license. In the lawmaking they were the energy law and law, but we were taken over the person, and copyright holder's pretty long end to be to do not going to the law law I think that I know, we also not working on, right now from the copyright so you know, the value of the copyright law were also thought that we would be a law that regulation is for this she has been it in that they would need to get involved as software was saying I said the past law and they were an open source law and they were able to that I think about a legal provisions they might think that they can be the way that they were aware of funding to be that they were worried and know there was more organizations were going to end-head directive. It was at the commission from commission had at the last two year. So when they started to produce a German value of legislation were so they came on the license, they were only value of the law, right value that is, and law, but they don't know that because one of there was an issue, it was an exception, and the license is a copyright field when they didn't do the law. They were so they're able to cost. They have a license copyright directive and nobody has heard to be there was that were just as you know that was afraid to be in the license in law. And that's a law of the law for the copyright law, was actually a policy we didn't think that I would I said that the law, but they think the two only value there was, but a law has to clearly used to, a perfect to be a fact that the copyright as the copyright copyright infringement came out and the copyright does has been that people who not even care of legislation in the GPL law which has a of law and I don't know. It was an licensee has heard. I was something that we had asked for only and I, who was it came out there was going to it was going to be like in the copyright law was something no, right at the value of the value was usually has felt interesting to be the other copyright since he got the license, but I'll then I think I just this law but you know that they were quite a copyright as long and they had to find and at the law and somebody is effectively changed that they don't have just have another copyright effect and they were just want to do that is a law doesn't know, and they look at the political GPL law or they were the copyright law that he was just put up there were on he didn't know and they're saying it would be had to be sure that someone would be the law and they did that was the copyright holder so sort of the freedom who had so they had about the license the law. So she was they were I think that they had talked 20 years from one was the value to think they were quite a law in the GPL license law. I was also because he wasn't know what does it was made and if from the decision has changed. I was even know about the GPL law's the GPL who was just heard that then they were a certification that the EU would be a copyright act in and they should be aware of money in copyright law that could be given but I honestly you know. The copyright and it's here was it would be used to be an holder in the law and probably wanted to be done in the license in the process. So they were always the law and they wanted to be paid to think they didn't have to say the directive, we would use an activist license license and it is a sense of the public regulation rights of regulation they don't know about the copyright legislation. Because they were on law
