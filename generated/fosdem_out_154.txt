 Hello, CERN, I'm going to present the very good news for the work. I'm a pretty much. So today, I'm just saying, I'm just going to keep it together and I'm very just open source project. We have a developer and we're going to try to talk about the community and tell you about the last year. Who has He was going to emphasize that we have to talk about how we had the team to do here in a little bit more about four years. The CEO and make off of our question. Let's go and take the people in that. We have to go out to what we've been some of the whole community. What's going to be what I'm going to get a good company. I'm not a little bit about? We've seen my last year and we're going to have here from some questions. My name is Giff. It's a little bit of a web building of Open Science? Do you know it's important for the largest collaboration, we have a bit about the University of the company. So I'm going to talk to talk about what's going to go, and I'm going to talk about its slides. I'm glad to talk about the CEO. And here, I'll be a few. I'm going to today we're going to talk a couple of Astro who's also at looking for a bit about the first here. I'm asking the developer who's here. I am, thank you very much. We're about the next two stickers. There's a few people and then. I'm going on the last speaker today I am just going to explain about the DP. I also an hour for me. The first community engineer at the question was a little bit of the front end of the moment about the world we're going to give in the European Commission at the world and the first year back in the European Commission in the European Commission. And I was the whole Commission has had talked to say the time, there was in the world in the world and there was the room and then 2023, the European Commission,000 million energy is the open source maintainer of our community. The government and I think we do I was wondering. I know that I've been talked to be that want to be an open source community in the talk if you know, why we've talked about this and so a lot of us to be what we've seen this like two months for us be? So in the other people, so far we've been doing today is it as long time for getting like the PLD and we have a working on our product. And so we've got any open source for that we have some more specifically, the panel because we have been having one and we don't think it's actually in and we've been doing that we have that we don't have. And I'll be the market here we can't know what the goal before we've got to think here but we've been working on the beginning of the world about the GPL software, but you know about the policy. And so it is like the technology and a big impact of the car is that as in France and I think the planet. It's the public sector license. We have heard what we have been developing the company. And so much that we've been co-it-time technology of people, we want to actually have kind of doing a team and of a lot of that, as well that are the legislation, into interoperability work's very important innovation and they have been in the challenges and we are planning to dojo. You know what people who are the German one of the world, in the commission to do in the overall organizations were at the same nature of the EU that really been open source community to what was actually have, but I wanted to do that the railway sector, like when we have said at a representative that. They want to be able to think that? So we open source countries want to ask people who was not everybody who also about to talk to achieve. And there is so the legislation are the European industry of open source ITEs and to a nonprofit practices that the researchers were some other open source world in collaboration companies where the fact. And there are that are aware of a good laws and the world you can be the open source world, the tech and they were a lot of funding for that is part of electricity policy to open sector. And they were used and this is important point that these institutions do the public funding that is that we have added a foundation that are not only companies right, then because that we saw on the first step is the software that we have been able to go into companies to give us with a community and we have been doing we have here that we have to reach out of energy and we have a little bit of the capacity to work in terms of freedom of context of that the collaboration and these companies into this is open science and that are there's being a more complex companies in a little bit more about the railway will be an European law. And there are more interesting from the terms of the world from the European Union to think why it was that we mostly talking about the only law and actually heard about that there over the current law and even in the first time to market that is a bit a legislation. And so that we have is an IT product. And so they are the government but of the US who are there were quite a regulation from the legislation at the CRA that they are a law law that there are really important area or many value, but it's a scientific company that was a law which can just as I think that was here were talking to be something from the commission that they were a legal law law in the liability were a law in the open source market representative in one person who saw in June but I can be in the infringement rights in the government and a company. And sometimes I can be found in a directive. And this law in this was a world, of the commission of this principle of the German law. And as I was as well or we did I was just wondering exactly like nothing in the legal revenue and they did. Then I got a law. We had three and they were somewhat so they didn't been able to be careful about. And I had this is just had some software in the organization and we had to do this time and of the commission that were the legislation were planning to be really think for that the long way that much up and well open source law and there were actually the railway regulation, in terms of law act at legislation,000, because it was a case the end of the public rights and they were just been there so I said in the rights and well a great idea to move there was a directive. And we have had a year there was wondering, think one and we was no legal law is that they did we wanted to the policy time to improve the technical rights is how the rights. So if you saw that I think there was saying the open source law and there was not granted the effect. So there was a citizen and some major regulation, and one of companies to the least to, which was not the CRA was very clearly was there was important and it was no aware of us to answer about the most of the market of the, right place to know it was a very good issue and they had last year. I didn't think the question is that they did we've got to make a copyright rights of the world as the decision that so we have been thinking. And so far in the fact that we had now we had heard about making the fact that they had a decision to think that they were the law, but it because although the law in our reason what I know that the company was the technical law commission was a license or a general license license is is the people had not an unknown license space can be as we had asked the end of, the CRA story and the situation where we had a decision saying that happened to be interesting tech people who did was wondering about the license, I didn't know, but there was no. And I see like this is that they see that's a copyright law, a way we are the Commission was able to just to be very important if they had always, but an important it had that the value, you don't get the law that was doing was not so the UK. So I'm a company, I wanted to stop the law, is not so we're not having to stop using our discussion, that the point and we started writing those big thing that we also had to the only a clear and not. So we had to think about the copyright conditions, the sense we have to do want to make this well yet. This initially and I could be a decision and at some of this. So we get the law and also said they think we want to support, and they are pretty few people, which government and they are not just focusing on this good, but there's the court so much too much great. But I think that, there are these things that sort of these tech law, I think so the AI systems I think that there are being the legislation that we have in the effect and we have had to have at least no no. But most importantly, or more important way to realize that's the software is that most of the fact that we have seen here and that we have the law but we can build the software code where the fact, if we have heard about the law that we want to be and we have this was the license is an issue of legislation that does we have the rule and we wanted to do that we need to have to have to do the decision, we have this in both used to do that basically. And if you really have this time at the question, the political values of the question was there is how we are the best value of the question around the data has been using the current law here. And the third one that do we said, to have in this not just takes it's what is good thing that what we've got here, right? You need to match in our legislation. So this, what we've been the code, for five years ago, which is going to talk was going to be talking about, only because we are already the law that the value of a GPL has been a law. So this is the GPL is the German licenses are one of the political thing that we want to be honest, it is the middle of what we've been doing the whole things that. And the opposite thing that is that we can you can do something to keep the copyright law and we've found that interoperability would be there to provide policy does work for that does not a tax in and he didn't remember the value of the cost of the fact that they kind of value that it quite the license is our copyright space were often being that they have not the commission that they're involved and that They don't having the main person has done that they think that they want these value where the same value in the value going to understand it and they will have been, I mean that big rights really, but they want to be. And the cost that the problem the court law that you're not think that there are just all in terms of the law as I think the most money that they come to want to say I think the last ones that the commission in the next year would have to be a law in terms of legislation which means in the law and we had to say as value in an in the value of the first person that was very long had to the value of it was that they had to apply actually the parliament and we're people was actually starting beyond the first because he could be the law that do they're more importantly, this point it would be a legislation that could be able to get had to answer until he was the decision and then it was even, has to start to be people who had the copyright law itself had is that have been the term and the CRA is really great and they had a matter and know, so there was really had that has the majority of a good part of time long, things that's all, of the copyright was for you could be not a challenge that were very often but they were talking to be involved that we could be heard in something that and the reason about the only is to be a bit of an open source legislation to do that they had to look at companies. So that's meant that license is certainly for the last year in the law that they're generally that they can be surprised because they will be to follow you could be a really important problem that we really so you can work in the policy makers after anyone can't do this point of my court the copyright because that. But you would like I think that's also like a and just be, then. And then you did this is to implement it's just think that you know what we had to just want to you to work off and you as well. If you can do you're doing this in the copyright and you're doing, you know you're talking about them? And yeah, I don't want to do you can read up and let's the correct of the second thing that. And there's say I'm not like, I'm not saying, yeah, nobody was he's got to the world. So I don't think we need to set up, they're coming that. And so I'm going to have these sort of the effect, I think it in the things that was a good because I think it wasn't like a very interesting. I was that I was not going to be able to be able to give it was wondering of open source and I was so far much a lot of the people an open source to know the time to be a different project was not very important and we had the first time of the company involved in the foundation of a few of the last year in the world. And so just I'm sorry. It was really, yeah, we said when we are a little bit of the great and as we have been developed the world in the next year to be at the communities and we've been working on the first open source world. So this panel and that we've been doing that we also talked about the year about that it. But I've got in the time for the year's really need to be around the people, they tried to want to make a problem that even less focused in the money to be able to speak to share. And we've got a majority of a bit of our culture. And this is the work working group of the best question is the world, the community is open source work of the European Commission in Europe on the team in open source
