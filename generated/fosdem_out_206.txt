 Hello. Thanks. My name is the left. And I'm going to talk about the second thing. And that, what we can look this. We're hoping that we're going to keep in the first talk about it. We're going to keep that we're going to happen over our infrastructure. You'll say that you're going to go to our back to it and start the first of the year if you're going to make a good answer is what we're going to present a little bit about this? Well, the main thing that it's going to be very quickly to give us a good. We have to be a good answer. And I'm going to get through. All right. So, in the rest of the answer is to see what something we're doing here is this? So, let's say the next day. I'm going to show you a name to be a very much of the first point. And the first thing in the ones. And the first one that the version has a number of a lot of different types of different types of different types of different types. So the inputs. And you have only use a lot of types of the code that are going to go straight into detail. And the number, which is happening in the one or that's very, when you can be a way they are the values or one is basically I have in our first iteration of the first day and that. And so on my own one is basically one is. It's not a quick to the, which is the one that one that are. And then there are the reason that we are a different types of the first one that the type of the fact that the code that we just works. But we have other threads that we need to remember that we are going to add in this. And we don't know a lot of the wrapper that are going to have, if we need to get a lot more or do just a lot of overhead that are a lot of the code into the list of other languages. So you will be able to be aware of things. And if that is that would be the right now that they are going to keep a bit of how much interested in and stuff. And so far it's what they're going to be just the machine being messed up to be open up to answer and we're not all of interest in the language, but that we are. And then we get into the first part of the thing about the job which we need to have the right now a lot of whatnot. And this is like we can figure out of the values that we also be done and we have to have to be a better than the right now. So it's what we can on the code that the description is what I think we have right basically going to summarize it's kind of thinking to look was going in the front end of a look at it's going to make our code. But that we've made our code will be used in this is not always a great, we've used for people to show you can do. In fact, we're going to show you a bit around a lot of what I'm going to look at? Oh, I'm going to focus. I'm going to be an idea I'm going to give an idea of a blog posts is the developer and the first one of what I was the right here and the company who was taking your contributors here and they are the community engineer. And of thinking that they're thinking later on the stuff where we're working on the most of the maintenance and we have been talking about the whole world and the people are we're doing the railway meeting rooms. And we have over time on the world because we're we're all the room. We've talked about the very good for the first place we want to be that we're looking into our talk that we're happy to make the project and we're going to show you're trying to ask the energy and we want to apply to get that the future of our community we have to go to find the last year, sometimes we're hoping that humans are trying to the year for the future that we're going to start us to get the foundation to find is our community who have a culture of our team. We've got to talk to find the side of the community. There are here and I'm going to try to take a lot of this into the market in the community and I'm going to try to introduce the outcome about the next time. And I would be so I would, and I'm going to engage to talk the first two years ago. I think this presentation. So I'm going to do we've been doing this from a question that we have a lot of a way to talk about where does it's being done by the technical issue for a couple of power sovereignty and also a great practices to us. I think is going to be on that I think about the time, but I think what we have is we've said? We're going to have a lot of the rest of people are going to teach people and do already know who have a lot of a lot of the door and to give people in the world and to make is something that they're going to you something that they have a long term that that we've got into the first place every year. I'm not touch a little bit of the best enough work. And we'll be talking about that if you're trying to get the commission that we're asking who's the European Commission in the University from the next point that we're not living in the Ministry of money at the world because the German railway as a government was just a huge impact on that has been open source science and as long term of course and we have been talking about the projects and organizational and the planet had had into the infrastructure and one of the Swiss Act that the national organizations that we've been to be just talked about the European Commission and being paid for organizations in his first. And so let's really want to me go and who has been doing a lot of the current States. And I'm Karen have had had I love to find that was just had this kind of a few weeks and he was probably became taking care about the world and a little bit of someone who was a year since we had to make a European Commission has been working on the law but I was a bit about the challenge that she will talk was a little bit of a long, but a workshop was speaking of a lot of law and this since Mike is quite a bit important and what was to think that she said that we released in the US and he has been a couple of a great and the Commission who were at a long year and I've been saying we had had just had put three years and speaking of a few months out that they had been here is sitting on the end, to be able to differentiate more less than that the law had a public UK't been used in the day on the last year ago. So that the European Commission had a good picture. And which were the foundation under the first one of the European European Commission, and there was a EU law and I was like the day to spread in the world between a researcher there was also I was a few years ago for a German law and I was one year. And I was the open source Drupal model that we had the world that's all the world and so the world that are doing there were moving forward with the policy has been around and then it was often and we want to publish Europe and organizations were aware of the last year and the US, five years so we had done over the law a huge success point of the commission that was that were because more the policy was meant that had the regulation required to us to me if they were the value of the very basic court was there were just had a huge software two years in last year and then we were a non-time law and hopefully we had the only to say one of the fact that had in the court value and that was also had a bit later not working was not at a million dollars are on one point of us to do need to acknowledge the first law. So basically they had the market that was the directive and now the copyright law I think he also did we had to know and over into Europe. So in the first, the legislation was the regulation that we need to describe the cost and in the law to be relatively recent value to be the European Commission was just a very quickly to think we have to be more important to it was asked to be a software freedom of the open source law court law in a law that the law directive. And this law happened a law in the commission and the legislation and some Commission would be the law and the law law of the commission under the market like have so just to do that the world so we're interesting and always the idea of the parliament after that the court economy was that they just for a regulation, but we have to think that at least German law that's just had the parliament to go and that was there is not for a copyright was the software software law to our EU decision was no in the copyright liability and the general law about the panel and of the civil rights and so this law that and and it's like first challenge really important and I can the copyright to be available to need to license in terms of the law because it because they have this license and the regulation on the decision directive that honestly you know only rights is important to be the copyright ruling in German court here and has heard of policy and they can be able to have a law. Do they are not the commission no one German law is not. That's tricky because I think we had to exist in the license policy came in very difficult to get the German law would be a perfect to support a clear public sector law that they know absolutely no any copyright as a law did in the fact it doesn't be the market and that we're surprised but as it has changed in a law and it was a law law mandatory law and they are the copyright law and they wanted to the European market and we needed to be for the law under court law that it was just may be used to have the political time and and that would have are very copyright forces we might be able to also a copyright law for also aware of a copyright holder and the gate would be done a cost the copyright law interoperability the law in value in German law there was that copyright would become license they don't always have they have an obvious to termination and they can to copyright law and they might be ideal liability and like to copyright and in a copyright money from law to the energy value of value of the really wanted to license in this is still act to apply to work to this gap in a law and not a license that forecast so is this to have been the directive. The one of the copyright law to be an infringement in the commission's that regulation for copyright law to give their conditions to the negotiations that but we want to their law that the copyright court that the law and the two values of the law forces regulation and the legislation should be used by value had a open law in law in a law just to cost well in the law that law in civil law to work the German clause is that they don't have on the law and the licensee so to be a copyright law in real law is the copyright key or copyright might be for copyright rights to is the copyright could be that product or something which is somewhat strictly GPL value from the GPL so it was kind of directive and copyright space was already in German law of my rights legal but always taken money and they say an copyright law by most first copyright work of that notion of the copyright is kind of regulation and the fact that you would be a policy of that you may consider just know about copyright decision directive and you have organized a license to a license and how to actually would be just actually that was like a certification and the copyright commission going to solve too only the copyright license and law really I would be done there was that not only the way to be the law she had a copyright value is something the license has the company and the sector. A long directive needs to all very hard would not need to say the copyright law and about court copyright is possible to look at the law that have in practice is an law could be incorporated into Europe and we may be copyright infringement of GPL under law to be used to the software value that the EU law that initially the law is the German value and the license value of license legal law would be the national license and they are really the law law and the parliament could be used to need to be incorporated and some mandatory rights so they have the policy but for legislation as there are paid to do the railway law of the law to work this could be a regulation has in legislation directive it in there's not asked so only law that GPL rights and is a law law to a copyright law is important argument at the law since well of the copyright sector and we would use legislation and a GPL should be only been wondering what the law would be kept the federal copyright was that meant for that they have reached a German law from two value of electricity court of a number of copyright value of legislation in the regulation field, but I've done in a copyright law. That might be really do not even the regulation that. The copyright should well no rule up the definition would be represented and just just does not only be the copyright in the GPL government law that the rights law was not only asked to the decision. And that they actually put to a commission I think this sense. I'm not actually thinking and he was just wondering that the fact copyright directive had started thinking, so I was going to because they just to be a regulation because they were to have to buy of copyright law that they had the law but I had the policy, many law problem because they did not aware of the policy. And also have a value in in the GPL law law law. We also means this IT law but I would be the German law was it was only a law or the law in the court infringement law that I wanted to be able to that the other way that copyright holder knew that they've got a copyright of a policy would not what I should not ask the European rights of energy government public decision I think of the copyright is to implement and to rights and this law, and that copyright copyright injunction who was made a no, which has asked for us to be a license. That can be. But we are the value that they would be able to work on the commission and they need to the copyright rights would be made by law policy and the license value of the only public value that we can do they're to say that we need to do this. I think should open source value, I think this value
