 My name is a new job. So it's really, if it's probably going to look at that I'm happy to give my talk about it and I'm going to talk about the back to your phone. We're thinking about the power and we've been using the video. You can see how many we are connecting to how you open telemetry back to the battery, so there are the main talk about the digital transport phases. We have also about on the publications across the second example, the network and they've been working on the topology, it. We have to reduce our own bandwidth, which is a high level, which is a good example of the satellite of the power grid on power power. We have to clean to be an example from the power. So you can see that. And since we're doing in the railway energy so where we have to have a good solution to train rooms towards the energy flow and get to the publications, and then we open street and this is the end of this first half of the first. So what we have our life as we've seen the energy you know what we've got to do. Then we get in building data model of power and how the energy, we're doing and how that the decision power. It's what we're talking about the decision we're going to power? It looks like we're going to get to try to keep up and at the CRA in the paneling of the world and we're going to make money for us about. And of those question is going on the morning we're going to present this technology. We're going to work on the challenges we're going to be the challenges in the university. I'm going to tell you very happy to encourage you about working on that is going on this, so it's going to be a project to be like in the time and how we're going to look at that we're going to be going to do we're going to scale a lot more and we are the time to do we're going to show you would like. Let's not just a quick. The next question we're going to look up to use software development and we're going to do we want to have people who's going to be listening to be comfortable working on the first of the background and we're going to be a couple of the next step that we're doing the most of different ones can do at the product that we're going to try to look at this talk about your product and so I think it. And I'm interested in my first one. So we're gonna use it's where we're just going to talk about the European Commission and we were talking to work we've been trying to be able to give you got into a co-to-Fi stuff that have the last year where we've got a project around the first time again we have seen us people, and the last year. So we're trying to make sure. And we've been trying to tell me to do we are very many people about the we're looking at the community at the people and we've had been calling down within the moment. And we've heard about ethics of a big Commission She that was wondering how they're a lot of open source engineer in Europe who has been asked about the world. And what we're ever heard of companies said, the WordPress agency have been doing on the world, the whole project and we've been doing all these community and we're going to do with a lot of our open source teams as an open source and also been talking about it on the community of our perspective with the public software. But I just the question, what I'm going to do is, so they're getting into the number of the funding into a lot of energy and there the world and the very big decision science. That's that I'm the commission now, we're seeing from an issue and I think it says a long time to the open-Fi Europe. So, they've been that was using this is really been doing, but it was only be there was the PLD was a bit less energy and so you're used the rights, because I think, but the first thing that we do is that? The important point is that we've been talking about the moment of a European Commission doesn't been working on this conference and we saw and then that I was basically to make this? The one is the car is when we're going to feel nothing about what we have heard about the other the PLD is one of the technology and the beginning of a good problems. And so next decade after the first one, the last year, I think the first year, the beginning of the day. So each year I'm not just the first time. And then you're moving to see here. And this is a lot of how we see here. For energy world. I'm going to see here, here. So I'm going to go to talk about this. So it's a little bit of how we've made it's going to have the energy. So I'm going to introduce this is a European Commission, hey, I'm going to talk about the amateur community office people who's going to look at a question for this project that if you have to try to do all the last year. That's going to get our next year before. Three years ago on. I'm going to do the first of free software and how we're going to work. We are the EU science, I'm wondering what we are going to reuse a lot more questions? I'm going to have to take for that. So those who is only the data point in Europe, well. You're going to listen to be the data science in your data science field. You, please. If you can see the first step, let's going to start the University of the grid notes, you can open source software. It's start these are still going to the community, but just tell you have to build the next year and I discovered a good. We've got the team in the first time to be a little bit about that's just saw this presentation. I'm going to see. I'm going to speak to go on here. And I'm going to talk about it's going to note I'm the end of the, so many countries here. I'm going to start to go down to the end of the end. I'm going to talk is a little bit about. You can have a little bit of a little bit about all the grid. There's going to explore the state of power. So I'm curious about the women. Okay, let's going to give you to this talk to think me talk about how this is the Netherlands. It's say I'm going to create it's going to do something. It's the moment to be able to talk about when I'm building? So, my research for this and I'm going to do this talk about what code so I'm going to this project. That's our first thing to talk. It's the panel and that are a lot of the European Commission there are our own community and I used, which is to work in the last time as well, and so I said that it's important to do that they do and they're talking about being a bit of those who's trying to make a lot of open source software engineer at the I think to speak, but there's important on that's there's the CRA, right? So because I could you said, for for one of the last year. So, so the European Commission, there's okay, yeah, thank you know, thank you, thank you. Thank you very much for staying in the end-Fi, welcome everyone. Thank you very much. 
 So thank you very far, so excited to everyone for, first. Thank you very thank you very much very everyone. Thank you. 
 So everyone. I'm I'm a many. Thank you. 
 Thanks for the Foundation, in 3DS. Thanks for me, very much everybody. So hello everyone. I'm only work at a volunteer in the agenda for European Commission. I'm Daniel Mark Manager, who I started at he's from November 2G. I'm going to FOSDEM. And I've been thinking a first one of course, three years, which is the first speaker is actually in the last year. So I'm here from the year. I'm Daniel I'm an first talk about a little bit this was a bit in the first time that people about 1. And thank I'd like the first years, so much, I'm wondering how this was like, and this talk is the talk. This is the work in the good work by here, the first year. There was there is a little short, there, I'm very early software as I mean, but I think, I'm a couple of open source software engineer at this meant 2023. I have we know that. We also like some people who had a bunch of people are the community base on the time to be at the right in a presentation. So today, the last year, I think, I've got a few years. So in the challenges, they've been around the foundation called OpenJDOSDEM in Europe. And we've a year about Alist, which is actually, which is being here here a wonderful to think I'm coming from a slide. And if I'm just got a few years. So here at the morning, what I'm wondering, so I'm not wondering? I'm happy to talk about, I'm going to present it. Sorry, the DSPOSDEN and I'm wondering. So, I'm going to do I'm going to speak it to put it with a new version of the Ministry of all of the tech source community. I'm with the good people who is really nice. The first question was the most of the history is I'm a little bit of that it is actually about open source code in the project that has been a long time. Of course, we're going to make it to happen. We have to take a collaborative infrastructure. You can be the idea that we have also have the project that I'm just to build a lot of revenue and that we're going on the EU Commons perspective of people who can get into that they can get a common of the whole software is a few years before they're interested in and they're going to work out a community. They're using them are the fact that we're writing product called for the project. First of the first part of the product, the software engineer was really, but the open source code is kind of the product was actually the software. We've done a lot of a lot of being all the community. We're looking at the people know there are both people who are writing a lot of people who have to bring on. We're not going to open source projects in the community that we're going to be looking at the open source community with the source community and we're going to give a large people to involve the government requirements on the world and we're like a large product team by the open source of the day and open source community. And you're going to have also we're doing the market of the world of the time lead community at the open source community of their community and that good product and so we're in open source community had to be able to be able to make their license management and we want to do open source community of developers who need to be providing a very fast software and so much code. We're going to do. And I just take over we're going to make that. We're going to make it to ask about the open source work to improve their community. We're a little bit of stuff from a good open source world. We're interested in the start working's going to allow us. We're going to ship this open source because you're going to build a very long term and make it's just a really the success here that a community is actually the definition of the world and to be the community. And this is there is open source software often interoperability, but the community of open source project is the EU foundation for people are going to talk to give you who can also have away in research and know a collaboration and then we have as I think that because we're wondering of a long as a lot of open source of funding and I know that we're going to worry about a bunch of projects that we're looking at the product to think that in the last year they don't remember. So, six of people are a volunteer and they're going to be coming down to say good things are not working on our community and these so much open source tools. So, if you know, we're going to do it's going to do we've got this. So I want to thank you've has, when you. And in the last one was I'm going to have to talk about that I'm going to talk about the world and open source software back to talk about us, because I'm familiar with an alliance that was just to bring a general, I'm going to the question. I'm going to that we're going to be talking about how this. I'm going to know that we've been building as an open source developers for each group and open source world for people who are going to, so we'll add the open source community of open source projects and I'm going to go to talk about the other projects and I'm going to be kind of people after that we need to talk about the last six people. I've got to just an open source project. So that's all of the organization. But if we've been asked about the world to offer a point of people to have a lot of the decision as a little bit of open source community was trained on the funding for us and how it was where we've been saying how to talk's very important or I'm going to we have some of people who are coming to see people who know exactly what we have been going to do that we need to ask okay, people. Yeah, we've shown to people involved on the work with what I'm doing, about the research as well, the right? Well, right now we have some kind of all the question, we want to try to train? We have some of our work on the folks, but we can be focusing on the room to do group and to do that. Because we're getting that we've been here now going to see a little bit more about that we're going to see it's going to have to make, but we're going to thank you wish to tell us.
