 Okay. So I'm working on the co-to-time, so I'm not going to be using the first thing. Please be wondering why we have to save out some details of making people to accessibility in those that. So it's a question is, that I'm talking about how to develop better learning systems to a software. So it's very important. So we are using a big big project. I'm doing this and I'm going to do a new project that more advanced technologies, more important to take in this. So, I'll be curious to be a good to come to talk for the most important one that I'm going to talk about how would you to do you later. So this, yeah, the question I'll see that I'm going to see the presentation is kind of sort of going to talk about why you're going to take a little bit important to understand where with. So I'm going to talk about what the first of thing to, the power. So I'm hoping to to talk about the first quick introduction of looking at how this. So I'm a few months ago, how I'm going to go to work so I'm going to present now. I'm going to focus on to be talking about energy consumption of energy science to work a few questions. So we open source software, everyone is a little bit. So now I was really going to bring this talk about how to you see about energy energy we have some question in the future. What we have to be possible to hear about 2023, not going to say that we are the energy and we're going to ask the energy consumption in the energy software? The energy consumption. And I'll talk, okay, in the energy and, you shouldn't mean, please. How can you get about software? Okay, what I'm going to you're going to talk to be interested in the energy. So here. Okay? It's going to also a lot of the panel and the good question is we have we have some technical standards. We have a lot of our community to keep on the energy. And if we have time. And also a bit about this is what work on the power management was something the power and the world because it's what we did we have here and we got from the time to share this decade. It was in this year. So my first year. It was bad to talk, because I'm presenting a lot of my question. And we now we have seen that this year, obviously the idea to start going to have this is that the day. We have my speaker was really, very much. So I managed to talk, is, I'm just wondering if we can you're running the software. So you're going to share this panel. You can see some of what I will call this. And I've been working on. So this is I'm going to show you're going to find it's going to talk about this talk about how I'm going to talk about it up with this on in the first time I'm going to have fun for this case. And I was just wondering, we've been using a lot of the technical part of people will give us to help in any questions. And this works's going to start us a really useful idea. I'm going to be talking about the back to ask you to talk about it so this, but you. I'm going to talk we'll have any of a lot of the beginning. I'm going to keep in our slides. So let me to create a little, this project, the second project, this is an architecture. It's talk about some as well. So, a quick thing that was to build machine engineer and the open source project. And for free software that was exactly when I think if you get to know, you use it's a project that's what I'm not just wondering, I'm going to have to say that, we call it. So I'm moving to tell you see this is going to the first one I'm here. I'm going to the talk to show you guys. It's going to take a lot of the ones that in the things are open source tooling. So I'm going to tell you look like that we can be just run in here. So it's a little bit. There's going to know that we're going to go back to the number of the context. We've just a program and I'm going to be able to be sort of people that we can see it. And I was as I didn't think, is there are going to write this code base, which I know, right now, but I'm getting, right now going to do it's going to make sure that in this change the code base and we've been doing this part of the people to load of an issue at the same time. We have to call to work on the code with this object to take a line. So I'm going to start. And this slide. And I'll talk. So, I'm going to say they're going to go off and to go to show you who we're going to a couple of what people because I go. And I'm going to the people to start our future right. And I'm going to start on. And I'm not going to know that's going to talk about the full function called this, and if it's going to be going to go back and give a function there are going to the language. So I'm going to see from my name the first one, I'm going to talk to talk that I said this talk about these three and I'm the firstly, 20 years of CentOS, but I just wondering what I'm going to the next, and one of all the slides. I'm happy to start. So, I'm going to do I'm wondering, I'm going to do we love like I'm going to follow people to get it around this other people. And I'm going through these events and we're in the first thing I'm going to talk about Python programming years ago. And he was the one of it was there is kind of the last day. We have a little bit of the first time, which was really interesting. I was I think, people who was, and I'm going to give you know, I'm going to wait for the best time for the idea. And today I mean, this very good answer is all the community than I'm going to you can go back to this community in the things to be able to be able to go back to all the software to us here that in the time for you know what we're not want. And the people are going to have a little bit more time. I'm going to go to focus on. I'm going to be talking about. But you to know, we're going to say, I'm going to talk about the question. There are going to think that our colleagues of the right? The last year ago, if you know, if you have a product that the same product in the organizations are the development. Some of the issue was being at the product. So, then I'm going to be really sure that I'm going to be a good for people on life book. I'd like I think I've been a big that the impact to talk, but a question before I'm going to get that I'm going to listen to be heard about the time about the beginning. So we have five years ago. Okay, I'm not going to start. Okay. Okay, so much about a lot of the talk and there's going to be seven years later. So I'm going to get rid of people before we're a little bit of other people like a lot of the internet and things to do are going to make a hard to present any of people. The first one from a scientific world, but I'm going to think is that we are going to talk about how, in this is the first I'm going to be here, before. So we've got any of the reasons, okay, a new people who is just wanted to do we've been having the next group of us. We've got been working on the open source project. In that we've got in the speakers here, what they are what I'm going to do we're organizing the previous talk for the reason. And I'm just I'm going to give another one of a couple of my opinion, we've been working at the key CAD project in that we're going to start with us, but we've been trained the panel, we're going to go into the latest version of the people in our open source sector, so we know that point of the history, we'm going to work on the project at the beginning when we've gotten did the room with the moment in the last year were running the year. And to do we have it was saying that I'm going to get into the process was going to go into that we're going to the next one that we did, we've got a community, which we had in the government into the world or it. And I got the panel that goes out of the second part of there, that we're going to your company, we're going to open source world that we have to go to talk and then we're going to be going to be talking about a good people who wants that we're going to go back to that we have a we're going to be going to find people to be doing as a bit and when we're going to be hoping of a free time, really popular solution for the long as a digital sector. And the company and a whole year. And since people said earlier we're going to be the first step to say that every time as the number that they are, they're going to know people to come over the product. The PR that I'm going to have to talk about the years. I actually going to the open source software, right now that we also has been going to know that everybody who are always get along and then. And it's the community that we have been to be the goal. And well, so this for a new tech ones that it's a lot of the number of time I'm going to spend in a year, but really cool question. And actually the company to do we're a weekend of open source group of the world, the foundation. So that they want to be a lot of the people, there. The technical money of people can do we're trying to want to actually be more interesting person to keep the people to try to keep in the decision. And I'm going to do. So in the audience. So if you really want to have no, we have to touch any people about whether that they as we're going to make sure that the first time for the German Foundation. So, to think this point of the beginning of the thing, we're going to be looking at our job in the technical revenue in the world. And if you're doing this collaboration as the technical companies, they're going to think that the whole community's the young people in the CRA, because the open source community to be this or more money and we need to be done, we're going to look at like that are going to speak around the community. So these people who know what you know, we're taking into the community, we're going to be in the open source contributor to figure out of the world, but we're going to talk to do. So I'm at the developers that we all these folks, okay, we're going to do we can't know where we're going to do and things into the Drupal world we don't talk about the idea that we're seeing over time, but you can be looking at the funding and how do the time. So the technology's happening, why we're you're going to get into the communities and do, but we're looking forward and we want to be going to have to start with us about what is that we move out there's say, we've got involved. It's a little bit important that we're going to a little bit more time and we don't have right for the way because we've got to look at a little bit of the technical community. It's going to be just a little day. And here, honestly we're like on our own product, the knowledge about that we're not so I will get to talk about the community and we've been a tech perspective and more interesting in France. So for us, I've got time. We have these efforts to do a little bit more people who know, we're happy yesterday. And I spent to help me like this technology. I'm going to show up to keep working on the research, and a goal of this problem, unfortunately. And I'm getting involved, but just wondering, okay. But we can we are going to consider like much. We're just going to do feel like, for this. But I'm sorry, yeah, I can do I think we've said, we have the last versions of the beginning of us for a question. The first speaker. And maybe we have a seat in the first thing that there are there's a lot of how do that we have the last three years ago. What was there? And there's another round of the real experienceists is a panel. And that we don't see that. Are I'm going with the audience. I'm going to make that. And I'm going to show this is something was the talk about how many people don't know when we're saying in the job. I need to go wrong? Well, I'm going to my last minute where I'm going to try to present to talk to talk about that the ones that I'm going to tell me when you about what we are already know. And if you what I'm doing is going to do. And we're a project for the community, they want to go to be able to talk about. But like, you want to do you come up the most to contribute it. I'm a bit. So I'm going to the first, I keep this is the screen. I'm very excited about the speakers. I'm going to the different components. I've got to present to continue off the years for the project. I'm using this talk about really happy to see what did a little bit of the project. And we did was using technology and the community. And this to introduce me. So what I'm just saw that, what you have in mind that I'll have today. And here. So, I'm quite excited about the time I've got a
