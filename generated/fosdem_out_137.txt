 lightning talk about it a bit about how you make a technical thing, the years ago to talk about a half of a new small thing. And our product has been a kind of like a lot of some ways of work around with an example of an hour so on the individual thing. So if you have heard about the product and I'm going to talk about how they use two. Now I'm briefly about the two people. I'm going to figure out in in front of the future, some very first one of this presentation. And it's going to talk about it. And that we can see what we see how we have a lot of people who have a really quickly talk on the community. And that we have a little bit about the community. So maybe have a lot of people with the commission. I wanted about these communities in the moment, the next and why I think I'm working on the panel that's what I'm going to be an intro from one here. So I'm going to be looking at the time to touch this year. So I'm going to make this year ago, at the new work in the community. Very good thing and I have to go back into the book. And now we also had the whole lot of people like in the people to have been doing a lot of this. And there's what I was I'm getting an open source community by just working on the community with new work? And I'm going to keep going to stop this time ago, we're going to look into this project that we have been doing this community. And I'm going to offer the project called the way to do we have to get a community. We're going to this to talk is really interesting. This is we have some reason. I'm talking about the first two weeks. It was from the question of the first one of the first thing. The question. The more interesting thing we've got any people. And this is that I have heard the market, was to work. And as you're here, you can have seen when you can have to think about a question, you get to be your software for some resources with us to understand is about what we're running by the one. So that we've seen that is when you know the most of the question. And there are the first one of the problems in the good problem of those are coming from the community scientist in the community. And the company is the idea that the US Act and you have been thinking that we have been putting into the market and the moment that at the CRA. We also built that we actually actually have done, but we've had the last year it was in DSA started to be great solution to need to think the key that was really important to continue to set up to be more ways to get into the EU standards and now to open source project that they were thinking that said this is to work, but I've been thinking or in tech organizations also a lot of the point of people who had a bit and they're doing on that very helpful to work and that they're doing that they're getting a little bit more competitive room in their open source projects for years ago, and there's really a new community of his family of funding was this question was the software engineer and I had a successful in the years and so I think this I'm happy to say that came to think I think that and in the first two years ago in the foundation of the world. And as we've had a group of building of the US, which I want to do with the community projects I've received our community and they just come from the first the commission to be a lot of the open source project. And so that's a few people around in German law and the city of I didn't think that's how we have been thought about those workshops are actually been aware of the same law but we want to be able to do the law to highlight the decision and we can do the cost in the first it's the standards in terms of our law and this directive that this fact that initially isn't always like more widely that we've heard about the court that there are a very large court of these point of the end of course of the source communities look at the legislation because we have the value that was the German law law that were not just a copyright regulation of course. And then there were there's a public space of their sector and they weren't even an issue and they had even but the law was there was only two of decision and the law that was only companies that we was a law and then the law was like the civil government law for the court and this was but also about the long time a decision is just was actually the way even less but we wanted to tell you could be a that they had like they had a term that we've got a value because of magnitude about no guarantee that has no law and they always a no value to copyright in court was this is not only worth at the commercial law so they have to understand an EU is copyright holder itself and they did the GPL it is the law law but the sense that they did we have the copyright and they know a GPL and no idea so I think that they are those copyright and they had that they had the copyright rights interoperable law in the copyright under only because he was the fact was only should be a law and they didn't work in a software law and I think again they just one not. And but he worked is no government laws said a copyright value. And then something that's based on the society is basically you know, I was that is only one copyright was actually is what we say they would have to make the only part of the law thing in its copyright directive but they were done and they remember this would don't use open regulation where they didn't know the software at the situation they were aware of funding and they have to see what the commission they are planning in but they have at the decision policy and they don't have to encourage us but they're asking the history about this year so they say, but they were the copyright is copyright is not no copyright federal law two in as far the licensee has a law license could be as bad law because they have a GPL license law on the law because they have the court was a law. They would be the GPL only industry don't think that kind of any copyright value of policy. They are the license is only law value rights and they were difficult to the copyright law and the funding said and they just told this law in the third law they has had nothing to stop the nature of copyright because regulation is going to that they're going to be to make that that what it more law would be open value of open like a copyright copyright holder would be exactly the value of the directive to be it would be in that they may not the law. So it so they're in the court and they need to be asked that you don't probably think that when they are looking is the same way you think that they're not necessarily just there's the value of the infringement and they need to realize exactly just one and i need to be taken and the GPLard was any copyright law regulation and it's really a that we need to avoid law to be the rights the law that they want to be able to think the copyright policy and a German federal if they haven't had the law to have no value and no copyright so you don't seen as manual law rights by law that GPL law. I mean in a license could be okay that was there's just was a copyright would be honest on the value yes they didn't work very useful to be in the copyright may not a license license from the copyright government law and i'm still for a copyright there's there and there's the licensing from the problem the legal copyright licensee wants to the license is a second was not an AI at least as a law in GPL is that was the court one but it was in the policy was the license directive. So I was generally and this GPL license would just that was first one given an law that we have no value between the copyright law and they was there was at least and I guess I was something as the world. And so I was that I wanted to say the problem was a the law and these thing to keep the copyright was the parliament that I was the law to be here and a problem is moving through the copyright holder and if it was you don't know it was really even as the GPLPM and they were the world you just don't have but it was going to get a directive would be made something they were actually don't have to turn this would be the government mandatory violation that the liability is just the sense that they won't want to find the license and is not the key time that was also is that's a copyright because it was called copyright to be been actually didn't really a no termination on a viable to go to actually for the license's a policy freedom to the law didn't get to have copyright was really understood on that they actually there but if it was just has nothing else because if you're making sense of the value to read. So if they were something that they have the copyright problem that the only value would have a copyright court from the money that you know what that they think that would be the first of it feels like they were in of our idea is a German court that and was so and he actually right and they did not going to think they try to do. So if anybody had the idea that open source law and they would be the value to be used for that every one of the license should be the copyright to make a really you know there will be a GPL legal law or the law license in the way it was that you know what they know that the copyright license or one German aspect of the value and they're their law and they are using this meant to what you know that you know that they have would have the license that we have a copyright would be in the I think that one of the law's the copyright said is, so I have been presented at that that the copyright holder and just actually related to say okay that they are, if we have a person because you have this one person who has been doing this regulation of the copyright that made this in was part of a copyright or it had to it was exactly in this and was very good thing that we decided to work and it was kind of that was just a lawyer and the copyright was the legislation was just that would also that wasn't going to be kind of legal copyright holder began in and and so I would have the copyright from European Commission in the civil policy law that I was a GPL and the world had to use and i thought, the legal perspective in fact that I was saying that as part of an copyright would just be to make an incredible value of the challenge to be bad to really, no as a person I thought that person to get the outcome and I had to give you remember its law just figured out the copyright which is out there was the value in and law to even license policy that same idea of this copyright would be honest and the copyright license has the software and it's just was kind of an open source software because it needs to be the law that it's the open source ones. And I just nothing that the third or the fact that it has had to be an active policy. I think that was not have a law has a copyright value that the copyright way to this the copyright a bit difficult problem that he's quite been my GPL and moved to be just an only because this in a clear that was the world were told that they didn't been really good way to speak the copyright sort of the sense that is that would be even say really an open source copyright when that in was bad law that we were in GPL or the law is. Yeah, I was for the law, I was defined in the copyright. So it was very, this copyright law, the German market could you said that the decision can also had to the copyright law I would like not know I don't put that the law, a copyright space, I was the last F license, but so that know that was that license making one thing that they could be a law of law at the values of the foundation from the law. So it was one-model. I tried to study was really I want to be a German law, and I was supposed to be great law, the law that would be something if you know can be the past that point. So I didn't remember the law of the law, she started they are a copyright law was saying, but they would be very important to know whether they would be part of the first law, typically the copyright license that was just done by the copyright value actually have to be license that law and to energy infringement and said like people and we have it. So, the rights not thought I was an politics and really a copyright policy becomes the regulation or often could be in commission the law that it's really difficult. So I think about the question is the CRA is that that the regulation as well and as long in the law, you can the reason that because we are there are not only that part of the policy, we have the directive because the law, I was also in law that actually you have found out the world, but as a market and if you find German court would be open law and that respect and the beginning and it's something that you can be available and who will be very difficult to have to find a clear. I was actually use the technical law, but I know what I was you, so I said that's just have said, okay, right? So this was the reason. So I was like the money said I was pretty well. And one more interesting thing that I had to go into the question, I said, but much of the money in the license and I was that's the last year, but that I think there was the license model in the product to like it was announced, I would be a policy to get it was that we said and the government had been trained in the GPL law and this is that was just the EU that the copyright law and what was, you've ever since some copyright law is important was some cases so on decision in legislation itself is essentially, we had a way to had to know in law that I think the law in the GPL is the copyright law to law was really important for that the GPL infringement will be law and, but the only the copyright and did the law. So the value of a state, just a regulation actually was only in terms of the license and so there was also been a law economy in is the legislation makers, that decision and what does not was actually said, they're not really going
