 Hello everyone. We want a great mentor with a company, we have to get your business building a more people in OpenSocket and I'm very closely with product, but for us, okay, but as a lot of projects like we hope to help, or make that we treat the product. And I'd like to make out of these people that have to get the project. So I have a group that's the first one of what we want to talk about the funding to be the most important to introduce that we have in the work. It's very essential to get in the world to get into how they just about the first one place to do or in a lot of kind of a lot of work with some other projects that they have to work with open standards in places like open source. So I'm most of that's basically a lot of people who have been in this in the world. We have been about the product on this open source we have been in the European Union already have in the product company and a long as a new companies to focus of a community that we just also have been trying to share to spend into the way to come from the IT that are shipping in this from the communities. And I think we're doing with people to get it. So it was going to start to be in the open source community-profit, why they are in the commission to be like the moment or a democratic and so we have people and just can be used to follow up who don't do it in a lot of the world and we're just for us not going to be in this and think that we have on the second time to speak about the world. So there was very good person I'm not just looking on the community and I'm going to be here and they've been doing that we have to give us when we can come from that the day to go to our product or volunteer project community. I'm going to a tech and they have my open source is a first person we'll go and we're going to me in the big tech, so far. We're going to keep just looking into the open source community and we love to look at our project. Now, because I'm going to be so early and we're going to focus on and let's all. I don't know the people who's speak. So everyone. I'm going to thank you for joining me. Thank you very much. So I'm just wondering for us? We're going to have part of applause for coming out to try to take a while I'm an end here. And I'm going to talk, the technical side. If you. So we're going to see the last year. So everyone. I'm going to say I'm going to go and thank you know the co-ish, so we have one talk here that it's a little bit of us. I'm my last year to talk to go ahead about what I'm talking about the first year ago. I am I'm just looking back to present a few questions that we will going to the chance to talk about like to try to you and find the panel. So that we are we are very much for being removed this thing that in your side, but I'm going to talk about the session because I was how I'm going to be talking about their stories about community was saying that I was to come now, but the European Commission and I am the Drupal and I want to ask the Future and I'm wondering maybe wondering exactly the European Commission is an important to the Commission since this point of the UKI is it was the big co-based law. I was quite happy to work there, just wondering about the time for us in 2003, but I said that I was like we can be in Amsterdam, maybe they have a little bit of all involved and we have been trying to share us some issues and so that the EU Association, we have five years at this incredible for Europe and software ecosystem and we actually have a national Commission in the United States open source and so they were at the way that I was wondering that they were the fact that was actually has been using to come out there were also been on the world that was going to the world on a lot of the last year and to follow the situation that I learned about one member of the parliament here and that he's related to be here. I started so long time I was trying to four years ago that I think I was the second part of these were the time in the national law and parliament was the law or I had time and he would had. It needed to my think the years ago and she was just wondering what I've had wondering is his knowledge in the commission policy and they were open source commission was a legislation were about the law that actually had a important piece of the law company announced that can just had that at the government in tech in Brazil and the court decided to ensure that were using and they were in this field towards the commission to follow up in 2022. And the Commission was it was wondering and the question was really the European Union that the first aspect that was that you ran into the upper law. This was enough of the long law in the license from the law point of the law and a German law person was a legislation and we would't know that somebody who did have in the commission, but although the government was the law in law in the law liability was here was very soon. And he was very important to the law, for the German law and they said the law was to trust of government law has only value of the GPL could be the decision to the commission directive and they were trained on they was the law between the parliament had that could really big law problem, and I was that had to solve it was a law or something to say which was not the law and an law is just interesting in parliament and a fact that was the commission was basically a license and if you was just wondering to be really to have no been in the standard copyright. So the law, and it's also has this law is what is not that is an a law and they could have like the clear and so, the one copyright person and the value because you can be a policy and she was the market of copyright makers? And here I think it was just a part of important. And this question that I said that I'm a license in the I was thinking is the value that was for even clear value of the law, a European law but I was the license was very famous value and the rights and I was in a law was a law to be affected by a moment could cause itself, and not a value such law, but I found that could be an copyright holder themselves. And the copyright law, right, we are always saying an industry infringement forces the copyright act on that they will be done a GPL was known as an copyright would make could of the law was a copyright in copyright law that the copyright license in the software and honestly, but I think about legal law and a law law I think it was a good. And the market and then they were in a directive and they come in actually used to understand what she has been doing this notion and they actually has a copyright freedom and and that they were the copyright law and they have had that still did in the transparency, but you know that's something that they will happen as a directive by law effect. So I would be a question was like they're in a long enough. And I think we had you know, I was just think that GPL has considered the copyright infringement to the commission has had to work as a law was a law and people was okay, but don't have to be there was only heard of that is that the law is there was an law that happened at least saying that the law was wondering to the commission in the law didn't get the fact. I think that she got to the license. But when they're from the law law, so he was, okay I'm just supposed to just the money. I didn't know nothing and after the GPL law policy is maybe I was in the law that the copyright law of the license should be under a commercial law, but it was mostly you know no copyright law, no law and we are just wondering, but we also going to that they have the only saying that copyright was something important and there were going to use value that were the law and think they were speaking about copyright could this market field that was important in just uh, you just not just one place because they tend to keep going to have the value of the German fact that the world, uh, right value to be a copyrightkeepers could be the law and they are involved this value. So that they had a legal law that it the copyright license for government was not someone will still said, but as a license was surprised that that license in the law no good, that law? Because I said about the right side at the license nature of tech in a, uh that to, no infringement were made the GPL government. I think it was a law that is meant you could be the nature of law that they have always do and they're like in copyright cost that the value, but I don't know the copyright world that I think before you need to know about the GPL as time that the copyright is what people have or not for license are the licensing but right, I know a copyright product would know that license since they know, so let's the licensee was not first license legislation. But then I think there was the license and this the society has nothing is an end when we just heard in the software that it was just is really helpful to go off the same policy was the licenses and they made it out to know where the term is used by the commission the copyright law was used that it was quite part of law there was used in a license and um, is copyright law said for the license who was a license in law law law and the copyright and they were a directive. But there was the conversation. And so that was a decision, it was very good law, because they were a copyright rights sector so that they said a value. She was in the GPL software, that is like third license in the copyright license value for it was by copyright law perspective, and they thought that we've worked on that was the court was clear but they were in their law, making it was like copyright directive and they had an hour was copyright holder didn't working well so we still this product so that was open public decision in the law, so, and so this problem of why they were in the copyright that are that was just the law that was that is a policy. But it was a hard to open up to be more often in the copyright mean, okay. The license that we can be aware that we've got in the fact that the political was said about the only a copyright in Europe law And we've just talked about the value of the law. We can't actually share their copyright licenses but that was the copyright court law. We've tried to the copyright copyright court, not part of. It's how the term is the industry could be a value as a license infringement needs to I didn't know for market made open source copyright that the only has never decided, a public value report we can be, because the copyright value of free commission that we didn't think they didn't work out that came to keep somebody were seeing the GPL had no point in practice in the government might be the license and policy would be a place for there that to solve really cost is no longer and I've had it so they don't have to update and they say it had really, you know. So anyway, I want to do we have them on an assumption that we should be the copyright to be a copyright holder could be a value of law. So they looked into copyright policy. And, the license so I want to do need to throw it's happy that the commission, for like a way to this is that they're doing? But I've got there's just saying, this happens in that is to know, that what would be the copyright law, because you know, in the law. I would be able to be or license itself or maybe the copyright directive. So when the license could be made in the copyright licensee is the copyright law is the German law license that the copyright violation and we're going to exist in a GPL and the copyright and the court to mean the court they could be affected by the value of law to solve a law. I would be a copyright doesn't have somewhat important that would just wasn't get much there in the license that law or kind of license license decision copyright law license, they saw into copyright law to that they were quite open only it was a license. Because you know, not just one person that, because it has no license and they just a law that the license have to the holder to be wrong copyright policy law that the copyright that key in and GPL that value of the law, because they and they act made a copyright, they would be able to so the GPL GPL value to be fully publicly license has really not be super clear and could open copyright is exactly what I think that they would might be the law directive, but it's to be, but it's just a decision that there's absolutely a law directive, people can license to do it's already an and they would be. They're not longer mean that they're. And they get the copyright could be able to be a policy in the value of the EU law that the copyright transparency, but they're not only one license regulation, but they can. And they didn't have a copyright and they've heard of they're not clear that they're not work for companies could be a fact that have a way to you know that don't really have any copyright decision that made this law value, that we would be only have been aware of law and in the politics and the copyright infringement and none of the laws, of the world money and that they were quite time they didn't see people don't have a lot more copyright license law because they be able to know as part of companies are very often also so they are enthusiastic on the value as you know open term is that that you do we have to be asking that the third law of all the license field that's the rights and the licensee came to be able to be there's not so on the TPM of the court law value, but that they would have the copyright law field of a copyright holder. So there are a law. And that was the license will be some way to open source license open source law, they are a a law with law about copyright copyright and a closed source law in as an rights that says that they don
