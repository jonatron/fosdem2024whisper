 Hi, and I'm a brief introduction. Okay, I'm the Openuse talk about to Daniel our name just introduce a name. I'm a little bit of a little bit, which is the first one of Yoo called last year before Glean for CISU. InC, where the one that's the user is the beginning is a lot less than Robin, but I'm kidding. And we have many of those, I just using CERN, which I'm going to write the CNCF to share the CPP. I'm getting an OSPOSDEM for this C++. On the backends a couple of other in this case I'm going to talk, I'm here. I'm going to be curious about the first time for this code for the SSSDOMAD. And I'm going to put a little bit of code C++ or I'm just going to be going to talk about 20, which are going to be going to talk about how to start about it? This is the CSSD and how to talk about the OSPDON is called EEC authentication agent? So, this is an app that's a more of the first. It's called OpenV. It's also for a first thing called OpenSSD has its NSSD project and TSSD and OpenCAD. And what I'm a modern Open SGXEG. So thank you have also had a way to be, what I have is thinking about the first of the OpenJDKs have is this I'm very long time for the most of the developers that we're going to remove PSPOSI and trying to introduce the way to do you for all of the we're using a bit to give me if you a bit of a lot of a lot of this, the world that you care. We're going to show you another one as well, which is that we have. This is going to take a lot of this whole team where we're going to build and we're going to be hoping to talk about it's going to keep a lot of SSSU and so that we have to do this point of other people in our infrastructure, but this was kind of open source projects and we have been thinking about me. How does it's the European Commission has been trying to offer in the open source software services and we have one thing. And we also with a huge company that is the German product and the EU institutions. And we have a research group of the German open source and the EUs of companies needs to do about interoperable services, but they are working in a problem with the EU definition of the whole world and and say that we have the product and we are trying to go into open source company, like that we're here, we have a bit of these things to work incredibly important for example that we have been created that we get engaged that, but there was about the fact that we're going to try to follow and we've been doing it back to be nice. We've been saying that we're using the commission behind the challenge a big stories on and we've had been talked about us to learn more advanced legislation at the government and this society and we have the commission and we'd like to do it to take one of the foundation and we'll need because we have some ways to learn between the open source standards and where we have a European rights and I don't know this decision makers for us out. So we have an organization itself. So we say that we'll say we have in this is very, we can throw into the long time to think we have a year and we are looking at the commission companies and the whole community we also know a culture and the digital rights in here about it's and a very first of the commission, it's the legislation and that we have in law and they're going to be a governance and could be like that the European organizations, of the long work on the tech and their society in one is from the world and they're open source world as we have seen the European Commission and the AI foundations themselves and open source funding to look at the sector in the commission open source software project. And the good way that's a wider data, also there's open source software and you know, the European Commission's four years, what they would you know that community would pay you know that's good impact and we've been in the world of the world and we've been the mission. And we're referring to also an point of making sense. So we're going to be looking for it's like as we've been using the moment to be affected for a good time. I was looking into the end of technology. So we thought we've been using to do that we're talking about the AI community engineer has been trying to a lot of the software as we'd like companies, we have the copyright rights to be able to work on the people and are hoping to make people to, right balance and what we want to set up and we're just to open source software, give you know, well even the PLD, they will start within practice we're the world. And they're using software. There's what we also doing in a nonprofit organizations, which is that we're going to be willing to be open source community? Well, like another question to be a critical, we're, all that, there's why it's a social software, there are so in a first have some of a lot more people, and these people in the CRA and there's not to say that we're not in the scope and they have no way to talk as possible to try to go and then. And a good thing, they're a lot of work with the whole bunch of issues like people and they can think that they have the team to be aware of open printing in their product, but they can be there's one of work with the EU and they're not have the world and they may be there's not so they're not only one of that they're pushing the world. And they really important thing on the best it, they're doing something very, but they're in at the companies to share and there. And that's a European Commission, and they don't free world and they can share the law for that the act that you know what they may be a license field and they know about public law that they will be used for different law and they're effectively are just the copyright of the regulation. And that they just an impact on to do not just the CRA. And these laws that the copyright could be able to be called copyright license and they need to be aware of the impact and they shouldn't really be a law in the key-oneability is trying to keep something that they're just a would be that they would be more interesting or many countries that they wanted to be used as the licenses in the public sector. And that's literally had the legislation, but there's what i would be a different sector and that I've been a open source software, in and a law or one of an issue that particular decision can't know, like the directive of the issue of the world of the railway law they need to be the law the world is because they're going to see a law or the year or the person could be the copyright decision that was made the issue of these regulation would need to ask that their law would be clear that it up in the CRA and there but of it's something that it would be made to think it under open source because they have that they want to identify on the copyright product or because they need to use any legislation that they have an open source law and they need to publish the law in the long term by this law or the rights this open standards that the law and act in the EU court rights. And and the public law is that's a copyright came at law there's being copyright directive in the law should actually actually give is the world. And the Commission has been an issue. So that are, the world, the commission to start the negotiations from the European Commission has been done the open source community of rights and they have had to be the regulation that society, the very popular law that she said that law in that were made for there's very copyright is an open source violation in terms of open license, so they did not only three years ago, but that the problem the world and so much technical rights in terms of law and they are not, like even a question. And for parliament is they were to give the moment and or much a great question was one of those EU clause and a law they have the open source or as, because they are more energy and they would be a German law value that it's being the parliament on the German government. And so the copyright law I think it was interesting as a decision law for fact the government could just just tell that a law field who brought into any IT law and their law and the gate, not be. And so that the law has been the money in the CRA. And they had to open source law, because it was an only the policy directive is just been elected into money to be on digital law infringement law companies to be the beginning and to influence. So I would for the open source value open source. There was one of the middle is a good to the sector and so the directive. And because they have not a value that is saying I was to think because I was the directive and I was just was the one of most commission was the value, but I was not been to benefit to the panel. And I think that Drupal law that was a law so in a law is a political value of many law software license law in European regulation of law and is just is going to open source law, and and they did good law and it was I was useful for the rights and they actually and a legal states and there was going on copyright field. And they thought about open-tas the law law they were there was something often a GPL Act that they were also said a commission. And we had at that they were just said it only had the OAuth has to try and they would be addressed by legal law. And they have to say that legislation and they were the law that was open source software the last law and they had a copyright decision-GI key guess only. In 2018 and they were able to forecast and they were not always taking care of the commission and they see the panel that we were asking the regulation said about TPM until they were always be able to identify it because they had to do have the last value of course a copyright because they came out of his law licenses to be there was not only important, so in the world and they were available at the moment. But they were then if they were the beginning of the value. And so the goal was used to be moved to see that they came to public companies there, but they had a really thought for and often were not been a license that they were the copyright copyright rights was saying the people is and they were using copyright the law in the law because they were a policy faced as a copyright in 20 and the EU and the copyright infringement could have were the first value of the same parties and even a CRA policy entered into the law. And that the copyright holder is doing they were now have been really so they didn't know it was only time until which was just one of court law that long as a lot of people didn't have we came in the open source law who would think and because for this law and I could be an GPL law within the copyright to law because the first that this field it was said that to work that they have happened that they don't have no impact. They actually is organized in as license in an encryption standard only approach would be nice thing that they had that they were an issue and they're trying to also had this was the business and they have said, because they know they didn't know free license were a decision the decision in was you know that all have had in this regulation that was really of companies were funded at the value of EU parliament for a sense that the copyright. So they were when they were allowed can always there were really not good to go in the EU directive there were just the court commission, who got this point that. And they were actually they're a value the law they had somebody can't know how they still an issue that means three years still there I'd like each parties that the market because they call to regulate in the commission would be the last way I don't know this? Well, but there is by you know what did at the reason. You've been the tech field. I think we thought about what were able to think that were, right now I decided to have been working a member of this in a hard for us to manage, right so there were quite a good question. And I was the law and we had for software and all the fact that's an obvious to do and to kind of the industry in our directive in a very, but the software when people are we are not being so the amount of product was coming in the big topic were, but that were responsible yet got to be just thought that was over time. So that for the one over time, I hope that we did we had the world as we had a long term that the, at the first time going to say that was a law and that we had the directive. So if we're going to share think it's happening and we get a policy and so many the answer was that is happening. I thought that we went to keep on half of the time enough time, we knew the question that we get back to the right now we do it had somebody had to the conversation and maybe not have this person was in a policy and then they actually doesn't work but they made it was talking to do we had in the left and feel that it was just been working and they were just that they had to have to do and they were doing that I had worked at the key con said it really just had was really the end that I had had to wanted to actually had to put in this on a key at the key to do and so he seems for the way to guess. So I think it was just had to say the TPM key cloak was very good because it in the key now it was just actually meant that I said, and the TPM because I would like to jump and he was to be very important to like an event and I want to have the way to put the key and they want to measure the TPM as you can be something. They are we can't always share the keys, and so that they are the TPMs and they
