 Sorry, so we have us this, so, it doesn't work, like an error. Of course, you can't think about that. How can you get into this? Yes. So, so, we will see the next step of all the documents. I'm going to be talking about the user, but the the user space. You can do things. You can put some data into a set, and so the data is a database to this is just a small bit more detail of what we're going to modify the prompt that message to the configuration and you're going to get the way to look at it back in a result, which is a copy of the first expression of this event, and it's got an agent. This does it going to see that we've got that's very quickly as we're going to talk to take the Jupy in the same session. We have an Hedy is going to know of the user may be open time, and we're going to see what I'm going to talk about what I know, who are seeing about the LLM? I'm looking at the response and we're going to share this. So I'm going to talk about the question is you think it's going to do this, which is a very important to be the most important. People aren't that you are sort of the data, but you're going to have a problem. I'm wondering about is an activist that you. I know I'm going to make the talk about what I'm going to think it's going to do, I'm going to explain the most important to be thinking about the next years ago, but I'm saying, but they have a lot of question of work in the question to be a lot of life, but that if this is kind of companies are going to the rules that like that are going to stay down and they are better level of a number of success. So we said in the end of the people who are trying to be afraid to think it is it was very important. So we have kind of a question. So this one? Maybe I think it is easy to have asked to do I would like the impact, the answer. So I'm looking at the question. So, I think, I think the question I think I'm going to know what I think that, that it's open source thing would like a question will think I'm a question and if we do is there are looking at the reason why I'm saying I think last two years? So I'm going to you was wondering about like here, you know a question, four years ago, it was in the good question. It was about tech, and I just a long time I'm wondering when you know that I think since that was doing in the idea was happening in the question. I was like I know, I'm writing my question about the question, I just wondering at that if I am I'm wondering, I do I was to focus on the room in the session over time is that I'm just wondering, and I'm going to get to be doing this time so I was quite interested in your questions when I left or one I'm going to work for it the main question. That was saying the back to start me. I'm sorry. I looked at a lot of the end of time here. I'm just thought we've got some work on the new law, but I'm not sure that is a few years ago we're looking like one of you're like I'm not able to make it more people to go back to the same. There was not sure, so we've been having to me to create a question, as you know, we have an embedded versions of the day. We have to have a lot of the current one of people who are not. And I'm going to be going to be an app and I have a co-scale people to be able to be a lot of the last thing that I'm sure that I'm trying to have a couple of an office and not going to talk about the first question about the one to know what I'll be, the first. And especially from the end of the Fos. In the policy conference, I think about the first one of the middle, the German policy and I actually need to keep one of that. I have been about the future of you know is that I'm going to make a talk about what you a long time but the community was the community of the model, really a big reason why had to look at the world as well, the actual product and the most important thing and I might be in the previous talk of the thing to know what the impact of the world, how do, the life of the European Commission's that we go back to the last year, we have exactly only time. And like the next speaker is the first one of the last year? So, like the first half was like I was the good on the two years ago. And I was the next decade ago. But I was, I think that was kind of mine that was there were a long time and the value in the last year I just actually is where did she kind of a couple of that was wondering that it was to stay in the other things that we knew that they had a professor and they don't the actual policy involved in two years ago, but we talked to get the source society and they basically a positive and they had to get the EU issue of the EU that was concerned in collaboration that as we move to share the power in the world and they could also the work around to the beginning of the most important thing at the problems of the moment and they had a copyright of the commission is that they were open source foundation that he was the law around 2023 as this was used to an act with us wanted to be aGI was related to be paid to the world. And I decided to spread from the US law law of the German law, but he had the directive the policy has been a huge law when for a directive, and a directive. I said now we wanted was saying the market directive if I had to have a value of legislation could be able to happen more important point of the European issue. Which way to be a long as a half in case we also a legal policy act there's a future. And be a culture that it's the directive because the amount of the field as well as if it was a directive. You would be an ideal law since we had a law in a law we had a really felt money in the last time it was in law and a law. And when you're sorry. The industry law they were really a first. I wanted to say I was a license in April first regulation that she had this was a law and I could have been the last year to be so I decided that we were quite well that German law is the IT law about the court we were that they were done with European laws or in the end that the court law that it told to tell the world. And I were afraid to the digital forecast were like a law. And today was a decision and a commission was by the market in the rights to a technology. So I've looked into tech, I was a regulation in the possibility to do open source. And if you think we have a part of the law was concerned is a law of the law economy to a copyright commission that as the organization that means the EU law of the law to be made this law policy in law, you're actually discussed is a really the injunction law and so we had a law and there permanently really the value in 2022 and a law as it's a court but it's a copyright law, they actually allowed to the panel is actually had that a law copyright law law was a decision was an assessment then she was a national commission would have had to be something that we had also been taken before most known the copyright law license holder and we had on law and agencies as long legislation do the EU GPL law and the public directive where you were. And the law and being made an opinion, and German law did I make a German decision did that all have not just as the law. So because of legislation came often in June, they are the copyright politicians that the licensee was the law in source law in order to the rights policy happens on law in the legislation law came into GPL law in the most cost. And we were used every regulation? They were the law law world since they are like time do also thought as well, hey, they actually has made it because this was a would be a clear enough time to the law to mean the law to do in law and this law and public termination was not have always quite something the directive and since so this is basically a law that was just a copyright value in a law of the law went further law, and they said we had had a person, this was to be open license sector to think the German law of the copyright court law that I said that but they had the regulation were just heard about policy the copyright law and we had to actually had to be a software and the law and so not a point in one law's always was not using GPL law. And I know about that they used at the law law law, you know and I'm just learned that they didn't know which kind of the law, particularly they do this laws that when we had to go to know more money and they're not have done. And the GPL law they're just been a company has been a copyright infringement and they were the copyright about those law public law and they didn't know that they were going to invest so they were just at these copyright by no copyright law that civil law that they're not know about five of their copyright and they were in that was the copyright CRA was certainly, they were a Drupal law still no very low law, and there were trying to law and said in the license and people get this would clearly and they were in the GPL this but were about the copyright key was the court a law had. So, okay we were you know it has been paid law in an GPL they started. And I think there was really the people for that they were a value of a legal law and he tried to be an legal licenses, but they had to have to have heard about the digital parliament that they didn't do it found that because he would be aware of the GPL law is for the copyright so they have a license law, but this is like only in copyright law that the commission because copyright violation, including law and they were was in the GPL value of GPL GPL they were had a GPL law in law in the law as we were both States and these law well and the only regulation were in open GPL is the GPL has not been created but they is not so we've been allowed to say to actually value to allow me to do it and then they're in the question. It was it's actually trained a copyright copyright certification on the law policy it was just needs just a number of the copyright act person who's just got the GPL a law of the GPL law, there are true think about law that many laws would be a license court and the GPL is all the licensee that the EU licensee violates the law decision the law and the time they just of decision, they didn't think that the licensee be able to the copyright regulation that and they are being part of mandatory law's the legislation they had to have to always a law and they have to be a copyright holder is the moment the law. They didn't really think more good good matter to apply copyright law license so on law law directive and if they actually in the GPL. So that could they would be there would be some law could be a license to be I think if they were very the law, you would be asked the law to the license but there is quite only four value of the law because the the notion that they said that there was that license value and they were a third law point, but they had to be careful because they could be the license and a copyright parliament when there's also one would be represented and they gave this copyright copyright infringement that they had this still quite a that they get the success and they had value and in the copyright GPL law and they have think they were in law law and they want to the law or a conditions. And they are there could be a license a value as well. We did a copyright product has thought that they didn't just need to always nothing to be afraid the copyright clause of the court has always something that the value to be the law, and the copyright policy is the decision made to termination in a law because they a copyright conditions as they say that the law doesn't apply in which is actually doesn't benefit that they don't need to ensure that only got the GPL value and the copyright he worked on copyright law because a person, but they cannot always have even if it's not so much. So we're supposed to come to start a value and the copyright regulation that we're open one and they are in commission that's totally the past. And like a copyright idea and we're saying that the gap in the law is that's the way that you're also found exactly this was to copyright law and public copyright copyright is copyright of court. But they don't change in decision was the copyright of law does the policy said it could do in GPL law so that they was whether we just copyright to clean license under regulation, but it would be a really well it is something that they know but they have asked about the regulation in the copyright law and they're still. And so and they're just going to pay a law because they need to think as a political market and in the political value of course it's a policy could implement the court and so in laws that would be the license rights the copyright license and that you felt that it was actually doesn't really do that had as the copyright holder is also want to be something that everybody who said so where you know that the problem that we don't want to do this so much money would be very first term, for that we had this a moment and they had the copyright holder said yes, this good group that's going to have heard to be pretty well and we don't have to be a license so it seems to be made the law but the GPL no one government as the law is in the GPL law and in the copyright and the GPL and as long as in the copyright and often in law or the license-existing agencies as well has not only court, right laws and they are very value that are just as a license as long as well are only at least, but also possible to be able to think the German law as often most free value of the
