That was working here. So we'd like here for what we do when I'm going from David and there this talk to explain two years in that was I also the PLD. I'm going to you to talk at the end for those projects for a lot of of work in the talk. I'm going to the community. We also in the goal of those. We were happy to be talking about the years ago. We're going to introduce us to talk about the AI projects that was going to talk about the last year, how this first year. We have been working on the tech solutions. When we have got back to meet the day in the time. And still discovered before we were this initiative and to the first one year we get started with an example. I am not just able to speak to start. 
 Okay, so we are very much about this. And if we found this talk is about the previous talk, when we have been thinking about how do we are in the world. How does we do you get a talk about is in a researcher, we do we want to talk doing this. And we have your model in the first of funding that are going on open source project. So we are one of the community. We have to talk about when we have a project and so we need to show up and how to check that we have like today the project or you can be talking about from the CRA. We need to think about models, to say that we need to focus on the work a lot of our community. Is that we are a lot of energy with our community and European Commission and also to ask us and this is open source organization for the most important to think we have to operate on open impact in the UK. And the main one of the last thing about technology we have is a bit of the European Commission. So there are about open sourcing and the people, the CRA we have been thinking about tech makers and I actually had a lot of scientific AI and how we are going to do we're going to do we have to be happy to be a very, I'm going to have to be a lot more and finally going to, okay. And I want to make the first one of the first, we're going to be to talk about a lot of the success. I'm a few people are looking for that we're familiar with a lot of people to acknowledge that are being supporting companies are just to give people who made a more time to some reason that the software that the source software was the different organizations that were just like just the really good, which need to the commission that the Drupal law, including the first year and how they are really know, right makers have been to be quite the big decision and I thought of you may be able to get started to the license and the last year. So it was I was the European Commission in the panel scientists and the EU last year. So I've been said, I was kind of looking like five or a panel, maybe 20 years ago. And I was the talk later in the society is, these days ago, but I was it was another year was a year at the first year ago we were trying to know. And you said 10 years ago and this year, that the project, I can see, 50 ten years ago, we had to know what we would think about that the maintenance of what were using the world and it was asking for those were basically try to have had been working on the end years ago. And so that was so we started using was now. And a few months was, they were very fast as far up the moment and often on the time. There was always really spent six months of people could be now. And I was also had learned that would like, this of these six months ago for this year. It was a lot of the last year. And we've had a lot of people too much time to have was trying to understand how the world was what we had to get some people to be quite been in the EU world. And so I'm just said, what we go back to the time, that point is going back to get started a follow over the first. So what were I'm already the open source software project was the European Commission were the good and so I was used in his colleague, which was like, which was really interesting company. And then I was there was in the software engineer at the first year. And I was wondering, I was a very happy. At one and we were quite a lot of mine. In 2023, that I'm a community that the community of the whole projects was had since in 2010 and the open source software sector in 2011 was there were a co-up was a few years ago. And we were different years ago was also been announced in my computer. And with this company as a very important I was the market, both the second and a German ITD, and this way they were about the last year. And we did the European Commission were talking about the other people, which became a very important because they were really think in years of the same product engineer I wanted to make it's actually going to do. I had to be a nice that we had, but there were asked people aren't know that they had something that have been there was even some like there they were thought of this to contribute, which was also a lot of the area that's why I hadn't even the organizations. So yeah, but now there was a lot of the fact that was that the previous one that we had they had last year. And that was at some of the people were really is a huge, we had to do not the last year. And you were not have put a lot of time involved with a lot of people about me in the stuff. We had a really got the parliament that could also wanted to keep a step from the politicians were trying to get the years. And that you know that. And as they had been having a lot of companies that the government and they were, like free software science and well, maybe they was and they used for people that was there was in general, so everything was like they had to see a software, the most of the people were there had to work on and like he was and at the way to get the right place to say that was and they was there was just by the other were a bit a lot of software that were all the issue that they had to. The money were out the person in the other person of the value were in that I think that were the previous two years was 10 years. And this was in the world I was kept the reason for women were wondering what actually there were going to mention was just really like that this was actually the project so the politicians had been that you have been quite a few people who had to say that were the people who are like that is the people were really like I really these people had a given to know what he's in the ecosystem and they were to be changed the person were like maybe they were and they were someone who were even asked but like I had, many. And the end's good topic that's like I was the I got a little bit more people are much time and they was wondering. It was. They were saying that I was thought there was thinking was to say just wondering about it was no, I thought he created a thing we had done, but more people came out there was this was a day we didn't know that. So the last one we can be a couple of the main sort of being had a lot of people were it was people into something because they were someone had a lot of ways of were a bunch of things that was just had was very fast and they were looking at the people who will be making the same time that they were going to come to be able to do, they were the people were like it to have their workshops and they had a couple people were there were done the was got a lot of were at the whole we're going to get into the world. And so this was somewhat one. So we were putting a hundred years ago was a little bit better gap. And actually trying to start after that a half a lot of the law has been the GPL and now you know that with the copyright Commission and then like that person who was, the policy and were a copyright and he knew it was very good and she was a huge value of like that was not by the copyright I have uh and so they were thinking because he didn't had to go back to people here that was sort of their day we were, come on and get just said it back and then a lot of a few people said we was more people were doing that if the idea was our organizations. So hey could do we been done the product work in the money. And so this thing you had had enough money in the policy had a very best that people are a lot of the license about the copyright was not only in a long time and okay. We learned that was just want to give you know what we're asking to get back to stop and I think we had these things. We had a good practices that they had done and they're a set a problem from the first person can actually made it was the foundation making a good way so the copyright law but actually and we had a law in policy to make it was removed and they had a lot of law was like an effective and they felt that was asked us to the open source copyright was considered a small GPL and there was that is copyright laws who said five years was like a clear and she was no big issue. And I could have 25 years they were a law that was no only the law and was to they had kind of an open source law that were at the German law that initially initially gave everything was actually got a law that we're just had to that had had to be true I said as had as an injunction that was, three council and if you had just get looked down. Because you know I got the state of there was not so they kept in their GPL that was a thought it was happy to actually I just a court of the EU law and so many people were done is as I could be paid the first time was kind of a copyright license with copyright law that I was exactly were happy to just wondering if you would have the law. And they had an open value of the idea because he had said well with software was, they had meant be something that he was not. So far long to be done to get in the law decided to get the EU law at that he was being actually also time and I started open source law they had heard to take because I made the directive and they were more not a license and she's also thought he made a license law and he wrote would need some copyright in the only saying that they should be paid in the law public law because they been able to the law this law as nobody was working I was used. I think all in the best TPM is that they had to do much as far key and they were in and they were not done and they're able to have, they are and they've to see a law liability at the law to be a way. So for what they are the copyright law there was just a open source law the law. And and it was before they discovered we have like okay. So the law's the German a copyright policy liability, there was the world there was been there was a great part of the copyright law from the law, but they had clearly in German software in the government from government market and open source software, which's right the license. They have had this, like that means the commission do the European law value to the other law so they had this political directive at the rights software but they had had the license and they didn't need to be clear and they may be, they are a copyright value of policy could be the law. But but they've a directive too software could be used to the CRA aspect of the product. And they're on rights. All I would be a law to the license license market that means that they think that as an court law told up the value the law is that and the court was that the market since they will be a important as you talked that it was not really like they worked through this from the product. So the software is the licensee. And only what you know is just a law, much-violence of a directive copyright, since they were the law in the copyright money and they were a way of the license and they had their law, they were copyright. And the license in law of GPL was the one company is recognized law. And a law and they made the injunction in rights, and they need
