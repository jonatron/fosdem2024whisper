 Hello, everyone. Thank you. Thank you very pleased. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for one. 
 Okay. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you. So going to talk to I'm going to be in RISC-based and more about the first thing about how can get the community in there. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much for that. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Okay, first everyone. All thanks. My name is open source Foundation. I'm welcome everyone everyone. This is today I'm going to talk about the past one. I'm going to be going to talk about the next talk about the real talk about running in the second talk. My name was a VT. So I'm going to talk about today. I'm going to talk about my founder of the first lightning talk about the OpenJDK. I'm going to talk about the three OSPOS. So I'm going to talk about a fully engineer since I'm going to be going to talk about which is a project in OpenJDKOS ecosystem. I'm going to talk about the talk about this open source. Airflow is an engineer. But first one of the French Open Sources the WebV Foundation has a KSPOS and I was just been called OpenJDKV 3D Association. And I used to talk about and I know, so far about the first one is the V3. And we did I'm going to talk about the University of the OpenJDK, and I'm you know it on, I'm in the first I'm now, yes. So I'm one of the first I'm not talking about 5. I'm going to talk who's the Commission, we run on the project for the tech projects and I'm going to talk about the OpenJDK is already heard of the EU that most of the European Commission. We also for a long-im around the ones who I'm going to give myself. I'm going to be the open source projects in the C++ project. It's an active since a project in the EU projects for the PV. And he's the software, but he's already launched on the world. We have to talk about the world. And I think, I'm currently, I'm working on a year to the day. And he's a lot of the community, I'm at. There is our product of I needed for the fact, but I'm trying to introduce a product that it so much the European Commission in Europe. So when I'm going to do I'm going to build the world and the open source code base and I'm hoping to talk so much about the first of the way to tell you're going to share about what I'm going to talk about that we're part of people, which is what we are about about the open source and you how do across the work in the thing we talk. And for our open source software called OpenendA. I'm going to think we are going to give us. So of energy in the European Commission was about technology. So the open source project and then we're open source software, we'll be able to be able to share and also technical places who are actually need to think about the digital law but I'm using this open source community. So we should we're thinking about as an open source and the first version of the software and just have been working on to share the fact that stuff that open source source software and so on the license about this brings us, and can be part of the community and it as a software for also open source software, but they're also know about for collaboration in fact that model, we have a lot of the world. So there are also a lot of open source community to build a very often has been developed. And the software that is a lot of open source tools's when you can be not for that's what they're going to be kind of people in the technical community and the last decade from the whole product is that have been a new science in the product of the commission law. So that was the perspective that I can they were the world. I mean, so from the open source community, they talk are really even in the GPL and they are very good at the community and they can't get into the open source technology and they can say they don't feel like they and bring their product that these discussions. You can to open source, if they want to know, you're like people and they may be doing their product. How we are the world, I probably have to have the idea of the CRA, because they're in the educational product and they could just want to trust the value of the copyright license to be a software and so they come into a technology. So they have a scope to have no idea. And they just this rights in the source projects and so much more in the world. And so they are a sustainable. And in the culture of the second software, the maintenance and research aspect that was important thing at the way that. It was that the code, but they could be our world is in the whole community and then you can be aware of their community was in the commission to be done by the market with the power and the data and it was the standard. And it's the German law. So we use of the last year. So it was, the world.0, if you could be. We're going to have to work on the negotiations and they've been working for our first year in the year. So they had a bit of a bit of a year. And it was going to be really known law and the CRA. So why we'm going to be looking forward to convince some of your energy and they would work together, but we did not good at the big decision was doing open source and so we mean it working on every question was going to do that as long time. So it's a lot of energy software engineer at when we were your software, we're calling for free software. So we made us, we're looking at the world. So we see the work on this year, and we had to try to get. We're going to think we've been working on the best that we've worked on this year. So for the time, I'm not going to do some and we're going to we've just going to talk to be able to talk about the initial impact sensor. And then we've heard about how it. So usually because we're gonna explain what we're going to have this thing we're going to get and we've seen our open and we're going to see what we're going to encourage people just talked about us this is going up with the room in the world. I'm going to keep the energy to work. Is on panel we're going to do is going to talk about being able to be focusing on your attention to hear the time for the panel. And I'm working in the co-source system as possible and this year ago, but in the community, I've been told the fact. And I've been building, the room. But one of the company's on the Foundation's a good. And of the company of the current law. And I'm a European Commission and the internet. So let's really little more of what we're asked it. And I'm going to be a lot of the last year, we've been doing today, we're some years, we're the person who's going to spend in the community. We're going to talk. We're going to make this community who are now talking to be talking to talk about the people who's going to thank you. I'll be not gonna just looking at a few years ago. 
 So thank you very he's the same question for the time for the open source community with the first of the open source product is about the world. And I'm gonna introduce a panel. I'm going to a little bit to be a little bit of a big overview of open source projects that when you we have a bit of the first but just wanted to be a couple of a bit bit of a very popular programmer for building of years ago because I'm going to be a good to talk will be a little bit more about what I'm going to be open source project and the future. So thank you may be talking about energy we have a lot of fun to talk about the previous talk about the question, how you very much? For example, please who has been a little bit. First of the co-side energy energy is quite a different part of the European Commission from 2023 in the first product and I was half years ago. The year. The point was 3% of the world, they were a community came about the OSPy in 2011 and I think about Blockly. So the first one is that was part of 6 years ago. So I had a few years after 2023 and I think I did now.0 release was very simplified company from the last year. And like a lot of the last year was very exciting presentation was a big year of the software. We had to be 20 years ago, when you back to give you know what you a while in one of the release. And yeah, the moment. So the years ago was probably the end of the European Commission was created a long time and the first year ago we were the moment up them were. We reached a company. And so Mike created for the day. So I was an American year ago. If that were I was a bit to the current 10 years ago as for the moment. And at the first time, well, we were the year. And I was looking to half a lot of a bit of these year, I was good thing we could find the first days, but I've been experimenting I didn't see is supposed to make a year ago, the last year ago. And if it was something that were a couple of people are being years ago on open source software in days. So I didn't have this project. So the open source product was in our project year ago in the community and we've still know that. But we were the market. We had the things to see a bit more time. Here are here we're just have to spend the world and the Commission, we have been focusing on the things, we get to go back to it a few months. So we have a lot of us a year at this day. So the first thing that's kind of the year and he had over, we also the moment. We had to get to give you a little bit less about the last year ago. And before, our European Commission, we had this time at the last year or this week? And to get a co-one. And so on the moment and then they started doing was started doing this work on the first day period on the first, but this year before we talked about the first of our day. So we did here, I found three, so we got some of the year, very happy to see here was just wondering about 10, but I was a few years ago and of months ago. It was a company in the last year, as I was the year ago. And this year. And we had a five years ago because we had a few months ago, presenting it was the years ago. And the last year when I was just the 30 years ago, again, there was not the presentation for the year ago. And we started this presentation. And in 2019. I was the first one of the most of the first year was what was a while this sort of the moment. I was trying to make a few people was launched. We did we had some of new things yet. So I had some of that we had to keep one year. So the year. And basically look at all of the year ago, I was invented before we were going to happen. We had started this year. And in 2021. We were working software, I was really like to talk for the moment. And I was the last year ago of the open source community was here was there were actually a lot. And about the panel and I was very beginning of software. I was a little bit of the world. And I know, I was used a bit, I was a little bit better way to do it was having this was the problem. This was the reason that we had had to do was going to have a person. Most of the idea. So if we need to do it was that and just realized that? Because we had a little bit of a lot of the end up. And that sounds like I brought into the problem that the last year. And we've had introduced the first one is that we used in the beginning, which is to do in the future. So in reality, the last the beginning because it was the idea of the way, we had a lot of the right now that we had to do is to look at the right now that we're going to talk to do as I work to have to think about that in a lot of the work in the first community was trying to be a lot of the community. So, there was like a big I'm just have a hard to be a good to build parts of these small project, which is that we can be a lot of the community. So, but I also like, I'm going to do this is kind of time to do it's a lot of a whole group of people to talk would like I wish to do something and I think that we're going to do the people? And this and I'm going to give it, like he was going to try to keep up. So we're going to introduce people next up to do very important experience here in the team. And he's really want to be the first year. I think we had a lot of how we've really want to come out the project. We're gonna be able to end, sometimes we going to do we're going to give you should want to ask the people to start going to be doing this in. That's going to answer me what we want to come on. We're going to do is already have our next week that it's going to talk a whole point. So, we have seen as a little bit of people who is just call the open source code. There's going to make any of, some of the go back to this talk about source code that we're going to our product at that are going to make for the product and getting into your project. And this will be the things we're going to have
