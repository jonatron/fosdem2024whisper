 Project Foundation. And I'm going to talk about the first thing. I'm not any questions. That's just wondering, like I'm not wondering, I'm going to give him our talk about myself going to bring a little bit about it with it and you like a specific platform, you know, maybe we've got the next year. So of I'm going to talk about the sort of one of thing that I'm going to introduce the talk about how it's going to give a whole job for that. You can add this or something. So I'm going to show that? Okay, so we're still looking into the community in the latest one to be used to do this, we love and I think it's just going to discuss with AI learning, but if you've been looking at the year. So, I'm doing that. I'm going to happen back to write a very small project. I'm also a little bit of a topic from the community engineer at Mozilla and so I was presenting the same name, I'm not going to talk. If you're going to try to start, the presentation of the community. So the different stories was going to be looking into the community. And I'm going to be talking about the very briefly about this, we're asking you wanted to explain about this talk, was an open source community, from the current community, and open source standards and the beginning. So today. We need to talk, we've been talking about the free software and AI and we have a community. I'm going back to talk about the CRA. So I'm just the PLD and I'm going to talk to you about these digital AI policy engineer at the open source, right. I think I'm a software that I'm a first time. So I'm going to talk about the co-founder from EU product. We have a law? In Germany of the first three open source projects, people and we've been using France, and it's also have a first slide, of the Cyber Resobra. And this society project has been open source world. So I'm going to be an IT, like this is a time. The first of energy science room is the EuropeanOS, we've been working towards software engineer in the technology. So it was we have a pathway for a community. And we have a policy. So I would like the end of the time to think we've almost an open source and our ecosystem. So the case, we have a very well, the moment we have the scope of this process in the current infrastructure. I spent 20 million of the railway model was for a national science. And as a huge science, a little bit tricky part, you've had a lot in that they're talking about the first point, or a commercial technology, which is, there are getting their product research. They actually been a national ecosystem, but they're trying to be open source projects and they're doing their definition that they have had to start the first person, but it. So you know I think we're really, and it, and the value of time they have seen to think that this is like, so much that we've been doing. And this is important is interesting. And I've actually, what we're in the technology with the open science. But that I'm going to show you, let's still work with the last one of the law that we'll have into open source open source foundation and we're just have seen before doing this kind of technology that you heard about it's how we've been doing open source software. We've got a bit of a lot of a few years we're going to be able to provide a new law in the German law. We'll speak along the Cyberist since then we're going to have the railway law that would like, which is the internet of the panel. We're discussing about the commission, what the German law. We're going to stay in the product and so many years ago, was created by the only going to keep it. So I am, so you guys are going to present in the EU revenue are going to be talking about the license at the largest staff, but we've been talking about the last year. We're going to people know that could share both open source developers and we've got to be brought to work and then we have to start. I don't remember that we're going to be talking about the important to look at that everyone. I'm going to encourage you're going to sort of these first and we're going to be asking for here about someone who have a lot of the digital rights and so much energy act in fact that the German law that happened in the University of the law was because we can we have to think about the biggest methodology of all the commission, unfortunately. But that the organization that OpenGI is a directive and this point of the goal of what I think about this is for one is at the question. Because the US and the world that I think I'm a legislation and as the CRA has been trying to be free world. It's important idea of the rights value of what this law and it was that the government rights in the law, I found exactly in the lawyers did the public rights of legislation and also about the community or a knowledge in the Drupal. I was asked the German law from the GPL law was and that as I would like so on the idea that was trying to rights to get, and the government court regulation in the EU law, yep, he's the law in Brazil is government law, and national law and I've seen before I'm a government and they are mostly at scientific law, and the open group, Germany. Because do exactly the license in their licensee law is a law, and that he did you have a citizen law directive open source organization in the only law she's always came from the sector. I was under copyright law. And this copyright law, that they're just felt about the copyright law. And I was in open license that I was since also had a licenses are very recent legislation may actually on this regulation, of legislation were just funded by the copyright foundation that was involved in European practice. That was potentially as you know a law and law or that the copyright copyright sector law after that they had was not so didn't know that was essentially the copyright perspective that it was that the directive that was the educational law that the commission would be quite important to. So that was to become in any law here, the court law company, in regulation, so they wanted to the German law that would be a law. I was that was wondering that thought that in this was the copyright law and they made basically would be to keep the German law that's not being the GPL rights in any law person else also important. And there was not closed at that could still the law at least a law. And so not only thing that and this point is there was good to say that was a law when the decision had to the funding within the law has had copyright law since laws could be the European Commission was that has been a copyright and they were probably had thought that value that he would be the parliament in the law and we did a time we took that were a law told the value in the law to be made and they changed and they have the policy was a copyright from the GPL law happens, we were able to the law and they didn't worked on license infringement that will only had no no value of open-shirt over before they were all the term to get the copyright value on electricity from the room and they had to the problem that and they can't really understand in 2021. And had had no longer had this issue that we were just know that they were, at the, they were part of the legislation had, we used to do they had done as much and no money in the industry was going in the court and they did even need to fix a German GPL would think I didn't even actually see the moment we had something that was they don't get the law. So this was not get in that was important part because a moment was really important of the license that was to be this might be the upper license called law and of a not too well of this was very important. I would be this was missing and the court and so we were really have already like to do we had would think they couldn't want to pay for debate. So the most people. But about the CRA came up being a few people to move and they also since this, for this isn't worry that there wasn't just a specific legislation or just an injunction has been. What was interesting way something else? Should you have talked about the copyright policy makers and she had a possibility to try do, what he was actually had to do was like and they had the German law that then somebody said about the world, but they wouldn't not be a big thing and the commission and the market to be much more, this means that I mean, let's super large law that the law, because that I mentioned, because you remember the world you may know what the law and the GPL and the copyright law has been going on and they had been announced to be one or the past and she's going and they wouldn't know a long number of the copyright nature of so they have money to be key said is by different rights are saying saying they are they have a law. And it's like a copyright sector so you can be the law, there was a German law, it's also very important for three women work about a law. And so, so they're a national law. So I think there's the law to turn on the law has been happening. Now, of the law that's some copyright law, which is usually the only a copyright law, not not the law, and a copyright law, was in a decision cost. And no law and they're not going to be even known by free law, okay, should become the GPL is going to be a second law a license law and no license has changed by the closed German law in a political government and was you're in the German law, the court law or copyright holder with rights from law, so to license license. But as I think there was the license means it's, then the GPL. I just you remember the parliament, because you think it's coming into the regulation that I think that is not in open software law law and the law, I was a law, but in law would be the GPL happens. It's not the license to, I think in the state of trust in that, right, the law. Of open source law could be had given copyright license law, but still more of those legislation. And my law. And, please, before, that I would actually asked to be in this. So you know, I would be the problem that some law, the only very only way of what was there is that was a copyright and what I was that the law proposal would we did this point back I would be discussed the only question that was the copyright policy is the copyright. So it was pretty good enough to be more or like a law that the law has been I could be the UK? Well, and the GPL and so that was a the law for energy sector is the law and unfortunately. And how the fact that GPL is the most important is that was made to act and they are the directive. So as a copyright rights will be given a open and he will be here working for me and everybody who did I'm not see that in the copyright would be that the law law, the data. So they were in the license and the license they had that person that they had even in the license itself by the law and they're not be able to in the law that but they are not, they also one that they were there really first one copyright value of that case in practice directive in which is always mandatory but they're not as well a copyright holder. And I think it's a GPL or not only secret license freedom the copyright person are like public copyright law that this and they were made a key policy value directive because we knew that they are funded by all really just decided a data for that people to say they work on the value of legislation and this law and they were from this information that they are in fact that was made a field of CRA. We had also good the commission that has done was going to just created it and they had to be considered that was not the licenses and as well there were not a court rights to be a TPM license making, because you know that I thought that it was in law developed and she did know is, yes only the value of this is actually in the copyright law itself was a value of the law. And quite only exactly, but it is really really important that it was the UK, because it was it's the copyright license like license but also a license could be the number of the copyright infringement GPL license. If a copyright law and it's kind of policy, and the law actually that makes it's a value, but to say they said because it makes it's somewhat paid for the copyright in copyright conditions. They are actually, think it just because it as possible the law and copyright doesn't really exist exactly money, and it's not a clear to that it's not open source so the law that how we have is having no I think about the product is more of law and they're going to be there is that the policies, it for we can be liable to have to have been competitive to do if the evidence because it's effectively a copyright rights, but I'm going to actually a copyright thought we have to follow them and tell. And we were able to do, so we always know, right. We work on the license that we are a legislation in this law in a license. I think this point when these license to be a law, and they were used to think, they didn't not quite nothing's some copyright product, it was really important because they had that they talked at least the commission, and very good question could not, but they can't be a sense for each law? If you have an legal policy space. And then we just say we talked about, yes, we have enough people. We need to get into legislation in the copyright. We're going to get into the world of copyright law law. I said, we don't even know that we are going to the value of the value as I'm not going to be as I need to stop the code in this just wondering, if everybody, I think we have a whole idea of the German infringement license legislation. You know, we are that, what we're
