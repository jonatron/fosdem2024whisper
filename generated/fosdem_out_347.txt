 And more specifically introduce that you so do with us. So you can. You can create a database or different. You can see here in the name is an AI in the first example of a data, and you can create a database, to show the data, when you can create your data into another a database on your code, but if you want to insert is that is going to deliver the data. And one, if you have a data, it's how you get here or we look in a cloud-based, and you can take a lot of other, of a name for example, for each of this model that you can have an schema, and then you are using a result into a bit of an example of a very simple example here, it's just to get the transaction. So the block, you have the block, a database result of the data, which is the database that's not in which means that you have in data that the database and on the data from the table, it's the data that you need to just the data inside and the database of the cluster. And you can build it and you can see in here, it's a data, if you will be able to aggregate in this area, for example, you can only one of the roles and you can be the table, right, but the prompt, okay, the first, what's what we have, that will be a prompt that you will be able to be in the objects are going to the database or anything, it's the database or the concept of the rows on what you have to deploy. So you want to find from the data. So in the database files that's a series that you have this case in the code or for each database and data from the you will expect. So you're also run on the different types is a table. That's probably obviously just just so you to have a list, how you have the data. It's the result, you don't want to have no answer one of the data that we have to be any node that the data is the storage of the data does. You know the data, that you can be available. You can look at the transaction. It's very simple. So it's the data sets are very important to your database or you can create your website that you can be a container data, you can specify the data. You can move the data. You can see if you have this kind of your data, you can reuse a path in this you can write data with a function. You can have the other pieces, which is really have to the data. You can do everything, but in a table. You can be a problem that you can be done. For that's when you can be used to answer to enable the data. And if you can also generate a database with a database and there you don't have also the data on the data that data. You can define the first source in the data which could be done by the data in the database. And if you can be the data is a database, it's like a database in your data data, it's not only available. And the database, and you have this cluster. And you need a database is part of an application. But what you can you can say, then it's happening, okay, so you can also can create a table that you can see in the data from that the data that you can be the database, which is basically from the database is shown in the query of the database. It's a group. And you can, it to use all the database, also a database are not that are used to read data. So you can be interesting. You have your database, there's the database to query that you might be aware of Kuberos database that how you can do you have the plugin, the same cluster by the rows, if you have your metrics and you want to set up the database, you can also define here, but we want to be used to be a local data. You will be put in the database, the role, and at the data, but you have data in our world, which is capable that has a database that you can be in a table, the data in a lot of your data to a cloud. So the name is a database that is there are basically even in a lot of how your database are just handles all of data or a database. You can use your data when you can identify what you can do we use in our data, and you have also create the data. And there are we have two data, two parts of two two, and is one. In-Wiki, based on the data, the dashboard is where you have actually have quite by the data systems, which is all these columns to be available in your data, a definition, but of data structure systems who have, on the data work that they are here. So you have, that's of learning in an data to figure in the data, what you can typically have about a standard field? Of course, but you have some very long term table in our data, right? And in this is the data, so within an data looks like model, like in Python models, so it's a bit, you know, depending on the database, it's a data, so that you also the data set a data and so that will also data also the rules of data, how the database is basically the data that the data. It's the data, which are your data, right, right at the storage, if you just the users. So here, the only state, maybe you just as you will be open source code on one of the data that you can be 0G, which means that, right? And there are some of these fields, and which are four, like 10% of those two that is two, at the data, four times, six the second part of them are the table that you have two,000 times, 50% of, six, two. The other types of the events just for the two different resources and that are available to know that are the structure and for the input, and so the data is that we are here. I think about the number, the first one is not that when you see from the number two, the next. And I'm going to do I'm going to tell that. I'm going to talk. I'm going to work in the effect. So I'm going to you who did I'm in the slide. So the talk, I'm going to talk about the community. I'm, that I'm doing. And I'm going to talk the idea today, I'm going to then I will explain a few minutes. I'm going to talk about this talk about a little bit of my talk about two months ago. I'm going to talk about that. But it's sort of it's a little bit of a bit more large number of an hour and I'm around the first one of the four years ago, to know what you very much more than I'm going to do we keep about 20 seconds of five minutes to what we have about. Now, what, this? And if we have happened with the technology. I'm going to do I'm not going to be going to do is our infrastructure engineer, we've done in the first, which is very thankful for all about the most important thing. And the one thing I'm going on, but I'm going to talk about the internet, you're going to explain what I've got a few minutes, but I'm not going to explain going to you how can click on the next week, but it's possible you're going to do you can see how you know. You're going to go to be wondering. You should we're going to the next one of the previous talk. I'll be going to briefly. So when you know, you're going to focus a little bit of the first. Yeah, okay? Let's going to start at a few folks. So you'll finish, I don't see again, oh, we'll look at the first one of the audience. And the next one is that's the hallway. This is the microphone. And then we're going to be live from the music. So, my colleague, wait for a community. So this is the speaker. So, I'm going to speak to go. So long time, if you this is going to continue. How does we did. And I'm trying to be going to remember the next speaker is, I'm going to work. And... So I'm going to go back in a lot of a quick guy, thank you for the slides. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. 
 Hello, so today I've got here. And I'm going to start about my presentation for everyone. Okay, OpenIT's one. Thank you, thanks. My name's my name I'm going to thank I've got in Belgium. Okay, please. I'm a talk about the next talk. Thank you. So thank you very much. Very, thank you very much for the speakers on the talk to talk in the first talk of our speaker talk about a talk for our speaker, but to our little bit about a little bit about OpenJDKos and VNC and the time for the ones. We started the talk? And in France of course, the first talk was OpenAPI is also going to some of who was also to introduce a huge half of the current release. OpenAPI and in that is the talk about, can I was trying to OpenJDK 2. So let's good talk. So let's talk about the community. And here's see a lot of the speakers with a lot of contributors and we have been talking about the talk about the Commission is a lot of software engineer, what we've been this year, we were thinking about the core engineer at the whole project today. And I'm just think I'm working on this year. That's Chriszuth, today, maybe an open source software engineer, we can I got a few talks for the moment and then I started working on the German University of the project in the community here. And I had, I was the last year. And in that I've been the moment, the most of the world before, I have been working on the people to be very, I'm just wondering to talk about us, especially to first 10 years about how I'm going to work. And I'm wondering about the last year. I'm a first story which is the first year. And I'm going to be last year. I'm a small talk about the agenda, I'm going to talk on the years. And who's just use of the new foundation. And they have it on the power and they happen to keep from the other people that they're not have to the various. The big few months ago that they have been getting worked to have a lot of dollars of so they're going to get to be fine. We are the last year. It's where he was going to be a little bit of women that we have been kind of the Commission in the market here. They are the best of effort is going to be like. So we try to try to see that's going to give us that we're going to make a round of a fantastic to be talking about the first time, so much from being a little bit of my time. It's how do we don't have any people are going to do we're going to have said, but for people go through the time. Who was these stuff at the tech workshops and he's the first year. What I do we have here? That was going to say exactly what I'm going to'm going to have to happen when the biggest talks to give you're going to talk. And I'm going to talk about the goal. So I'm starting to talk about the sort of the next talk about the agenda. And I'm going to he was contacted by in the first year. People, for our year that while a few years in the German German case. I am going to talk was wondering there a history. And I'm here at the first year in the last year 2017, so far there were a month, but of the time, let's a little bit about to be a couple of a long term with the council and how when you're going to go to be the day, but they just have. And I'm really have seen before this was a little bit of view about, I'm going to go back to this report because I'm going to other people out that we're going to introduce this point. And and say we're going to talk about the first time last week we are looking to set up from day in the last year ago, we have time well. We had this year on this year ago. And this was a good title of this was a lot of a few years ago, if you had just have a little bit and I'm using on it. And there. I'm just wondering. We'll be a little bit of the things, we didn't see the idea is that we weren't have an open source project. We've got to offer of our time until Mike, we have to use the problems for us to work on is that. So the last year. We've said, the question is the last year. And what we don't have done some of the time at least for two years. So I'm the back to give a bit of people into the world, the law is that they have been a lot of the people who can't have been very good and they can all of the time. And the money, we have been doing money and it very often would be able to work on and we've seen that we had the presentation. And it was when we had a really stop. So we had an open source community has very quickly made their organizations, and they had it. And I was for me before just really, if you know, a lot of the first time we've been trying to say it has been doing around the US, there. I'm hoping that that's part of what's a few months ago, there are now. I want to think he's so many years ago really even, if you know, this project we're doing. And that's not always open source services of their product for this project has been announced the world of open source community that the world we've got to be the open source software for those open source and the hardware. And I'm going to talk about our life. And I think they're going
