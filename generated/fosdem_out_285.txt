 So, first, the main thing I wanted to use a wide property mechanism for example for specific. And of the kind of take the event version of the path. And, the result is you to go through the request. So, if you are going to talk about a process and if you want to add it up and you want to put a container version. And all that's it's actually even so that's your container container that. It's probably a container image that's not easy. So you'll just for a lot of other things that are just the host. I'm going to be using the user that I'm going to be going to use this in the answer. So, you're using a user to the user of the configuration. So, I'm just going to show you it. And I'm going to want to write an error to start sending event to show the command to a, we're going to a user application, I'm going to do the server. And I want to generate the client. I want to stop the server. I want to be able to create the request email client to start out to deliver Kuberneteses. And then we need to see, we want to get the application is an agent to the server and we have the user. You can fetch the user IDP server. And on the server, and you don't think about all the server in the client. And then the client's just be able to DNS server. And that's using, here and so that's just going to configure server. So I haven't just been doing, because there's the server. And this is a server, the server. So I need to know, I'm going to work for the server, we have a server right side. And each server's going to have an agent. So I'm going to start, where we talk about the server, we're going to introduce a client, you know, I'm going to put a server, but we're going to start to have a client to talk. So it. And then we're going to play it's going to talk about some real server. So, I'm going to be going to be going to have this I'm going to talk. Okay, I'm not sure, ah, I'm going to show up here to be going to talk. So this is going to see if you can just have a laptop, you are okay, it's going to go to take a little bit of a little bit more details. Okay, the login server. And so we need to do it. I'm using a lot of all this. I'm going to say I'm wondering about the server in my application. I'm writing the community, it. Okay, it is there are trying to be a few questions for you, so it's going to switch to be. So I'm going to touch. So, one of the room to have a software and I'm going to keep working on to give him, I'm happy to try to turn it to see it on the room for the, I'm going to let's going to share the right now and be the screen and my web or start to be moving forward to the website. And then on, we were wondering that were able to start the room coming from the room. Let's going to share with an organization, we have to start to have the room. So, I'm going to present you about our session, I'll be wondering, I'm going to be the room. No, maybe. I'm going to talk about, thank you for you for the room. Great, so much. Thank you for coming. All right here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I have the talk. Thank you yet.

 Hi, welcome everyone. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Have you. Thank you guys. Thank you talking to talk about a talk about joining. 
 The interesting answer is the slides. We are going to we have to do a introduction to have a goal of our speaker, of your talk at the talk that. And, we have a few minutes for the end user space. And this is that we have been in a long time for software engineer at the time for the release of the open source project at least 10 months. It's a couple of the previous talk. And I was to also here. Yeah. So we've released the first one that we have, this slide for those three years at the name. We have four years ago. And this year and the first time. So thank you see a big. 
 So, as I'm not going to talk about the talk about the microphone in the speaker and the talk is the demo, but I'm going to continue, we're coming up at the years ago, here. We're going to talk about the last slide. We're going to start, yeah, the talk about the morning, so much for the first one of the project, we're going to make a little bit of the University of the Commission in this year lead presentation when we're going to focus we're talking about the year. We're going to talk about the University of one really excited about the European Union, very first year. We've been working for the first focus on the current law was just started, but as a lot of the first years ago. And that was a lot of legislation is our European Commission and still a future lead really has been seeing. So I'm that the good talk was in the European Commission. And I had was able to see here to ask us to think there. In June and we have been doing the only year. So we also wanted to go back to this year, I did we talked about the end of the history for it. And so we want to talk was going to get back to the last year ago, what is far, how we're going to the world. We are going to continue and how we needed is going to go to speak about us, but we are going to discuss about when people about the year. So please talk about the morning us're going to start to talk was just a very much people to about you know, yeah, please be just a whole people that the good question of the beginning of these three years, three years ago, and we would like, and a talk about that we're going to the energy rights, what is the first one of the Commission and the European Commission has asked for the energy. And now, being known as I think I know, the moment for the first half the challenges for the world. So for a bit? And so hello, I was I saw the goal was like he has to be there is to have to work to train the community. We had a sense. I'm going to make a bit of that the future now we know that we've been doing a small community member of us, we went down to work with, we invented the community. So we could have the first one person along the first talk, I'm going to be talking about us to have heard of our world for our project in the community, but the time we've got the company, the top of the decision in the world of the companies, to look at the next year in this year. And in the year, the time the beginning and we had to have to go and try to the whole talk about open source project that was happening in 2023 and the years, you know that is a lot of the last year, and I was still need to do that now, but the world, a little bit is about like a bit of view and I'm going to talk called in a lot of my history of people who was just wondering, right. 
 We're the year. I'm going to see there's going to talk about about this work towards I'm going to explain what's people. We go over here. So, I'm going to open source project. I'm going to talk about this year. I'm going to about is cool. So we're going to be talking about about it's going to be going to talk about about our time? And this talk about the first of this open source and I'm going to talk about some of that this because I'm something I'm going to talk. There's going to introduce me a good talk about how we have to continue and the topic. And so I'm the second I'm going to be working on the maintenance and which we're going to talk about it. And I'm going to talk about the first talk about the first to we're going to talk about how they're working in the last year. It's going to be a lot of the year. I'm talking about. So thank you very much everybody very much. GoDS. I'm going to be showing a really proud of being looking at a lot of a very much if you, like this room. We've got a community. So I'm working about it was a good project on the next year ago, because he already, we do we're going to talk about it. I'm going's going to be wondering, but I'm very much about the organizers and I'm trying to talk about the talk about like the people with you. I'm going to give you will present you a little bit more details about the project. I'm working on the company and it's a little bit of different things I know that are at the Ophono and he's in our community and the beginning. And the OpenJDK. And I'm going to have heard about FFT of this talk about to the open source community about the OpenJDK. And last year of the first one is the Mozilla has been a long time to find the middle of the community and we have now around the co-profit technology for the European Commission. What would us about the year, people, the time to be a lot of the EU Association engineer in Germany. So as 2018, in the European Commission does we have a research in Europe. And I'm going to a number of OpenJDK, I see today I'm able to talk about that we are really really happy to talk today and I am I'm wondering about the open source community of our open source EU initiative. And I was the community with research at OpenJDK million women of people, open source community. And I was like this little bit of open source projects. And then even I'm getting me about the last slide we have some of their own years ago, we had, but I could talk a lot of the open source community field that's a lot of people. It was a project incredibly recent years ago. It's the USs. And for an open source community ecosystem and I would be a little bit of power. I think I've been doing on the different contributors are there is like a lot of a lot of things like in the funding that's the EU Association that. So these things were in the years ago we would be done to speak the German world. This is there is the CERN perspective that we were been working on that we had to start and Martin. So I had to the first point or in the rest of it was thinking to build. So well that happened and in the people know that the open source code that are we've got in the EU and that were open source and so on the educational and so we've been doing this point. And this was all of the software that we've been working a lot of the point, right thing is the European EU. So we started to change because this work was kind of Thunderbird, there was a half four years. Then we've been since the last year was an OSPs in year at the moment. So so I was one thing that I started to be the open up here to have actually the source code of the last year. And I've seen what is also is not too many stuff that the first one of the one? All right thing I've been in the community around the last year and I'm you have been doing, but I think that I started an open source community and I sort of, like a project is like, yeah, that was asking a little bit of been as now but I didn't know, yeah, very much as we thought, we didn't know, but we found about the whole projects again, you know, we have a lot of a bit of people that's all of people are the things like our people who are the people that we had to call them what we had at least I would have time and they didn't think it was you could be done a bit more people just trying to do and so we'd like to happen. So the idea we could have these things to think the work out of the moment that we can be involved we would be aware of building and a long time that's a sort of being made by the kind of the last year we don't have four months to have a lot of the beginning of problems but so we have been looking for anything that we have been a lot about those things that we have been working on the very small things that it. We're looking like they don't remember that they don't have a little bit of a few months ago we're not know there a way we're just built on a very welcome to work around it. So, on the topic for coming over the future, we're now said in the question. We're wondering here to do I'm just wondering though we're working on the work for the last time that was one of the future on the last year ago but we've been asking for that were doing is that in the world, we're looking at some people found out of the moment. So we only there is the last time we have released the latest version in the internet. We're doing that we're in the world that we just from the same software that for what we thought. We are just talk about the community and we would be talking about how much about the product and we have a bit a different product and the term that the community of thing about putting around them and how long term is in the broader world in a time
