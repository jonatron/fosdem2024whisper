 So we are using the backend? So our, we have some, we will try to get on. So, if we've got the next part, the most of Mambo with native test case, when we have many applications, not really we have a use to be used to do it in-side in open a lot of things that we can create to be a similar to that we had an IDP of the JID. So we had a kind of kind of that we would like to add this. There's a simple kind of an IDs, but we can get into a new description to a bunch of stuff what we'd like to do that, right? So what we have with different versions that we are we want to have a tool called ABI. So we've got a lot of things that can do we've done doing and we could have a lot more of the actual NICS and that we have a lot of different features that are very useful for that are the tools that are so we created and we can take a lot of other things. Now all the are, so are a point for this is, we can solve the compiler or less than the most important thing that you know all the first have to get a simplified branch of these steps to that are. So if you can be the same things are calling the slide because you can be any other value. So that you need to enable, then you can be able to implement a function looks like a new function that you need to have is how that we have it's actually there's in the address you can process application in the reference system. So I'm going to look at least I'm going to know if you can just saying the UI. So you can be using Nixs right now is executed on your application, we need to have to have your server to be able to connect to configure the network, but if the client. We'll be able to the one and check everything that the client's the server over the server. From the server, then the server is not the server, I want to do not on the server, the server, and it's about the server. So more, the server is an IPA server I'm going to back end user store. So I have before, now I'm not going to start this in the server, I'm going to download the server and when you have access to be done open. So this laptop. I have your server. And this platform, you're going to get new server server, it's going to open to show you are like that stuff that. You all the next. And the server does something you. You can be doing it's all that's the other. But what we can you have like that it. You can look, kind of your server, you that I think that's not what I think also have a user? So the server is it's what, it's going to it. You can the server, the server is running server, you have a client it's using the client in your server and it's going back to work in a client from that's so that we are going to a client's going to live client services to do in the server. I'm just going to get's going to provide a server. And so that's going to work to have a server for the server. We have the server to deploy room to user via. We have a client server because we have this part to be running the server for for the server. It's a server, just very easy to call a session and Docker server. Let's encrypted server and this on the server using it's actually allows us a server. In this server, we have this. We need to do a server side. Okay, one. And for the way, the server and the client. We use here. No, yes, no. We have the server. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you.

 Hello everybody. My question. Hi everyone. My name I'm from My name is I'm a talk a workshop and Kareni and I'm going to present the one year on. I'm a talk I'm talking about the first introduction. I'm a little bit of the name of Wazad for the one of the talk. I'm only a few years. We have two years to talk about the first. So the first half and I'm going to talk about. Yeah, the last one of Mox to talk about the last year in the last five years ago. And Mike. And the 30 years ago. And while I'm going to talk a little bit. And I'm going to try to talk about the microphone. I'm going to talk about the year, I'm the workshop, I'm going to start a little bit about the end of the world. The Next, we're the first talk, which is very happy to talk's going to about RGL with the past hours. This is about the middle of the European Commission work in OpenJDOL. So this year. And I'm going to introduce the general of the beginning part of the University of the next year. I'm a few weeks. It was the time to my PhD. And. I'm here, it's a lot of the Drupal Association has had one of, which is the open source project of students. Great. So I'm just been the European Commission is Mozilla source perspective about the first. We have been published on the Dora is a huge and that we have been working on the first thing that the rest of the European Commission, so that we have been talked about the European Commission. And I think that we want to see what are going to go to be doing that we've been doing. We have been part of them. So that was an idea. And I'm just wanted to come from the audience to find the main day in the European institutions. And it's going to engage in a power workshops. And here is I'm very quickly was going to be trying to have a warm welcome to talk to talk about the team. So I'm going to do we have been that we use the University of our community, I haven't know, we have been sure that we have been having the knowledge in that we've got on where we're going to have to try to do a few months ago. So, for the EU community is all really a lot of people. And even more difficult to have a similar part of companies who is that are having much a long time as well and we'll get like that we have been going to be in our own tech, all the moment. And the European Commission, to be done. It's the parliament made at the directive we're about the possibility to have to make the European Commission or legislation. So first one of what we have we want to do is if we're going to go to work. You're using all the world, but I just introducing a lot of the sector to keep the world right way to do you've been doing the second one of that we have seen a little bit of us, we have problems that we're worried about protecting legislation. And that we have a lot of legislation that we're just trying to be able to share our company that's a general impact. I'm kind of American, which we're talking about it. In June a US and we've been working together incredibly happy by the world, we have a thousand organizations on the educational part of open source world also some open source and the community has been doing and we're part of the European Commission will be open source projects that has been in open source community of the world, what is done is that the railway projects are quite a lot of open source platform and we have been asked to have a lot of good open source projects that we want to think about to make a large projects in a project on community and we've been doing those community and in a very open source policy and to work in the co-one skills that the first aspect of the technology and so open science. But I've been open source project that's incredibly important to them. Specifications are a sustainability and it's in these scientific software as a product community could open source community as long time to understand if we're not having a hard to do that also do this work in the world, but we have this time. So we've done this is the moment. This is the current world of the DAGs are
