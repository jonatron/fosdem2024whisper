 Hi everybody. I'm Gabriel. He will let me introduce Benjamin. I am a DOSTN, Paul He will present with Green Foundation. More about Mozilla Code, Matthandroian. So Red Hat is first introduction at the last year, we have here today, Daniel Security Room, an last year, I do I mostly about the world. So today is the main talk that we today was Martin, where I am I'm a short talk about Open Source Foundation. So I was wondering, but I, especially about the agenda. I'm going on the first of the talk to start the open source Initiative is one of Open&A. And with everybody called OpenBL Foundation-to, the company, which have a company. I'm just wondering. Open Source AMC is a researcher. And I'm also a great open of the only reason of tech. I would talk, but I think we have a little bit about open source platform. So to present I'm going to present to talk as a big talk about VT to use. We recently talking to present from the beginning of this group in Paris, a lot of the first year, and Manuel. We're Daniel 2023. The next year, people about the University of the end of the top of the University of legislation, it's 3D to try to learn how Ophono, we have been doing this year for new institutions between the University of the lead at the first year. So the University of course we found a year, how much what we're coming from the last three years. And during the JFTs and we have to build and I'm going to talk is as I said five years and last year, so on the last year ago, but we did it was saying very close to see all the SWiki software is the software-to-endes. So we did I said we had a few years ago, you know what were using the years ago, let's going to speak about open source code of the most of the company and we have heard about the commission and, the US and the negotiations in the last thing that was one is just released last five years ago, and the Open Services. And these projects in real thing, the EU institutions are aware of the EU world project was that was open source release, but we decided to share back end source world on the European Commission, and they had the last year and also, and knowledge was I was probably had any of the community, but we had a huge term. So I had now the best government and as long time to introduce a number of the big ones and the whole and an open source community and so I was the European EU law, which is 2023, the European Commission, and I had to like the railway, and we were a European companies, the university side to see the main year and I was a little bit about 20 years ago. They can it was a lot of OSPF Foundation. It was just a lot of it was very early EU and then at the goal was the project, on the EU markets were actually had to start to make a good part of Open Source, we had for the digital sovereign Commission, because we had a huge sponsor was working group, and the last year, year. And we had a year last year and then, and then at the last time ago, the largest railway, we had to say, which was to see a bit of me to be able to make time. We started in June two years, more open source as a half years ago, at 323, but still there were like well. Sorry, the European Commission was also four 12 years ago. And that we are supporting last year and there were able to get started in the EU Foundation. And last year, I would make open source projects. We were very glad that we had to discuss on the Commission, but yeah. We knew that we had two years ago, the company, there were very small year we're going to integrate across the same time for a community, oh, but that with our research and of a huge partner. And we've had to think we had to start those young people. And I was wondering, but this was like, yeah, so that are at the panel. They're not not quite like the last year. We're going to tell you to talk about me if they are going to talk about some questions? We're going to go to really excited things there's going to the organizations together to be available on a big staff that can come in the day. If you know about the open source community of the world. So well, when you know, you're going to ask. So this is we have been involved in the European Commission have been doing funding about the first companies, we were doing this well trying to stay around that all these years before. It's the time to be open source software freedom and the open source project managers and we're going to tackle us to get into each month and like an open source product in the IT policy also by the most volunteer directive. So we've also have. And this is a company, within open source product. We've seen in the world, I'm going to the EU Association's going to dojo. Okay, we're going to talk about the best question. So I think it's going to help the first talk. I'm going to a lot of the policy market that we can we've left. I'm going to make something what we're going to talk to be talked about this point, we are going to have a little bit of software. I'm not going to be interested in between the world and the moment to be as someone who are going to solve this problem that I'm going to be going to look like this problem. So I'm saying that the future, I'm going to talk about the only one of the world. We're going to keep a year. So I'm going to talk about that's going to be going to start, what's going to be going to are going to be the last steps about to be going to call this, with this open source code. But we start to run in the original source code in a lot of open source project, we have happened for those organizations. So we have the future, what we've put a lot of our code into our future of people and we're going to tell us are going to find the world to do it and a lot of interest in the product, as a lot of people here really care about the software that was actually what was doing and that. But if you know, I think that? Okay, of the source is that we needed to ask that I'm going to say, so we're going to describe it's at the question in the people and I was going to say that would like it's going to look in. And so we've got it's going to tell the code that, what we can we're going to make the work on. Each time and we've seen. So in now we really think we have one, so we have the new compiler which is we have just going to go ahead and we're going to have to be going on the libraries in. We're going on the code on top of the place. We just a lot of the world. We're planning to be able to start in the code. And then we have a couple of thing we probably all kinds of those things that we've got here. So many inputs together that these things we're going to maintainer we need to do. The community, if you know, you know, you can really know, as many people that you're a kind of people know, but you know that would have one very important to use, there. You know, you know, but if you know, you know, as many ways that much, you know, you have a lot of these ways to get there's a lot of stuff. We can do in the code ahead of you know that, but I'm very, right now, so much as I'm kind of magic thing. All right? But if you know, it's going to do is kind of, all sorts of those things, what is going to do we're just use in this kind of like, like if you know, but, I should have like, so that those things. And then you know, you know, that you know, you know, like, we're going to sort of like, like,. If you know, you know, well, that they're starting to do, here, yeah, that. There's, hey, right, you know, do it's what you know, right, the, I say, right thing about this part of the problem. So as you know, when you know, so, but we have an example, we have a right, right? So, what's how many, is about. We are that do we're going to join us to be doing to do. We want to look at the question, we know, we're going to change? So for us, we are looking into a good, much something that the world, we are, we're going to come back to start, thank you very much all on. So, thank you. Thank you.
