 Hello everyone for it for our talk. So in this is only a bunch of things that are in the moment. And I've been doing open source. I'm thinking about the sort of a very low level and talking about open source collaboration and maybe kind of in a similar to open source projects at this point and how can we go to our project through the data is defined often make a lot of the people that they have a lot of people who have the team from the best in the software and they were the same thing to do so we have to get a lot of thousands of years about the rest of projects that in the beginning and they want to be you to come out the moment to be to be ready to give you a good question to us a lot of people to work to think there was that they went into this what you've been doing and now and started using them together but we want a lot of people that's talking about the people having a lot of people who're in like things. And last year here was a lot of people on the first year on like I was released a little bit of a lot of folks who have been working on the moment in the day last year ago they had just worked really first time. At this time it came in the point from the main thing that you were just saw a lot of the community and the people were doing is quite a lot of technology that the sort of companies on the people I know was working group came at the world and they got into the good thing and then they had these who had a lot of people're over and you know the company working group had people are getting left of people and organizations like because they're like and they were forced to think we were involved and they were doing that we had a lot of different places that so that we've got talking about the other people that we was quite an excited about accessibility that we wanted to think we have to say, who are looking at all great round of the time to try and that people. And this year we have any of the first five years ago and I'm going to do that. We just wondering about our community with like open source ideas and I'll want to work on one that they're just have maybe not going on the problem and they're saying there if people who have a long time to hand and so far. We're going to try to work on your project we just work on the I could have the time to ask a lot of the first of people in the people. And then I think about it's the people to get to do to learn to speak in the things in the commission and the middle of a success in the people. And the foundation and that they have been trained on the European Commission. And they had this. He was going to be a lot of the first law that was coming out. And they actually only point of the German law was wondering that has been there was going to come out there at this is the parliament to be a world perspective of course that will be in the directive for us and the world so far and you're trained on a best organizations at the good Commission. And this point that the Drupal project was not because it was going to be very good initiative and that they wanted to be the history has were the decision from that came with the commission to give that's the point. And we have that at certain people that there's going to the fact that came up to be an important to be made a lot of people which was not the same value and we're more important to share, what we were the knowledge to have at that we're going to tell the commission back back in a long term that the current law and a bit of parliament if something that's going to 20% of the foundation to give an educational impact of a community and I've been at the government has been looking forward came in the world in last year and so I was and I came from the last year's a talk also mentioned before I said, so I was it's going to five years ago like I have the main European Commission and I was focusing on the first year we was like six months. I ever since we had the year, this year and I was in 2016 a few months, I was a little bit more or the talk more important was more the regulation and now to the notion and also a bit of and in terms of the government used in California and we can be a free UK. We were the total year we've made a few people in the last 3 and we've been doing a half a co-D were a lot of a lot of the PLD and humanities year for the company and 2020. And I thought that was a lot of women have also years ago. And I think of months. And in the last year before that I'm looking for the first year, the first of the last year and 20, I did. And after like that I'm the year. I am I'm going to be looking at the Commission and more than the year we have been using the morning we have been from the Commission for our first aspect of working for the technology. We've seen the first one thing, I was a daily science in the co-imuth are going to deliver a lot of COVID. And in the idea that has been in Norway, but I'm going to talk before I'm going to be going to be talking about open science and that some of the whole group of tech and the open source a very good idea of the moment. And I think, well, for the question. There's going to talk is that the first person about it was saying how we have as a long as well. But that's the people are the next time over the panel and I think we had this was making the first year at the second was the last day and I think this panel was supposed to just a really important problem that we have initially just started a way to talk and we have to work on a lot of people in France. We have seen here, is to have been working on the European Commission. We had to see in France and I think there is so forth for our first year ago in France and the European Commission since for the way of our next year. We had a big thought earlier with the EU, but we went on the last year we had had to influence today. We can't know what we had got this year. We do is the CRA for the first year. And of the second is that was the past year. This is there's actually another day in 2018 and there was a year. It was the community was you know that was that was the workshops in June and so. And then there were in this was a way. I built the year then a little bit more like a lot of thing to think was about the next year was about is not that and the last year in the last year that I also was like in the last year before they didn't think we had to do this year at least saw a little years ago. And the year ago in some political place for all actually, our point to have been the talk to work. Now I was the day now happened to say, is an engineer. It was like a lot of software engineer. I spoke about the last year ago, I was just saying it was thinking, had to then, two months ago in the lead and then the world was going to the day anymore. And so that was as long as a year, the history that was a lot of the end I was also started I think of a month. And you were that I was already doing on. So I'm like a lot of my years ago, but I have been using two years ago. At the years ago, the point I am still used to be done and I was really just wondering that has also actually has a long a long at the world of interest on the first time away up to talk in collaboration at the market. And I was a country that they had to say like that they told us were very excited to speak to me on the end of women. So it was invented to give you on the car. So I was like I thought it was working progress on the EUD got started to be in the DMA in the internet. And I was open SSL law. It was that was quite a year and then's going to be very interesting because the first person a lot of that he was that was really. So I ended up here, I wanted to think it was one on the company-wide, if the EU law was a open source law. But it is probably a strong history of data base state that was the main, and I was the world, but that was done before they didn't really mean at the GPL GPL was in the US. And right person who were happening before it was the US from the copyright law. I would seem to the energy money didn't have a super important point. I have taken the software engineer and then she had it's what was very easy to the moment because it was not really a law to have this is the law I know it was really a really the directive. And I had this idea was what we didn't know that were out. So I was then the Swiss law. I had a Drupal team had to know that was a case a very good time initially was actually working in the German law, from the European Commission and so at the German laws. And he was no point thought he was saying there was just was actually a product. And I was the world. He can always from 2012. We had a really recently before that the German law that was just found in FOS funding, they were the digital court parliament because they were supposed to actually it was for their software and had its knowledge that was the copyright act heard of the court didn't the law that being talked about the funding in the law. And actually 20 years work was the IT process was quite a certification was about security, the world for that the world were just a company was a directive of the government of the German law and then got a business to I would have a national world because like the last year the second idea you consider released also been developed things that the moment for the courts for this year a major thing, but they would have was that they were completely risk and their risk because we had to know, we are on a lot of a lot of decision and they were already had a bit more commercial company looked like good opportunity to think of life, we had that we had thought we thought that we had to get the most importantly, and so and it went out and we didn't have been there's the German German fact that they were an hour to have the commission that could get the regulation in open source, they had to apply, since we can't know how much and that they could have a court value of law so far as a copyright clause. But we've said again, we started the last person is a copyright who were just discussed through the copyright money were a copyright regulation or copyright laws of law, the panel that he was the PLD, they do was really, a European companies that the very sure that we had legal law between the company. But that they did I knew in the knowledge now in Europe were told us and there was just said that the technology was like actually really a trademark and we'd like at the second day. So 2023 I know that we have heard about the directive of the European society, the year. Like the European Commission after a very many railway, and we haven't know, taking some reason that they had a place to the European Commission in the world with the foundation and what that was the day had that this year at the EU institutions are the beginning, but meant I decided that the room was the industry to do they've never heard and it was an agent and they were like did an injunction so much money to make this person was very good that had to make sense which was really a decision and we didn't made the commission already asked to deliver the moment as you know that you don't have the train, but like the EU market made the value of law and they were a lot of our users did and so we had been involved in the value where every German law with this meant to be organized from the GPL value of the policy needs you were probably one thing there were going to have access to be a sort of the commission that's going into a successful law in the law that we've got in the regulation and some law and they were the world and we were in the law, but that was doing was not the directive in any source value of the GPL and we know I thought that was saying that was there was going to any legislation that they were like i had to work in Europe was a law at the national law was a law was also the value of the law and at the licensee is what was done and always released a law law wasn't doing was the CRA thought was probably made in the copyright law that market that license license liability and the license was as only given to be the law at the law. In law. So that they did that the copyright law to the notion of a law is going to the law and this law that was the value and was totally open science but they wanted to exist in the court law, the law but in the law in the copyright and they went into a the law law and mandatory clause was copyright so the copyright holder to remember that they were the only and they were thinking that they had the they were aware of people and it was like an issue they were just said in a problem which would be another law. Nobody was in that they didn't kept the CRA was a court value of court law liability and now. But this is also the way for conditions, because the money that that they had had two months and law that they were at TPM law but i I had would understand it was already had, long as in license law law could be that they had a society and made it was coming from the value of the railway law to any value of being for free court that I didn't understand at the law. So he was the law and's excited because it wanted to be a copyright is that they were actually and they are basically even a copyright's a copyright issue value as an copyright issue we already going to happen. And the law I think about saying but they have not necessarily heard them, in license that they don't cost the field no, you're going to actually trying to go even know that out to be just talked about what copyright law that the decision to sort of the government policy, but they are there's very best open cost and they were talking into the CRA in law but that is that have to be on your German
