 Okay. Okay, everyone. And yeah, the reason I'm going to be the end of the first part from the right. And that was the beginning, we would like to pass the code to be able to do it on the browser and the browser. So we have to use the server. So in case, we have to see the server to set here, the server will start with an error. I'm going to take over here. So open a service to send a to the browser for the server, that will not say, we will do. And, for our server. And we have, we need to actually only start to need to pass that. And for instance, we have a log to the server to set the server to get my server server. So now we are here. And then we want to implement our server connection to the server response to the server to the services. So, this's a server a user, we have this. All right. And if you have to do this server on the client and the server. Now, if you have this server client, then you want to configure a TLS client to just change the server that in the server. And. So, my name, as I'm going to create a secret client over to send you need to your server. You want to the user for that means we need to have an operator. So you're going to give a client and to see that server, which is the server and then we want to tell us up. We want to have a server server to go to end right in with those server. We have in the DNS server, mainly want to the server in your server. But if we're going to provide the server and you want to be able to have a server and then we have to have several server request server. So how you are going to do that you going to write an server. Or you're running the server. And now the server. So the server cannot see the server's going to the server stream. Thanks very, I'm going to authenticate to get the client gets the room. ...OL and we've got a server to the server. And we're going to login server and start doing it up. So, okay. Where we have done the key up on our DNS server service server goes to do we're going to the server that is an client server server to work this server is what we have to want to server, what really good? You're going to do, because we want to follow the server for our client with our server, that we have, we want to create the server and we need to call server, and client can just want to pass it, we're going to create these client server, they're more server. And user IDTion server, it's currently going to use it'll get this functionality, let's going to. So when you need to take a side, the server server, you can start the server, there are going to see. We'll see that it's going to hand. Yeah, I'm going to be here. And we have to say this is the client. Okay. It's do your server, the server server, so this user, when you need to do this is the client server that, then we're going to apply to to the browser side or user so what I'll be the server, everything is working. Thank you I'm going to share the server, but this is the server, from a server. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 Okay, who are going to work too. Thank you. So I'm going? So, I'm going to start with a home to be starting to talk we are here. Next? So, I'm going to start working on the client server. I'm going to talk about that's going to talk. So, so the server's going to give this is a name of the server interface of the JNI server of your server and this request, is going to the server, is going to share the server, but this is a server? It should be done in your room. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Okay. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Hello everyone. 
 Okay, thank you. Thank you for our next talk. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for the question. Thank you. 
 Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 So I'm coming here for Red Hat for the talk. I am we are very much for the MDA. I lost a room. We have to talk about your project, but it. We are going to talk to talk about the whole community and thank you very new death room as long time. 
 So let me for the talk, we have thank you for everyone, everybody for the 3D Foundation. So let's focus next year, I'm all, about our own over my name is here, let's talk, and welcome everyone are we are a dev room. We are the presentation. The next speaker is here are coming. Before the speaker Room. We do we are related to have a few years about our talk about a talk about the European Commission in the European Commission, mostly the point today and we have an initiative that open source community. So I was our first hour to talk about Martin and open source projects to Open Science Center and I'm sorry. So let's also wondering. And today we are I am a name of a worldwide security institutions. And I am a very happy to a lot of the first in a few people who we have been integrating our front end first year. I love. And hello everyone. I will encourage everybody for the history to talk for the D Foundation and we have a bit to do the lightning talk to be talking about today I am I gave a bit of a few years on the moment. And it the creator of open source railway infrastructure. And what we joined in what I was the current last slide was important is we ran into the amateur community in this. The Ministry of the first use of the first one of the researchers of the market. I just to present in which is a pivotal year to what I think, to be a lot of open source infrastructure in Germany in the beginning of the same month and being in fact that started. And I am I'm going to talk I started, which she said we? There was going to get to talk about where we had to spend to note on the university. So there are here to a topic out a couple of the commission used to work that's the negotiations who is the things that in the process and I'll just trying into the back to make in the commission and a pathway and a very interesting word. So thank you come to make a very much for some other room. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you morning. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

 Hi, thank you very many folks have to be able to speak with the talk. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. 
 So thanks. We have a couple minutes. I'm now, so thank you first welcome to keep the lightning talk about the first. My name is an open source community, I am we mainly. I'm Simon for a few weeks, I am you for our talk about having a little bit about today. I first talk about the right. And I am also only talk about the next talk about the first year of the early as the most open source and OpenDesk conference. So I would, yeah, okay, from open source project that the world's an early company and also a software tech. So how we are this European Commission. And we need to go for the European Commission who are moving into the end. So what we are looking at the open source energy standards. The parliament and it's exactly the European Commission. The discussion. We need to have seen and software act on the first is a panel of the EU standards and we discussed in the European institutions, we are going to share we are working on the European CRA in the first year, right now. I'm going to have a thousand railway foundation. So if you're trying to be at least to do we have this point. We have some of course we're seeing about at some weeks and if there. Yeah, if we are some people that we have a month to hear the European Commission. We have to have some new value of the EU European areas, about one day in France. And that said it's great in collaboration. But this discussion in our software. So today we are the first one-founder of the OSPU. And I'm going to do we have a lot of the end of things. That's going to have a lot of research and we want to talk about their attention to do, we're interested in a little bit about the European Commission, but in this is about software in France and we've been with the US Institute and so we have heard about the end of this year into the world we had a year. And so that can be much by the Ministry of the US CRA? Like that I'm already had to build group and the European Commission's hoping to be given in many other institutions for us in the European Commission and they had been using a lot of AI and the European countries and our EU and the European Commission and the European Commission is also the EU agency, in the product in 2022 and we really important. And they were all the European Commission had the future in year, really, we had to provide other Union we're going to have created around their methodology that they should be able to have to create a collaboration to have been the European Commission and we have to have some of digital co-based association. So the definition and a national EU Associationary across the European Commission and so they have kind of Europe. I'm going to be a lot of like software. And then they already had to be competitive to do a huge impact in a very, we're currently have the member of our science and we have a topic at a funding to achieve the world. So you can I think about from the EU Commission who are now, who's some really asking a way of the first one of the world of the public sector, the commission makers and so the PLD will be on the big Commission, so we have been talking about companies within the impact from 2021, which did a national and the German economy. And we have we're talking about the science project of open source software. And what we were talking about the end of American society. And we are part of the decision about the EU factories or a public data at the US and the main product institutions of Europe and legislation, we started to provide also in the world. And that the EU Commons. And in the one, the University of the liability makers that we have of the EU institutions need to try to be a world if we're also have a coalition of the same sector to be the overall power science and then we have a member of the beginning of legislation and we have a huge value would also talked about the European standards, and EU institutions of their rights that their Commission in general decision European Commission at the world and we have heard our rights to tackle is there's actually also the science field of the parliament in the EU and then we have been even from the end. So that is, but we had a million research organizations to work on the negotiations, we have not want to be moving towards the model in Norway and we want to see that we have the important and here. And it's another idea of funding so I mean we've had to do that we have to share and, in a European Commission has been for public science, they don't know if they have to be able to tell us to say we're very important for that money here. But the beginning, and the French world they are also part of the world and they're not working to be the world, but it's the first term that the CRA's not understood in the world but they're being used to get used in this law that I think a really important question was to go to talk is the world but we need to a talk about the world, but we're trying to the only two years. So there's what happens in the idea of a little bit more important part of if any other ones over here is something you know that we don't have been doing on the product and there is that we have we have the commission that we've been aware of the commission. We have talked about thinking about that the technical companies in the EU initiative. So at all of the beginning of the things I think that happened there are people, many people so that they don't have to do that we don't know there we have some users who are all have just wanted to their first thing because they said that are the world where I am that have heard about the market world from the commission. So it was from the whole law in the public principle, I said that the world actually the EU decision makers when this law in the government law. And this law, the nature of the term actually was another court was a GPL is the IT directive the decision, but the same policy regulation under the parliament in the copyright laws and they had 2023. And the commission was a court law-in law. So this has just wasn't a law that was not an open source and I was, just a law actually some market world because in law in the reason. So, but I think is you know what the open source law that the software, if we made in the time, a license, when we had these law, we have been in the licensee, the law in this sector government. So and there were also commission said, and everything is a big law in the problem because this legislation of the law has read this way we are not need to you know that the license. So the law only thing, we want to do, you know the Swiss law. They were the law policy said? So we're trying to have to keep building sector, and the value of them. And so that's a GPL law, we just important that
