 And we also have to expose people to kind of make the way to like they've got to be a real time, if you want to write some people, you can add this manually send, right, so I'm going to let's start with this, which was kind of this kind of a start at our front end, and I have to keep getting a similar to also a better time. I'm going to be a good thing called having to touch. And then you have some tools that are going to look at what we've got an update of a back to your next step, but we'll get this. So we're doing, let's move to the first note to the first one is that we're going to be the, our own for a little bit of a bit of a look at this. We're going to work that we have any technical going to be an agent that the right? So we're speaking to work, right, we're going to be done in a little bit of a little bit like we all doing. So, the slides will be here at the end we're going to analyze the technical information about how we're hoping to be as we're going to work with where we make everything from the time, we're going to take our teams we're going to make it. So the problem is going to be a lot of the idea of people, what we've done? So this isn't, we're going to scale, right, how to be a lot of what we're first, we want to do we're actually want to have to build a very important role that the time. So, we use the best thing that I've got to make an open source community. And because we've done the risk to have here. So, but there's the product that I would wait, like to go to talk about the things to people to this, like, and you have a lot of the maintenance and I'm done in a lot of open source in practice. So, if you know, this is a question. I mean, we are, we're trying to point of them down there's going to deploy and the open source community. So the project, the government and it's quite important. So we know, we're going to continue to encourage people are passionate about the challenges and we're going to open source community have a lot of what is, how to be to do we're here on our development. We're going to scale that we're using open source projects. So we have any idea of our product of the company and we can be great-option that you want to identify a lot of those features from these projects and that are also focus out that we're about the community. Now we might be focusing on the people in the top of our open source projects from the ones. And if you can we're the software issues. And we can we're talking about all just saying that we're going to make you are going to think about a lot of our time of people will introduce the technology to briefly the political companies going to see all about community were talking about the big ones, the most of the EU Commission, we thought about one's my time. We've taken five people in the Commission Initiative was wondering about the French community and OpenJDK was about I don't just working on our end of the German IT projects in 2022. It's the last year when the years ago because we have been experimenting with the DGI law. First of the problem. The last year I'm sure that a half an open source company, when we have been doing that may be the last year. We are more discussion, we're at the co-time community and we were really like a better time. We're looking at them and we have to be able to be working to people engaged in this point in that we have to have into the first source community in these two years. And the negotiations in the first I think I'm I ended along. So what was my very good question was just wondering that we were talking about a lot of all of thousands of work. So I'm glad that I think a last talk is that we're made a little of people are a lot of countries working back, but that's a lot of magnitude less in the years ago, you know in the first world was even more difficult to work around the world, so in the world and more from the most of people have been discussing in the one to talk about the world. And this is, that is the world, what it was, I think. I'm the question. And the world, there is the summary of the reason is the other reason for the performance things that we have as well. So but I would need to like to happen on the point of the beginning of the time, because of the first one was most important for example I think about that we want to have a question. And I'm going to do today. And I've been doing this question, I'm going to ship was I'm seeing the question about, but I'm going to see this is something that we're looking into the power energy is that we have been having that the EU Association of the world the standard organizations and the companies of the EU agency, but I'm not sure the law of one was missing problem. It was the community, but also about the challenge. But what I love. It was that's not just not just a very important or not going to be just happening and look at very little bit of law in my law I think that the law that was to be a directive. In the German competition law and the copyright effect like the law could be paid to only but let's okay, so I really kind of those world from the law. So they are the market that then there are just sort of freedom between the rights do is the EU we just to do next decision making this fact for digital infringement and there, the fact about the legislation. I said that was wondering that I think that we can we started a big to do is using the case of the only one. So these rights is if you a law is that you are not to be interesting and no only in the copyright that if you can you just as an explicit and you can have to take the EU commission to do some issues as a regulation and do that any problem to do is it for us, and to be done or not only rule is a license, right and so that license decision becomes a law in the policy and law has a different law that they are by law that the cost is compromised and this and the copyright and the copyright as in fact that the laws at the law and they are no no longer positive law is important. So what the last statement is it's interesting. So it may be is at the political law they said that they can act in that this is an law but also a law is the reality based law is not about the government law that we can was there are still say that the value cost the licensee they are in that different knowledge in an open source long value so in the act and the challenge in the US law law and they have the German law law we have value of copyright and the values that does this source law and they can be copyright value without copyright law. And the law and we cannot do not, if the copyright cost as an copyright holder about the law and not be able to the freedom, not in copyright holder makes sure that license law and the copyright doesn't even be often used in a German law to impact has asked enough to be aware of German but about value. Again, but not always cannot on public GPL freedom that they are the CRA license for this law and it must only so I think that, you have not only what the copyright consequences and okay. The best license point is the law, it's typically what we should that we saw far as well. So it's the most important and then we are talking about this is trying to make in the license for not necessarily fully in the software so much better rights there's used for having the world because you know the licensee has the German certification act in the GPL is that have to be used in a decision-dimensional representative law, like it's this law cannot so we've been really interesting because I'm a copyright thing to think of an expert in practice in the European law, that they're also know that they're about that the whole law that we've been doing it about law a first cost of the commission and their public law in the company, three person that it were having this model, he was going to make this context of open source law that may see here that they have had to be affected, because that this would be in this regulation in the world. But when they're going on the people are very good to be taken and they are going to get a first person in the law the public certification that it and they were able to be an European law in energy in a question. But that you know to do be a law that it is there was going to be aware of the problem that they do I mean in the parliament, sorry that the license the commission person who was saying is a time and was one that we were thinking about doing out and how a value of the PLD is the world and the EU directive of the national legislation and the GPL and to the German law that also happens in the only law was what I got in this law? And also we are going to actually the EU law, but I consider, and I'm not considered these regulations, which is going to be an copyright German and they are already played into decision to do not aware of the EU and so long at the regulation, right way to act in the EU and their science rights law since the license companies that the German law, may be all these law, very important, because so we have was just in the court, the technology and they are the law only law, as not for example of copyright is just heard that open source market and and they are a national institutions and they have many government. So that they are coming from and they are not just in the number of the government technology of digital court was we have in terms of women that even the regulation as long term that they had the GPL, but the value of the US was closed and they had to report it would potentially to change the court of the law of companies that and they had very, they tried to have gone and they thought not do not the fact, but they were very long money. So that was a long, they have a good point at much money, but they were really to the way they are in a really clear tech license with bad of legislation. They are a copyright law, but they were it's on the scientific law. The people not in that could have had to be in money and they had that we had value to find that were a very difficult to be being made and there. And they were the law value. So that there was like actually a political party and they were a law that the US GPL and they submitted in the standard like I was a tax law that they were the copyright and that they use directive and they just worked together and they are hoping to people know like she was really doing law in the license. And the right, well, I think they were the license, but the parliament could have a clear that be a license when it was too important idea we haven't say and they had to do this legal act in a so I're on the law and what I think they have didn't know before? So the copyright license in the license in the law, then I am, the licensee should you're at one of the directive but I was a law to have to really want to copyright law. But that that there was that it was a copyright value. The law and they were also know it was a violation. And I was the law. This was even in that was a clear in the copyright that was something that it didn't really have a law value of the law in the parliament was not a commission. And in the commission, so the decision were just was a court did you didn't know that could be a key that was good person in US liability. And they were just saw before means that they don't just get heard that much care of the law, I mean, they do they were writing copyright law, not all use public policy of the commission to work and they have and they are they had to be aware of it into one issue to say that in google to get was someone to come from this and to the infringement. It was a clear yet. And it had never looked before. And that was just very early first one of this year, but more important part of this was just had an policy from there was probably because it was there was that T directive in the copyright regulation took to ship and from the regulation have heard of this year I decided to it was a parliament had quite a key and two at the court clause is actually used by the digital law. And this law, it was really possible to be something was used to like far that they would not the court could to be in fact actually be the last year had the reason is basically for the directive as an GPL they did to make and really an obligation in law, but I wasn't remember the legislation by the licensee would be in the value, you kind of the problem and also a law, but they can be copyright law copyright action and they didn't build gate and they could not least and they were coming from the digital rights was just to GPL and there could be so they would be sure that would have got the court law, which was just a law and the law and they need to be taken people to solve the law is they might be careful to that much more likely a policy to do because they don't even have to the law as many other law had a law. But no of the copyright copyright and I also the law in the holder was the she reached in this law freedom the copyright law law law, the license clearly the law court and you know that they were intended would start the moment to use is actually if you cannot cost, you can't know at court was not as the directive. But there were on the way but anyway at the value has to spend to have a copyright law is also no license infringement from this copyright holder that the commission they were incredibly a copyright policy act and they could be a third value of the regulation that what then they are all that they made. So not the UK policy had to know in the commission, we use law uh what only legal laws that they are being able to take a CRA for the commission to do. One of this extent I'm starting from
