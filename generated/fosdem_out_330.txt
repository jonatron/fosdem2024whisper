 Hello. I'm sending the laptop. That's going to work. And so the side I'm going to contact us to my home. Yeah. The first name is the first office model of the public and do is the one that I get a little bit of the things that if you want to create and the community will connect to that. There is a seat which will do this in the real world, which is one. I'm just wondering. So let's say, I'm going to share that we're going to give open source code, I'm going to do this to get over here. What we're going to summarize. As I'll talk about the next talk, I'm going to try to talk about this? And I'm going to talk about. We're going to run the project. So it's a great presentation, the first one that I'm a very glad to tell you what we have a process of the whole talk. We're going to be going to try to introduce some kind of a project of like to. We're going to create a language that we're going to keep going to talk about how we're going to share us to show a little bit of a little bit of what is from the code from the next model. And we're going to start with the first of Ruby program, C++ code in a function that is going to build. And that's going to start, why it's the compiler? So this is just a code base code look more. So, the kind of the main stateful code, such a C code and we're going to start going to be looking at the source code we're going to be going to do on the project and the JavaScript. And we're going to really going to be going to be going to going to point is you were going to be going to go to find a little bit of the code and we're going to do things to look a few other code and then we do to go into a few things. I'm going to the next out of the most of that we can be going to go back to continue. And I'm going to figure out to be going to try to start doing the code and see what we'll talk about this, if we are going to keep a kind of the right. Or we're going to happen. So here's going to start going to open source code base the, the C++ code set up doing that I'm going to make this and how we've worked to switch over here. And I'm going to the source code, the CMake, sometimes we've got the people doing, we've got the stack too did we can just see the time-to-friendly stuff. So it's going to add these things and I'm going to the stack in a job. So I'm going to show you're going to talk to have going to be a little bit that I'm going to talk about five minutes. And you're going to talk about the whole talk about this talk about how can is going to go again can do we've built here about the SPDX project in the LLM to have some more of the challenges that I'll come about the building years. So I've got there's going to have a developer for the language tools where people, I'm going to talk about the community. A lot of the first year, when you see that's like the people to say, you start starting to continue and it's going to talk about. So a lot of some of communities, we're looking at what we're going to talk about the idea about the community. So that are going to start a lot of our project and we've got a lot of things that we want to solve a couple of people understand that we have to start a lot of people in a little bit more people in the business. So, no, I've been able to say I think we have a bit of things going to do. But that we are getting out of the last year. So I'm going to speak about the talk to show them. You'll be ready to see for the first. And the last yeary's our first of the first time I'm going to try to talk. So I'm going to show you a little bit of a very interesting. So I'm going to talk about an introduction to talk about this is. I'm going to speak a long-upy has a good talk about the goal that we have to do and we did this talk about going to a lot of all sorts of these different organizations of people are looking at the code in the code. I just like this point they're going to share some of this. So when someone looks like this thing that we have a couple of those really hard and we actually work. And then, for us did you know how to know about, if we produce a really want to do you know the model description of our work as much of decision in the thing. And then you know whether you're going to reuse it's going to make this in a decision. You can be a human. It can. It's just the definition of this is I'm going to work and what you've got in the story that we're going to know, right now going to be doing? And I think I'm going to be just wondering. And I'm going to talk about the question. I'm going to talk on the talk about here. And the first. So I'm going to have to a good idea of the case as fast as an hour for a job over here and all I think that I'm just going to give an open source work. I've seen that you got an FOSTA and then I'm first talk to start with a lot of the end of interest of the knowledge. I'm the foundation, I have a long time and I need the last couple of my stand to do. I'm going to open source in the only, I'm going to start a bit of many people to start the talk about the talk about the community, the focus. Or there were open source and the open source and that's being a few people who are based on the community and she's going to talk about Wikid-s. And so I'm going to talk for us here, it's going to talk about the community in there. I think of a community. And I'm just, so we are open source community engineer at an open roadmap in 2018, almost going to be great product and, and open-to-tools and a lot of open source projects, working on the product. And we are we're not about the main idea of the forum and so the topic there's our people, we're starting with the product science community. And so much everybody are just to be a little bit of five years ago, so that you know about them. We're going to look at FOS and this talk about a software. He's a lot of someone who are very popular community of companies that we can help us. And there are looking at this technology. So, you know, we can't see the European CMSs, you all the biggest ones that is the world. And we run them all the only share, I've been using their next part of all the world. We've got started doing open source community at all that there. And I'm going in the first time, I'm going to take over here to talk about what was a little bit about the time in the project to be open source world of a lot of legal revenue and open source source software to keep you. So the tech companies are very important thing that they're open source communities that are developing. So in the story of you know that the internet is an open source community science, they've been doing that they're going to be very young revenue has really a lot of what you know, the software, but they have heard about a very useful point out at the community saying that you know, and they know that people actually work, and they're like they're really have been surprised to be a bit of the idea of a lot of the source organizations that. And that's where you know there's happening in the world, they work, they're going to get away to go a very strong community. So you. I'm going to say, my name is a lot of a lot of people in the past because of people are trying to come into more people as it really big companies who are going to be there are in the things of the world. And a long as we are a lot of these are going to have our sort of people like the problems for our open source projects that they are trying to share. They're very, the moment and they're starting to make sure there who have something out people said, like people that. But that person that we're here. We've got the kind of the people in the people so if we're moving to ask about starting to help us what they know the people to get their users for you know in the way to really make sure I'm not sure that you, they're trying to do. And the things like, we're doing with these things that they're not really not going to know about this in one person who was thinking about the experience that everybody. It is a personal investment of people that they're looking in. But this little bit of the community's always really there's going to have have the last few other companies who need to have two people at any people that the other things go from the years ago ago. And how they're getting the idea of the project that we'll see. And and we're talking to contribute to see that's just found out of the whole. And we have a researcher who are all the European Commission and in these teams and then in the commission and companies share their public product. From the people in the project and so that they're involved on the EU world, so they're a huge money and they know what they're maintaining and they're, they're good success of you wish to make license they're just sort of the product and they're talking to stay into the compliance. And they have been like they're doing? And they're going to be able to be able to think about the interviews and they don't really want to mean, they're working that people on the Drupal and they're not in time and they're not going to get the third question to focus. And it's going to say let's your market. Most of the people are like I was it's like they're being messed up. The Open Source Foundation should be like they have been the first of the CRA. We're really like a few months are interested in the whole company. Now that's the last year right now the beginning of legislation is basically that a tech people and a new sector for open world. And I'm going to think that there are there's the most important thing that the focus would be a really going to be a lot of the EUs basically the world that can be a software and software and there's happening and there's the panel and a lot and there's many years that other side. And we're developing society came from the first you can help out of the world and we're going to see those decisions that we're trying to come out there. We're trying to maintainers. We have a community making the panel that we're just like we're going to have an open source product or a long term and then find a day to do it. How the challenges on the way to talk is we're working on thinking about the last year we're going to have been doing the goal of the first. So let's how it's say, why we had a bit all of what we don't keep going on some open source community here is trying to mean that the problem that we're going to try to be the world, the community as a big. And I'll hand, we're going to try to be a good to be very much for what we're going to tell us. Our goal. So they're going to do we're going to answer. We're going to look at the project there, in the first time. So we're going to have two people who's going to work in a lot of it's going to talk about exactly the world. We continue the past week, we're going to keep going to come from the people who are going to do have to work out about it. But as a good work for the market. So we're going to have to be able to be really the first balance at least also the room making a few years ago. I think about the thing is the ones too much money at the way to do we've got to bring it for that? How do that about the world. So maybe other parts. It's more people have been working on the whole ones that. We have lots of these days. But we have this talk about the other questions, we have heard about the challenges of these kind of these software in the beginning of the community and we've been spending the community. You know what you know about the community and why I was in the moment. So, we've been working in September, but I started as we can find exactly the people were like, we're using the point. And he had to the world. I've got to work on the world like a good enough. I've seen, he's a large community that. He was even done that. We know, we had a new team. And there were just learned about. I was built to say that came that just I thought that was just wondering that it was the car, and he was quite a world. I also working in the first day world. And then he had to see. And the beginning, this was just the past, there was a community that was actually it was maybe doing that was an open source project became a few months and he started to have been on the license. And since we used it is the project. So they saw, and they were in the first thing, a lot of developers were the job in the project. And they made you know that they have been the commission who had to be a point, and they would. I'd like to give a chance to do that they could be a year you to be on there. So the world, you a really end of that's also had to help of the world about the project. So a few years ago, if you know that there's the world of the University of the first mandate in many of people are the government and you know, they were able to be in the world for people don't know what's the
