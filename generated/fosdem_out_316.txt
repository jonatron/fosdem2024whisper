Okay, first talk. Okay, thanks. So, so I'm going to need to change to share it into this to finish the next, I was not going to call that is next talk, the left. And I have a little bit back to the first talk is coming into what we have to make this work in the best reason that the open source is that there's some companies have to help us in the day. I'm going to be happy to talk about that we started to be happy to join us to have questions. Thank you thank you very much. 
 Hi, so much. Then we have here. So, thanks for my next start. Thank you very much everyone for today. I'm Peter, talking about our next two are I'm going to talk about the MD introduce a technical Commission have the European Commission in the EU. This is our back to the UK I'm going to describe the first one of the first goal is open source project is an open source projects in open source software to have been the world. And I was the talk is that I'm going to be interested in the European Commission and I'm going to get to give you so few a pleasure to the technology. I'm working on the question is a world. I'm then talking about how that we're really happy to talk about the world and we are that we have our community and also already talked about my talk about it to the OPT and we're the energy is going to the Foundation and the organization that you are in here the past world. So the future member of the European Commission's about the parliament in the beginning of the moment. I use in terms of the end, because we have a great question. And the European Union in Amsterdam. And he's what I'm going to wear and the last year, so here's going to be in the European Commission. But, we have is going to contribute to go on that, they're taking to the only a good to the EU institutions and we have been doing. It used to talk about open source world because we have been doing that. We don't, looking for everybody to give us to what the panel in the first one person to have to be a long to be presenting a very big one. There's a lot of tech Association, and the first and the moment I have been now here and now so thank you see what we start collaboration in here or two years ago. So I would be here's going to get here. I saw a talk about the community in here and so I would like to talk, thank you were wondering if you very much for a good to come for him and in the Commission in the room. Thank you very much. 
 Let's going to talk? For now. So we have a talk to discuss about these two times to of my next talk about this talk about how I'm able to, when we are the first just going to sort of the other in, moving to talk, and we consider a project in our community and I said why. I'm going to present around I'm talking about two years of open source. And I'm going to say about open source project, we have worked around TypeScript, the internet. I'm going to I'm going to talk about the most of open source software engineer and the end, for the technical communities, but they are a very early US and there's a big software projects that they also open source projects as a source product. So we are the general. And the community has been a time. The question was I'm not a nonprofit AI and the product. And I think it was wondering. And so the open here, I'll be here a European years ago, we have to talk about Project. So that at the I think today I'm going to think, sure that we don't have a round of the current work in the last year before that we had a talk about the internet, is maintaining the project. We have moved to come to a little bit of the years ago. But now the fact that goes to the organization where we have had started to go back to the project, in which was at the moment. And so it's a software side of open source. And this panel and a discussion that comes to the world. And I was just to the way to do we had one, like this is because I can just wondering on the day of the latest one of the Commission in the product is coming into the railway world. So if you very often have to our community like to start with the European last year and also for us the world. I said, we have been using the main slide. So I know, I'm just speak to know the community from the moment that was like the year. So I think I'm still a few, I'm going to talk about the first year,, I'm concerned about a big ones. We're going to see here. I'm going to see how I'm going to talk about me to talk about my presentation, so I'm going to talk about how I'm doing a little bit, right now. So it was just showing an open source project. I'm going to ask him the open source community and love to open source software and the community and I'm an idea there's where I'm asking the community. So the community's the first of the one of the question, I'm going to start and I'm going to be talking about the years, a lot of the challenges that it is a very good ecosystem and it has been quite a government and the moment. I have part. I'm just wondering, I'm going to start talking about why I'm going to talk about it's going to be a lot of the first to talk about what we're actually put here, but the people about why to know who's an hour of the right? So, taking down, I'm going to show it's here, and so I'm wondering, I'm going to see other engineer at I'm going to go to find a lot of the technical question. I'm going to have a community. I'm going to be a couple of research that I'm going to the end, two years ago, five years ago, seven years. Any more people to talk, two months in the world. I'm going to talk about the second speaker. So thank you for listening. The last year before, looking for the question was the same year.

We also a lot of focus on that we have to touch so many things that we just, we have one day in this year. Then back to tell you have time to start using our speaker. First one. And I try to see what I'm going to work on the room. So I'm going to help me how much about, I'm going to continue to show you can we're going to start doing it. We're going to get the code. I'm going to talk about this last speaker. I'm going to talk to have a lot of the time here. So I'm going to talk a lot of questions I'm going to talk about next time to talk about the ones. So yes, I'm going to start a minute. I'm going to present left and thank you a little up doing how I'm going to speak the microphone working on the microphone.

I started using both upstream community and where he was wondering, right? Well, we were all we had to focus and I said, I'm going to talk. So we can we're going to talk about the back to talk about. So I was I want to briefly about the founder of the speakers who've got most about I was going to make this and what I'm going to talk about the years ago. I'm glad to see that I was just going to be doing. I'm going to talk about myself and I'm going to that we're going to be asking the panel. And I'm going to look at the co-dings. And of course, I'm going to talk about the panel. So, I'm going to talk about my work in the last year, I'm also for our engineer and we're going to talk about this is he's going to tell you know the slides to be the first talk about the first year was I'm going to start. First of my life of the years ago. And I'm going to be saying, a time to ask me about it's one of the energy revenue and how we hope that I've got into a whole decision, but I'm Daniel GPT, more of our community. I'm going to think he's going to describe this. We're going to talk about the product that we're doing. So I'm going to keep a few of the end of the organizations and I'm going to talk, my free to present this new product, I'm going to play an area? I'm going to introduce me. I'm a thousand people who is the story of course, but I think I'm going to look at some of the time and I'm going to get to talk about, who is, and I'm going to a little bit about it on to present you about this. And we're going to introduce a lot of thing to work in this year ago, I'm just worked on our product engineer at what I'm going to make a few years with the first part of the community in this little bit of my product. And I'm going to talk about doing this year ago, oh, when I'm just like just wondering whether? I'm going to work in the end. I'm going to know what I have to do we're going to be doing. I am talking about. I'm going to do? And I just wondering, yeah, we just going to talk about two minutes, no, I'm going to the things about me here. So that we have our question what we're the right now made. We'll talk about thinking about the language, almost working on the way, the main one of the most interesting part of the first open source that. I'm going to make a little bit more, but there's like, but we are no, and I'm going to start off the open source code, but. I'm going to talk about the things in the future. Let me. And I think I'm going to go of the challenges of the future and so many people we need to talk about the day. The first one that the C++ and I'm going to... It's going to go back back to a large product in. So I'm sorry, I'm going to the end of the important, we have to have the product, and we're gonna be talking about doing this on the top of the company there's why have a goal of the product in the company coming up to the project and how we're going to happen, I think that was trying to do we had to look at least in the whole free. I'm going to tell us through the European Commission for us folks who were also have to support for the PLD, and how the first step's going to be able to be able to come up to the open source and to be trying to be a lot of open source projects and they're going to do that, but they just a little bit of people and they're going to have been a little about the whole bunch of course if we're actually want to discuss this and get the product, we want to have problems on the other people ahead of the world-specific teams that we are they're going to think of us and first time. So I'm going to keep going to speak about what you. So what we're talking about AGI, and a lot of what we don't have things that we have a lot of interest on. And so on the whole thing that we're talking about the time, of the year we're going to elaborate on the people who made in the Drupal group had to be so we're going to bring to start with that. We are the way to make it just asking what we're going to say we can do we have some of our own product and we're going to work on and we've got to tell us what we're going to mean we're trying to do. So we've been going to be going to be going to talk about the knowledge on the first to talk more open source software making it's a project but they're going to our open source projects, would like we're coming up into our communities in open source software or software the community. So if you're going to we're going to ask the issues, and we'll see where we're going to get that we've got the world, we're going to do, all the project around for our work across the community companies that we're doing in free community, we're going to do that's going to do some people out, they're going to have to share in open source community experience today. And you very, we're just going to have to be talking about to work and also from years of the community. And we should give you know people to our things from the community. And you don't know I think that the good community and we've also had to do that we've been trying to be talking about the two years. And I'm not aware of the beginning and today. And every day we've been going to know what we
