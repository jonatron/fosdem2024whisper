 So now the second version, when it is a first, we're looking for my project, in a grid, how that's how, which is actually a value that you get to know, but I mean, I've worked on the beginning of the side. And I was going to me. And then, if you just saw the world. So what happens, we all the community made before we need to be using the conference and we have these things that we have to happen in particular job, we're trying to do this with all of our mission. And we have our future, we've not that we have of these work in the beginning of our community that we have been doing our community that is for our tools. I'm going to work on. And then I'm going to talk about and we're going to try to talk about coding communities that way to have some of the developer. So we're going to talk about how we're going to find the end your community to share our project. It's a project more about sustainability. So last one before I'm going to be a little bit so fast to like to contribute. And I'm going to say about the fact that the first talk about the question was the community of the best of the main building and they are going to do about who have been doing this. And we're going to see the challenges and we're going to give you a talk about this world as some of the mission was the people who needs to be back to be done. And I started, why I think that you're going to be about if I personally heard about things like a lot of the way to focus on, these projects and we took for much time for the way. So I'm saying, you didn't think the problems, I think it was not, but it's like, but more much time. That's a good way. But I didn't think about this is it's really important to take into the work. But I like, to make me to work, right now. And this is this is a long time. It's about what I think it. And the question. And this, I think, if I said, you're here, right? It's too. It's like good to, but I think there's a lot of this time, and this is a lot of, which is only we have to have a lot of different open source code base. Obviously the people who is generally want to keep the product. 
 So, we have a lot of how we don't have plenty of those in the different technologies. But there are something that are the time to look at the end of these projects and the community was just using the time and the community. We are the end of the community that we are only a community. And if we did this from the we're building community and we are doing are not just open source community for everybody, we made a little bit, so we have a long experience, you know, and we also have several people like the product and this is the big quality of the same for us, but I think we have heard about the first one of our software organizations to say, I don't know the biggest open source is the moment, we have this policy, a lot more money that we're ready to be really know whether the project, but the last thing that we're going to happen in the community. And we're going to do I'm going to show that, there are trying to be an extra questions, as a cost in the community, we're going to make it's going to think the software in the product, the world, in the code, we're going to ask a time for that they're going to do a solution in a look at the world. And so these money to finish our future, how much. So what we're looking? If you're going to keep running people, you're going to work with us, what we're going to do we have a thought, if you're very often kind of people, we're going to think that, I'm going to be saying, please have to make the market in general, we're going to stop doing that. So to be wondering, how to focus up a lot of the definition of contributors around to be a lot of work for that people who have some of like we probably say that, we discovered is going to know in particular nature of the software managers. And also know, there is kind of things and we have this thing out of skill work that we have to keep there. We got funding every product who want to share and their life or we also a lot of the resources that we want to do need to make sure that all when we're talking about we need to go to do this for it comes to us that way to go into our infrastructure in the users that means that isn't what people who have had been done so much work on this. And yeah, right, I also for most of this is if we're trying to work on software engineering software or not just looking at this talk is actually want to do, and it. And but in the software with this is. And as I think I'm just kind of being great over time to the issues that back to work. I really what I think is a really important that I think was looking at the best time. It's kind of people are I mean, because I think I know I think we're looking forward to think, yeah, we're going to be able to be seen the ones. So we're going to come up to this is going to get the main project that we're trying to have a third source code that we're going to accept the community and we're going to be able to be like to be as a good. And last but I think we are we're going to give me and we can try to be able to focus on that we have started out of the open source code and keep in this, but we're going to try to be in the source was to keep a lot of the case. We've used to work to change the projects to focus on the project that all the most important question was we're going to think at our documentation, thank you're the question. We're going to help us. So we're going to be interested in the first time and I'm going to go back, so much very much. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks yet. Thank us.
