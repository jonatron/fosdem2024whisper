 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for OpenAI we welcome everybody everyone. Thank you. Thank you for everyone. Thank you first I am, OpenAI and I am running for developers. Thank you very much for being a talk about the FOS engineer around the year. Okay. Thanks back. Thank you very much. My name of the University of the largest Code toolkit. My name is what I'm I am I work for the FSF for the open source protocol to have been doing? I am I'm going to be on the talk about the agenda. He has been in this talk. I am, like here since I was a time at the same time I was released a topic of the end of the community. And I have the last year I'm an co-time, I amateurs of an industry Foundation and in 2019. And we've been a lot of OpenJDK in France. And then I'm wondering that Open-source project at the project, a number of software engineer and I was somewhat 100 years, very important and we have been doing this year, but I'm going to bring me in the OpenJDTT and the history of women it. And I ended up and I was able to get the last year I was a tech, you to build here. I think, I just in the future, nobody wrote my company and he was really was that I was mostly in there were very last year and we had the years ago. I knew who were just just wondering the moment which year. You're going to also the end of he was going to get this year and they did going to back to spend a little bit of a number of 20 years and he had to just going to go back. I was wondering that went at the last year. It was an end of the company released a very quick experience. It was wondering. It was a lot of these companies like, but I don't know that we're all the moment-ogs, where he was a couple of where they were a bit controversial part. And they decided that they did been doing as their journey which is a reason why he's, just a little bit more confident. And I can I forgot to do see in the answer, how to the talk about the original 20 years. And I went to, but when the fact, how do I know, I found a lot of the I think this working together. But the first step was, but I'm looking at the project. But I'm thinking about it's the future. I'm totally seen a lot of them, what I'm the code and the whole thing that you think we have been just say like this is as the same thing that you're going to speak about the code that people's an people who are doing this kind of the code. And it's worth writing software is also I start to write a website. I mean by the community. And anyway, you can. And you have the idea that is, maybe maybe if you would get to make that. And I think we have to get to know, I mean, if you know, if you have a minute. So you know, I will have the last time to do I'm very small time. And you know, you know my question there's going to work. I'm part of using the one of the question. Much for example of your best aspect of the most of the things that I showed up, but this was I don't like I mean, probably a couple you can go back to a developer, I think this slide. I can we say? Right, yes, I'm going to ask me how do the front end, but I'm going to do I've been doing. No, but I just felt like the audience. I'm just wanted to present a little bit more details of the open source code, right? Okay, so I'm not going to do you could just throw a feature, but I'm not sure of them. I'm working on, I'm wondering. So, for the, you could talk to the right? The question was the question is the question that we need to do it. So for the most important thing I'm going to work, we are going to start the... I'm going to be the question, and I didn't saying, but I don't have to know what we put an open source function that, but it, if you know, you're going to have to be the memory. So you can, it's the idea. So this is in this is that's a result in the first one, I mean the open source code. That's one of the question that I think about the whole for the most important thing that they can is done on. I don't know, and the question was this is kind of the future. I think, like we are a hard to do, but you know, but this case I know, you can we've heard about talking about the best term, like that. And this is the next part of this was just the developer, to know, the library that you know that they take care about. So this is just interesting and then they are a tool that the right? Well, you're just mentioned, they're kind of in the problem. So essentially made a question, these are almost the most common version of the only one more but also the language called Z80 that are all the main thing that I'm not the right now. So this is what I'm going to play the past, but the end of the C++ stack. I'm going to talk was just wondering if I'm going to talk about C code before those are going to see. I'm not familiar to start to. So I'm going to do I'm going to do this state, I can I'm going to show my next time. Let's going to do you should be a bit more details. So, why I'm going to get some of the standard because I'm going to do we have the best
