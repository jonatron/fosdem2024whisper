 Thank you everybody afternoon everyone. Thank you. So the audience here. We have Simon the co-shirt from his talk Welcome to the My name I'm a lightning talk about the hello we work in our presentation, the first talk about the first. You have a very much. I've been a different talk about the introduction to VLC. So today. I'm to the chat to we can talk about the next talk about the open source app foundation. I'm going to an open source process of course. He has a little project. So I'm going to talk, I'm an open source project. In the main talk is. And hello everyone called RERN is a very amazing project called Scratch. As you to he is a technical talk for everybody in the EU. And I was trying to be the PLD. The last year's yours. We have about the first, at the amateur project called Open Services. I think we have an last year we are looking at the last days in the last year. It's the European Commission and now the open source project of the last year. And I'm not very excited about the point of the community. It was on legislation. We've been looking to mention for there was very beginning, but he has a bit more first impression about the first year. And I had to have been to be wondering about the Cyber Resined a year we decided to have a good audience in the introduction of the world of the years ago and since the funding as a couple of the beginning of months ago, but on a bunch of the Netherlands, we built and we can't have to get more in the year ago to present on open source software under the software. We have a new tech companies we have a problem where we have. We can we've looked at the data and they're in in the moment that we've been able to focus for one year. We have the community and then moved to be able to the best year. So there were just a long time that it was something of us from many people were a very similar. And the last year we've got this was wondering that I was another year that we had been at this was like I started to just going about the last year now and the two years ago and a member of the year before now the last year at the year, is he had to have a last year. And they were the one year, okay, but the lastly and we'd also had to work on the last year ago. So when we couldn't know that what we try to continue about the time at the first we used at the time that time we had a year. And now we have been doing that was a lot of what you see. So the first one that we started explaining our year and we wanted to get back to open source code on the years ago and we did the project and we had this was really, so much as we had a lot of the software that was actually has been doing and therefore and this year that I was the work with some kind of the slide because we were doing a lot of a little bit of we shouldn't know why were doing the year that I was actually had worked on was going here. I knew at the discussion about 80s being been able to actually something like a few months ago and like I was trying to do that were working with the tech here. And he came up our people wrote it also was good question was a lot of a little bit about the community and I didn't know that we looked at that was doing was showing the previous talk. Well, but now we just really know what they thought the way it was the first here. But the year that I can I was a very loud thing. And I can we could I was to look at the first focus on the future. And we had a little bit of software. Who will be a talk was just started, a... So what, so I was just going to do I had a couple of the current project was the community when you know if someone was the CRA and he had as well, like that I got a little bit of the latest tech came up towards that he was actually was getting was just doing a number of the whole opportunity to go into like every year. In the commission. It was really. That was in the beginning of the EU. They have the first time because they were the year, the moment, and they were paid a really been the business sector developed since he made in the first step was doing. he had been in 2018, about the year to the only to have done by the EU. And I wasm from the world called the technical discussion that was trying to an engineer I found out the freedom of EU and the digital law. So what I ended up, we had a few years ago. And why I said, what I've been in the moment, really nice problem I was even I'm here. And it was no, I came I was the first six months ago, we had a bit more and he had to spend one of the first. We had it was to be going to get in this to be able to give a lot of that people who has been using the point for us a policy in the policies. And then we've made the first one of the market, but again, and I would seem to help us to be at the rights and then we did some some legislation because I ran around 20 years and as I wanted to get the beginning of the panel came in the main society of the other public sector in years to have created was a bit of the law and I introduced the German value and where they've had had because they ended up to do it. So basically a nice thing that was the money were quite interesting to follow people in the PLD has had a few years ago in the value was going to the parliament. So that in the same way to go too well, they were starting both for the legal is just had to worry about it was in the funding for a research to be another in a few years ago in academia and they had to give a year. And what he had a couple of the world. So we had started on was a bit of months of the previous one of the first one years ago, so that were about what they got an open source thing there were the industry project in September and they had quite interesting to stop a year. And that was an act we got had to present both before. They had to do was getting in 2018, but he was that was wondering that the next company was, basically their company at EU Association engineer back at the US association had to the American Commission. And this so still has already to get the first time to the way to actually said that we had had before to ship in the foundation. And it was pretty no, but we had asked about that was showing a few years was looking for years, it was to contribute to make a few years before that that was very, and I started doing that was just is not great of the big stories, so the question was what was given the last year, that was, the left. And they worked there was there was actually was only like people had also just really just because it was the parliament out of things that the reasons here. It was always a successful. And they would always done in and like the industry license was the beginning and they were able to get it was like like at the world and that we released I had to work very excited to fix quite a lot of us and they talked about it in open source projects for us to really didn't have done before a good news was on the industry on the goal on the last sentence that were getting up the parliament had funding, so the rest of a few years ago was meant to have got a day because we just asked to do have been saying to do that the next year, but I think that just did I like you think it didn't think's a lot of what I think that and the open source software to do it. That's something that we had to do, really do this in our code were having a lot of the reason, but then have to build, but that people to go ahead of these types of the ones that they got into the kind of, they got another thing that you got started. So they were, which was interesting person that the first one was someone I made a fishbowl money and I went and they had a big years but they were the idea and they were going to be talking about someone who knows that were to do, but they were doing a lot of how we had before they were doing and they don't really need not really going to make the companies were at least that there, you know the other you know what we had a little bit more people going on the end of the people from the car, depending on these of their interviews who get into the people to do was using the left? So if they're going and they were going on the first version of the way they didn't have an issue number that the source they've got the day, or they're just came to think they're going these kind of places and the company who's actually at having a five, but they still had thought then. They had to do the two months ago, so there were more people away here's this point. They're there was the only one big time, which was I really kind of these people at it's say to do we were in terms of discussions, and then the companies really been there were the world. And we've heard this point because I think that was no reason that had at the world. And the years ago, like it was kind of the people who were having thought we've been doing today we don't do that they didn't need that because they got to. They would like could get the project. And they're saying that there was done was very definitely done in the beginning. So that's the whole website. So we've got a user space. I think I've been a few months ago for that's another one of the left because we didn't think that's not going to be really know why they were doing. And that the first thing we're going to do and all these guys had something. And we got our career and thought we have been creating a tool. We've worked on the build towards the developer that was like this project is the first, but I did we used to get this stuff and I was really tried to get that we can't know what we had the next year into the other people. So a long did we skipped in the I didn't know, which was going to get the project. I guess we did is going to do have to try to do it, which was going to try and we should happen. We get us remember other people. So I said we've now is very often looking at the reasons. But you were asking people are the future. They're talking about you to change what we did is allowed to join us at the whole steps at the way as a lot of what we think we saw is we did we don't say there. So just talked to match the whole point is that's it was the server. It was the slides that was the documentation was the whole example of the software. And so we know what we had a good companies have been doing was we had last six months. But something we're going to build, we thought we continue talking about the people who got our teams kind of those legal software but we're trying to be trying to have been selling it. We are like they had to solve that, that we're not going to create the people to see how we've taken into the people who are doing the people, but we had to do there's trying to really important to throw that I think that in the important. So I think the work are of the idea. And we ship was we have. But we've just hoping that our slides, what the panel, but we have some sort of the children in years, the team can we're going to say I've in the people in the last year. And so this was funding in the public sector was going to talk was about the best and the room. And last year of the time, our discussion about the community was because we had to do we have a community in the time. We did we're the conversation at the first one of the speakers to be aware of time we've been since every year already had all of what was being said, we talk better at the big women in the open source software is very much even though, right now I just doing with the public software law, community, that society, I think the world, the world or in the government licenses. And so we're going to make a bit. But what we're going to this question, the way we're going to do we're going to give us to the
