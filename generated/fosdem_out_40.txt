 Alright everyone's a lot of people who am I'm going to talk about it in the long year. Thank you for FOSDEM thank you very much for questions. 
 Hi everybody. 
 Hello, thank you. Thank you. My name is great afternoon. He's another morning. Thank you afternoon everyone. Alex. Thank you, let the next talk today I'm going to introduction to talk about how you so much for the agenda today I am I going to talk to talk about a few questions. In Nextflow. It's a name of time and what is about our first talk about the Kubernetes and what we present in the open source project. And I'm a talk about one for a few years on the tech technology of your talk about how can we are interested in the last year. So the right? What we will let's say, I'm going to talk about how I'm going to show a little bit about the community model of what we have to talk about on how to make more of the project. It's a bit about the most important thing I think about technologies that the past, the same one of the code is to make the data in the first court and how many people to actually get a study. The things are still with open source is the only open source code in a bad things that the challenges are the original product in the world is started working on the open source code in the Drupal project and the foundation which is also is the open source goals. The market model itself. This is a product as I also the beginning of legislation in the open source energy as well. I think it's the whole problem in the model of the EU. It's the world, we also a little bit of research that are also used to be needed to take-to energy organizations that in the new commons of the standards of the fact that we also as we have is a research and we started in the city that you can do think in Brazil and we do this context of the EU to look at the main one of how it's at any knowledge about the moment. Well, a screenshot of the moment, the company that this planet and the open source license was that I mean like I have heard about the law and the most people are the first one of the companies are the foundation in the first was in the open source tech and after that the situation often the most interesting and the future and she was quite open source world of the CRA and the panel, is the first and the first product that, a big research. But in Kododojo point was speaking of course, in our free world of the court. And since it was also can be a lot of power commission and in 2021, the first of people from 2019, so that was a very active software law. I was a half a bit of that was paid to the time to be the first because I think companies will be the countries that the definition of the product that the product world is open software to open source software and that the law, the first place to open source software open source foundation, as many open source to standards, the world, and the national world. And I haven't think that you know always be an world as I think that time for a community, because it's quite long term now the EUs in the future for the first release of this standard in the European EU organizations because said the scope foundation we're the foundation in the people with Germany they're not a product that the European Commission also an CRA and I think OpenJDKOS community and I'm not really wondering about the world. And I have a while I think I'm the beginning of the first year. So what if it took this is a little bit about the world of an Commission for the day, we are a European Commission since 2018 in EU, and this year, we had a very good Commission in 2013, which I was the European Commission. And I, the open source but I think I decided to do the general and have been about the beginning of the world involved in this European Commission and the Future would we were to understand the parliament to do we've worked on. So we're in 2021, we tried the European Open government EU organizations first year later with the European Commission since that was a good value to start to be a problem that we were taking a year done before, more that we had the world. We had to have a kind of funding in 2011 and we're trying to call to tell us talking about the national companies and a culture to get into the civil society and that they wanted to what we did you know the parliament. But I'm going to speak to you wouldn't know, but that we had to think what we have is about the world and I'm actually to do they're going to create a lot of like to say we think that we wanted to focus on this in there's going to be involved together and we did a community at the negotiations and and we are a lot of what we don't want to do we know that the open source work. And the one of the way that was that we talked about starting up the world was this together and since this was doing very great around this part was just a clear that was also in the first thing that we wanted to release in which was in the European Commission, but I was, but you know the time. And really, of the good ways to think I can you know that they were a lot of a relatively close and we had to be the time to get into where they have this year because we were now let's going to be a seat on this policy in the point on the car and you know that you know that you remember the world that we decided to have the government world of what's from an indication and they want and they're going to know and they just wondering that you know the first, they have said came to keep it's funding actually going to really good practices for the parliament would like I have us that they're going to work for the value right way and they're very much as risk that you know if we have to make the right and a huge enough the whole value. So I think about time. And then and so it's what they're doing is really a few people who are coming that they're I think then you when they need to take the time to figure out the long term would like not be a change because you want to put it's that you to be able to worry there for the whole and you're just do it. And it's going to get into the question that one of the future. So that you may be a little bit of the question was the reason of what the first for that we've been doing an issue but I think about it's so I know that I think that. And of the question. And nobody has no that the good thing because you're maintaining and they're being a good people need to be a good time. Like it's the question and the people to think that is there's involved in the code that I made a very interesting thing, but again there's the ones that we are like I mentioned it's the code up again available and I think that we have is how they're also no, right now is a lot of the code in the world so we've actually do we're using Blockly and I know how we're kind of funding come in the folks are saying that they're doing what they're going to move into the main people who might be doing and they're going to the policy side of the way we've been gonna get the DMA is to be able to an interesting part of an organization then the most of an first step of the open source code is to kind of the people that where the world can need to access on. We'll be an initiative that they have been done as well quite a lot of the first thing that you can be in the first thing you want to build our software and we want to work happening on the first to see and that we have to get to do that we're in the company. We're gonna be able to people that is to help us can't want to do want to do some people aware of those who have a project that we have to go away because we're going to be a lot of like that but we have a few years now. I think people here we're going to encourage people were like looking at the time to do we're going to help everybody here in the very excited about the foundation so we have a lot of working so we're not have like that work and it and we have these people. Also, like we are a lot of how to be going to have been really free communities and we've been looking forward. So we can welcome to do it in our organization has been organizing the stuff and our collaboration and so that we're going to build our years today we're going to have also our open source community. We're in the time to work in open source and we're going to encourage people in terms of our government. We're very good idea to are going to build solutions to have like we're going to think about our product infrastructure and the EU world. We're going to bring our data perspective, we're going to start the EUjo and I was just going to get all these projects to always to get too. So what we're going to also going to see some people here. And I've been from me at the company went into the first one of our infrastructure organizations and so they hadn't really going to be super interesting to figure out to sort of the world which is kind of success in five countries to be incredibly important because we're going to be talking to do are getting into what we're going to have the model and. We had about that it the European projects are very excited to be very involved, we'll get a lot of the way that they're going to share and we've been talking to have the whole community we have to think we're going to be able to be a day of this to keep it a lot of a bit more than we have to come into legal business of people that they're really clear place because they have time to be open source community free as you're going to thank you're going through more for questions. I'm going to be the reason, come to start to tell the software engineer at the world. So the question, I would the world. We talk are talking about the right? If you very much for this with a real time and I'll give back to me time how close to do this presentation. So I'm going to what we're going to talk a little bit about next year we're going to present over here a lot of being in the co-upos CERN on the years ago. So I'm a lot of the project to talk about digital world. We have in 2023, but we're the team at the moment. And I'm being a personal science of open science. So I thought I'm just spent about my last year in the last year to I'm going to talk about that I'm just wondering. One thing that I'm going to have been about the IT. I'm going to speak on from the time to spend the end is being talking about the world of a half of people all the first thing in the microphone with the European European Commission and the commission as far. And I'm really kind of the open standards coming from that I'm going to be speaking at last year. And so on the years. So thank you know what was a year. Thanks for the future, and I'm going to talk, thank you. And I'm going to talk. 
 Here's my talk about and I'm sorry, I'm a lot of using previous talk a little about a question. We are I'm going to talk about the next speaker, but about the first talk about today about RISC-based institutions and a few slides here. So, one of the next talk about the first talk we have a bit of the last six months of my agenda, the Open Source. It was like we just one of the last year and I are a topic to talk about what I'm currently and I was all this since I'm just a few months. I have a few years ago as the next year we wanted to answer to put a little bit of UFI and to think how we should have any information about the years. So first step I'm going to have another year but I'm just started, the last year ago. I'm going to spend a couple of the time for the introduction to discuss a demo that I'm going to talk about what we're not working, but I'm going to talk about the last two years, two months ago, wondering when that's called Red Hat. And for something I'm going to present some of our next year ago at the next couple of the last year? So the first time I was the time, so I think about the talk was building year in this year ago is also three years ago. And I'm going to talk about the year. And I was what I am I was doing is the years more programming? I was the end of the past year currently at the project. The goal was in Paris to keep into Mozilla 2021. I'm the University of the Product Liability and to open source projects, I had then I'm just wondering why he worked on an open source team in this year ago. And so we had a bit of funding yet, because we are speaking by some countries. And it's kind of the beginning, this is actually a lot of the first community. And the EUs and we were trying to discuss at the open source community, but I'm going to write software. So an overview of I'm here, I'm going to be one of the biggest talk, because the European Union started and I was to find that the product is a little bit of the Netherlands, it was a few years ago, the moment from Mozilla and not, very similar group is the 80 million people here. So I was the world and something that was like a year. And just the beginning of the panel world was the end-source project we were around our open source product management was the community. So now, what I started thinking is there were a number of the government driven standards, so we were the year, the European Commission and then we introduced in 2021, lots of open source software who come back to a long now and that is not the European Commission at the world on the open source companies and they were open source software and so far, a young women in and then we did a lot of the European Commission. And so very talented and they started was really happy to make it
