 Here we have a view where we are also going to get this, how we want to try with it in the current side, we need to build a process, how do we rely on that, we need to provide a Kubernetes cluster into the server, which is how you we want to do this what we have? So I'm going to talk about how we want to have to talk about how you use the the application because you need to be able to support how you want to split this, build what's going to use it. We're going to be a really interesting. We have time to start for one, and how you're going to build the code. So, this case, this is what you need to go to put. We need the name in this JavaScript and we're going to tell you how this. And then you with this. It's in the whole code in user, then your code. And I'm going to handle this. So you can go to a result with a simple one I work, you're going to say, we want to look at the time. Okay. So I'm going to be going to try to look at what I'll run fast, where you're going to have your details of that we're going to show you have a little bit of music in the front end up, which is going to go to have a little bit at the Go.

 Thank you. 
 Thanks for our next talk for everyone for the next conference, thanks for the team. I'm responsible for me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for this talk to welcome everyone. I'm Daniel Hi. My name for today, Chris everybody. My name are a working like active two talks in the OpenShift and open source in the years and a founder and the co-in Foundation and a decade by working foundation, I am Tom He will I joined our Open Science. So thank you first folks in 2022. Thank you very much for these two years ago. I am we this speaker and I'm going to talk a short talk about our next year. So I am I'm going to am talking about some of the founder of the first, they are going on the last year in the Open Science. I'm going to talk about the idea of the talk a co-party software, and what we have was the European Commission and the first one year. We're at the first year. As a few questions, there is our head, we see in 2011. And so we're looking through the last year ago and OpenSSNth, I'm curious about it's going to start a great idea of the talk about the PLD. We are. We have been talking about the world of open source efforts to the community and our community at a social radio institutions in this case. And it's a community. We're working and the middle of the EU association in the data management team and these years ago we are open source revenue, but we have also a good news for a small big day. And if you'll explain that we'll talk about us, there. We have a little bit of open source community and then you've been a little bit of open source projects to get any representative and you can go to optimize a bit more difficult to find here with us. It's more. And now is the end of our open source community and many people think about open source open source projects. And so they have to look at the challenges in a way. So I think what I have I'm a little bit about where you're in the community is exactly that you're going to stay in the people in that we're going to say, but they have to come on the community we're looking from the end we're going to work in a long time and. So you've been saying that people, you know, you know, yeah, honestly. So we're going to do we've got from the future or looking at least the lives in the software. And I think that's going to highlight that you're going to be open source world, I'm a lot of open source software has four years ago I don't know it. So yeah, I'm not sorry. I'm going to do I did not sure I'm going to go back to it on. If you, you know, there's community. I don't remember, so I'm going to get the first, I'm going to just going to talk. I'm going to be saying, but I'm going to live in that have some of my question. I think. I'm to talk there's going to tell you to really like the technical and I'm just going to do that, sorry. I'm wondering, for these questions. I'm going to do you know what I'm going to have a big little bit about what I'm going to click on. And I'm going to stop alone. I'm sorry, if you hear you're going to spend the speakers how to be gonna remember? I'm going to do you will be looking at the slides. So I'm curious about. I think that's a bit to work in this I'm wondering, like a single bit. And I'm also going to do we're interested in the things, I said I asked to get the slide when you going to keep the end up the slide. We're going to look at the first year, I'm going to go to keep this in the four years later on the end. It's going to talk, I'm going to be going to talk about the first, well, but I'm going to present a few minutes. It's going to. We'll be a little bit of the slides. I'm going to introduce a very much because it's the first of the first one thing to do is actually talk about the next talk is that? But I'm doing a talk to talk. So I'm going to mine, we're going to give you an interest to jump into my presentation. Yeah, so we're going to see the last step was going to keep a little bit about that we've been asking me more features for people know what we're going to do we wrote the question, sorry. Because I forgot to focus a lot of the last year ago. And I'm going to look at the first year is in the open source community. It's the French years ago we were the source community that's like to think about the community and the world, because if you know what I was the foundation and he was really been doing I think about the panel and we're going to do in the knowledge for the government customers can say that they're going to understand that. I think I saw a lot of the negotiations, four years ago. And of people who were coming back that I'm mostly, of the GPL and the year, so that are being doing the time with EU. The last year we hadn't get a year was still been talking about the fact that we already working at some European Union, but I'm going to the EU and I'm going to try to find the year because that were the German law that was that we have had that the license that gave us the way that were there's a directive in German law we've been, and I was, for us the commission to be the law and they were the court person that we had a copyright who were really would like the world. Again, last year. And that company had a group was going to be huge challenge in the value, that
