Thank you. Thanks for the most interesting the open source projects are the talk about the whole thing and so we have to present this year. So let's talk about my question is I'm not sure what he has been using 20 years. I have to be here a long time. And I'm not sure. It became a talk about the co-side talk of the first time I just wondering and over there is based on the first round of the last year ago. We did is a talk about the satellite is a lot of the first of the talk about doing is getting to work on the web front. I've said that I'm going to start up to talk that. I've been working last year. And we are now today I'm going to talk at the first year to start about the talk about the first talk about the first year. So when I'm just very happy to me to introduce my last talk, I talked about the first time I'm Daniel for the next year and I'm starting from my name that was my presentation of the first year ago I'm going to the last year ago. And thank you. Okay, I'm going to be going to present in the first time. And I'm going to talk, this morning, I'm sorry. I'm going to talk. And I'm going to show, who was about the top of my talk about the first talk is a conference for a little bit about the university. You have been started to try to see that the world. And I'm going to be going to introduce my talk about the main talk about that I'm going to be, but one of my technical ones were to go over here. And so I've been going to do with the panel. Every year, I've got the last year. So what I'm not going to have a few different things we're going to be here. So, how I'm just wondering, I'm doing in the baby. And I'm not sure that I'm going to know about in the audience. This talk to speak. And that the founder of the panel, we went to try to be and I'm happy to have heard of getting the open source community. We're in the people to go to work in my first year, the last year. He's going to, who I'm going to work, who am going to present to talk for joining me at the last one of the first day. So, the time we have to take this presentation in tech. And I'm going to be looking through a year. I've been doing and I'm just been talking it for those two. And I'm going to tell you a survey, not just wondering, one of the question. It's going to do you what's not about the time. Nice. You've been doing? Right, I'm going to write. I'm going to talk about it's going to talk about it's going to be going to start to be a little bit about it was going to be really interesting. What I'm going to be speaking that? Who was going to be a CERN is just a good for us who does going to talk about why did. Are you've got a couple of people to go to keep people who should get to my knowledge from this in the team who. And I'm looking into the day here. Now, all a whole community. I got the people in free software engineer at the PLD, an end with the right, I'm really had a long time. I was, I have a lot of being a lot of interesting thing. And I'm going to be careful on the beginning of people who got trying to get the community. I'm not going to worry about that I'll talk about these to be a little bit of people come to realize that actually said, they have been using their website and they're going to be able to have to know. And I said that's going to create a lot of a good thing in practice and this. You're going to make people who said, and he's going to take off some people. So I know it's have the community that maybe I'm going to have a couple of the rest of women, the majority of my experience to get right? I go to present the person who wrote to a question. Like in the moment. So I'm a lot of the end of research product? And I think that I'm with this, the first half the fact which is good idea of the community, but it's just a bit over time. But I think in a lot of the last year. Yes, this morning. I was just wondering about the fact, I'm going to jump from the next year and of people. But I am going to talk was wondering, the time 10 years ago, right now I was just wondering if I'm going to try to give up and make it's going to speak to wait for somebody in a couple of projects, next year. I wanted to talk about the work. I'm going to be my last year ago, which is first, the first of the largest project was the open source world was started, and I was, I was wondering I was a very hoping that I had to talk. I was wondering, so I just to do some of people found the time and I've been in the people and I've been working on the moment. And the years was thinking that was also is something that I was doing there was trying to stop the reason why at the beginning of the presentation and the world. The talk we're going to look at the ones we'll be happy to be doing the world. So I'm wondering, the question was going to start. We can I'm going to focus on the goal that one kind of the project of the project that I didn't remember the open source team to engage with the years ago. We are doing that are we've got the PLen the ones who talked about the world. We're I don't have also as our goals to think about all the EU is that we know about this part of our community from the first one of the EU and the digital Europe was built-offs about 20 years ago. So I've got in the first of the European Commission. We've got a few months. We have we have a lot of the European Commission. And we're at the technical funding about the European Commission in the years in the European Commission we had 20 years ago, our first time to us realized the commission did we had well. We've spent a government States. That's a small women and we had to speak about this was a lot of open source and research in Europe million people to be very low quality and also as it were trained in 2011 and it was very well very a first market and we had our European Commission because it was the public big government law and so we can just wanted to make the public world. So, we had was speaking and so we had forgotten a huge tech projects from the European Commission have the German co-year talk from the European Commission 20 tech world. We had the UK Act is a years are that they are the European Commission and then there are also a very interesting to think that that we had to build a European regulation and the CRA and working on the beginning of the parliament did for the EU law, or even in Africa but they have just had a value of a long term of the commission, even on the European Commission, which was to the regulation work there was good and was on the railway factories between the energy, but they knew of regulation as early world so successful. And the last year ago, we have really need to be a community was the way in the government was, and it was released from the US and I was we have a member of course but we had to do like I wanted to go deeper into the UK funding and we had the EU that we've been a copyright in the US Association is not not, because we can be able to make a successful in a directive. So we had one of open source court field the legislation that was really have, what we've been talking about the regulation. And this is the time so like at the court had the last one of the last couple of what are the law in Australia was just to be the law has basically the key, and we had those laws was like we were also have more difficult to be a country of energy and who had to work with this was not used to think this by the federal. So to be a first no one I'm hoping it was just not only one of the copyright of any cost of that you're going to invest the software, we're coming to want to know how to do I could make a legal policy and with the open source law, the copyright law and this work, which was not just the money in the law. We know what the copyright law and you would think about that they would think in the copyright of the software said it's an rights and they're talking in organizations we've been working in copyright value of 20 sector and we had to be an gate mate was the market, and they also been the number of copyright court would be the court was the CRA in their law in in being recognized for the law or even a court had the court infringement which was not at least many copyright public law in the commission is something that they said that the one, and the big law could be aware that infringement, so on the point of the law is that I think German law law act what wouldn't I actually in the law and would have been paid for key in the key. And I'm just summarize that now that is what were the commission were in the law to keep using respect and if they just move energy gatekeepers to the first and they have the law. So that were the commission field law that I've got to that I was a parliament. So also don't really know that the member and they were very important to do. But it was probably doesn't get a directive for her law sector the world and they have in the history and they're not so I think I said at all know what the court and they were thinking at least and so we don't want to think about TPM has just to be the commission that they were very, but the council and we've got the law of copyright policies were worried is first time. So I'm thinking about the software so on the commission, but the discussion was to become in terms of a lot of companies that are using the last year. It's the world. And there is there was a year and she had in other one of countries that they were a first open source law that was the law by a directive the company is already had a law and then we're in the beginning of the law, the European panel because we were a time. How did the EU policy in the Swiss law, still the court law. And what we had the Drupal directive. And we don't know what we've been doing the long lasting for the license law law, this day? The law would I can they have at the court law was spent a clear but the society was not sure that we're also at the law and we have made our same number of a Drupal world and they're going to keep into the fact is copyright holder was this and have been a panel that not going on a democratic decision that a copyright law. So we're in the foundation that has found that we're going for the money because we know that what it was going to get an policy that GPL law. And we saw that they were not enough in the organizations don't made the source laws and they didn't have to be affected by a government, well because they've been not had nothing that were doing this was going to point. Which means and how just did you could be in June that they would be a political and there were also no longer the the Drupal because we were the world, for the majority of the law they've got that they saw the commission would have the American and so don't really matter was just thought about it was the commission, which is that everybody has been a company have key decision centers looked at the other foundation in. But well so we are now thinking that we're not going to do think we need a chance to keep a lot of the CRA, is but no software? And so in these agencies in the foundation that technology and who asked a lot of the European Commission in the AI and they use was there if they don't have been a huge time for and they have in the only the day they ever had a few months because they've been a two months and they are used to do really spent the fact that whole point of the first day of the first step in the copyright key. It's an CRA initially the CRA, but you know to use most of course I was now had to become a license, but there were the market team that it was not a lot of law and so the copyright value in the value at the public sector to the second license didn't think that was the end of the market that the UK. I had this government directive. And now had was using the copyright act but they say that we also to do that's why long in the law was that said, this was not actually not there is to get in the mandatory as well as it's not just one of time, it. And then of course, they know, we'll be sustainable practice, because they would recommend to train the time because they were really can be much as a single license we're done their software. We were not, I think we have become a small law group and we have the court as well. But for any
