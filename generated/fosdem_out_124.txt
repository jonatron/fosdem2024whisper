 I have a little bit better and that can be a very cool way to enable you to do. So I first talk is how to me. We also have multiple new tools that are using different repositories and have a web services is just a lot of plugins from that to download the web server widget to create it to the browser and so on this. There's a language. So there's also a very interesting and we have these features, we can then remove this from the application. Some of the browser that we have a lot of technologies that can be measured on to our data in our project that's moving to continue using a typical data into the blocks to add on the web and our servers. So there's the source code that is a laptop to enable the backend and we have a lot of different way to have in the browser that we were able to work on the API. And this is the API and we are using the application that we can be able to use our application service services to provide a cloud services such as we should be able to interactivity with the UI testing. At this case we want to want to implement with the browser, your application. So we have a container provider and the file system or you can find our applications might be able to have some flexibility. What is a different as we have multiple applications for the applications, depending on the network, whether we can be able to be done the only for applications, in your service, obviously we have a DNS services, by integrating the whole process to have a web the application, the service or a service, but are integrated service in the end encryption services to open source that are based on. So, the server and we have a client side, we want to service and the vendor service API that are available, we want to expose your browser for the server and we want to use. And that. And of a DNS provider of your network, what we have is that are doing is also we have to do is. It's the user applications, we have your clients. So as a user, I don't know. So we need to answer to allow is that we are at this, well, if it's usually the API encrypted and for the service and the proxy that, right on the service provider. That's not the other, on your users, for using it's necessary, which you can also for the application that slide and the server provides the protocol for example of this basically providing DNS. The, the DNS server. And now are usually the security. And this would be in terms of the server is the API. So if we have you want to want to implement the user network to use the server, like to have to use and they get the the client, I have a server, but they're getting the SS2P is anT client, but they don't provide the server to that. And that they're going to implement DNS server side for the server for clients. You can already want them. And this server, then you need to use case the server's a client side in one other device, this request. And we need to expose the server, you can also want to start of the server. So there, the server so it's it's pretty good to create the IPA encryption, for that's not just a clientG server server server in the server. So this client client, we also, also want to the server that's a client, we have to do have this DNS encryption. From another server and the server where the server is new server, we have a server of mail server, which is the server. And this will add some network server that is like client that time to encrypt to remote. Of course. You will be linked to the request. So we have HTTP server. It's the server encrypted. We are going to the next server of the server. You have full server. And we will add some server to send DNS in your server. And that. So here, the S4 is the request. So, we will start up to our server. And the server. And in the server and Kuberos, right side,, for the server for that, when we'll generate our servers. And then call API manager is using the session encryption and we will just provide to not going to have to process to connect to be using that to a client in the server. You have to the server. So, and the server, if you will call that's the server. Thank you want to configure server. And you. And, this is the server that's in a client, we have also have a server client in a server side and then you have the server server is the server, which is a server server. And then a client will plug and client, the server to request will work. But because that's just works. So, you can see. So you have the server like a client. You'll want to user then on the server. You don't have to your server, it's going to share, the server that way to create your mobile server. You can deploy DNS server, basically use a server, you can also want to just create a client app. So Kafka service, that the server, that you can can specify your server has to start to our page and have to enable to then for one client to send out to your IDP server to the server. You can click that. You can see the server and using this server, the server. So that in key path are a client, all your server, you can can have a server and the client. So you also create your server. So you used to have a key, to go a server. Yeah, there, the client. And finally that is a server to change. So, a server you can's going to open server, you can use it to have to. But the server application, the server does the server, the room. I'm going to know, if you should be able to remove your server. And now. All right. You can see the server, I'm going to, the server to start from the, oh, I can now. And I'm just go. And I go for the server because, I'm going to the server to pick the server. I'm not going to add a server. I'm going to the server because, I'm going to server. So, you know, if you just going to do it's going to have some stuff. I want to talk about the server for example, only the server, is going to end user. It's the server, but it's not very useful to do. It's not the client's not going to be a website and it is ready to provide a server, but it's an application, but it's open-'s essentially a domain encrypted. It's going to the connection, but I'm interested, if we start. So thanks to you know, I mean, I'm one server to have to, what I'm going to interact, how to talk I will have heard in the server, which part. I'll look at the server to be able to talk about how do you have some time for the client or really need to do you. And I'm just have for the server. I'm doing the server. And I'm not going to talk about Fosos. I'm going to have asked the server here. And I'm going to ask you for the stream we're going to start getting an client side. So all. I'm going to thank you today. So, my application, if you for the server. And for. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 Hello everyone. Thanks everyone. Thank you. I do have a story of applause. 
 Hi, welcome to the end. Thank you. My talk about the room here. My name is a talk. Thank you. I'm a talk. And I'm working to I'm just wondering. Thanks for coming. I'm curious about the co-source project engineer. So I'm all name I'm going to present the best for the first slide. I will ask a very a name of the top of the satellite, and open science world. I'm last year when this year we are some of being a last week. I'm just wondering about the end for the founder of my presentation. It's one job. So, the founder of the University of the first one of my goals, I started thinking about the folks, here we are going to be talking about the technology. So one is a very interesting thing we have the room initiative is there is in the open source community. I are also a number of the International University from NextCloud in the car lead company, the year. I'm going to women. And so I love to speak a lot of CERN, the commission, we have been doing a little bit of society in tech and the end of the organizations, the first goal and a sustainable project of open source industry is going to be open source projects to be done, and open source engineer at the European countries and a good place to work that the internet. And the world, you know, if you know, you know, you know, you know, on the moment, but the point, the end of a few years ago, you know, we decided to have a lot of open source community's the world. So in 2019, it's 10 years ago and it was not a new product, I'm an open source community group we've been doing a product. And there was a lot of the EUists, we've got the problem around that they are not going to be very beginning and they did part of the community in the community and they were doing their first think we're doing a lot of the CRA license around the project. So let's the energy world. So I'm an EU. Let's talk about the last year to be here, the license community of electricity, well, I'm going to be just wondering from the product. I know, so I'm going to say, because we're going to go in the world. So from the second room and we're doing those days. And I was I'm going to talk to see the moment away. You know, I'm going to be so it's going to have the first time. But I'm going to come into the last year at the background, was doing the first year because I'm going to hear you guys're going to be looking at about the screen, the deaf product. And I'm going to be interesting to have any of the parliament. I said that I'm going to be at the end, we have was going to be doing from Germany, and I have this year in this. Let's going to the first one who has been working on the very new room in a year was Robin. And in open, we are going to talk about the end of the panel, the community to give the start to the open source projects that I was doing. I'm going to give me. We thought, I'm going to try to talk about this time with I am going to introduce you today and bring a great to be a general at the world. And I'm going to the next goal of people to talk to do this topic on this session to show you for this. And I'm going to my research that's just talking about this morning, the workshop. We've seen about some point is the first, we've come to focus on the FidoAs. We call the latest release. In December in general. And last year, I've got the standard, the way I did is about about it. And I've been focusing to try to share a bit of how we've got our work here on the panel. And I think that I'm pretty quickly, I'm talking about the open source community talks about. And I'm you about a very first minute. I'm going to introduce any of an open source project of the last year ago, I'm just wondering to talk about Mozilla. I'm running the company, who we start about our open source Act, we're just focusing on the actual community. We're going to talk a whole community. We want to show you. I'm just wondering that I am going to ask, but I'm one of going to go to do. So I'm just wondering, but I'm a open source initiative. I'm going to be curious to be talking about that I'm going to see this talk a long time of our mission of this talk about their talk. So we'll show you so the main thing I'm going to give you a couple of work on the guys here at the University of you got the first experience. I'm going to see a non-to-one architecture and I'm going to talk about the past that are from the big-free project and therefore. So, we have was trying to know, if we have had a lot of a lot of projects in reality and we had a lot of communities and we had a few months to open source community ecosystem of the people that have been open source community and also have been doing it up to find out. So we would like we could be talking about being a few goals. What we have a lot of a look at accessibility information about it. And if you have at the community. So in the community that the European Commission was a lot of the open source world of people will give you know what we're seeing some people, how this thing in the end of the CRA. So the world have asked we've been trying to go into the work and we're going to be going to go to participate in a great to care about that the challenges in the people. So two years ago. And yeah, there are just a lot of the other people that are also get kind of these many people which were to know that they were also felt there came to do that. And so many people who are like the world and they know for me all these they have been doing and they're kind of these things in the world open source and they've been more and they're the world and they're not just the ecosystem so they're not going to know that they have that they have the market in the funding to be doing open source in the world where people are we're looking at European economy. In the CRA. So that they like the world they're going to be a great world of the world
