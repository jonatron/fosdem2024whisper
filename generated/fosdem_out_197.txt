 So, we are going to do we want to be able to get the next year. So what I want to do in this is the next talk is coming to the first part of the biggest one that the compiler is what we move here and get some work. It's moving into. But I've got a little bit of the code that was a good question. If the work I've read. So I're going to be wondering about the ones. So we're going to get to be going to show what is this. A bunch of different types of people. There's super unstruct do anything. So we have the description of people who just going on and what I'm going to start on it. I'm going to do this data at the beginning. We're going to start to give us a first thing to see what it. What we want to do we want to talk about the first? I'm just wondering that kind of something about the data actually going to be a bit more complex to ask why we have to read the way of the question, but the way to do it. How do we understand? So we're going to be saying, what we do you have a look at all this talk about five minutes, right now? How can we want to be a couple of the three years. But is a really interesting question is that don't have like to do you know about. Those you know that? Because we are like quickly about our data. The difference between the first one you had heard about this is we had to know what what you know that you know the one thing is in fact that one, the right here are going to be the future of the first thing for the impact of the right side of the things to be actually a bit more. But this is this is not the very good question, the question is how you have the memory and the question. And if they do we're going to go. I think it's it's true if you know how often the question was changing the time in the question was the most different is going to the work, it is that is that it's happening in the question. So it's the end to be the question was the question. The question. It was the question. So when the question was in this is this one is. So here. In each other question was the question is it's why I discovered like that is the question I'm going to keep there's a question is how do. And this a question, I think that the question was an open source people can you remember it's not really interesting to the question is that we had more about our question. So the question here is that are still we can you know for the question. But in the question was the question is. Sorry I was, I saw the question of the question was that I said, but I was, I'm wondering. I was I haven't so I had have to show I'm going to go in the question. I was doing this question. Great. And you know, yeah, so, I was the question before I don't. I think you have this talk about the question. So if I had one. I've been in the question. Sorry. No, I'm thinking, you said, I have at the question, and after I know, as I think I had 10 years ago. I know about the question, I'm curious about the story about the question. You know, more people who have in here available to implement that's going to make a bit more clear change is just going to know I mean? So what I just, I guess we have been doing and this? So we should I'm ready to work. Yes, what they are I'm thinking about the question. I'm wondering, sorry. I'm going to move over the question. So, we've talked about how you. I'm going to, okay, I'm just wondering, so I'm going to ask about doing it's going to explain how to my question? So, here, okay, I'm just kind of view a technical difficulties to look at the questions? So now I'm thinking about the meeting. So I'm going to work. I'm going to be going to give you're going to the time, but I'm going to be all of time for that I'm going to talk to skip to turn on this. I'm not sure we have the time. In the thing we have the question, which is when you want to try to do, so that's going to see the thing that I'm going to present. I'm going to look at the right now. And in the question. I'm going to speak about what I'm going to talk to do we have to get the room. It's going to build a little bit of... So that I'm going to skip to walk down here. I'm going to call this? We have here here here. We have a new room, I'm just wondering. I'm going on the next talk. So, which is one of a little bit of you going to try to be done. So, let's got a little bit, one, if it's start here. So I'm going to find the talk to be going to introduce you are going to just going to start going to show the first of the slides. It's going to give you could be in the other one of the world and I already. And we've got a time. So we're going to create a little bit more questions. So, how do you're going to, I'm going to speak about how the bottom. The end, is the panel coming out, the room, right? I'm going to give some background, as a little bit of the open source at the maintenance of the community, the world. So we have is going from the time to make the open source project that we have been trying to be able to try to work and work on the community. And so the challenge to look at that we're not going to get a little bit of what we're going to the time to do is you're going to get our first year to talk about doing and about why we're going to bring the first of the moment. And I'm going to this panel was going to start. I've got this talk out, we also a lot of a few years, at the first time, was very exciting talk. We're going to have these last year. And today's gone back to talk about the new community was going to going to talk or, again to talk to continue to talk about like I'm trying to talk about on to improve the best we were looking to this time into the projects. I also had to build the good community of the open source community so we're going to speak more stories to be quite good to introduce a little bit what people in the community. And this is that we've ever want to just looking for us know. We're going to talk a very thankful because they're hoping to talk to be able to bring this community. But I want to make a few more things we're interested in terms of our society. We're going to start to be able to start to dojo and out in the open source project but we want to do coding and we care about the first step, you're going to do a lot of open source communities for many. And since the last week. I don't have a little bit of people who already have heard about the project that's going to keep thinking about the organization and free software world. And that's going to try to be around the community, that dojo. And I'm probably think it's not going to be trying to ask about this thing. And then the good practices of the community. I think it's the community and I think that we have a day at the end of 2019. So this year to look at the past all of people and this collaboration and being the moment in the world. That's going to be the first one's great idea of the commission. We have been talking to tell us here. We have been open source lives on this year. I had to thank you the panel. If you. I'm going to show you very much for two months ago, everybody is the next year at the thing is funding for a year. And that we did we use that time in mind, as well because we're going to get to work. So we were working on the year and we now we're being now. We have been using our open source world and also interested in the, we're going to talk, we've had one other people who were trying to be going to look at least going on the industry since we need to do well because we're going to work in other reasons to be used to have to work out an opportunity for our organizations. A community that we are the community supply in the world and we're going to encourage people more often in our business and we have to think about the community maintainer, we had a couple of the community perspective of years and get into those work in there and we had to be a lot of people who said we had a lot of projects, but here. So I said, I've got the community, we had to talk about the project in the way to you don't have some of various ways to use other people in the challenges, which were doing is the community. So let's the developers and I asked the first one, the way of the open source community were moving down in the world and so. And we had some people later on and they were also have been focusing on one really excited to provide people who. So, maybe 100% of these projects and so we have been working on the project, they were also know that we've got a long time to be able to be very happy to make that we had to integrate through. And the work with me to keep that we had a lot of what we have a couple of technical and we'll give him? We've done as a website. And and I'm hoping to share time to introduce online and we have something that we are a talk about a lot of other years and to show you can work on a lot of different. So to see that talk about how much about how people. And this is how you're going to the community about how it, what we always saw this is we're going to be a community and we're going to make decisions to build us to have some of expertise on our solutions. These projects going to write as well. So we're going to look into a good. People who are, we're doing the right now and and they're going to you're going to have these six people in the first five years ago. And as a long as we're going to go to happen in the people and we also need to look at our whole year. We'll see, a little bit. And so much as you know I said we'll talk about today, how I should be here. I'm a lot of time when I'm wondering about the panel. And I'm going to talk about some of the first a world, they actually talking about funding and we had to share the community. And we managed to say great topic just talking about the open source of the community. We had to show those people about it. We started speaking about our research work with a lot of the project. And we have a lot of the world to keep open source community in our tech and we have also been writing open source software conference in our project. So we had a community and we were doing this talk about we just to talk about the organization, in Europe for a lot of the market and what we've done a lot of our technology and we're currently have open source community. The future there? And that we have been doing both research community. We also good experience and work to open source as far as much as I'm at the community. And we've got a society and so much as a lot of funding association that we're in the world are on law to focus on the software guidelines for us be as a regulation in terms of doing the policy, there's so on the CRA and we have, we're not aware of that things. And they're talking about software. Okay, so let's also ask people really important to understand why we're doing we have to know why we do they're working with any of the PLD, so much as companies from the community product foundation. They are talking about the commission in the license and the world and they know, but they're in a sustainable in the legal product, well. And that they're still know, okay, of course, then we're talking about the community, because that's also the second world also do open source project and also a German law law in German law, these rights about it's important to study in this point of the product or to work. And we've got that we know what we are our institutions have was the point of the public in the way, we have an open source community who was just got the software of building law, talking about all the software engineer we actually work for now. I have then we haven't have to promote the commission that I think that we know, and we're actually had something that we looked at the world. So they saw that I'm the world called the product model, which means the last year, the knowledge in the German US copyright legislation was a good problem with the German law and the ones here. And they've got a company. They were also asked, there is a parliament were a lot of open source And that would be often be all of people know how and I think it. And there are a lot of these people are like the EU that are very big and hoping that in the world and the people are part of the software community group. The question was the product and the AI is that they can be the world, the product, in the law of the law, but they have said, they are a regulation. I think for all of the way that we have two member that they have to be the beginning when they know a new companies, we're a public, we can be able to be so they've just to provide a gap at the CRA at least five years. Also there and so, but they want to the market. Because in a common license point of the law in the foundation that you know that they have the licensee would open source time or that he had to keep that we have to be important part of the legislation and they are there's not open source law so the EU is, but the last year,
