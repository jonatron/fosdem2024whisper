 So I'm a little bit of a little bit, a bit of a little bit. And then we see a little bit of different dive into in the Python. So I'm going on the first one. I was going to talk about, but I kind of a bunch of bytes. So this is why I'm going to figure out how this is going to work. I'm going to see what I'm going to build that. So I'm going to be going to be going to tell you how to work. What? So you see the two things. You're looking out to work on the Ruby model that this kind of looks like a block of structure of a bunch of ways to figure out in the next type in. And I'm going to be going to be going to work. I do. But let's it looks at front of... Well, you can see the second instance, we have a code. It's a Python code, if you have a bit more important to do, you can see that. So the list, you have a graph between the one of the C++ code, the only one of the code is the C project. It's a C++ code that you can have an analysis and a memory. So this is what I'm going to have the functions that I'm going to run by what I'm the code. So if I'm going to add, I'm just wondering about here, I'm going to make a lot of the code at the API. I'm going to start people to be the Python code and I'm going to start, but I'm going to show you a more on the library. We have this is just adding the C++ code here I'm going to get to run and I'm going to do it for me. So I'm going to talk about the code and here. That's going to be cool. As I'm the C++ code base, we're going to talk about Go routine that I didn't say, we're going to be happy here on the C++ browser at the C++ code and I'm going to say, we will keep using the C++ code base, the D++ code base function is really interesting. And I'm going to make this is you can be going to show you can see here at the documentation for the next talk about performance and I'm wondering. So, the last one, we just had an option that I don't have a Java code with Rust, is the end of dependencies. But the code that are actually the memory and the memory analysis is the code. So I forgot to give data. I'm going to use time for the API. So, so, I'm going to start some to run the main point is happening here, I'm going to see the code. I'm going to talk. So this this is there's going to be cool, I'm going to talk about writing code and I'm going to the documentation actually going to be going to be a lot of the current code base and time, this is that you can perform the code in Python code into C code. But, which is the C++ code, this is the C++ code, I'm going to say, about AI code, before we get this talk, right? I'm not going to do because I'm just wondering, but we have, but one that I'm going to think we care about what we have, we have questions? We're going to talk about two, which is interesting things we're going to make a new to build, the code is actually use. We need to search. So we're doing it's going to C code that we are we're going to keep going to touch, what the C++ code description later on. So, should we have to talk about the C++ code it's going to us, which is that you very difficult to do don't work with the first version of the most of C code. Specifications are done. He's going to look at the community and I'm going to be talking about what the last year, what I'm going to talk about our talk to start the first year, it was talking about, but I, more about the LL function was the world. And when is kind of the fact, you are the right? And if you're going to discuss about that it should be careful a time I'm going to be able to really interesting idea we're going to, what we're making what we're going on the function? So if a value happen? It's see that, we've been hitting it's going to start getting more than I'm going to add about. And think that we have time in the time to start working on the right. So maybe some of the community conference. Okay, I'm gonna. So I'm just wondering what we are I'm going to go to get to us to be here at the things. So I'm not sure that I'm just wondering, to start. All right? We need to come up. And then you know the first. I still want to get in your community in the way to look at the community. And I'm the slide about the focus in my name is that I'm going to my open source community. But what I'm going to do we get? And I'm talking about the most of all the time we have been in a open source code over a great idea of these five years ago, two years. We have a lot of the work on a much a question, we've got a lot of people doing to implement because open source project about this mindset as a place you can find the features, we had to talk about the community standards. So that. That's just the world. And even if there's not a lot of the language, right? And as a lot of months ago I won't think right? And so the last one of my spare time I'm going to be in your product to have to come on the standard for that. I want to get there. And so I think, well, that out to show you how I'm sorry how you need to hear like to introduce a lot more questions. I just wondering about the community, right? So I'm going to take any of the slide that we've been talking about our community? And I don't know that. And so we want to talk about the different years ago as well, right? So I'm going to get a lot of this is what it was a lot of women are going fast to go into the past, we're going to go, but we're going into the time and have had to get a bit of like I don't have to say, but the I was quite a good companies that we're going to do for people who was going to do, who have a little bit more questions. We've done for people who have it. But how did all these questions, you know what I learned was all the challenges today was being looking for us done with me to look at the impact on the year, so far away. And I'm just talking about a lot of the left in the European Commission and a really need to be here, we have in the best thing, we have to be able to start the European Commission who was discussing where we have to give up if you the European Union to a city who are going to give stuff and to have? These two years ago, in the EU as a million and of the educational research in the European Commission and it started from the world in European Commission in June 20 years from the EU Commission maintainer so I was very important to use was funding in terms of the EUF project. We had had to have had 50 years ago, and so we were very much to think the CRA. We are being kept that the first year ago. And well, mainly in the European Commission said we had, we've been talking about what was able to be able to follow a bit and last year of the first years ago and the Commission to work on a year for us actually now. And I think even excited to have to introduce people in 2019 to think we're here at the year, but if we're working on the first talk because in the commission. And then we were just talked about the last year ago. We're hoping to discuss in North America Initiative was wondering about that person and we have the three years and the European economy as far we had to make the EU railway sector, which is to be reached on the Commission. We had. But we've said that because we had a challenge that was going forward by the third day was it was in 2019 is going to be published in the world, which was taking a knowledge that initially thought we had three years ago and originally, although I think, from the first year ago and European million are then had that we've been trying to know that were those were in and we were talking about EU institutions. And because we had to get very interesting we were looking that were talking about to share. And they were in the fact that was going to take a bunch of this year. They were coming from the only had that they were was really the last year over to speak the US's European Commission, this year, we had been working on the moment. So this year we had this talk, so I thought we had a lot of an excited that I said that was on the panel of these last year. And I was a year, despite one room for mine. And good thing that we had to do here, it was a good thing that they can we could we are also have any of the work with the years, and think that we've worked internally and this is to show this is a lot of this time, but not so this kind of other people who did. So this is it was the best practices in the first thing that we've got another thing for us. So we did is that we've been doing this was we've been doing the topic was that where can be done by what we've said about the one of how we are going to put it's we've seen a conference at the previous 12 years ago and you have a bit of the best, which you know that were going to see today. So some of the first day of all are going to work to work together, but I've got at the first year, many few months ago. And we are in the middle of the best to talk is getting a power at the digital team, the grid and the year. And so we got to get quite a lot of one year, which was not the middle of people who originally released the member of the world, but we had to have heard a lot of the world that we've discovered that's important talk is not as well, there. So there was the past, but there are maybe they've got a small release of a small world and they've had this is a lot of the first year. And I haven't do you're the five months ago, we have been talking about the year at the last year. The good idea was that was the past and then I worked on the panel and I was on the moment and it was, the entire little bit of the year in the year, and the year was the future to use of why I had some point to be getting a new release, and I was another time. And because he was initially was, and the first time we had been launched, and the process, the issue about the first year ago, the long enough forward was getting released, but I was just think you could be a lot of open source project that they had something like one billion in the last year. And this, the European Commission were also we were trying to work back they were doing and they were a lot of the panel, and they had a young people to do have a strong impact of them because the CRA is, as far as well, they were the panel was got the world, but they had before they were like they had to have like, in the moment in open source software projects, all the time, all of the Commission was actually have the end of our product. They is the time to be doing this year working group that they were doing the various years ago and they were the end of the same time. People. And I was done. And they were so we had six months. So like one of this, so we were the year, I think most people were saying you're going to be to have a bit about. I had any of this thing that was do was up. So this year, I said, just to have the beginning of course, I had that I have here, I was the last year, I was just seen last year ago. And this was going to ask me to a very much this years ago, why is the last year were just wondering about the main success of the community, here and the work for you know. You know, a thousand people were watching how many years ago, at the other thing, because that we are only, but they were looking too, they were like she is the one day, because they are we didn't know, they did we had in this. At least a bit of the whole thing is a very important thing. So I should, yeah, you know, we have the last year. So, was a little bit strange situation, if you know, you know, you know, you're thinking about the right? You all, you know, you know, right? I'm just one people use here. Sorry, great. You know, you know, you know, you know, and the last year, two. So, but like, but you know, you know, right? As I'm going to go back time, like, okay, that we have, right, the right, okay, I'm going to the I, all the, okay, the actual people know, right? Yeah, there's try to see some people. So, you know, that are not it's all the question. But if you know, you come up, how many, you know, you know, right? I'm going to start building people, right now have many people, and to have a little robot, like, but, I'm going to find it's going to be just wondering, so much time, not so yeah, you know, and there is, right? And, yeah, you've got time, right? Sorry, okay, thank you again, thank you. Thank you for everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for everyone. Thank you. Thank you
