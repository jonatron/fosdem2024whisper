 Thank you. Okay, next, first thank you very much very much. Thank you. Thank you for everybody. Thank you everyone. Thank you very much. 
 We've been going to talk. Yesterday I'm currently going to add a little bit about in the next talk about most welcome everybody at three or three challenges in the first? So I am trying to do we like today is going to add on the project and what's just talked about us to talk about accessibility and have to be a whole group but we are very closely with this talk about and engineering and first thank it's going to the main reason. So the question before I'm the talk. I'm just wondering there is time for our last year on the panel, the workshop of the project and to talk are community who are going on the good enough conversations about three months of the open source community and how I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about the question a first thing that I'd like a lot of the one of people who knows that we measure the open source community is a lot of people here and we are talking about it to join us need to the biggest release development energy, the software to make a better and then there are connected to discuss and we are also talked about the community and we first five of the last year or 100 years ago. It's the end of the whole software and we had the whole discussion and the market now to work we have many years ago to be really wanted to be a few years ago. So what we need to take that we had this year ago, I think about the European Commission and I'm going to talk to show us first year because we've been doing or two years ago about technology for the beginning of the world and also hired a lot of the big impact of women and the world. And so much of the Commission in the European Union here that we have been being able to give us and a half a lot of tech engineer as a problem, well it's maybe it's a huge win in the EU person that they were around right away in 2019 and the world ago just a lot of England and there that was no, the day let's a very small program to this is really interesting of a country but we have a high priority for this is an open source technology community and so far as a year at open source world but even for the world because they have 10 years ago. And I think it's a bit more important for a bit over your best technology and so we have heard what it because as good, and it is that the European Commission there had a big so many year I'm happy with the European Union and then we have a lot of the big companies were using the European Commission learned about interoperability government institutions and so much with the fact we could be a lot of the countries or three years ago a very different two people, six months of these workshops that are I make the moment. And the product that have been taken off and they were developed support, but they were added a new world that they were in the US plus federal community, they are really feel good regulation focused on a license and there were on the space that is a strong software as many more national products were also a company, but of the idea that they were quite important to do was that they have to do be available for us. So that is a great for example, we have a lot of the CRA. We have to think there was to be, and the first time last year ago, but on the big decision, but there was great part of you really important for those lessons to have to make sure that far when we want to be able to make sure that we would be used for them on a positive to handle the same time to get to turn in our first thing that the last year, which year, but they want to ask our software software working on people and therefore the long time in December ones. So we also the moment at least to have any of the world and, well, the last year, which is the first step of the only going to choose to just a quick point of the computer science. And the case with that I think the beginning of course, we were the discussion of the world from the whole stack is the future, and we are not only we were actually have been going to be in the future in law and we were discussing in our licenses so that they have had asked for us to do we had been working on the problem that was only the law from, the second bit of the energy perspective. We wanted to be about the GPL law and so at a very well, that every year. And we've got in the fact that now we decided them to come from the law by the law, they were the first and at the law that the law we went into our society. And the law would like the CRA would have been getting into the value and there were an last year back to implement the directive that we have had to share the first year and the third person. And so that you were very good experience for the last problem. It was that person to think I was quite a law law. And as I could be the commercial law, like the public law of my law that I was something I was a key format in the certification that was open public law, but I think it brought around the money to any policy also actually always when I've had to the law to engage on the world. But it was originally had to him this was actually was quite an value in the market community who thought I was kind of course only law long time to law. And now came up to help me very grateful to think that have to take out. I've got three years of materials in our law. Just a law that German law, we saw this, but nonetheless in the second one was the court, it was a law, which was not all always had that point and that they had had had to say this is all this was quite a copyright and he is there was not a law. So and she were a long, they went into this key. And it was like almost one of the years was half of the end was at a private policy is, I was often saying you cannot we didn't know the EU, right, we came up. And it was the commission. So, but I just interesting for the work. The next value did you had to know I was here is saying that was you know the moment you know, I knew the one of the same side, they've got the product that somebody saying that also you know, again thought that, I think there and was a license and they had to see that. So this is a copyright of the license law in the copyright the copyright is that's a law, the only person, is a law that all the copyright law, that the copyright in the only law, but, was an clear in the GPL is that there is this law. So not exactly what there is going to the copyright court by law was incredibly interesting law and actually about the law, who is good value has was the cost because this German value came out who, but he was the copyright license was about an license could be a copyright license copyright that thought they were really thought actually felt that copyright that in law that were just going to say that this is that was meant to? I didn't know that we were just sort of in the rights, but then I had, and the value of the law to see the human, has been thinking is a copyright law, the main money is to the copyright GPL GPL license holder did exactly the copyright in that law, TPM that really was not actually very only because I was not, is what I've seen of law and it was going to be in the law and they were that policy spent started in fact that data that they were, really good issue and they was that they had that I ended up the past law told us and they were invented by the, but the law sector were starting to the copyright GPL then the point of the GPL license that we had to take the GPL the value and they said, but the court copyright holder was not only came from the legal copyright law, that so they had was had in and we are very aware of a law was a copyright association of power was just asked in the commission in the law and since they started this law and was supposed to think he said, nobody was really been considered the rights and what was not used to just so that they ever was not even then at the TAI itself, which they were an court or they really, no idea of the license and open source world would be that would be organized as you get tried to think what he was happening and I could be the commission and if we got to be done, then we were just said the license at the law, they, they were generally think there were published so they could even for their copyright because they were a public policy, no copyright to put a um, like an licensee would be like, but actually going to worry on the copyright holder. If they've done of what was something, this GPL key that I shouldn't tell us, they had to keep a copyright policy, okay, right, just wondering, the reason that was just need one, a copyright, so the first option and I could also a that are not aware of the copyright is, the copyright infringement's the GPL. How did we have in the value that, the they would they wasn't know, no issue this but no one of the license was that the law, but not only the license space and they were also actually there like a person who has the copyright and it was the source law that the other copyright. It does. I didn't know that they couldn't need the legal copyright to kind of copyright policy was value, but they were the software license of what one was a I know if they had to do was like an license a copyright, which he told them said that the law. I was really, no, they're of the value, well, they had a license, google not matter of copyright at the copyright was aware that and they could be doing the law, but the key, but there was another copyright changes even know that it was that we have that it has had been a really aware of there was what someone that in the copyright and he's actually told this. It needs to be the copyright keys out that was just gave to work into copyright and honestly, like I was not using that also, I'm just wondering, so initially just like that came back again, I had, I guess, I found a legal was at least an GPL GPL came and he was an GPL is that it was a GPL law, but of a way out that you know, but trying to go into the license that they were really have the notion, and they don't need to know to prevent copyright policy. And so it was that have no, but they were only person and they can't know that nothing that they were missing was at or you know the licenses that sense, they have said, and they were the license from the copyrightkeeper they were not that they have the license wasn't even still had answered. They didn't really be able to be a law as I know me without an issue that they knew that we did not really have had. I'm not really sorry. And so. We used means that we don't get a person was that the license and we also had to be, shall not aware that GPL, well an activist, so well, uh, yeah, but here was not mentioned that we had that we were kind of almost an issue of value. So I think it was asking the license organizations that, I'm not saying, like it was for that isn't, okay, but I think. So the GPL law and the same principle of fact that he worked on the law we don't know what I was you know exactly good one and what he had a law and the key and he actually will be been into the GPL law, we have was good. But we had, we now. We had to see in the license directive and he was that was very, just was like then I was not a was like no law, okay, not just, I was just go, it after I was not just just wondering what I had this room and the last year. And they're going to be I ran in a clear it was the German copyright market that was able to be kind of that the civil society. And that. It was called policy and then I would be a copyright was that was a tech was actually not a like I was the value of the GPL is to create people who had, you had asked, like, you know this policy was originally ever had a copyright license that was a copyright copyright. Oh, I was actually had was the only allowed to solve a license, but it was just been saying for what we could it after you know. What was because my GPL license to just worked in the principle of each individual licenses, the GPL court copyright in the licensee was first value of the key. And the fact that they might be the regulation had kind of like a copyright thought that would like even for anyone is also don't always want to get their copyright always has been in the same longer on it. That was completely another license with license policy, and and bad infringement during a. So I've had to get some first time that was, I had had actually had a bit of the commission had to they've worked and they went beyond an issue together through them when they were saying there was just said there was an industry. And could be just put that I just worked in their the organizations had been a regulation where you were essentially have been paid at all open source and they were we still had stuff out of them and having to do, but they had to do
