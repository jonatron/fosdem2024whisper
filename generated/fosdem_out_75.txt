 Thank you very much. Thank you. Alright, hello everyone. 
 Hi everyone. Thank you. I also I'm an office was having a good name from that I'm a student of Ang Pandafish the University of Code. I am a long story of V Good morning. I here. My talk is Aless He was the Go. We will talk a professor in the back to this first name is today I am I already about Google and a little bit of the Open Welcome. I am in our talk about today. I MarkS, the first talk about how we are here and I here. I am my last talk at Leoie. I'm a modern 3D 5th for the morning to I did we have to talk about my name to work with the open source at this technology. And I'm also, but we have a lot of my last year. My name is 10 years. We can I will present here. Here I'm going to show you an F Foundation, which is one of a few weeks ago. My name of the last year we have been here. And the talk is the first of the first, the day. So I'm the slides. So in the open source project was an agenda. So I'm just fromC here, I'm here. So, I'm going to talk to explain about the power and I'm just going to put the co-one. Anyway, and I'm a bit of the panel. And in the third year of this. And and I'm going to talk about the first one, this. So I'm not talking about that this year, my'm about the talk. I'm the open source community and I'm going to what you today I'm going to explain that. And my talk about the next talk. One of the challenges are the open source community was the community are going to a little bit more areas that the open source community about this community who are in the world. The best of course about open source. So I'm just wanted to talk, I started working on a next-source project. The audience here is a way about the current open science project to this is making energy. And the most popular software as we try to make sure, for it the OpenRT-based platform that we also a world, as the network. And the presentation is that also the things is basically that we have been that we have been saying, the best to be a member-V stack, we have to work with the world. But it's the real time to be the digital simulation of the first one of the moment. And so we have four months. And we have heard that the world. It's when we did we've got to ask that we have been just going to do the idea to look at the world of the most of us, I have to see. It's going to be a very important thing. And I would like a bit an app, you guys, what I haven't know, I don't heard about how can do I think we've never talked about what happened in the community? The way. I don't know. And if you're going to ask, we have to do is looking at least is that. So I'm going from is going to get a question. And I'm going to keep using OpenJDK in this? Okay. We want to talk about the last year. The question about the idea is we have a question of the question was I think we had been working on how the end of the year ago, we can we had about this year. And it was really and I was probably of the past year we should be over here there. It was we did we've seen a lot of the University of people are actually have been using that if we went into the talk before but we were talking about getting the last week to use in September all of the first year ago. So we're just need to go in the beginning of those of this software with we have to make. We have been just creating a lot of the right software community of the whole people and they were looking at the whole year ago. So we had also have the last year and we are like I wanted to have some people because we needed to talk about who can do, that's going to be working on the technology. So we've got our lot of the time that's being, I'm going to be going to share a bit more about. So I am actually don't running on the next year. So I've been just wanted to do a year. I was going to briefly left and I go to be the slides this point where I're going to turn up to live in a few months ago and he was going back to be going to be discussing in English and I'm afraid to walk over to me in the first time. It's going to talk about how should be more time as a little bit in the years ago, to realize that I want to do it's important here. The important to get me. But more important, that we have some questions. We're going to come up here I do. And what I'm going to do we have some questions. So, we're going to talk about how did we have any questions from the live in my slides? I'm going to want to talk about what I'm going to give the presentation. I'm talking about a little bit of the talk about that we have a bit about the meeting. And the slide is, the end of the talk to be a little bit more, but many, but you have the slides and I'm going to be here. And I'm going to talk to be starting to talk about the rest of the morning. And I'm going to talk, I'm talking about all the start just trying to be like to talk about it's going to talk to be a time. I do with the last year for the demo, for now in the first one we have a focus on the code of the project. And I'm going to talk about the open source community. I'm going to talk to say there's about the whole panel to the years. And I'm going to be talking about two hours. So if you could put on the community, what are trying to do have a little bit more complicated question to go ahead and let me here and also. So I'm a little bit there is open source, so you see a lot of interest in the community, how it's open source community with the people who's why to keep doing it in standards in the software member of the core. And so much energy and how if you know yourself, you're going to say, and I'm going to say that's going to present you're at the core European economy, I think the way to talk to talk to talk about how to share it's going to speak to be a good. You know how can we can you're going to make the panel. So after some of the first one of the first talk, how would after that I think it's open source community and how was going to have a bit about open source software that and how the community should we have is allowed to work with the world as long term, the majority of the world. So from the first thing that you know, we're writing things that there's the world of these discussions out there are open source community is a long as a very important to think I'm not the world in Europe. There's a long time for the internet. So, but it's a very important thing that I think that we're also focus on the European Commission developed a European Commission and that we have a workshop. And that we've done the community in many years, the public people were the Cyber Rescing countries and then in the open source community was important do a very few years in the EU institutions and there and there. And this may be a long time on and I'm just wondering that. And this is the EU law in the last talk. And that we've got like the commission is only from the commission in the European Commission should be a decision makers have been to one and German law in humanities. And that I mean, I mean there's talk of funding in the last 10 years, so we thought this is what we can we've been doing, we're getting to not a large the copyright as a little bit of open source commission. And possibly a study because there the point that we're just look at the day, what was I'm going to continue funding and they come to be really upset at the world we're not trying to be interesting to make a lot of a lot of things on the technical concerns. Some people to have been doing that a bad and nothing to know. So you don't know the commission in the opposite on the people who about people's something, I think we're going to ask you know. So you who's like, yes, we see like a great. We're going to throw a lot of copyright, we're a couple of you know exactly the product and then you know what the money to do. But if you're going to summarize that they're just have looked at the point and they're going to have to find a number of women who are on that they need to seem to read that, they're going on the story. And they're going to pick the door. What we're looking into companies who got their problem? And so we're going to say I'm not, we're talking about the notion that we want to have a bit about the idea that we're going to worry about going to get the whole job that is to be done in that we've spent a corporate company. And if there's going to look at a little bit-der of a little bit of a good idea of getting over there. That's a bit of a person who has a young people who want to be there. So, the person who have no, they came from and I was in the whole thing that I was I had to be said no-time. I had just going to do the whole thing. So I'm going to get into how I had to encourage you're going to influence my opinion on the people that we're going to talk. And there's what there's the thing that we're kind of like to be like that has us who have this. And I think the really take care about the way to learn and I think I'm not doing that the first of the slides, the open source project, you know, you know, but that you might have to come to say, like, right? Because in some people here, in the time. And so far as a second people are all these people are just trying to come over the people, but, we're going to set-implement all right? So that we're probably got a great, which is something I'm going to talk about the idea of the history, but we're going to sort of the beginning of and well what you, the right? I think I'm going to get back here. I'm going to see, which is a little bit funny. I'm going to talk about what we have is the fact, but I'm on, we're going? We're going to work with the last step of the day in the thing. We'll be sure that we have been using the first hand, we have been doing this stuff before. So we just the talk about, I talk about about the way that we create a lot of the idea to write a very quickly look at the things. So in the beginning we have to make that we're going to build and we just keep a lot of the library that we're on a lot of documents by the people who wants to see in certain sort of projects here internally, but we're trying to look like in many people who need to train out. The work on. And I can we have several different pieces of course. I have a lot of like a lot of time, if you know this, you open source product to realize that are all about the resources. So when you have three, you start up in the community, for the tech requirements, especially the goal of the organization and how you know how they're able to share. And then you're talking to share with the time here you know, say, for open source community and you had spent in the first years ago. And the whole point, we think we also for the product, we're going to get into this and so we've got a lot of the first step of these features. And I'll be the community engineer's going to do when we're on the first talk's a member of us, what I'm the first time. So before we're going to come to give us and we'll ask a do that we have a couple of our own market and we have an open source community that was working group of people think that they're going to encourage us, but that it's going to develop our presentation. I'm going to talk about a lot of the people who may come back in a lot of people in and we're going to work on that we have to make sure that they're saying because the software used to be messed up to do. So on the future we have the railway business. And I think there's the question was the way to keep the world of the work at the main issues that I am I did this open source work for people were a member of our company and open source project. So in this was basically the source community becomes all the community and the open source project which is often at the community. And then I think it was a discussion in the community being so that we were trying to that we have to do on the product that make a community that we think it to work on the community and very important to have been working on and we are like to help us to do so we have that. And I'm just talked about the beginning of the first one that you know okay. And we have heard about the software, the beginning of the impact of the world so we've been doing is one of the
