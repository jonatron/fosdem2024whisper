 We want to try to call the library. You can create a backend, you can see the build, you the implementation of the X2. We have to add a C++, which is the CMake, which is called a 4D, which is pretty cool. So last year in this is the V2, the actual version of the C++ code as a really can be the Go, there in Java and it's a C++ code, which is a platform for a very interesting way for that we also to get into Ruby, from the Ruby code, which is there's, for a simple. So, do we have a slide. Pico 3. So, there's also a C API to make C++ code what we have to be a C++ APIs that we need to know, we want to use the source code base and we have for us to take for for C++ to create this package that, really need to look in OpenShift code, we have a C++ code for Rust, which I'm going to go there. We have to find the current CNCF, but I'm going to show you a number of types of VEX, which gives you this Java code, which I'm going to talk about it's going to work out to start, we're going to do this project. Because it's going to talk about is also a bit about native code that the compiler, we need to show you that in C code in the code, but so we're going to be a long as high level that we have a lot more about what we want to have our code editor, which is all the most of the, but that's all all going to work I think about the community. Yeah, I think this time and I think about. I'm going to be hoping for a question. I was I'm going to have also wondering about that we didn't need to be in terms of my, but the, I'm showing it's going to mean, it's based on. I have a question. The question was I'm going to make the last question is, I was just wondering, but when we have one. Do I would like we have three minutes. I'm going to have to provide a lightning. We take the agenda of them. So that we have a bit of the talk to be going to our talk about the work for the community, we have about, but we have been doing that we are really have the web browser with the project, we are the server, the other developers to be able to use open source community, we are still want to actually we are using our community management platforms for the community work on the community, using Go to make our goals. The first people need to do, we need to have us to use our world are doing the first thing to work, the last year, where we don't have a standard in a community, some reasons that we also we have time we want to implement request support. We have, but for our open source project we have some goal to see the software-source projects that the community? And we want to implement our GitHub developers to work for us across a lot of the community of the other software world, you. You have some people, since the last year. We also companies are using GitHub, for that we are talking about projects and AI community, collaboration and so on the work, and communities, in the world, we have developed our community, we built in the data into the community projects, and we have four years in the previous release teams and we have been working on the world. And on the first year, last year, this year, we were also create, I think we have been working on and I have five years ago, actually have a lot of a few years ago, for the community and I think that we have a bunch of people in a day years and we had in the only one of the fact that these folks. And I was the future had the first I was it was really a lot of the most open source community, maybe the moment to, we were a little bit of the years before and here at least on all the community from Germany. And I discovered as well, I would like much money we had at least the open source projects in the community and also a lot of the problems, so we have four years ago, really happy to get rid of people to be the open source software to open source development process. And I think that covers the community. We have not a way that they had to set day towards the point, I said we wanted to look at the people to be in the business. The open source project was in the software engineer, we had to focus in June, I guess we were not able to be a lot of the open source funding to talk was saying that was people to try to mention of people are coming to work at all these things and they still making mistakes in research from the project. So it would be amazing practice and with these projects in the world. So on the question. We are very important and we need to present a big things that the European days ago I'm not a lot of the code and many companies and so to know what we have been all around this kind of the moment, how we've been thinking about why we've been working on the end of open source community. We're working on the best companies trying to have to use the best practices and we have this group into education, so that we don't want to get in that society to make like all work for projects that we have ideas and use the most of the European Commission, they've worked in Europe and you to reuse of the things like the knowledge of tech that we have had to have been working on a lot of the community, which you know that they've been use both of, which are really looked at the world. So sometimes. It's really so you're very difficult in the product and as a lot of projects. The ecosystem with people use cases that we've been talking of different organizations that you know how to have been doing with our data and we need in the open source community and they have heard about all these point of these things. So I was saying they have that we had been using the community know so they got to think about the business licenses that I've been working group of the maintenance we have been using this together together and I think about what should have about the world because the open source software that's really matters that about the knowledge we've been a super open source code, it, so if people are the company and the ecosystem have to work is actually there. So the CRA on the day in the definition. And we've got the open source data to think the third thing are the world that is. And I'm looking at the fact I need to be made an open source community, we have to use open source community that it, but in the last year ago we need to give the world of companies around communities and the first and the community that we want to do you in this kind of our future, we think very often get involved in Switzerland and to stay in the open source community and I'm going to give you to learn and see that we're going to help us what we make the community. I was going to be talking to know who are going to be worried about to speak about this as well as a open source software and what the projects work really a lot of the world of the ones that you need to know. And that people have to have been kind of companies. So we're going to share into the challenges of what people, I'm going to talk of that often understand right. So yeah, we are about a lot of open source projects who was there that they have been a lot of money and they're on and they're trying to throw into people who just participate in there. And I think is you know about AI and a lot of you know like, and they want to share people involved in a very few goals of people who that are like this communities all the world. But in there was the challenge at the last year they're going to speak kind of those. And if they're a very important thing there's important because they're of people are starting to look at the skills in the source projects that you know what they're going to do we have five more people in terms of people are going to do. And they're going to look at the kind of the next year and we've got is a trademark. So last five of open source projects were here were there is the most of the agenda of the Drupal and they did it was an open source code for the big ones. There are other people. So the first option is and the first of the case is the first of the future of the community was quite famous project, but our company like this talk before the fact that I think this feature they come. So who all these things I'm going to be people who are thinking about where people. My political sector, like this is that was the community and the world. They have been using to get involved on the company and they were doing this. So these elections, and they've been working on the research between the first half a lot of the years since I have the last year. We're going to talk on the one of the only about the company being working projects. I've got from the European Commission in the beginning. In Europe's a way. And we have to give in the first of the way to be the open source community where they've been there were trying to be a bit controversial thing that we don't remember from the room for the negotiations and so we're trying to throw away from people who can do open source companies also have to have heard about the community and the goal of a young people and they have to have been to have colleagues of people in the things of the past and they're from we're just have to the open source projects, they just had to make sense. And they have a good opportunity to find off and it even all the software in the, they have the world. It's going up a long end of the project where people, the work the organization, they say, they're just then all of the problems. They have also some of the discussion in the technical field and they're going forward over on the people. And of the commission. And at the university and they're looking back in and you've got to a really enjoyed the things so far as you could get there and they're going to you do, and they're looking at the commission and they can't really be here when they can't want to have to make this person who are many people to be able to open source, but they will be a minute on the whole point that we're going to start to be wondering about the time. So the first thing we'll give a lot of the commission who's going to ask you just. And that we're going to about what we need to talk about the first of the community has to be able to work that time to be a corporate community that we have, we're going to do is going to do the educational, the beginning of things that. What was we have a specific about a lot of an important thing that we have been asking for all the AI, right? And we've got to get to know what they're going to. And and what we have to let's going on what sort of a way we're asking for coming back to be able to get here. So that I'm doing we're going to talk about, but we're going to the first step that we're going to be saying that. And that we're familiar with the people know about the way we're a good ones to look to finish the person that we're looking at the world. But be going to be the time to be able to be talking about the world. And that we'll have to look at the technical talk and we're going to try to find that with us and highlight what we're also going to be going to start with those questions. That's going to be wondering if we're going to have been doing some questions is going to give us in terms of our question. We're going to be going to give people that the world that's going to your stuff going to talk about the slides, but there's what we're going to make a couple of a lot of months and what we never trying to show you. But then you're just want to, it's all the people can. We want to remember what's going to tell you who are trying to say? Because you. You can come more or know, you can see on. And to have a couple of time for a lot of years ago, the people to be able to help us to tell the best time for you. And first thing I think the quality of the goal and how to introduce you how can I have to think that the audience. And I can we have to share our whole feature? So this is going to worry about this kind of course, we do we have a lot of a slide, how we go to do we have this we go to get one-time community, how you know, please, how do you get some interesting things to the person in a lot of what you like we have the other pieces. And so much energy is the only one of time we're going to have to be an open source conference as well in the time. So I've been doing these questions here, the first of the power, the first thing I'm talking about the end user is to do. And kind of course, I'm an open source team from the main talk of the most of the last year. I'm going to be just going to talk to do with the open source projects and the community and see that we'll know, and the project that we've been using CripPad. So that. And then we have a good we have a new community site in real time in the job in the project. So, which would even if we need to share software involved in the people to be long time. We're going on the whole project of the world and the other components of my day. We're going to give people are we're in the whole number of all the things that they have the software that we've had to start with that I'm very much for the world. So, we've seen in the start our community and we have been doing our folks for people who is we're talking about a good initiative which is not the people at a bit more, we want to present the most of the open source world today. And we really, we
