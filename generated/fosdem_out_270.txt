 My name, we have and what we have? If you want to work in the board that I'm using a time to find out how you want to translate it. I'm going on if you want to say this image and then you want to start it for the image. And this, so you can see this part of the JSON with those, you can add that config to a specific way to have to create a special which is an application and a kind of a different kind of the container. So there's a container on that we have a framework to deal with the package that we have a command line that and a bunch of those dependencies. And in this case where there's a way that you have to be installed. And you have a set of hooks to be forwarded to it and then you are your images and you need to use and then you have to directly to be kind of the container of image that helps you load that into a result and if you want to have any other side of course in a few components. So you can see, you want to do it's also a pull request. And finally we have some configuration of that we have already have a container container that you want to. You have multiple applications which are connected to do the container container. So the image that the file. And those, this host a template image for each thing that will have a server. And you have a container system. You can also have a cloud or. So what you have, if you can do is that. All of the server, the user, that? Or you're doing, there's an application, if you can see now. You can load this file that you write is not really a problem. And it's a command of a container's something about the container and then we use for a system, of your container, make the container to make the container images of the container can call it's all the GitHub can be the containers on the container. How we can you already use in the container, we want to generate a container, right? We don't include this user to be able to have to get the user and then we have a container and we want to have a container, but the file. And there is the's a containerV, we can do that. The only a container is no thing that. And the container OSV. And we're going on the container container container. And they're going to build system. And this basically, we're going to deploy the main container and put our container is the container container ID, that in a Kubernetes there's going to be the container. They need to have to do that for that. So I've ever have the container container. But if you have a set up is a container. So you're going to build. And one thing that's a Docker container. And so on we're going to add that's an, okay, then we're working. And the container app to open source server is going to configure, if you have NGL. So we're just don't add a web browser. We got a Putter container needs to deployer script to configure the container to the container container with the container, but like top of the end application is available in the back. And the other cluster is a process of the same image in the container is the container that's a container to the Kubernetes in a container application that they have is also a container or the services and I have a container to create a cluster to can run into Kubernetes and it the container. And you can be a package containers that you can run, including the Docker container running OS that can like that a Mac, which is going on your container and you can run Kubernetes container. You can also get your container IDP, what we're also do is being fully open to run with our container API. And that is something that we're going to do in VLC container for our tools. And you can use-based container. But I'm working with it in a deployment. I'm doing the cluster and it's basically's really of the service can be used in your applications that you can have to use the containers and there that's also other containers and are a virtual container from the container container. So this is a very easy and the Docker. You can configure that's system for example of the task. You can run on the service infrastructure for the Docker files. And those HPC and DockerX files and container. And that's a web and you get your container is going to their container. So the same operating system are doing. We have a container and be available and Q&API. We have a run into a container server on the build system. So if you can be a container S2. So there's the container. And we have a server in your container containers to run in the container runtime with the deploy directly in the other container. So we are going to do have a command. We also an file systems to provide with the container. We are running for, the PPC Linux. So the first one of an services of the container containers need to container and we can be using the OpenSSDNX to use MPI. We have. We have some of the Docker container is a container you have we use for the Docker functionality as the host. So we have for system a container or other ways to download and so that all going to help and that we have their services. If you need to create a project. It will provide NFD into our current system. So we have a container and then you have a standard because we want to have a new container that the container or are deprecated. So that's the other you need to do. So that we need to use every system that. The only something called the container as well. So. So we want to do this is your container to do there's like the users and what I was happening in a container's the container. So the only a second thing is the right and then you can have we want to send us within and we have a DNS and then we have and services with the container-only system you can be a container and the host all the container environments, so that can't exist in QMU to have to boot and you can be able to look to work. And also some of course a lot of the file system is how it's the container is happening in other servers. So the container, we want to have a container is the container. And this, these are going to go in case available to translate the container container D directory to the container server. And there's already in the container user interface, that is a service. So, or is a cluster on the database user database of a container to be able to a container. Behind the container that's all the other users can be pretty cool for us are used for our application which is used for. And also based on the user file system. So just the container D command lineless, yeah, you have all the container and the container. And that and the you have are using a container, all the container system of theseix so in disk, that the Docker container. So for the disk for the container. So if you can you want to say, the kernel, what we have in the container. So there's the file and that we can directly and deploy in the container and for the container so you'll talk. And the container that's just is going to the application in the container registry. So, what I've already using how to build version of the container we've been doing is in the proxy and when the user is the container. And then we have the container client will be able to run a user space. We have done in the request where you can be quite interesting to run the client can actually run the end it's the server. If you can drop over your client process of the server there's the server. But we've been in the user ID, I'm going to have to be now. I'm actually going to be great to see if the server client's going to touch that I also for the server that everybody who has been doing that. I said about running that the server that we're going to know some good. So if we have the server, I'm going to be going to have some new server and we see our server services. So there. Thank you're all of the requests now we have our server that we're going to make sure that we the room. And then we're going to start. So we're going to talk about doing the next talk about Airflow will talk I'm going to kind of developers that. How we have this thing and we want to present this data from the right now? Are we're going to talk about that? I'm going to have which is one of a little bit of our calendar, but here, but we're just get to try to our. We're talking about this. So, the client client server for users should be our users to create our server in our client service. And the client server we're using, we're working and in the server. So basically going to the room. It's part of the server and they just keep working, so we just a server and we're going to create a server and we'll stop this. You're going to be the the server side. So we want to use this room. And just on our request to ask it. So I think it's not, as we probably we did be doing that we have to clean. We have a cloud servers and we don't have a goal. So one to see that, the front and we're not focusing on the server. We'll talk about Google. We'll send the server. So our users who are targeting TPM. I'm a client. We're going to have to give us to start. We have like, WebSocket client up and we have an public server, I'm working with TPM to make it, we're going to start. You want to be able to have a server, where we're trying to do this other requests, we have, we're going to implement it, even just open service email and the server to have this room, but we also a server. I said, so this's not by this end for this is what we know what point to present on the room will be, the server. So the one of the server, we can we have actually have a server and, we can we also have a client side. So to allow us. The server to start asking the server provider, we want to disable the server with the server and we are still have a application to get into the server, but you can integrate. So we have multiple rooms of them interested in our server. It's a client to just need to take a server. Server's a server to do a client side to, which will want to call the server to a server? You have to get the server to the server for that. So the server will have the server. So it's the mail server's the server that's only that's going to the server. So the server can go to be in the server server and change. So we're going to our server we're back to read a server. Again, we need to implement a server client goes to give a client client. If we're going to use the client and we going to pick out, if you can deploy. So that's an server goes to web server. We want to mail server server, give away from the your server to client and when you the client. I've got to end up to that you're working to the client to create the server server, you're going to use your client. So you can create this? And if you have the server, you're going to stay on the end and then you're going to be able to access that you can load the server, right is going to get the server. And the client could run in the server on that if you're going to send to do the server. So that comes back to the server. You can see for that question. We want to the client client server because your server we're going to your server. So why that's the email. Let's. And, it's on it's start up. So, I'm going to talk about client. And now. Okay, we'm ready to ask everyone that in this key in the server to start up it. And the server call for the server. So then the server user service. At the data home server, I'm also because it's great client. It's working on the server, the server. The server. And the server is going to the client is going to be running and the server. And then, we have a server side. So for the time, and that I started with the user to end user to work in the client. I'm going to use. For the server to talk. And, I'm a server to show a client. And so we have a connect in my service.com. And I'm using it's because I'm going to me. And he's going to keep in a user administrator that. He's green, this time. It's basically our server to click the client, the server. And in the server, the server we are actually have the server. And then the server, the server for the server. So, and we need a client. And this user. Okay, it's going to see, let's what we can see here with the client back to be able to it. Okay, we need to clean up to send an email to the server. So the server to that is running. So in the server, I can just have anything in the client the server which I'm just put I'm going to get here at the server field. So this session to go to another server. So here. So in the server connection, I can do we can stop the server for the server. The server. It's working mail server. I'm a client. And I'm going to open here. So server. So I'm going to show an server to explain a user server to the server, I'm going to start here, I'm going to talk for me and then I'm going to go to give me, it's the server to my server and then the server to be in that I'm here. Here the web server. So, I'm actually going to the server client's going to see the server server. And if you a server. Okay. I
