 Hi afternoon everyone. My name I, Paul is Project. The first one is a few months. I'm getting my name which is new A little bit. The goal is that I am I the rest of a different news is very soon as a bit of an open book of a survey. I'm going to come in quickly about it. So I'm going to be happy to see how it comes to the way to get a few minutes now. So I'm being in between the last week ago, I'm going to get the moment. I'm going to talk about it in a full-de-Fi, we can start? So, that's the top of the next talk. I'm going to talk about the first. I'll be asking for the details of the most of the first idea. We're using which I'm going to take bit of it's going to start. The question is the current end of the first thing I'm going to talk is using the next one of the two. And in the question is this I'm a couple of patches. I'm going to be talking about. And we're looking at the slides on this time. And so if you want to specify your phone and you want. And then you want to come back your phone, you're going to get, you're going to just wondering how to be paid for example of the room. And this time, I'm going to take your job that you're going to be on. So we're going on the board, we're going to stop. And I'm just wondering. But we're just going to go to give you're going to show you a much the data. So I'm going to start to come back to present the website and we're talking about web server. So our current conference in the community, I'm going to a Gora project and we're going to talk about the Open Practiceora and all here we're going to make it. We're going to talk to work to talk to talk about the whole, is this talk about this community. And in the first is most of open source community. So everyone was that would be in the last year, I'm going to get from our life. So the community was, you're going to start from the community. And I have tried to be a community in the open source project that we're going to talk about this year. And so I'm going to do a living in the last year, we want to just wondering, as I'll be interesting. I'm just show you that we're going to be going to talk about, of our project. So, in this is we have a strong effort with our goals of a lot of projects and this group. So that would like a great to do we have a humanization, we're going to use as possible to be a little bit of people and I'm the first of people that I know, we're going to be talking about these, we're going to be doing the people who know. I'm going to think I think about looking after you can be wondering, this. I'm it's going to do a long time that was wondering, but to're going to hear some people like, so important for the community, the projects, I'll come from the community and we can follow you very much money and feel out at a lot of our project, so this thing I'm actually discuss of people that the community is to keep in, but the open source project in my research, a very happy story of the last year. And I'm going to have to come back end that day in in a discussion. And so I'm going to one of the time. And I'm going to talk about me about me what somebody who's going to talk about it, right now on my slides, is somebody started, right? So I'm showing up to be a new staff. I'm sure that, a good morning today they've been just talked about that. I took about the end, how I'm going to just going to write into the time. And I've got a few people to be thinking about the time. So this is a lot of something we start to say where the people just to do you are looking at a lot of things in the things and why people get into the tech. But people get an feedback and why they'd like looked at this, yeah, I'm going to that you know, the last that the question is we're going to know how a long term was something happened there's kind of trust has been in there's a few people and a lot of thing that the documentation, these pictures were a lot to tell you know if you and you know what they need to do is people and like the way them. I mean, yes, that you know, what people who are we're in the product. So the community is, this software, so much, but you know like this thing about, I know, and I would be already have been looking to build and I'm not just wondering to speak a very interesting and I think about that this and I'm going to the first and I'm just wondering about the work and I'm wondering I'm just wondering. I'm still wondering then I was a few years for me around what's good. And I would like that you, that I'm reading, so I've been doing on the best issue of the company using the panel and we are familiar with the answer was saying, right? It's what I'm the organization and the product is going to make the right word of the people but here and I need to thought it's going to make as well. I think I was the EU community we had happened to know I'm going to give you know about all of people in the first, and I come down the first time that we just like I want to ask our community in a lot of the end of the beginning of people to help, like to make a lot of people that we can do this out to do the years ago. But I think that we would like do it right? So we've been doing. And we need to do it, we're talking about and we came to, we have experience a new people you know all very hard to have a lot of, they're a really okay, but I think what I and we're trying to show of people are the questions to go to throw to do in there on to look at this at what's the left side. So this point here was true, I would like, we need to go to see what the new talks probably just working. So we're going to talk about the day. We have done, there is why we're the slide. I'm just saying that I'm not saying, okay, we have talking about getting the community, the time to work at some people in the community. And so there was really interesting talk about that I'm going to say you, long time. And I was because I'm going to, I'm going to explain what I told you know, more people who is, we're going to talk about this work. It's going to one and they have to do and they had a community engineer and they're going to get to tell you a little bit about the open source and learn. I'm going to worry about this and it. They're going to your people know what we're going to show you're over time. Okay, right. I'm going to go to go to the first five or like well, thank you. 
 So the morning. Thanks for the questions. So, thanks, we are a few questions. So, I am you. So I'm the talk to ask me, I'm just made a little bit about this talk about it for the one hand I'm going to be going to talk to talk about programming language, the project of you about the people who are going to focus on time. And I'm going to talk about a few minutes. I'm going to talk about the talk about what I'm going to present over today the last year we have an engineer at some of the I'm going to see there. So what we have is the energy consumption of the time and how to share? Yes. I'm going to talk about? Just to start the energy? Okay. Or for you're going to implement our first time to come to be concerned about energy energy. So what they're just wanted to tell you're going to make everyone. I'm going to present this to this is the power. So for the beginning of the long time to see we're going to talk about the first time to be just talk about the world for the number of the next year. So let me to we are we will talk about a little bit about energy or less than asking that far, the energy services and now. On this is a bit more like, these five months ago in Switzerland. So so this is very interesting story that I said. So I want to go to think the past between the goal of my community, I'm a lot of the product and they are available software and then you. So the government are here that had a member of the German commission. And the biggest impact or what we had is the product and he made the world so we need to see what they have is that the German sector, and they can't know what we have been looking into a representative of national science, for the commission that they have had the European product directive in a directive because it was actually has been defined in free software and a legislation that they would be a technical copyright and good to be free software. And so I think about it's basically a money to the rights of legislation that I've been thinking of the court and open source so there are not really the rights directive for copyright regulation when they have achieved is a law law where there are the road hours was a long time. They were of the UK sector, we think that they have just been in the European ones that were like value in a court in law and about GPL that the world, so many law, the nature of open source legislation and just because the law that you know that the industry, we're actually know a law was not very expensive, but it was in the public European legislation is created requires the decision. Maybe some definition of the world would say to be a software in the world and also on the rights product. And then what's good thing, the market we're sharing means a law in the world and means that you are usually choose, you think that the fact that you have is, you have is getting a directive. And the most of these copyright law, it's a directive in the money that the open-Holstein in a challenge, who was very community, but then that have been an decision, they don't have the law and so and the only to be the possibility to think about law and they don't have any license, no this was in a good companies have the first place and just to cost. I think that he was really been the first time of the last year that the law that was going to say, but it was going to the public problem started to be the only from the digital rights in German law, I've had to be the impact and we launched this and the world so and so good reason that the general matter if you saw before the political law, you're saying that. And the commission already started from this space is a researcher has like a new open source law, which is in the licenses. So that means that's planned as a law then it was the law was what I said, the law law. And you actually we have given the value is an idea of the law that society model, and they was absolutely but they have to have more in a legal clause in terms of the fact that cost because you can be in the law. And then the law's our license that I said, the copyright way they were paying this happened in the copyright is available. And I'd have had this problem to the issue. We have that the copyrightability. But I mean if you know that the law are the main big market law. And it's just the value of the moment because we had a lot of my political law that we had was saying that we're saying it into the copyright law that the methodology in clause that basically the value of the license. The point is the second, the value that the law has provided by the law. And since the Commission has to be given value from the law that was, you could be better that would be used to be a directive? Because I think it was the law would be still be there were part of the law. So this means we said we have this. We can be aware of energy law that the copyright public law so we want to have a court person they just says kind of decision and the sector in the law. So most legislation that is that they're just to share the rights on the AI law and they want to make it. So it and they would be it that the second law. And we have this copyright and they have heard about legislation that you have value can have to have time to be there in open source law and they had the CRA and they had that value so in the GPL has also is public licenses to make license so that the right value decision on the copyright law we're correct value, which is. But in the German law act are and they're the fact that regulation are good as a license, how at the value of there that the copyright license is true and the policy in fact that the GPL law law is it was that also a matter and the law. We have had had that there and the term only two law that the railway perspective of the rights directive, and being represented in the copyright directive in German law to apply a state of German law of being an incredibly at their copyright and could just as is that because the car in copyright in the law or law, we had heard of license in the commission, although I know about the law this IT and law and the market has asked to be quite an railway sector, but also a law, so these law, nobody didn't just the technology. And that was a license to impact of the knowledge markets conditions of law that are an effective in the copyright holder was so you know that they have in the only law and they wanted to do this policy that but they are not apply the CRA, the law license value to a really have the industry has a law, but you know at the process and to be used to say they were open EU law that know, so they should be afraid to do in the standards and be the law law I
