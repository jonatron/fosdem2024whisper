 Hello everybody to talk my colleague by the time to talk about the French company. So I'm here to talk about this. So I'm the University of the community. And I'm going to highlight. The first time I've seen this one that I'm going to show you what are I'm wondering to tell me how I've got to your social co-oneieel-based about the open source, how it works on this is a couple of I've been a little bit better, a month of years ago and I'm going to show a couple of months at a couple of years ago. I'm going to talk about it, so what about how we're going to do you're going to get the open source projects that happens to get done in the moment. And ultimately this one of this is the world went into the EU. It was really a huge idea is that's open source software and a great part of the public ecosystem. But I started to have been in the things like a year. You could be focused on this point. And I think I guess the last year. So I'm here we're here on our talk a little bit about the workshop and the idea is that we're talking a couple years ago. I'm not going to be a year by the PLD was actually a company. And so I've seen that we're actually get to be a lot more of companies to go ahead and we're coming from our product and we're going to us to talk about to the foundation who's like to just saying this people that's again. So thank you are much for everyone so much for the world and when we're going to talk to continue to note here at the first week. And we've got the software engineer but we going to work to be just talk about. I have a little bit nicer talk to do. So how we want to introduce your talk about the communities in the most people. I'm going to start being. But we need to be a member of the year. And we need to talk about how many years. But right now I'm already had the project of this and we had to think that was probably have a lot more the journey because we had to get the people who were like to talk and we did a few people had funding and like the year. So we've been trying to be worried about the problem that I said our talk here is the first presentation. I was I'm done and I have been doing a project around the last year about it was just being working on the last year ago, so we were working on it was I get very much more questions to get too much time up to that we have been doing there and being able to this was we know, do have changed with this and we have been the community and we have a company that we are talking about the projects that we want to know about energy team that everybody who are talking about the first year and we have been thinking about the panel. We've tried to start doing this year. And we want to have been the years before, we really happy to get worked to people as a kind of us to get into making people to work on the way from that we wanted to what we could bring me the first year. It was we've been a long time to talk to be able to the first one individual group in national rooms that've worked really the companies and the world and then have been trained on this was an initiative. And it's the fact that became in a long time was what we've been to be a lot of a very quickly came from the first two years about the years before we saw yet and I've had nothing was maybe some of the best day you've been working on the community. And it and the best ones and we're really do you know why we're going to use was from the time right away up doing the commission. And unfortunately. And we might be even on the meeting the CRA right room, we have been actually going to start each time to work at the first presentation. Still trying to be a lot of the work, but we have been doing the session because people then the world started in the first thing that the presentation was the beginning of the future and the community going to set was finding through this to take out and we should work. That was happening on the work in the system as the full time for the public transport world. Yep. And a few people who was done was very recent years was a lot of this year. And yeah, I think I said that we want to do like our strategy and as well, and we could do, we need to open source people who made more as well we've done. So we need to think the energy funds, we also made to have said it. So our last time we've before we have all the world. We've got the work a few more organizational had a very nice point for the first year. So we've had a lot of the world that we had our success in the world. And if we had to get a few questions because we had a very much energy, we had we have been doing a long time for both in a lot of standards and we have been doing this open science and we had a community and we were discussing doing this year. We had to maintainer is if we had to get the world for us that for us worked on the world. And we also there were talking to get started trying to try to help us to keep the whole world to do we have time to get a large corporate society to actually our software. And so we had started working on the end to try to be really have time. So I just to be talking about what we've been working on the time. And you know there's true for the community because there is what it's being speaking. And at the European Commission because we're, we're working on the point, I think we bring us in the time. And we'm using WordPress conference and you know about the world collaboration on the world. And the panel, we want to be all of funding and in IT community. We don't have to see we're wondering all, because they're quite an end up here into the foundation. And so they're talking about the world and I'm just wondering. He has the legislation. And I'm just wondering that means that young people have been a law started doing and so much more of that we've been talking to spend the way to the world, but the licenseeum is going to do that would be part of whether they have been the world. And there was going to be a year? That's a photo in the German Commission has a bit harder to be a way. I think was wondering on the world and the best panel is also a lot of freedom. He used to try to find the EU that we're also have a thousand people that like people are doing that. We have been seen it's the commission of court of tech and we're going to do the law that they're going to have the commission that had to spend more of the EU, we want to be able to be to call to think very much. The panel. What we're going to actually has been looking at the civilTech. I've ever heard that I'm going to ask a second one of the commission and we're going to be not seeing some people who who can going to be trying to do it with it the organizations out that I'm going to be the public world and which we were just trying to be super sure the whole Association, the election it was trying to come back to be a really an open source law in into the first companies and he's the world of the people. And so the copyright rights act a practice of law liability makers will let's the term of open source software. And I have a certification to be asking for not going to be a political law. The I'm going to ask in the value I'm going to be the commission to be the commission to be taken at in the commission was, but I'm just a point. What is an energy under the product really excited, since the IT and the organization, it was just to the EU court policy. And on the whole scope of the Commission and saying that they're going to be the regulation in the law, I said to be in a sustainable projects. So the beginning of the law. So the third law, so we'd be the government organizations to the licenses in the policy, therefore they could be developed the problem with a moment. And so far as I was made a first parties of the European Commission in the liability sector and a definition of a copyright member party directive in the EU law. And so because that's a policy and it's a copyright sector and the German commission would be adapted to climate rights by law society and also making open source law. And we could the directive. And in the data center of people were now the commission and I had to be a question because they got a license would be very important for a copyright company. So I've ever remember a decision. They're about the person can't had been a number of law to participate in the public law. So we've been on the policy and these really thought the court had to that, but just that's also needs the idea in last 15 years ago and the law, we got to do not think they should just spent as clear for the law and again. We have had asked for one person that you know that person or maybe we had the law field of the copyright they're developing organizations did a paid they're saying commission and they know what they realize that the problem in the way they're not only law at that if you know that legislation can kind of the law, from the fact open source law is the source market was working is not great to the regulation that not in 2019, I was just saying what there was happening in tech institutions and we got to be. And I've had, we had to be asking of two laws in that they have the law, two people who was by the German law in 2019 was my law and I thought in German directive and he asked that just had was the world to stay a years ago from the laws and money to understand that is like the law, how they have made in German, we had a legal law that on and they were there were in the copyright commission, was the law were a country was legal to influence the US that was part of US and they were saying that as we had to get three European law because that we saw in that since the German, which was originally has been a copyright directive and in law in a bad court when households had been asked 2023. And those first two dollars and there were the directive under law and but they had you know from the copyright law and they didn't solve money over there was law to the democratic regulation of the scope of that they still been invented was that was in and since the parliament were out to be sure to Drupal has had a reason that we have given long and they were a number and they weren't start asking my law and that they had a value of law, which we didn't just been talked about law as they were a law. And the infringement space of licenses in the German infringement forces was the license is actually came with, but that they said some rights and I think that was law of the copyright market in Europe was the law. So the fact that was already reached wrong and in terms of course they were just needs it was announced in the EU and the copyright law was a law from copyright GPL law that have this court law and especially, but it was pretty exactly that was open law has a data, but so yes, they had a GPL law on the licenseep for this law and they had only that was about the commission, and the UK law would be the copyright is the last year. I would not allowed me a law and they thought that it was the copyright, but they did personally asked it was there was a directive and the money and they would be a law really difficult that they want to always been able to do there that a copyright license to even really feel that you know that did already had for regulation and they had a copyright law and and they had to say they did they actually say the value in practice in it would have a sense, and they were just should kind of the copyright as far as, as well, and they were kind of being that we could be a copyright that into the copyright money in the license would be the problem that I think they were kind of what they would want to change so as important value, but they needed to know that they can we want to be going to do that they could do have to do that, which is you know like came from the copyright was to keep a thought we need to think if they even then we still have to think the copyright way the copyright value. And we mean that if they would help that they are free market in the commission for that the trademark now that they would be aware of the right on the directive. I had a free law was that's just means that was not the digital value from the legislation that there were it's not just a law and a law that was in the law and a law and generally saying that I initially was a civil cost of commission, that they asked for they had this time but they were all that they've made a open source license that they received a GPL wasn't allowed to think there was not good from that that made for a GPL law proposal in open source law, but you thought they were our law because they were not in the commission open source, but at the law of the time. And I know, so I think it was someone was in the court was asked the government is always a law has worked as far that if the copyright law cannot take into the most of copyright law for that I'm happy to that this infringement. But it was not just open access to be open source law that in the law law, oh he was probably was here. The law and I got to the law because he was then they didn't, for law, but they had to an open source law was the law and therefore they're talking about the law. They're quite a law in the fact that GPL people just to be very far the German law to the law they're not enough rights there was not asked that that they see the law as the law policy is going to and they were on and they had this to be affected and they're thinking that they would get started just because they had heard of the law was the law so they would be more in law that at that they actually a legal rights EU policy commission, but they're just could be involved in that could
