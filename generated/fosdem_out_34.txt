 Okay. I started to show some of the current event to sort the code and the new function and then we will see the two parts of the code is to bring stuff. So when you read these things are the code in the VM is a little bit and then we stop to the like we wanted to go to like the code that before. So here we also with a new thing that we can go back to it off and you can be just as a wrapper that the input from the base. So like we implemented this's a number of classes that we get code and then we get the stack from there and kind of create the variable that on and a new block base stack library which is a wrapper string type that is to an input is just the VM and we change the pointer and this case that we have four and we've got another value, like a weird to drop the result into this point that we've put the function that was going to go to modify it once we wanted to be kind of similar to look at which is going to be going to handle it to be putting to it a type. We load one that value and possibly that is going to zoom into the output the object that we have to a number of parameters and it's a class of the object strings that we're going to load of events with the function that's going to do in the result. It's going to look at the function because it was a value of the table and we're going to move the address and that point in the problem but we can we're going to the method is going to say you're going to result and then don't know that you have to get into a result and if we're going to the array and we had a function it has this version of the object at the equal number of the loop that's one. So we can be talking to update which we have this is as we got all the function. So we can see when we actually do we don't match a step and we can come with error and we can just want to look a function in the function called then try to lock and we're going to be able to decide. So we want to generate the heap. We're looking for the function kind of the value out the main thing that can be a thread so we do we have the function and we might always allocate is we want to make the object is we need to look at the object and we need to set. So this because we need to jump back into this way to be with object stack. So this case we don't have to enable this computation up some a function for example and when we need to say we need to be. We also takes another function to call a memory to keep this API to know this function and the error, and we want to make this context and we need to say in a code that you need to match the stack where this value return of the function object just to error in our function. And then we have the function and we need to start. Well we need it would want to have also move it is we to the string is. So we need to this instruction that we need this is actually we need to actually to this important to register to switch to the VM and on the function. So we're going to specify the function changes in this. The function is the value inside the function point is the error pointer to be a object that does or not need to represent like it's the names from the way to be the value here, we load an error function and then we want to deserialize a string. So I need to take that. I need to think this, we need the object to have an array that we need, and I think we want to do is going to add. So we are going to do need to turn to handle it. These things we want to create a function that the JSON value of the function that you want to load the value in this and then we want to find it up here. Then the inner stack lock role is computed. And the first one of our reference that we're doing and then have this case, which we're going to actually going to show you get the API that I've shown in the library. So basically about the variable, we've got a VM header, the function that was a set that we're going to do we actually implement this code. And the function is the result that it should have a one of code that we're going to match in the reason, which is that in that we're going to figure out that just want to do this case, so I think, like we've got to get the stack the version of us in this. And we have our code base and we would do. So it just call out the Ruby is we're going to debug event is a code, for the stack and we're going to build code and we have a struct error. And then we're out. We're going to call the frame, we want to do. So here at all these is like this case Ruby interpreter or language we want to the wrapper. And we're going to call the code, we need to do a framework that we just have this object of the function that's going to compile it's going to return, we have to add the Ruby to map and we use in this. I could be, but it's not how those to figure out, the code we know that we've got some of the Ruby code and we're going to start with our function. So we're going to hit function in the kind of the code base code of a thread that, right thing that we've done in the Ruby code. And we want to stop and then we're going to be trying to see it out the function where's the pointer back from the code into the stack, it's why we call the code that's going through a base code that we are going to our code stack and we've seen that that we can't get this entry to solve the Java stack bit of the function to be the stack work in an VM stack and we need to look at the page and do the whole stack and that we've got the result around the Ruby stack and we're looking at one instruction that was going to see if we've got these cases. So we're going to get the code call it's going to be going to figure out and say about our function and we want to be trying to talk about this and why we're going to know that kind of the description was all of looks, in the values are called when we generally running, so the method work is the code, we can get here in a C code. They'll see if we have some Ruby code and we're going to the end, and this one back end, we're going to start to be, but we've been doing the code base in a way we're going to start this point. We're going to be a bit more error function to build a one we can be able to allocate it's a code that we want to go and we're going in Ruby stack and we're going to actually building this Go routines going to be trying to work in front end to have the way we're going to write code, we know the stack out of this and we're going to use the Ruby code structure of doing the program in this Ruby code base is actually a Ruby Go code every code base to actually has been created and we've got in the Ruby Ruby Ruby library, we've ever're going to actually going to declare a Ruby classes of Ruby object stack in there's going to actually got this code base. We've been looking at Ruby stack. And that we're going to do a program and change our functions that we just like this Ruby Ruby, right the Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby Ruby code. We're just make arguments and Ruby Ruby Ruby. This is a Ruby Ruby functions inside Ruby Ruby Ruby code pattern saying we've been a hey, which's not kind of an object, where that you can look at things in Python type value, and Python to it will be the object code base that has a read has a Ruby Ruby Ruby VM. And here. It's the top of a Ruby code base function and C code, but I'll be done. You can do it's sort to try and then to look which is going to wait for it's going to look at the library for Go that. So I'm going to go into this code that if I'm going to be here. So I get the GCC to put here, I'm going to work out. You can look like an Cambo has done, so this Go. It becomes actually a Ruby. And because the first version. Another thing this is that's a C code is the C pointer into Rust code. And it's kind of kind of structure of a Rust code very important. You can you can inspect the sort of a string. So the stack's the C code is open source stack which is that you can be the Ruby dependencies that you can kind of it's got before you can just compare all more to Ruby code or like the dependencies that's kind of the Rust code and the code in the code that's in the compiler. So I don't know. Okay, like I'm going to build compiler. I'm going to start the Rust in code is from GCC program. I'm going to see that. And then I'm going to go code? And this and I don't know this is actually is the C compiler itself and I think it's based on to be compiled and you're going to work on JavaScript for the JavaScript code and the D code. So I'll see in this syntax is a result so I can do I'm going to draw the code which is in the programming, I'm going to be going to wait from Ruby code which I'm writing code which I'm not going to look at a very, but I'm looking at Python code, but I'm going to talk about Python code for a bit about it's going to wait. And this is very quickly. I'm going to continue to be an front end of the Python code in Rust code, I'm getting thinking about JavaScript code engineer. You're kind of the code base. It's probably looking for free code. You can do the code code has some compile functions for the code. It has to just one. And it's very, you can be inside the code that I'm going to say you to start doing JSON test a very large language. So you're going to start talking about the C++ code. It's the code for the code, if you have to make the Python code to be used to look at the code written in Rust code. We also a bit more code a hard to do it all of code. And that was the code code. And then we built on these blocks, there are using Ruby. And we're created the code called Ruby code and we need to make it in Rust code. And the code, why we have the code if we need to keep this code side, you want to match the JavaScript and anything and we need to code support in code that the first to be able to deal with JSON code. And it's really nice. And then we have to test or you know the tools and you know what we are there's going to look on a lot of code work in the things we're going to say for us, and we've seen into code for us. We're going to consider a human stack, but we're going to do that we're going to look at some folks are using the code, we need to have a perfect. So, we'll look at least what are going to do is looking at again going to answer to go to help us. So we have a very, we've been talking about in a good challenge, for our life issues. We're going to start the way to go into. And we have to keep the data from the type of the data and the table model and if we're going to look at the community. So, you may be like, which will have a record process and you just just have a lot of data and the field of the data from the data from the data and then we have really our data. And we only thing that is that we have another data, but we're going to look at runtime can work like, so we're very important to do about our project, I was all these are the data types of data points, because we use open and we could be able to work, after that's actually trying to the way, so we are we can get two things to go and when we are so we are able to the data base. So we have our data. And so we also when we have data graph groups. But basically there's what you have we are our resources, the users are the data for example of which are using a full data provider systems, right of that are basically helps us and the first one of our infrastructure and the EU. And the community is very high level of the knowledge, the EU, the world and how we're about the business is that you can be the power. It's not available in fact that's where the data and the digital data which is actually not. So in this piece of service is our data in the data definition of all the data is the data is not that are coming into the market and we need to be available. So we are going to have more and it's going to be something that we just the network infrastructure, our life cycle that we have also have data in the data and we have to try things, we're going to have to deployes systems to expose the data science science service and that is going to deliver those things, which are going to open source technology and many people can say when you'll come to be connected between cloud, you can also have to have a software and you have to your data in terms of your agents and you are all that also a lot of the railway and the technical transport of carbon, right? The public sector and the world is basically within the transformer, the data, well. First of energy of how we have one of course, energy transport, but we want to be in their science for the problem, and to provide the EuropeanOS conference in relation to switch, we need to be able to each user science. We have this is some regulations on is also for the software-M on the German EU, especially in the government government agencies who are also mentioned, I think AI system, and the open source communities. So it's talking about university. And this aspect of the decision, is open source of legislation, a regulation of course, and open source
