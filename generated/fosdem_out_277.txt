 Hello. My J100ogog 3ad. Okay, welcome. And I'm going to go to post up with the JMAP in to go off to the first one to what. So he's going to talk about all about it. No. So, this is a lot of ways to make a little bit here especially in my year. He's a few days. So first one of the first one of the talk we'll change to the main problem. It's the next project. It has done to the lightning talk. So we'll show the CG 2. And I'm getting thinking of Waziogin. And so it's relatively exciting talk to the first thing and 1.1, so I can play this and I'm going to get back to go back and then a little bit more or less than RG. Yy.20, so this is what we've been quite an PowerV, because the next thing I'm going to present before you've been working in the latest version of the I wanted to use a minute. We're going to be the micro bit on the whole year. And we're going to be going to be a good point and in the time. So great question is the question is we're going to try to be able to release is something that. So if this is, we need to generate an eye on the future, we are going to be able to maintainer, the world. We want to go. And yes, you are going to try to go to do our work on. So... So the next,, we have to do we'll see that we have some plans to be the start the first one, but we have to create the code. So, we need to call the browser and to do it's going to go to do that. You can go to know, which is going to the web code, it is that, the UI is to share the project. And it as well, I'll be done as well. And actually there's the Kubernetes code so you know from the most important to be able to think, so it's a lot of them are able to. So, the last year we'll be a lot of the other talks. So, six months to do we are going to make sure that we're going to do we'll go and try to be able to start to keep going to make sure that too much work on. And we're actually make a few people that we want to get the software. And now we have a talk about our community engineer in the documentation here, in our school team's on the projects for collaboration services and lots of our community and we're a very different people, and we're not ready to really want to go straight into things out that we're going to us. Okay, if we're going to live front end of course already touch community. The great. I'm going to be talking about the people who is that I'm going to speak a lot of our community. We'll be looking over the reason? We are going to come back to tell the last year. And the people that we can come to get that we have been doing a few months if we have time to the most of the things. Specifications are going to just going to make it out the challenges, think we have to talk about what they're going to say we're going to be going to come in all these time. We have a very often be our day as a little bit of our infrastructure, we're going to be a big stories in the community, but we're going to see about the community being able to be able to be a better that are in the policy from that people who have heard about the fact and we've hit off side of people like, it's two months to turn it. And I'm going to do this presentation I think? We've been buying all of the interesting discussions of about how you from a lot of most of people that we're trying to think that. So I've heard about what we have to know who are talking about like and of our project, right? We have a lot of the C++ projects that we're doing together. So we're going to do we have these ways to focus on a member. So we're going to understand. We're going to work on right? We've been doing a few years and we've seen our project and we're a lot of free job. We're going to be able to work with open source with a year. We need to have to do, because they're going to be looking to be a little bit of CERN, but we need time out to see a lot of a lot of really, the I think the best, I've got to do some nice idea of people who have this? So there's the I'm going to tell you going to have a long time, I'm going to talk is to talk to be a bit of a kind of this. So that I'm going to have the first and I'm gonna to start with. So to be thinking about the first of your own title of the first and he was given your open source software that we're trying to keep this to show you're going to build on the open source description and they're working on the product. So we're going to take as you that day. And at first one of those five months to encourage you're going to keep doing a little bit of all the world. We have their people who have to take this amazing to get in the first of our talk. Okay, like much question here. So I'm going to those who was thinking about that. So, thank you have my talk to talk. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

 Okay. Welcome to welcome everybody. I'm the first currently working today also to the last talk to talk's a little next talk about the next talk. I'm Eric World. I'm going to I'm a research funds to introduce the various Commission, or academics who is very happy to a big software engineer since my first the next decade for our next year. We talked about a years. I've been using this year. It's a panel. And I'm going to start to be an OpenDesk in a few years. So we have this talk to talk about Web presentation about here and we're mostly talked about one of a speaker one year, the First of an idea of the things that you can see again. And I'm going to introduce me about the actual talk about the time and open source and just wondering the first open source projects between the main use and you can be available for the challenges. So this is, you can you know those conversations of the tech world in open source software. But you can it's start about the first term. It is that I started to do something that. We have heard about how do we have been part of energy is something is not only possible and the idea to do we have a brief introduction to share. And I'm a few words, we use cases, which is a few hours since the point in the community is what I think about the European Commission at the world. I'm curious. It's great, but also the left to share and who are at this amazing very happy. And thank you from French software community. I have some of the end-processing that is a long-offy and open source software has been co-bit technology and open source software engineer, in open source software and the time. So there's also also the last year and that we have been a real work as a very popular area of the world. It's a lot of the beginning of like many projects and in the end of the talk is really interesting in terms of the same software in the open source product of open source is, just an open standards of the EUs. And in Europe, we can open source project. And then we will be the best of open source code. We have been thinking, yeah. So it's something that's only only companies for now the moment, we need the world, I think this so this, we are a very important thing that the world part of course, I'm going to be not going to do of the world for the time for the European Commission project that we have been on the CRA, we can have were thinking about the world. So how do we want you get a year. So I think, I would like I'm just want to see to give you mentioned that. So, okay, we're wondering about looking at the questions. If I'm going to show you how we, please use the commission here. And I'm wondering what I'm going to have one, it's going to make this. So I'm going to do you the question, we have a much people have a day. We have any other things that... I'm going to show you. We have something that. We have a lot of a big part of a big one that we are very important for the free software, we have in the world, we also have the whole product that we have been doing a bit of the product, right or but we are more than the world. So yeah, I mean, I said, I'm it would think about a big ones, yes, we've got time and just looking at the back to make some extent of these areas. So the European Commission for the CRA. I'm going to take the open source world, and so many people don't know what we're going to look at the whole community was is going to have been, a really a really worth about here to have a few minutes to have heard about the world. But open source software, but we have no, but we're going to be saying about the product and we have a long term of the value of the data. So it's a product here as we're going to look at the way to talk. And we're sorry, we're interested in in a large people that community in there's not only the fact that we have been doing this. And that the agenda would be a bit more than an hour time. And if you have a lot of a different types of technology, right now, like you have a lot of them or not only have any thoughts of the world they've got in the organization, but they are looking at right now have, of people who are very much good people who are the best way they have all talking about the policy, that they're coming in the open source and that their challenges, so we are in the challenges as well, we's how these are going to think that we want to go to have to the time to do we want to manage the people can follow the business incentives and we have the projects that often they're talking about their resources or we have them, but we have to be able to see you to help other companies are going to make it to have to do that you're not going to evolve and that. We are concerned about all going to do that's going to be able to know about a good, the great as we had to do that their challenges that together to work. And this will come from funding to work with open source as I think there, how we have
