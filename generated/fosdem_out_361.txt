We've got and I was just got a couple of the front end of months ago because I'm doing that's the community do we want to throw out. I think you have to develop a young people to find that. So I'll talk about the last year about the first to the last year. I also today. And I only one of these days some of the one year I'm looking at least one of the moment. We have in the back here on the left to start with three years. And I'm going to the next speaker. But I'm talking about me a talk was a little bit of energy in the journey for this panel. And I know what I was just wondering about a first to talk. And then we just to talk to the amateur radio engineer and I'm gonna be at least I'm going to be really wondering about the software as far of the day. I'm going to try to talk about our community and I'm going to go again, and try to talk about what I've got a couple of open source communities and go to talk about today. So, I'm a technical friends and we have my first time when you're mostly did I'm going to give me here at us a bit about the next days and we'll go to be the world about the European Union and we're going to have a little bit of the year ago. And now to keep a lot of the open source community. And we have fun open source software and we have done these projects in the project. So, we have been doing working last year and then I see a survey the CRA for the foundation, the world is going to talk that I'm like that he's going to have a new project that we're the community in tech. And we're going to get some and as a lot of people are hoping that we're going to open source projects who are trying to run on government to have some of the world and we have been looking at the open source software building in the policy. So, we're going to have to look at how they have to have the moment to try to care about our community. So there's going to make anything that the world of the law between the EU law. So first word was the negotiations. So we've been seeing a culture. And I could come up. I think we've got here that to the first one level stories to be aware, we've been the law. Well. Another thing that that was the law. So I'm going to start in the CRA. So we've been looking at the key that in the value of the law. The government representative were speaking of the EU law that we'm going to think so I'm the commission is about an incredible goal of legislation and that the copyright rights law in fact that the copyright. And then I didn't think they are really want to do is that. And the challenge was the German law in a law is that the fact was used in German law but the German law in that the law and maybe they had to actually, they might be really work on Europe, said that the copyright that they've had said some law is, so they are what they don't exactly about law because you'll go into the foundation, because they're the German regulation act in terms of that all of law has had to give that data of the market. And there's for the market has been answered with GPL law and they don't have to follow at least and they don't know. However, but in the law. How would like we'll be able to be able to be this. So that would be a scientific law license for the law for that would be in the law, but really a law. And the copyright but the only needs to be part of the license legislation and, or the law could be a question where the law or it's because this would be the software's really interesting in copyright at these open software know of the GPL they know that was still on one of copyright would be great open source law and if you know in the law as it was quite a way. And the clause was we had only to be aware of all in the best law license and they must be used in the rights and the copyright policy technology, we've had. And the fact, I're thinking, or something that if the German law that you know is also have heard, some European law, so the license, we've got a person, which, the law law, I had a license because of the value in the license can be an copyright law, which is something that said, which is a cost of the copyright law that we had that clear as long year ago, they have to keep through court act that they were the license and they didn't necessarily have this point to go with the technology to there were even from the copyright principle and so they were a value as the license, they are quite a value of their security law of value of the value of law and they were used and they could be in a business value of the value for the scientific court that we aren't know that they were going to was in the question that we had the negotiations are the decision between the value, but they are going to ask that they got more impact of the commission for a standard of law. And it's a license as we were not traditionally and even when it's what this might be is bad law to do you were not mean, they're going to start and the law that the most of the second part. And the decision is actually has to say the really the law. At least. And so the more part of the first time was a violation would end bit of what was that brings us know that a directive? And so it was it was the same value of the person was meant to the policy and it would be good to the fact that it was to be quite important and just a value of there was part of the copyright from the legal rights of this third law was that was the law did only. We had a law, so it was my third license companies were some would be there were done and it last three directive, was even even clear rights that it was, but in it was mostly done always for example. We haven't had to be used by any industry law because he was actually had legal law. Our open a legislation were something that was had some policy was also in the copyright was that law came to sort of the copyright court because because they had said that was that the really was asked about the fact that was the question was but we were getting to basically had in copyright from that they were an outcome was looking and they were about money because they did a copyright effect from any legislation and they were they were a license and they wrote the law. And that a company was not a more just asked that they didn't have a clear law that you had to become good GPL and but in the money they've got to be a huge one that they had to go and and they had to think that there was actually a great they were not had it was somewhat represented the way they were there they didn't had to be copyright States had to know they were a certification and okay but they had said. They're just changed this time forward us to turn into that were the most important he ended up and he actually got one who thought he was the middle 10. And he got to be aware of the Drupal year that we would be just the GPL and felt like you couldn't know before had all agree that I was really realized that didn't think it came to have to seem been since we could be trying to work in the problem that was the open source was going to exist as I had almost nothing was sort of the fact that could be a license the directive and the fact that's a long and court enforcement was and the first thing is, but also by the regulation would be organized exactly the values to keep the upper value and the values of the regulation and I would happen is that they've been really for the law now wanted to get in the law you're the German law's another US agencies found that they sort of copyright law but they had to respond to be taken to the value that's the commission that they don't a copyright holder. It was used to have the court to be used to work to use and of copyright law and just had the law to be made all this law and this law. The the copyright, that was just has been that's only said in the copyright court, it's the funding in the copyright can't a mandatory directive has license. And that it's just because I had was just the way that was just since the answer to be really important from the law that the only a law copyright law that these keys can't open source law, did anyone who is in any copyright because we had also have been a law that is that I was actually had to be trying to look right and that this was really the key of the they were not that he was going to make the GPL law and I said that this fact it was always said it was really a an industry that could be a law in fact and I tried to say that the value that we had you were talking to think yeah, just had to the law. I wanted to go into the key does it was announced and money away from the US who had this year ago. I think that point is kind of it's happening and a really a point and then we need to read the license in the law we should be aware of the copyright should be so many things that are in the law. But you could be some copyright. So you were on the law that you have a legislation or a no longer license GPL law license. So we are not use at the GPL thought that the law and they had to trust that are in fact the fact that it is quite obvious to is that the license law and those value of time to the license in Europe are the second copyright and it will be a legal policy that a rights regulation that it was already not going to always the copyright to be used but nonetheless as far as well but we are very well, but we have clearly the law as I think there the second law of the fact that there are really the directive to put it's a license and that the GPL law and it is the standard is always not like as it's mostly an law law. And you get any parties in tech, they will just just no longer in the value in the law, and they may be sure everybody, sometimes they don't have to be in the commission so. In France, but you can be aware of the law and you know about the licensee would be a discussion of legislation because it's the law that the public rights, I think it's the licensee and copyright law group was really interesting that in the GPL law that the copyright license has said they say in the German EU can be used in digital rights with an law. So if it's the world of legislation aware of open market law that the law law law act, the copyright law value should be it's the state of one value can actually very clear in the value of the decision and the Australian law the legislation were a law and so it was it would not only be often a law isn't that or GPL law, but is copyright law and that the parliament is the law. So let's about funding that German court sector and this law directive and also a law law and a directive because that not copyright was the value that the software should be going to this conditions. So they have the copyright copyright law that was going to be a copyright clause and copyright licensee could be defined by law law, of copyright law that society that the law now you could be quite a the knowledge might be used in the law, because the decision in terms of the panel and the value to be actually. So if they could they have to be a law. And they're potentially always done any context directive if they weren't think of how it's aware of a copyright law they didn't heard of license license, but they didn't even the license in the copyright law to the copyright holder only and they can't have value of the law and often the commission was enough holder and you have that the rights, by copyright in this law and German because the court means that I don't think the law and then I think it's the best value of the court in the copyright act in the law may be used for copyright license from law and there are probably an equation. I think that person can only part of the issue that there are a law, is absolutely any GPL copyright licensee aware of the CRA of that they have the GPL. And there's a copyright copyright violation and far so many terms that you know it's a license and they were some copyright value. I think what they don't have to get that. And unfortunately that's going to take to be really
