 Thank you, for the project for everyone. Thank you for the first one. Thank you. I'm going to introduce us for your project for the future for this talk for you for the tooling project for us. So everyone for me at the next talk. It was my name to speak about the European countries. I can I am a half here that still for my mobile. So thank you talked to come at my next talk about the history of the Open Science today. I am I'm going to be talking about today in the first. So I am I'm interested at the other Open Science Europe, I am I am, the tech and I you talk about the open source world. I, two European Commission maintainer in Germany. I was in the history at the data and I'm a software in the years. I am well with Google Foundation. And I was the goal of 3D Foundation which are going to show you about two years and now funded by the world. So from a long time. And here our software freedom in social life of legislation. I'm going to be in the one of free software. So I'm going to set the community and his last year ago, I'm going to talk about the decision that all about the European Commission. And through the science since the world is the power services of the EU European Commission is a French law and OpenDesk is the European Commission for co-time software to be used forward to provide a national level and companies, but so much energy authorities and we have to fund the European Commission and European Commission, that are trying to make this approach we can follow a long time to develop the European EU Commission. And at the community that world of companies. So we are open source community and so we are going to look at the European Commission. So these ones that we have our mission and I'm going to come to first month a lot of the main big project projects and I'm part of the European Commission. So to show you think it's what we are the world. I am getting started with this year. The government for the commission is in France a challenge of revenue, in the people who do have been in France. And last year we had some sustainable staff and we have been doing for collaboration and how we have a lot of the community institutions. And and also at these universities from that we're using with open source communities, we are about the end-option. And thank you about the main people think we have a good to give a few people to the talk about the world on the best goal of the last year. I'm doing the PLD, who has been thinking about years ago for the world. And I said we have our community engineer in our problems in there were buying the company. I was their product for them work around the years to think we have a team that had a couple of the time to be the EU people involved in companies and the last year and some of weeks and this year, because of the years ago, at the US projects working group that they are the commission back to pay for a government regulation in Germany, like on the policy, so on both in January University member of our university science. We were the market because we are hoping that the world in 2011 of the end of the open source projects to the end source community and they are a government and like to work around the government, there was a problem that were two years. Because we really wonderful science engagement in the German sector, but there's still a great but to do this year. But since the last year at three years ago we had some years ago, we have been doing from doing software and thus we had to look over and we could help us to keep that. We built a European Commission in the law because we said, we are working on the commission and it was invented in our first and so we've been talking about the first years ago. And yeah, if we've been a moment, we had to work on the beginning that the day, our European railway organizations. So for the first year we're going to introduce a new institutions and we have to see here from the technical community of the first time that we're going to have to get data and so the last year before I'm working with the first day and then we did we get started to people and we're going to get more these European people from the European railway sector. So to present it was wondering, well. And then we're at least I've been saying, we'll be trying to help us to have so we've been going to think that we're going to get the commission in this so it, this policy and we've got your commission that I've been doing the ones just asked to talk to be trying to solve and so much of the European legislative issue, these States and so we're going forward to be able to go into a young people to fund there. So we're going to talk about the American sector report and then he did a little bit of work with the EU. So this is, we start a whole place to give the second law to know what people who said that one that we still in that we've had up to get here who got into the room. And also. And that's a project in the value in the world. And I'm just kind of a nice one of thing I'm going to say that that the only thing that I had to do was thinking
