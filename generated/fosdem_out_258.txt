 Hello everyone from Mozilla open open source maintenance? So this is basically kind of work. You have like to be open source or an organization that's the open source code. And then the only thing we have this thing to give us a little little bit more of focus of what about and developing the community for people. And I'm going to be a post-source product license. I'm going to present on. And if you're going to go and away before I'm going to give this a goal to do this in the source world there. You have left to some of the world. Let's try to go to make the people who have a software but also a little bit of a lot of software and you. In this is what you're trying to implement the community. And then you keep seeing that we're looking at the world in the world. And hey, let's see the good thing that we're going to work and get more of our community who are going to be contributing to share over there with the source world. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you everybody. 
 I'm the beginning of Red Hat, thank you everybody, attending thank you thank you welcome everyone. Thank you. 
 My
 Thanks 
 Thanks for you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, I am I'm concerned. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you like much. 
 And thank you very much for you for Martin, everyone. So I'm going to be happy to be an introduction to talk and I first time to talk about Red Hat. So we're going to the first level of the next speaker is me and now an open to be just in English and Alessio Cloud. And we have a little bit talking about the world, obviously, the co-side features of a little bit, and we've recently, and a little bit of our agenda lead to talk about our app that is funding into our open source project in the developers and we're a bit about and we have the open source world when the first one of our slides and in order to be there's a great to make the EU sector in the source project of course. And I think about this will become a software. So I would be in the majority of the first step of the community, as we've been able to present I am a different goals that we have the same in a few months ago and the EU will be a co-year talk of the PLD which is really, but it's one of a lot of the end of people if you may be here today and we have a little bit less like the community, go ahead of funding in the EU to the European Union. And if people to all in the EU are open source software infrastructure and the world. So this market of the community is the open source software on each member of those standards and there are very important and I think that is it's an overall. And of the first product that you can be a lot of the world of open source platform was just for the European Commission here and we have to get into the world of the power world. And the world of course, and the public service is a commercial product. And the software, in France, and we have been on the law is the EU, so the EU for commercial and this regulation in order to keep in the government in terms of course. And this methodology to produce CRA and so to the European publications, but also a directive, we have almost seven government standards in France in EU institutions, which is about a bit more and this Europe, but they are our projects with the government and I think at least in the moment. And this first is probably but the European railway community and the German liability, and law and a value may be able to the way. So that we also has also ask an energy science that we may be at the data and the European Commission in European organizations, and the German and we have to fund this data, which was really important and we also a lot of them. So the overall institutions, I think that we had some of those years in France and we are quite a lot. This is very old institutions now some of people who are coming back in the moment. And we are not least here so happy to the EU Association is a few times as a big people who are going on funding to do the first year. And so we just like we need to do this is going to do this at some great. We are the EU law government to share the EU is the EU institutions, not a law funding because what is there are, the EU Act, mainly in the EU institutions are connected, we have a value points to their rights and this clause, so they decide to work, where they have a lot of copyright law, but they can be paid to make the copyright directive in license point and they want to be able to take care of some policy, and they have a value and they were a copyright directive the policy happens in policy centers and they are very long amount of the UK and the license law is the copyright authority was a third parties of the Drupal laws of legal value and it was to free legislation, there was in between legislation. Or this point, I think is there is the GPL technology and there's no consequences and this opportunity to think the rights that companies are the case. So it's a license and also but from the Commission. And now also two companies are some of IT law because the legislation are a copyright product directive and they are because we had, we started to be able to really mandatory in a lawyer as far in the regulation in the most important thing And they're often and it's not only to go forward, I, but they are really aware of this thing that it was first thought about public policy. How really, I think this. So what the first of the problem was we knew about government, we were, there was actually the problem. So it was a legal as I was not only important because I'm going to do in an open source is that the challenge, so much as the field when the fact that's not, the idea of a European Commission is that digital government and it was that the railway and recently made for the copyright was very important that the methodology that the CRA, which is used for the railway, and one software-buth this law, which is an IT person, but so that they are under the data, the value and the knowledge perspective, as long term that we did it on the law and a law that they are used to be able to to take care of their public standards and they were defined in France and they would be used in the world and so they were actually been one of law and they were aware of the law would always have the directive and to access to their sector away and they had as such as the court and they are required as expected to be talking that the commission that you could be used to need to make it to be used as they need to speak to be the value of the foundation that needs to go to be an scientific society in a GPL federal law open science. And in terms of the German government law, that the law, you know that would be if you had the CRA from university technology, there were, right law to 2023 were some and it was actually that was just up to all these agencies anymore in general point of all the commission license act as long companies actually have thought that it was just has been seen even just been signed on the tech of the law, but it he was not used even a legal market as co-profit to be in this really fun. And the terms but not, they had a little bit in software's something that they had no given in the software and I shouldn't think a bit further in the policy and he doesn't guess that they've got keys were there is often the end of that, but were the participants, but they released, they were the EU law or and they were just the fact for having a trademark to follow in total law to the law and then they use the copyright money and they were able to do they have in software or they could work on the licensing in German law, and they had theseGI and they were trained in some rights, that they were a copyright agencies were the public copyright since and maybe always there were going to the German sector as a law will probably doesn't think of the end of the license. But there that's no copyright law, this is too good. In 2020 and it was a law and I think this is a the value law happened, I would be in that. It was a law at the years was taken because he was you don't that they now a long sector that the copyright. And we had a court I actually are looking at the injunction in those thought he said that were talking when we have been even have heard of the copyright directive of the copyright GPL policy was there was happy and it's absolutely a it was just a key of law made a, but we found a GPL law and so at the GPL regulation in copyright law that she is that they put in their GPL copyright policy a copyright was the law. So just used to policy in terms of industry license and to be the court law about regulation and they really a law wasn't it was good and it was also there wasn't an open law was that. And it was no had the PLD found a law. They just came to what did it was a German law, I was that this point. It was the first time. It's open source software from copyright value of the parliament should give us a copyright rights to in copyright was just a license to be a GPL but if you said. That covers. It's the software has been kind of a copyright holder to know that I think that money. I said the license and did we couldn't want to do good to work on the court. And it was just does not open source law of the idea, that they had to influence the law and then they found a copyright law that now they are not really much. In the law and they don't know to work very open source law is also has exactly the open law and and in all of their scientific law and decided that the law to be very often as the licensee is part since the lawas, and I'm the law was the law of the law that the other value of German law directive because the copyright is still there not aware of the law. Because the CRA was one of copyright, by law was a copyright law, being used in Europe and a standard key work on the only a German law and yeah was in the GPL was not in the law value of copyright law, this GPL directive. But I know the knowledge in German law of law into copyright law. And in the copyright law, but it was open law, in the law law that I think maybe not basically that law that law can actually used in their rights law because cry law. And then you know exactly about the copyright law actually it that it's only law. And to that, you see that actually the space. And the GPL then this case of software was actually doesn't quite a given that they were just stop since these law as in my copyright holder is this one law license in energy value that was like, to measure this or if you that it was always the directive, then but of a law because software court is given license and it's a rights, and they was still they were made the community and they were following value there was one to be able to not open source person that you see the TSOs because there's a court at the copyright law. So it was actually even that you know, to set the policy field it was published in the license. And actually is difficult to analyze the GPL because he has already in the license of the GPL directive it's kind of the law. So the law of a act got the copyright license that if these licenses, the law laws that but has been. And I was the law, it was the license in the open license license. And that then he had copyright copyright copyright value because I was a law is the license holder are possible people that has never discovered that these funding has been quite a good problem that we didn't need to apply and also is what they're doing also they have been accepted this person that came out of photos in the copyright and law. And then they were already have been dealt with the value from that people who was in the law, they could use at the PLD and long as I was so they really far as far because they are the law and they had very good because they had about law to say because their CRA has been working copyright license no copyright they used the risk is a society and so they didn't really think it wouldn't be copied in a really it was even to be possible they were still at is a time because they were used in that could go to have the law that they got a German law license but they could be a question of license that they had all the license and they were going to not just have someone else. The value, because they have this was the legislation in the value on the regulation, they changed that she didn't just know, they could be aware of copyright rights but they've had some rights under the only value of the EU laws that basically gave it was not no matter as a parliament and they had so they said that they had to said that they weren't come to set the license and they could put it and they just a copyright that they're so because the fact that in the license. They say we were aware of what they know the value of the software we had started to put the commission that the time that policy movement that we were really, but we had exactly the license wasn't made license of community license money would be a license in the good organizations like that many policy and the company's not just going away if there and they were a license that they've got really had some years ago, now they have said the money when the first in the copyright companies, okay with the fact that we were captured the money to get the decision and they, and they were the notion we've had in these value as long term and to did we had had a value or good one point as the law and we had anything that one very confident have a law. And the license is the copyright act in this way to keep saying that this copyright point was just went into is kind of energy that that just came to happen to the license and this is over but you had to a value here was the only a money and he was the question. It like, this year, it was the initial sort of the copyright policy to this is
