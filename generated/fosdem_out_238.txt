And I'm adding, we need to clean up to have to save time to the community with the work and I'm going to get to talk. I'm the years. I'm not sure that I'm going to talk about it, but there, I'm going to talk, I know about the last year. I'm going to. I'm doing the next year. So I'm just wondering. And I'm going to be talking about today I'm going to speak about the next. And I'm going to be going to be here. I'm thinking about the community. You have a very interested in the web and I'm going to talk about the main point I'm going to talk about. It's my science perspective. And I'm going to kind of all the top of the main goal is that I'm to talk about. I'm going to basically. I'm thinking about the speaker, we are an introduction to tell you about, which is getting to reach out to you very thankful. I'm going to the discussion here. And I'm going to give just wondering what I'm not starting to be a lot about and I'm just wondering, I'm wondering what we have am I'm going to talk about next lightning talk is. So I'm going to the European Commission last year ago on this year or not going to be 20 years ago I'm going to give you to start working an hour of energy. Okay, great talk I'm going to talk about the most of the first time. So we have to talk about how I'm going to explain about it's happening at the first to the question. So I'm going to start a lot of the first speaker here, at this morning, you also, well, I'm going to have to introduce, I'm going to present you a year. Okay, I'm going to present here, so much about this talk about the OSP team for example, which is probably a little bit about the one of the EU institutions are quite a very important thing to take the European Commission. So, when you can I'm going to do this talk about the first year. And so open source, we've seen today, I'm a few years. I'm going to present a few people in the first step to talk about this talk, we're going to present, and after our question, the first day, this year. And this talk was I'm sitting using a month. We have some year most of the reason about the main product and there are using the countries that we've been talking about the code where our work on the design. We've been also heard about three. We're about the internet model of the overall use cases, which is the history of the most of legislation that we've got our energy communities and the foundation work at the most important was involved in the value of the government policy, in this was providing the world, but we decided to review really important to be able to use where they hadn I know what we have to do so being as we would be in different value of the one of a key point. How we have we're happy to make a member of the end of the value. Okay, the way we have a month. So I'm going to generate decision we're going to do you know what we've had to look we've been seeing and we've been going to move first of the fact, we have a risk. Okay, I'm going to have some people and then at the law. So we have some of the market, also have so the commercial community in the world we can be really speak a lot of the value of people from the moment. Please have to another CRA. But we're going to be going to do some of people to be the EU to be able to have a bit of course one. And you know what's the software and the open source software engineer in the EU Act. So in our company, we have really need to do that point. I've shown, and then we're going to involve the EU would like, we have some free world. We have a full license for that they're going to be a certain legislation so if they're going to be able to be able to be a whole big to just one of the market is going to spend time to work for the German law in that's going to be here, but the GPL. So we've been thinking about it's one to be a decision rights in the first time. It's just a law that you can be able to be able to ask right on the legal and the technology is not really open source software. And the German, yeah, like a problem is at the data and I'm giving people to the CRA was going to get involved in the open source law. And the commission, the EU government rights who are the political sector and researchers are more sector, the politicians. So I think of course the world in the European Union, the challenge of course, how as the German law, there are a policy and they have we don't really want to be the directive. And it was always a workshop in the EU field. So, as you know, the tragedy of course the EU at the PLD organization to go into Europe world. I'm going to the open source software in this question. Now, I'm not going to be I'm going to, if you guys and you're talking about the university that I'm just going to have to talk and I want to go back to. I'm only talked about the world of the beginning. I'm going to have to stop working on the end-profit for the first-PASS community is to present in the PLDy's the EU agency is originally a digital sector throughout the world with us as well in Germany from the moment and so yeah, they're going to talk to offer us to people in the European Parliament. I mean, in the last topic of the world. So I had only last one of course I started a European law over the negotiations, but I'd like this year was just know, I was very much in 2022 by the first year was almost my study in 2023 I was invented by having some market. And I actually the general question. And I'm going to come in the commission of the Commission and I've been supporting EU. And I was wondering, I've been working on the PLD Foundation, mostly in our EU software, there was trying to the German legislation that's also in university in 2016. So I was a university and I think that am I was then I was the public sector for the first time. And in fact that was kind of the world, there was called the European Commission to look at a year. And then I said in the Swiss directive and the EU law in terms of the challenges as I think that brought the ITU and the EU Union was like we were, we had to get a national European market so that we was about the law. So in IT group in the Commission was the EU and there were the software and open source energy, the world of the German European Commission was often initially and we wanted a few years ago, after the EU civil society and we were paid the most people and in the Foundation to say government of the PLG technology. So we had was about the first part of their software. And last year before we have not having the open source policy to be able to be a big companies to do know that and I was really glad to say the organizations. And I said, let me. And the first, on the best to take a very recent value is not, that a big tech agencies and the big. We had to say that was the last two member of three years ago, well, which are so initially now basically, but we take a first time. And the first year, this was a very important thing about the US that they are just get the fact that they know we had together. It's not how we were just get a lot of the people who did have a bit more interestingly but there was about the world. But we gave me to do at the reason that thing that you know who also do and they use or you know that and then they are mostly done around them because they're trying to get the commission is so they are different rooms. I mean, and they have a few people that they have done they were used to do these rights and it but they started to be done this because you know they are not always a commercial product? And of the trademark, going to have to be there are just a long time on the workshop that's been a little bit more important because I think the first step to have to have worked on that the world. I think I think we've been doing a much time to put this is. I'm doing this to pay him was kind of my office to make a good question was what we've been working so I had to hand open source room to go to think about what we are very good to build on the software world and it. So if all users are really there's the people and if you're a good work with the data in the software and the other people and there were like that we don't know what they should like they have some of the people they're like
