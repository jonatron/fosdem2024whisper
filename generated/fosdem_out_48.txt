And I'm just to, what I'm a year to encourage you're trying to talk about the PLD, the open source. And I'm looking at the railway, we've been doing the whole workshop and I'm doing all going to do we want this here. And I'm going to add funding. The last speaker was now I'm talking about all I'm just going to explore it's going to start to talk about the things very excited to go into the technology. We're going to be talking about the last year, the two years. He was going to introduce you so we've been in the world. We want to get the whole projects that we're trying to have to find a whole product really important to work on the future of the web open source projects. So we got to try to get to have some people or a little people in open source project. So welcome to open source team that's a few years ago, the negotiations. And I only thing about open source community, the majority of thing. And I'm going to go to be good community, so much to the first one thing are my work that, the project was that we had a lot of the best culture that we've been using these kind of energy funding for the world. And the Commission was basically have been the EU world was really wonderful community. And I've got to share work for a lot of all the projects in the other people who were kind of people and the business room. So the project was one, but I would like a very loud year in the last year ago, I thought they were really seen a couple of that was using them, a way that had the open source community, but they said, right? But we would be able to take a really very much that we are working on having products and we want to do some of their market and they're a whole problem. So the open source has a clear decision on the person in the important thing I wanted to have been talking to do was getting about the people and we have done with Adobe can see and how many people and they had to be quite the European Commission was important. And that the last year and finally have been shown for the commission. It was that were presenting over the negotiations, the Commission on the idea of the work in this and they have now we've got this decision and they had had a moment to do have also aware of the time to influence the companies that you've worked with an open source way to do we've had a year we had to create the first of energy history of energy sector. And so we were super excited to go up to you see a much time to us very quickly ICTOSDEM here. So we have a lot of the EU we had a lot of developers of I have the commission, it was I know that we had a year and we had some of the world. And then I cannot have been just to ship to mention that. Yand-like future, and they'd like one, the EU. So they had to participate into a lot of the last six years ago. I've been going to solve an active years. But they are some of funding are like he started working. So we have a few of the European Commission in the time well I had to work in the world they were the ITs, I was to use, which were in 2019. And then we ran a project. And it was very clear to be just a really trying to be there and very happy to have a bit of the government. It was a few of the railway world were to do is in European Commission and now the second month. And I did was not use it was wondering. And in the time for the commission and that he was happening on the European Commission has been talking about me in a power and so he had a year and now. And we were seeing in 2022 in the parliament and I was it wasateurs is also working at the moment. And we had to think I was very first one year ago. I had some thought there was mentioning the digital Commission. I didn't just felt out there I was no year, but I was like this was at a year because I would just from the time. One was gonna be a bit of the Commission from the year. So this year. I didn't get back to people after they didn't start doing to the latest mandate in the most of our community at the companies. So to go back to the panel and then just had had a bit of open source people then just to talk at the policy. So I was I was thinking after, I was in the last year before. And the first thing was with it was probably the copyright law and this had a lot of the world were supposed to get in the open source community. So. And we were, I was like in last year, the open source software, we've been having a whole chance it was very well. And from the world. And I was a free software. And what we started in the first year, I said, they were having something else. And they were asking the beginning of the time we're basically have were just to speak an activist and they wouldn't very much money. They were these like copyright that a lot of the work and a volunteer agencies in the CRA and there was our society. So that they're the UK initiative on the EU was a policy in policy. So they were like the law to do it's the German market. And I would be the overall federal volunteer and they were quite well and the license in the product because the first person that's the world. So since the money had that was kind of the most of open source panel was the negotiations did was not do that the open source world and they were the money that they had had forgotten half the world. And they can't come from the open source and it was really has been doing in a court of the last year is that they did I was that I was going through the point of a moment. And the company that was allowed that the copyright was that if they have to be a bit of German government felt to use and they were in terms of the copyright law to. And I reached out the open source in German policy in here was actually decided it was saying government of the last time and they want to get to go to it and they just had with doing copyright policy, but they actually had this in the world and interoperability to have the liability and they were a value to be a license free source companies. And so they have this is a national law and and they were just a real law to was the copyright value of funding no law. So the people. These companies were a copyright had to exactly that we are going to be a value so they were going to only saying the commission was the market and then at the copyright out of the federal copyright was the GPL the commission they knew if we needed to have been asked and like this EU law but there to say no one that the past was that they was removed their law and they know but they need the principle of a copyright that the copyright fact that they had they were the GPL have quite even of the licenses who were that in legislation because we had made a law it had so we had for a member of the commission with law, which was not ever well as well to be like another law because it was like mandatory law directive and the commission from the copyright holder to the GPL has been understood because we need the German regulation has got the lawyers were this value and they got to get a copyright value of copyright is coming into the law and the value and they actually took't have to be taken that people to find it. And this first that they were taking, we never used to show it was the PLD were much policy. But that was a copyright law and I was also had already at TSS is a lot of the beginning we just a regulation and they get started a lot of the market. So they've got something that's not said, it does of the EU association of the commission were the PLD was a major license was not only the free law value of the law. In terms of that they had is actually have to actually had a great idea that you could be a law and they didn't really think that there were a big enough directive, because I asked and they didn't mean they were these standards but they had a directive was quite a regulation to interpretation, and they were still didn't really have an interoperability law that they wrote a copyright law that would they took a market, and then they had some public sector and they said they did another law has no, but they would be from the license of the policy would be a copyright companies and they were the commission said and they had the ones and, but they were the last year since they were quite a directive.3 so they ran into the technology. And they had seen that they're very uncomfortable of the UK is like copyright, if they went into a key in the GPL was doing legal law at their only thing that's actually becomes exactly because that they did was the copyright is actually got a copyright if they were on is that is a there was I didn't know as well their copyright of license is law and they had no one. Even and they had to go the parliament to the way we were not know that was involved and they always mentioned a um no one that was not saying there were and they read it was. Yeah, a they were even a really cool thing that they are the German law because that they had a GPL is what they were like not a way to have the money to know. So we had the way to be paid software to have the third thing to be there was in copyright, uh copyright system and the licensee was if we published as the end of the law sector of the commission made there was had a law and they had just had copyright holder saying hey got that is a policy could be so they know where they had tried it was basically so they could use some copyright that they had the law but they were at least the moment and we were able to just affected because the GPL TPM, uh they went and they kept a copyright rights to be actually know. And they decided it was just was a really a copyright so they didn't just it was they had to work not actually had that they hadPM because they were used it was to be a secret law and they found on the law and they were coming from the court. They could have to make as a copyright freedom to think was that what, uh it was the license are going around to like but they were definitely not made it was wondering about GPL and they were the GPL copyright from the GPL there were the license and GPL license and therefore they didn't have the money and they were and were like GPL were just just a regulation by value that the law were just had to be a copyright itself and they didn't really and of the license, uh copyright law would be moved to a sense. And I think we could actually had no copyright directive the GPL law didn't even remember the first think again, four value of the second value of the value of open regulation. They didn't always put the copyright law and they didn't remember the GPL is the law and in the GPL and they could be not be no copyright law at any license copyright holder is almost always open source law law. Like the license license is exactly really affected an thought it's the copyright holder and copyright has no value by regulation, uh and it was this law and that and copyright law would not trying to copyright value. So they made this the licensee could be made of a law license in a government will be the federal to law that people I need to think I didn't know that uh. I think that had not always asked it makes you didn't really what they could be going to become a policy so the government conditions in the copyright the tech policy that those German law and they didn't know and they won't have had time in that the commercial roots to ship is a value after the law and the commission not only license law where this two policies were able to the value into the term that they were just law and you come and they had asked and they were trying to have the law said 20 years to have at the license. And second value of the copyright forces they asked, of companies that open source effect was a law and so we spent the value of the law but that other law is going to share is the rights as far as like would do I have the court could be a law. And that. I can be that they were also like the legislation that I think you know how that I mean had is great court would be in court of the standard because the law, and it's only thing that you identify all these law value of the law that were basically happens against the value of the license in the copyright principle had to the liability. Because they are the GPL it means to the same copyright is the law they tell the value after that they did not even though part of the copyright because it was the law and really I think it's important point that copyright holder and it's well a
