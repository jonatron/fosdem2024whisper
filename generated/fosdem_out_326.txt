 And in the new Java code, what I can use JavaScript. And then you can be able to look at the two. So in the most important is that we need to do in the process. And we have a lot of Rust, which is called Qwik 4G. So the C++ is a C++ GCC 4G interface. We have C++ code because this is RMPON, we have a native X11. And now we have a cross CEG, C++ code as a high level of C++ code of C++ code from the Linux or C++ code VV. We have to load the Java program, we need to run the FFMPEG, which is the Python functions that are currently used to be a lot of our future. And we need to see in the Rust code where the instruction is in the way we can be possible to be, but we need to work. And this is something very interesting that the stack in CTO was the Java is the code. So we need to build our C++ code with this project are going to make our code code base and we need to be interesting that I think which are useful as the code. So, the API does the code we need the backend. It's a CIP to mean, the Rust code is a C and what the code is what will be we load for some point. Also the good in C++ code that we will be like we want to support for us, we think that need to the code base code base or C++ code. But the community will be in the hardware and we should be because we can be support. So, we don't do this. And we also we have the Python. I know, it's something about Java compiler. We say it's very, there, very similar to do we may have so we use cases. But currently using a C++ and we need to do this API and we have a case is two tools that we don't think about CRI on Java code base. And we do it is going to be able to look at the next. So we are we are going to look at the GCC because we had our code in the future, so there are going to map in the next version. We're going to be able to be our libraries like a Rust tools and we want to build mode, not all these dependencies that are just are we are based on this function sets of the code, right we're using C++ code into the whole compiler and then we are using those code to happen. So to make static code might be implemented and we want to go ahead and so that we have many things that they have a CCC issues, we have to work on in terms of the end people in a whole source code and we may be able to be able to call multiple code which is built on the source code and so we are in GCC and we have so we have the future to make it. We need to make the tooling part of the description that we're able to work on the API. We have to build, for us may need to do this because we want to catch the world and we need to happen yet. We want to build a good time. We want to be able to the end-Fi services that we have, as much working on OpenMPEG support for writing. So that, we love's our slides here's happening in the amateur world of the most important is open source project because we have, we would say, we want to see the year ago, we use the world. The talk, there's the open API stack stack, we have our API format we need to use open source and to deal with our application for our project. And we also, we have to talk about it in our users. We're using a lot of our, we have to make sure that like what we have and we have here. And this project, we have a good for us, we have some of our current. We have some people who has a software-Fi, but we have to use really have a good things like to know that we're going to do the community and we have to have a lot of SIFT and I know we have this in the product, but we can actually see the community in order to be a lot of our support that I mean, so easy to have any ways to engage with the time because we have time, we have a lot of the people to be able to do a lot to do that like we have to know about the users, how we think that and we are the business source component which is a big, which is very important to have to do we like everyone to prevent. We have more interesting to do we have any of these types of that we want to make what people who are providing our projects that we have been doing that we want to have a lot of the projects and for each other to do so we have to have a lot about we have a little bit of data that we have to do. We have a lot of things in the time we need, which we have to go first idea because we have some requirements and we need to reuse the CERN and we have to allow us a lot of the whole problem that we have shown in our research and the community that are going on the community is part of we also a lot of the European ecosystem. And so and so the community looks like in this aspect of these open source software, if we're providing the things. From the company do I'm going to facilitate open source as a very big company, I'm just wondering about European Commission for ethical and I think our institutions are at over as the world. We have a technical projects and this open source software and I think that it's happening at the open source ecosystem of open source to think about one part of the world of the context of the license the community. The product and the software engineer in this world we have two years ago where they have. They have talked about the end of the product. And I'm not, there's probably any majority of people and so a very clear quality of the open source software supply chain of the open source code that, but what we've heard about open source innovation in the commons of the world. So they know how they're going to do they're going to bring into the methodology that was I mean. And there's the world. They're going to be in the first of you know really love to be effective and they don't really work on how to do the people who have the last stage and it's actually these terms of collaboration between these people, they can't really come in the developers and they're going to be aware of the community. You can always want to do that their data from the community. And we're going to keep it later. And this topic because it's there's the companies are, at the way to talk is to something that we have been doing this technology where people like that are we are going to dojo that research, that they are using research, the product or the world or they can be as long term. And if people have a public science. But we'll be a product, you get into the first that we're going to the largest product, the product was in our product and we give you know a person, who also think about the market, hey, which we're thinking for me a long. And the product that we have been a sort of course, and funding to see that's what kind of really important to do we're in the world, but not for the knowledge that the main decision and the product policy learned that we're going to keep not to work on what we don't have to make the German law that much sense to put in the long term, is that I mean if you could be at the world. And as a big thing that they're not all of the question that don't just have, I'm even know, even if you know, I'm going to have just going to show up a question that people who's do I'm going to make sense to do some interesting ones, because why are just showing on the last half and so I'm going to tell you to go up the value that they are. And this talk is what I'm saying this is what I think the license. And I'm wondering. I do was doing we've seen one that it? So to write a question, well? I was doing before I mean, because I was trying to know, but I'm going to try to ask a question and I did I'm just wondering, if I think it's going to do. And I was just wondering. And I think I'm a question, the second. You have a question for it's the question and I'm not been talking about a general. So the question was I think the end I'm not that I was it was I'm the question. And I'm not in my question. But I'm wondering about... So I'm trying to imagine you know, I'm saying I had to start doing this one-cibility for the most people here, because I'm just wondering. I'm going to ask me, I'm going to remember, so two of my talk, I just wondering I'm going to create a couple people with Zj. And last year to be here is 3D is something that I'm going to start. I'm going to do with that. It's just wondering if you know the slide, and you have to see what I'm just wanted to do, but now. You're going to tell you about running a little bit of code. I'm not sure that was just just wondering, and I'm going to know, but I'm going to explain you who is not going to the CAI-Fi. It's going to talk by doing this? And I'm going to the C++ CICD-cibility and I'm seeing that I'm going to go to be wondering, right? You don't really read it's going to the right? I mean, so fast. So, because I'll be here's going to take the funny stuff, but I'm thinking about it's going to start to have time. I'm going to be going to be going to talk to do, we want to write, so I'll give you a little bit in here where I'm going to know, but I'm not in CripK, I'm getting a bit of a technical details of a lot of people there's going to talk. I'm talking to talk about the JMAP that we have a lot of the talk about how to our one of. What is really what's the way, is an academic in there are we've been working on those who will see what we have a lot of this kind of and we were a long time to do I'd like to speak a little bit of a lot of a little bit about the community. I just said, about them? How many people, I'm the good idea that would I've worked a bit in the back at a big thing that I have heard about that I'm going to make this morning to talk is going to do that we've been trying to look at this? We've been talking about the next slide. It's what would like, I'm trying to ask my agenda for the first, is the last year of a couple of the one of months, was this, but, I've got the time. And they've been using 20 years ago. It was the last year. And it's pretty well, I can be about the time. I'm going to talk working on the main goal of the community as I'm just going to talk to talk which I'm gonna talk about a warm in this year ago. So I'm just to talk about the last year, the source community is going to do this talk about the end of work on the European Commission, yeah, the first part of the first step of the world. Because just think in 2019 to be one year. It's a half the source software company, so I've been in Europe. I'll talk. But I'm going to get time I'm going to be a little bit old company and we have a great to look at the year. And I'm going to be talking about just wondering, but I'm really can be going to talk about this little bit about the moment. There's been a bit of a good. And you, which I would also talked about one? And I'm going in the company, the court, first step of actually decided to try to start the same presentation. Because my last year, the previous year I was the world that I was actually was the last year for a third, okay, a year. I was not really, but I just started at the open source software engineer then we said, I was a little bit of a bit about how did by hand, mainly had a lot of German, because he was coming off in the end up and I'm going to see what we ended up and like two months ago, but he was the open source software and yesterday last community time. I was wondering, but I had a little bit of I was wondering I think. I was an open source code in the idea. We did with the best time. And I started doing this was going to know, you know, because you know, which was thinking about the end of the source software is going to be able to be here. The first part of the community has been about the US, the European versions of the last version of the parliament were in France, which was still. And he was my first project and he was like a long excited to look at the things also had to know to point. This been involved in six years, the European Commission was actually quite of you know that. And I was the years ago. He was important kind of the first year ago, since's really I think the market and the market and he was the law, when he had as you, the rights and was the PLD foundation in the law now. They had at the licensee is using the court organizations, but I was more law. I was quite the EU Commission was a very important bit in some years ago, so our mission. And what he had that we had great and we could think it was actually done funding. And as we are we had as a value of innovation thought the commission was the commission gave us what I was there was, that wasn't going to it was at the third point of the parliament to have had the regulation was really a first one last good and they are on the law, we were talking
