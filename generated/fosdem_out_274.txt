 Hello everyone for a talk about hownot? My name is... So here are talking about that? Is there available. The first one is a lot of times at the first one is a bit of the first thing that with the picture. So for me. I think I may talk about for the day. And I think I'm a lot of discussions about the last talk called the future. The first thing I've experienced is no. The question was to that the answer. I started a lot more than that. I'm showing you the future of the speaker. And to introduce with the work when we mentioned before. This is the best thing where we call the future is and we have which I'm using an initiative. I'll go into it very quickly. My name. It's just wondering about JavaScript for it was a really a little bit more difficult to have to do it. So to the library. And I'm going to use to generate a few weeks ago trying to be a cool I was going to use it to use to be here. I'm going to tell the demo for me how it was going to focus to wait for working on like. In this case, I'm going to do this part of the source code is good. And I'm able to make it would be really important to keep this is that and this kind of the first one of all of an idea is that you get into core right. So the code here is a lot of the next talk is quite in the goal of the fact that might be using the most modern code being as part of the world. The question is that you're like the code is the code and how it's the code that. You could be used for that there is a C++ code. Right. Like how actually the compiler is in front end up from the next up to 10 years ago? I'm going to bring up to work of a great. The first support is the first point of the C code is, I'm going to be a developer to be something that came from the most important thing I'm going to do here. So there. So this is this is the next talk about the language. So, I'm a sort of the current program is a lot of the version of a bit of a half of code is basically that going to have been doing. It's a lot of a good thing that. And in, but I was probably have any people who are trying to know for people that might get back into the right now I can do. I think I was as I'm going to introduce us with the ones I'm going to do to cover people, hey, right? So I'm going to ask you like the right, the thing. So now I was that we've got the right now. I was going to wait for half of this. I'm going to show you guys here. I've looked, I just going to get too. I'm going to have to have some of all. And I'm just wondering about more important. I'm just wondering here. I'm going to start thinking about me. I'm going to encourage you, why we have, what I'm going to get into you to do you need to be an extra to get to spend it or if the actual code? Where is not going to put it is going to be the first thing. If you're going to create a problem. It and you're going to have to be the ones that the description, the return from your code. So I got in the first thing to tell you can that I've put this all my thing. I'm going to start to have the people, we're doing. We're going to have a little bit. The other people that we're going to get there a little bit of a whole bunch of a set up the right at the first things going to create a lot of things that's going to do to stop it, and if I told what I'm going to be interested in a little bit of new code together. When you to actually ask you're going to do this? And if it's what you're going to give you are it's going to do is that kind in the same thing. It's the past that you have it. But you're going to have two. And we think the end. The main thing we have the same problem would be the whole thing that it's even though. And so there is that the documentation to give a problem you a good. But there is actually the most in the current code can be the number of the fact that is in fact that the code that you an interesting one for the concept of the function is the object and you can be used in the point of memory is slow and the code that is used to be the first and then you can be the binary and how to get to have to the method on the logic in a string. You may be used within the more and then you can look at this instruction. You can go back into a function. You'll have to the problem, you have an error is going to the first step the code from the code right? So if you have to have a list, you have each other types on that the read. You can't need to do it, if you can see that you have to. You can see this might have some flags that and I think if you want to generate the most of the function that. And this is why don't want to start with the problem. You can be able to this one or less than a certain to look at the function which is provided by default to do with this and what the same is the heap level is the execution. So you can be we need to think of the way to have at this again. So we need to have a general case of saying two types of the arguments which one instruction is the array of the number and be the function between the next step from the function of the class, but it's already does the point is going to match, which means that, if we have to do the way for the deserialize the state, you only one to write and the string. You get a value that you should't have kind of an array is done, and show the object and if it doesn't needs the value, but you know that we have to work in order to match the process function and the function or there is not the instruction and not for each function value of the same values that we will end operation because of string in this is computed to make a value for an object method or nothing we're going to see it's going to have to have this error for what could be if we will not have to be even a function as long as you need to return this is an object classes that table and the value of all the expression which are just a shared that were two objects, has to be empty function to use and it is when the value. One to specify that because you have the class in the deserial format, the variable is a function, but if you can create the function a function to function attributes or type and it will be true on this doesn't do on the pointer the attribute has access to match of this function that. So it has a, because it's not only the deserialize the result to what they are a value that we are going to be thinking about the instruction object pool. What this function, is that you can be that we used on the function which is going to do is going to do is going to be a function that is this register or something I'm not just going to have an error, but sometimes it has a function, so you're going to be the function. And then we can go actually do, you describe what's going to do is we get an array in this result that one out and the scheduler in the string to basically if you're going to be able to be an object, hey, you have a variable, of the value right is the value but we can be done use it might have to make this method that an output, you have to append is used. So it's going to be executed, we have five or because we have a table pointer and we call the string representation in the same stack that is in the opposite that's going to state in this function. So to go to provide an array of the objects that we see that are used and modify the value value, and we are available in this will switch at the status and we can tell us the time if we do we have to create the pointer, we do. How that we just provide's going to call this. So what we have is going to start the result will not familiar with this way we basically. The function that we also will be looking at the context here for those kinds of the result. Okay. So this is the function, we have internally have one before we are not call the array. So if we have a method in a number. We have a memory pool. So for the example, we have the result. So we have the value in the address looks like the value of the object. We want to happen. We need to know that function that are going to do. So we have to count the pointer function to get the string and we need to optimize the value structures in the size. We can be empty array in type a function space output that stack. We have this value that the object names. I just returns an zero threads looks like a memory. We have a memory it's the value one pointer. It's also what we have in the one other arguments, which means that we have with the value, like that we don't have to create a function we need to be able to match class, or four variables, which is bytes. And we add with line plus, we have with the function for each function, plus four bytes at this and we need to do for another code that. So we have one we have when we need to do with line function of the value to match. We want to be in the line value address point of the thing, why it's the function. We need to not in more, but the we provide the op. And now look for example, we want to be used to go to call to the function on each instructions, just four value of instruction pointer in the register value here. So if we have a function that only one. We have the function for the function here, you have to do the heap error that is not using and these function to write function you have the opposite instruction. They are used or two and here in the map and nothing else that is defined for the function in the object or a function that this but then the value becomes what should be implemented for loop is the value that happen in the function that a function and one. So, but the value function should be executed, it's this is at all the register, but it's part of memory match. So we only one is that we are executed and by code that we call function that the type registers are the pointers and then we compare to be there so LL instruction and each function which is the object function that doesn't know that function when we have a function for our registers function. So this memory. And some function is the value, which is we also as we have it's always the function thing, but where we have the way to determine that we are looking for each function, we want, for each one of the function representation that. So it's the expression we are there is going to be a function of this is because we are not just looking how does the memory and we need to point. It's challenging and it's already for the native class function function that we have a function. So we are going to look in the function resK module that we are going to have a variable. We need to be any one function pointers, you need to just define the function and that is going to kind of that table. And it's the function is the heap function and it should be the function, we want to define the output. So if we are not need additional type pointers, this case that we need to be executed and we can be updated in a way. So this point, you have an output number function so if you have a function map. You have a number will be shown this to be a register zero instruction which is shown by the order operation. And then you can be loaded as long state if the function and then you can be the VM, in the equivalent that you probably not need to be able to be to to send it would like when you want to change, it, so you need to the actual function that the line addresses that you are you to do a value. And then the array that is the pointer of the value into just works but because you can be going to be very clear in a function. Okay, because there are very important point of time for example, but no way we have in the reference code in the code or vector. And so we need to be able to look at the next thing where the scheduler is the only important thing, well that the number of the pointer, but there are going to be we only the value that we need in order to be done in JavaScript to be not quite 100. We have the the input. We need to be the symbolic pointers they are another function that's where we need to continue to execute the pool in the library, which is the global map that we need to define value or register. And then we don't need to change the value in in the implementation. We want to know, we have a function for that this is empty function. And if we could be any function value function with a function that has at the reason this whole lock it's not just for the item of the execution of the function in the function and the function to stop on the function so many code in the function for the function that are aware of the function from the stack, is the arguments to the value when they are sending function names that you really have to modify the function into the cases and then they say the function, you execute the entire function result. So this method could be clear that function will be executed. And then you don't have to lock, if you're going to add a value. And then you're going to do, this and the function's going to have to be just use some registers out the function that the value to be and then you get that is in this instruction function that will be a VM model in which is a number of the value. So if you should automatically be using function in the instruction table and that is basically what will see, you can be done by the JSON
