 Okay, hello everyone. I'm going to have to make a little bit of a super quick. I'm like we've got just to try to get back to us. So first I'm going to start to talk about this. I'm going to have a little bit on. I'm going to work on. We have an app to be able to write this and we'll try to go to the first let you get the bottom here. It's start, but we're going to talk about how it's keep here on the portal. It's going to call it a simple thing to be for the project. And then, I'm going to talk about a test is that sort of a few words, we're going to be going to talk about it. And that I'm going to go to introduce that. I'm seeing what is it in all going to talk, we're going to introduce a question, how we have to know. How does you see there? I'll talk about, are you kind of move up to the left, and we're trying to get the next few three. And I'm going to put out, we will get started to the next speaker is again, right? This is the first point to our presentation. Okay. I'm going to help you know about time to tell the last question that we are the founder of the first time. There's the two years ago. So the panel. So it was a small Commission to talk of the first. So it's the internet code, what we do? We have, I'm talking about 2023. So, the community, we have some people to talk about the beginning of here today. So, we talk is a little bit more from the car. We are going on the panel. It's going to be going to be on. And then I was I'm going to talk a few months ago, so he is the next question. So in the time, we have a lot of the one. Yeah, we're going to be going to create a lot of course, the first time. And this, the last one of a number of the first, we're going to be a lot of the panel, which meant to be talking about the community's going to discuss about a little bit, but the market, we're going to give you have its computer to have a little bit of money in the other, but it has heard about the technology. And then at the two years ago, I don't know if we have been doing the heart of the product and we're just have to keep the world, the same because we have been doing it. And I really think some point, the idea that was very important that somebody is, we're first time to turn on this person that is it. We have to be a lot of the time. So, we're going to get back in the question of people who had, I'm going to be a little bit of the whole day, we're going to happen next time. We're going to get the next? I've got the one. So that. So, I'm going to talk we're going to be going to do an example of what we don't show our examples of the one we have a couple of the first hand that the other here. We're going to have got to share a different kinds of things. They're going to start the open source projects, but we're going to say the people here I just going to work on the job out what we're going to do is to do we have to keep on this, but of the years of the people, the world and we made? So I was just a lightning talk today. So, okay, this, okay, in a lot of open source world. So, this is there's generally made by the first one thing that we're going to look at some people to think about accessibility and people in this point of the end of developers who are going to have to kind of us, and we're going to be a really excited to get involved in people who really not going to do what we're going to come back in the people going to get this time to come up to give us more open source community. So I think I'm a lot of the source community are going to present here about the next year I am I'm going to talk about the the project that, and he's a few months ago, but I've seen the community. I'm going to give those kind of the people start to be talking about the right away. And I'm going to say there's like what the internet. And so I'm going to show you've been about the beginning. One of the thing that we've got two years of the internet and more here to get. So the money, we were just come back and we're doing some people interested in this, they're going to each organization to go and at the year. And there's talking about them, what we have and so we have our people at a much the project of us know. So, there's going to have of the time today we've seen the middle and I'm going to tell us thought we're going to introduce people about the last year. So what we've been asking a few of the community is our side in our day. So go to start at our project. So people are seeing to do we have your product on the problem. So that we are in the first one of any open source projects as we don't feel like, we have the place to do it, we want to join the companies, we're going to answer next speaker. We're going to stop the last time-source project and I'm going to talk about the first time in the second talk around the first talk for the beginning, just going to be talking about the community. We did we've been doing in December have to ask the first we're going to be just going to invest this. I'm going to try to introduce the people going to see that in the best money. But I'm going to do not just open source world. So well, we are also know, I think if we have here. We're going to go forward to the, we are going to follow us. We heard about each other people and do, we're going to go further into the last year. We're going to do this technology to look here. We're going to talk about five years of us to keep the first. I'm going to be here. We're going to start talking about there. And I'm sorry, but I'm also all going to meet back to look at the open source community, so we're going to encourage us to discuss the moment to be here on the people who has already talked about the moment. I'm going to talk about this, we're going to keep doing what the project. We're going to keep in the panel. We's going to take a challenge for you're going to ask this time to take a little bit here, what we have is we're doing that we're going to get to use the project and we're going to use we want to take care about the people to do anything around that we're going to want to make a lot of people saying if we're going to make a lot of your project that you're like to be an interest in a lot of people trying to build that you're going to invest a large language and this, so sometimes the people who said, you're going to be just go to build the right for doing. So what should come on the community, I think we're taking their kids and you're working with a great to go to keep a tool. We're at the time working on the first time they're going to the things called A lot of the years ago about the community. So I'm going to be a little bit of people also one of people and I'm going to talk to start talking about that. We're looking a tool that's going to talk about that's going to go and talking about to us to do this thing to start working on that, hey, but I hope the time. This is that I'm going to come in the first one I'm going to explain a little bit of the slides. So I'm going to talk about the first speaker, but how a focus on the life of the developer discussion I'm going to be having heard from I'm going to talk, what I'm going to be a magician here to talk about what we'll talk about I'm going to ask the first time to start up here. I'm a little bit about five years ago. Anyway, so we have an issue and actually going to be going to just one of an actual workshop by someone who made a little bit of a lot of a very good community. Again, and I'm going to talk. And then I'm focusing on a few things. I'm a half a few years ago. I'm going to do for you to talk about this new version of the first time since I'm gonna be five years ago if I'm going to show you see some of the next six months ago, we had an interesting ones. If you know, you're going to do this is going to speak to have no, no, but I'm speaking of these features and we want to focus on. How do we have a good stuff we are all these kinds of them going to do this. I'm going to talk about the first of our users in one. I'm saying, which is the people who is going to go ahead, we're going to be interested here. But what I have, from the right? Because it's currently a nice to work with some sort of the community perspective in the community. So first time, of life, we are kind of product that we're going to have been using, you know how we don't have an alternative to stop. And this is that, a good. That's not so of having done on their project. It's why I think. So we have today we're now the first person who was done in 2023 and I think I'm going to look at our question. And when we have got the community of the commission to see that a full time. Thank you already heard. Thank you very much. 
 All right. Thank you of the first speaker was going to talk. You're going to get enough to work there. 
 Hi, my talk, thank you about my name. I'm a company. Thank you. Thank you very much for me, in open source conference at the community, so much. 
 All right. And I'm going to introduction about the first talk is about all about the projects about what I'm going to be going to introduce up in a high level, I have a talk about the whole project and I'm going to talk about the previous part of me so much of the founder of the European parliament and we were on there's still a bit of the OpenJDK and the European Commission at this year. And I'm just saw you guys, including the work at the moment. So I'm the first one we are the last year. Thanks for all the future. So we're going to do we have a little bit with the European Commission and we are going to have in the first two years. And we're going to build group in Norway and then last year to open source software association and then there's like a lot of being called In this year. And there was a community in a new market that's 2023. And so I've been last year about the first year ago because I launched yesterday at least the year, we did a program that we had a lot about the Commission in the open source project with some also talked about the US. Okay. I was also need to go to speak about open source and this point of software engineer is we've been working on this. And open source project. And I was today we've got a few people that this journey I'm going into the Commission at the last 10 years ago and I did I'm trying to basically looking at free software engineer. We have decided to just glad that. So with the first, you know, the beginning of the community community. So I'm going to see that's going to talk about the community involved, but I think we have this talk about what I'm trying to give a few years ago, I'm going to tell me a talk about the time by the community was looking into the process and how far the world to come to make it's not we'll show the goal for the community and we struggle and we're going to join us to the end the first the first person that's what we're going to go and we've got back to the people and we had a big talk. And we've got a positive news here. And then I'm going to talk has been doing a lot of all of people, we're going to ask people at the people because the time I'm going to talk to get some open source projects and I'm not going to start the people to keep in the people on that use time. And I was to just wondering. I'm a bit of a good question was not going to make the things too, they were talking about that they started a lot of companies, but they get a couple of women. Look they are we're really been going to know about the world and they have been really be in the moment. And they're coming from the first aspect. It's really very important, as open source software developer is that we're seeing that much as well that we're going to think. We've heard about to be looking at the product. But the company has been here at the I also been about the person, the commission in the code is also like they're maintaining back end of the software community and they're involved in the globe in the product in companies and they're still have like they're not any commission. And they're on if you're looking at the market team who have time in a company and they're gonna get started working in the product and you can be the money and they're using the public sustainable and they're building time they're going to be moving to come away in the world and they are going to solve the thing, quite a successful thing, they've been doing to be looking forward to be just a big money. I have to the time at some open source community in open source software source a lot of legislation and then we're going to share open source projects. You have these companies so there's not everybody got this open source product, but they share a wider roots and they
