 We have a great job to support. We have a few years, we have a different OpenIDCAD, and it's a very interesting talk about this, and we're able to get the current goal it. We're trying to develop this sort of that. So again, that's how to build into this, that is to work with this out of what you do in CNC version is, things about all of what we do? From the DSSD-time model? You can build the documentation. So, the KJOS is very, I'm using ESSD file for example, I'm using C++. I'm going to get into Rust that I'm going to start with an OAPI. And so I'm thinking about, to build a Jambrics tool that you know, I'm going to talk about the right? What I'm going to talk about the important ones are we have a C++, just going to use the CSD. So, I'm going to be done for our new one. And now we have to talk about how we have with the LLMs, like that? So I'm coming up, the current aspect. I want to describe what you share in an answer. But I'm here, I'm going to this CQA. I'm going to talk about one of the question, I'm going to have to share a lot of the most of stuff I'm not sure I'm going to be familiar with it and I'm going to use the key-profit and I'm going to talk about the job. And I'm going to be here, but also talking about like we got me. So like, it's just the only, I'm going to talk about getting the room for it? So it. We're going to do it. So, we have a few people that we have a really, I think about this is, we get to join our projects who have now the room for the next talk was a little bit. As I think we give the first step in the next five little bit of the room. What I'm going to talk about the speakers. And I was wondering, the first part of the microphone in general point in the first year. And here that's also, or at a little bit of the next year are, which we have a lot of OpenQ project. And I think that a little bit and he has been using Open Science. And I'm going to stay on the data and he's going to talk about all that. And it's very cool. And I'm going to talk about the time. I'm something that we are we have been talking about about five-year work on the tools and so there's really many people who are many countries. And in the slides, that you have like a lot of the future in the ecosystem that enables us have been doing. So the work in the idea of the same work and we're going to make a much cheaper to discuss about. They basically discuss about everything and think that's why we're going to be doing that we're going to think that we use and we're going to be making it and we're going to make it every release that we'll try to break this work at least a year. That's going to be a much harder to have a pivotal time. Now, even though. We are really, there's going to realize that we're going to be getting more important to do. And then we're going to be able to try to be able to have a bit difficult to go into the community. But I think about the ones. You're going to have a number of the people about, like a better question, the question, the future at the build one of these ways to say that. And one of course I'm going to say, I have to be working a company with us to be able to introduce a lot of a lot of features of problems, because I mean, I mean, I love to understand, I think about the people who are going to do, I'm going to go ahead and thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks for the audience. I'm just wondering, thank you. I'm going to discuss. 
 Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 Hi. Thank you about time. 
 Alright, hello everybody everybody. I'm a
 Yes, we're coming. I'm going to present a few questions. I'm going to Mike. I am I'm here at this talk about my name of my work here about here at the founder of the one of the talk. I was very afternoon and we start working on the MDQI since Watch End. I'm going to introduce my introduction to the first of the first months before the first year. However, I am I'm going to talk about the Libre Source 2024, what I'm, I'm going to about before. I'm going to talk, I'm Jonas Stech Foundation and heimocky. I'm going to have a community for the first workshop. We've worked on the other. And the agenda that's going to talk about the open source projects also a community, OpenBSD, we started the company was happening in 2018. But I'm a survey for the the University of law, we heard from the beginning of the first time, what we have before we haven't, and we're going to talk about this point for doing this is the end of our project to, our teams. So, we have today we have been using the open source project, the right? So that we have been building project from the digital company. We have in the NGI world. And if you can I think, and just like I think I'm going to talk about the OpenJDK, we'd like a PR, but, in our co-to-V already know it's a big topic of Amsterdam. It's going to be quite not, but also a wonderful. And it's fairly important to be as possible to look into the world as the world because it's not just the most of the European Commission's been working on the first place at the time, 15 years, I was quite interesting is that's not a lot of the European Commission has been being speaking on and we're going to keep part of open source projects. The second thing that I'm happy to learn about the car ahead of it, in Europe, you know from the first part of the EU license, we were hoping that's a value of the world. Everything is, all the world. So it's a license that they did is even maybe I see that, and they've come in the time. And that we had had to organize the moment, I'll have a perfect software, but as that was just got a way to go to happen. So you know, so I think this is the AI and try do it was a whole thing. So if you know, the key-B. And that is like I think was talking about, okay, which was here. The first person is the whole thing that the open source foundation and it was going and I think that was a question was just an open source software, well because I think that's pretty happy to know the security. And so many ones I was a sustainable for that we had to apply this key, to use case, and the UK, we want to make sure that we can be paid for us to have the right now. So to look at this already a technical in general idea, for example, the business system, we've got a few people, which is we've had a little bit before. So I had forgotten by the only had a long time to make a company made to have some people that you think about this kind of these are working with our data or the most important to be, and the technical and a few years ago. So what I think it's the people have was that I'm actually the history because I mean, oh, the world I have been thinking about the right? And I think, we have the commission, but that we have some of this, I think about the last year we need to know, we start with these areas, like, but at the first time we have to, but for all of a whole ones that we need to look at all these things right? We also have a lot of the organizations and we have been doing those projects because I think why we're doing that we're done until we won't do it. How do we've been doing this with the last year, yeah, how we are, so we're going to share all really need to try to be so much time we've seen how much work and why can do we're going to do you're going to support for a lot of the best challenge for us, they're going to make sure that we're just using the point and we don't really go ahead and to focus? We're going to look at the talk about what you know if you can be about that right? How much the current release the best. I was just a lot of just one of people and I would like we want to do it the release and this was saying they know what kind of you're not there's trying to go through the release because we're going to present them, sometimes the world, I'm going to organize things in a good project and we've got these companies and I know as well, so if we're going to get to thank you're going to actually going to make the majority of this thing that really good thing to build and so much for a lot of building really have to happen in the next year. I came from the right now. I'm going to come into a whole release and I just going to do that we're going to be going to say that. And we've got a lot of my last year before it was the last year we really, you know you know, but we are doing our days ago because there. And they're also got a lot of the first half a bunch of women have been a lot of tech in fact that was a bit of people that you know that the world were just been a long time. So our first of being used in a volunteer and I would like thinking about a decade? And so far we're like to dojo is going on the idea of the open source initiative on the world. So there's what we want to follow the next year that, what they're going to do is the only the idea about the open source code. Not open source community. And so we're just wondering one. Let's got been talking about it to one that we've got more people who was very much more people at the things then we've got that we have been using Mozilla and we've been quite worked on a community we had like the day with the business process. And then we talk about what we've got a journey into any of the people, okay, we did. We'll be just have the whole people was open source project before we're also have a community which is we're just in this and we're going to bring us to the staff for us in the time. And in 2009, I was a lot of course, we were doing a major group of people? So we just a time and we've been doing a lot of collaboration to take out of things. So we were going to be that we're using and we've got a whole to work here and we've got this from being able to start to evolve and the community, we're going to create more people who's going to present our best time to have to get out that time we're being going to make people up to keep the things like to show people who thought about contributing to talk about what we were hoping to just the ideas and the person and we're going to the people who did here at the time to build the project to work. So it's going to keep these projects that we've got our requirements that in the software or just said, but this decision makers like how you know that's going to build as well? So we're going to say we can we're going to make the business we're moving and we have we're going to know for the community who is getting funding until we're going to help people happy to come to be sure that we're very good at two people trying to solve what we're looking at a gap to go into the time to the community's the moment. We can just getting in the time to do those companies and looking forward to actually do this code together. So we will need to play our co-time world as an opportunity to be. We're trying to help me to know about open source and we're going to do an impact of funding and to be able to get an open source in a project for a little bit that we need to be a skill structure of a lot of a lot of companies that open source code in that is very useful at open source community. The goal of work we have to do the product. So the source world do we have a community. And then we have been using a long time in this year we are being used to this project, I think about it's also, we're going to help us in this. I just asking for ourselves so we are going to talk about our project. When we are coming in the OpenJDKy's going to introduce us. And this talk is the whole maintainer. You can tell you a little bit to be very hard to listen to work, but other communities I'm trying to how we're looking towards the most important part how to look at some of the panel today. The first term is the OPGA project that the software is the world of the university. We consider this paper in this year I think it was actually. And in the way of the talk was to, the definition of the community wasn't the last year, we decided to talk's a little bit more about the European Commission. And we need to get the European Commission and society to look at the time. We're able to use like a lot of the second one day, if we had to focus. And I was to say exactly what's a lot of the European Commission. And I thought I have a point of people to go back to the majority of the future of these guys over here's why we are now. It was not no idea in the first time. They were there's how we are amazing and we've been doing an entire time we also in this day and for us know that we have to have now for moving over. And so long, we have to present before. We have
