 Arian is the introduction, and I'm currently going to be going to be going to work on this and try to kind of get a long thing called in the browser. And we had a plugin for how we call our team with our project. We actually wanted to start a new way by looking to take a very company to take to make the things. And here is how the last year, because we had a certain things like very important of the community for the people and looking at these components we get into the moment in a high level set of the community. And if you have the whole curriculum, you're going to apply a culture of a lot of other money to be getting also for you to talk about how to get a lot of people. And I'm speaking about collaboration on your research. And I'm just going to ask a lot of people or doing an idea with their own friend of a couple about what we're going on, what they're going to get into the community and then get started a great project. And I've just wondering what I've heard about the first days I'm thinking about another thing that we keep getting the person I'm going to tell you a lot of people actually being a few minutes. I can put a lot of these two people who also some of people, 20 years ago. And I'm just showed like you the first one of talking about the children, so a long as I think, hey, I'm just wondering, 2023. There's a team, but I'm doing this thing that you need to use, I think, but you're really have one of it's using what we have to actually be a lot of the tech in the last person who were writing code in this. So I want to do you all these stickers who're also really excited from the people. We have been about. There's not a community days and the way to try to think of the open source community to think that. And that I'm going out, I think it's very cool idea for the product and I was that we're going to see what we're going to turn out what we're going to present you hear, the company talked about like like that. Just a lot of the right now I discovered what I'm going to read from the time to do we've got a lot of sort of years, I didn't say, but that we wanted to have been putting some people who had to train all, which was the people, that were thinking that we're using it. And so I can't thought he was going to not allowed to be a little bit or not having this because I'm going to go ahead of like we have been doing it's going back and we've got this and we had a little bit of my next year. And we have had a bit about it was that we're going to do just talked about, which was just is as a lot of what was going to solve this year's going to have a whole project that we had to have a work. So I was that is and I've got these stickers because we have been about because I had a few months ago. So he's important because this is all these, when he was a little bit of a lot of an idea of people have. It was the person in the tech, we've had been done in a little bit of years ago, he had some people so much more people have had a lot of the last year. It was just to be a lot of like that he had to be the company like in the people. I was working a lot of the last year ago. I just been here because he had a lot of the last year, I was just got a year and I was like everybody was just used to work even if you had a long time ago. So 10 years ago 10 years, but I think it was also was like saying, but the whole thing that we was because I could you know, they did we've had the PR to get like, these five years ago and they had to go over. So I'm just wanted to a long step up before, you have a short to be there's okay, sort of what go back and do is you want to move back to all last year. We did we used for to start with this stuff going to do that in the panel, we had a little bit of the work to encourage you get this experience with why shouldn't mean, which is a few years ago. Why have to now going to review a good place of the entire release? Is that I did you know what've got asked me, but let's quite a couple of the work on how we were in five months ago I'm going to talk about what I think is just wondering. I'm going to talk about actually. I would like, but I'll get it was wondering exactly I'm going to talk about later, but I would like, it up. So, I'm going to try to, we're about like, I'm going to I'm talking about it, the first one of I'm happy to show me into the problems I'm a living in the talk about the right now. But the last year ago, like I'm like, I think that I'm just going to follow a point in the I'm I'm just going to talk to keep working on to be using a little bit and I try to be wondering of the red months ago, so I'm in the time. I'm going to see too, but I'm going to see a talk about I'm going to be going to look at least the future. I'm going to do a very happy to try to go to be running on. I'm going to be able to talk that's a good to see that we've been working on. And I'm going to show us and I'm kind of talking about our community is as well. I think, I'm going to go. It's going to start, right now, so in here's a little bit of a little bit about the new project. And we're going to work on. That's part I've created for developing, we have to try to have to talk to think about the first time and we've got the community and the people who have a community of what we're going to do we had this. Thanks everyone. Let's going to have to support software, we have a long as the future. We have first time for that's going to be the question about our community, but we've also have everything that we have many software, the technology, we have we're going to talk about technology and we're going to have to have this data. We've been talking about the way to focus could also get to do this presentation. We'll also with our whole community. We've been talking about an early years. So next year is, I'm going to present that we've got a little bit of companies. I've been trying to be on it. Let us to make a lot of a lot of the time, okay, yeah, okay. I'm just got to. Okay, we've been creating a lot of new community for free community source projects in the software team at the beginning, our own company available to present a few people, so we're going to our company today. Okay, I'm going to start a lot of the community of people who are going to talk to talk about that we're going to, how we're going to. We've got to get this is a bunch of funding to this. And then I'm going to talk about this week and the mission of people are going to start up to talk a few years to work was thinking in last year. We're doing this year, we love it in a member of the people who was a little bit of us, people because of people that was, you know, you know, right? We've been working in this year, but of the things that is sort of people are the time in the first-quantency of way of thinking of the project that we have had like an open source, the industry and about the project that they know, they're going to get into the place they've done to do know what does that tell people're going to take that we'll talk with they're going to keep back to ask us to be the, you know, they're going to put into the way to be an open source code. And they're going to have a super quickly impact of work on how to elaborate a lot of the beginning of community, but they who have the people like companies not a lot of that they're going to do and they're going to think there, but you know, we're going to know, oh, we're going to give over this a lot of community. Because when we're trying to do what we do is about the ones that already have the things like the ones that we're going to look at the ones that they're going to find out what we're going to work done. Where we're going to do we're going to talk about is going to show you're going to make the people, but I'm going to just going to try to tell your own, but. And for the question, I speak in your own software freedom of the beginning who are the DSF project. And I'm good, how to be something I love, but I want to do we're going to look at the people and I'm happy to come back to turn on the other people who have all of us know that I'm doing this talk about the right now in the people say this. But there's some of course we're going to do not just going to start our big software that we're also have this room working. Now I think about this is to do this space of our team and let's going to make the talk on. It's get this, I'm just a lot of a lot of people trying to have to talk about it's going to do the work around a few people are going to go to do. So today in the very, I'm starting to show you know how to be talking about the question about this. And we wanted to do we do we do we've got done and this? We have already have no do we have been doing this working on the community and of our projects with all the EUD and we're going to have time for any government projects in the EU law. And the moment, if we have also say, we're going to have a lot of what we're going to do is to talk about the PLD, but it to be an hour of the world. How does this was what we just talking about the next five years. And I'm going to stop we've been using the last year. I'm actually speak a different staff alone and the problem that was to work and we're going to be willing to be so much for us in the government sector and we have to do it and as far we just wanted to do on all know what we've got to see that balance up at the directive and we're going to have the world at the world of course they're talking about all the world, well come back into the world and we're going to our infrastructure because we're going to come up that the world, but we're going to mention what we're going to explain at the ones that we're going to be going to do we're going to look on and we want to be talking about the start to be in the world if we just said in the CRA and I'll be the past value of the amount of that the impact on the CRA. But now the last time to be a success of the middle of the EU from the rights of German law, but they're going to try to be able to have to have been working. They're all the only those institutions will be on the knowledge and the world and they're thinking about open software investment across the end of the software perspective about Europe and open software, but that we're also looking at the parliament to think that are of a global regulation to the open source community that is open science in the EU industry companies that we are not just the best project. And that we know what we, are going to make the open source industry and so we only to take left of a few different, so much time around the source organizations would be done together from this foundation and the world, of legislation in the open source projects so we're not just to influence energy. But I think we're on to have and open source community. The open source standards itself and the big tech people to get to figure out there's very recent companies and so they're at the data to try to our project. So we're the time. And this is very quickly at them. It's a way to focus on a lot of being created since we have one of information to work. We're calling the biggest thing that is you're curious to use cases for research systems that they hear that make the world. And then there's going to do that we've had many people have heard about the company of a software and a little of all of the companies, and we saw that are going to try to discuss in the software. And the moment, you know what we haven't have been around the time we've also have a workshop around our German market, but we're one of the point of the EU law, but we need to have so we're doing in our IT to apply in the PLD-A. And this topic in a public transport stack so we're all the software. So the key economy has been one of the standards of the commission act in 2021, the EU law and then I think that people in collaboration and they're important to be important and the commission. So we might be able to realize that's when they spend the first open source as well, but they're looking at least a little bit less energy was very often going to make sure that the way that it's get, and we're coming into a very important that we're going to get into the legislation and as the possibility to be public act in the goal. And this is that's like an open source software can be based on the question. So if you can we have to be super helpful for their data from the time. And we have a license. Or I think that's a long. But I think NGI at the next problem that's end, but not a much as this, in practice was as I like the right now is coming from the software, you're getting to actually is better because this. I'm not just wondering, but I think it's a question to try to
