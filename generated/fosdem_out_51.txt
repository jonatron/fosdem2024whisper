 All of the things is the internet. When you're doing that? I think the last point the question was, if you want to get home. It's possible. I did, I was really like a real introduction, oh, it's just a lot of things. So we get a lot. There's a lot of, like, if you want to create the car and that we're talking a good thing that we'll have to do. We've tried to create a lot of mistakes and we're going to use this as a strong with a package that to do that. You can deploy it into a number of things that we've got over to be available. So I think we're going to speak about what we're going to talk about. Can you see that? This is basically the start to pick and we've got one of the internet. It's the next one this. The talk I've got to go a couple of weeks. And I we've got this. And I was going to solve this. But I've got to get off and I've got the room in the whole that I'm just going to do that? So I'm going to have a little bit and I'm just going to do. So, it's a little bit. It's going to come back to be a little bit of the time. I'm going to do you. I see here. They've got to start the ones for the car and the women who comes out there. They can be a lot of the US who was the first one person that came up to the first one to understand the community, the PLD had been talked about the one. So I have I'm wondering, today. I think we're going to realize that I'm going to talk about the law and I'm going to talk here and a lot of the things. We've identified this talk about us a question to people so that know what we're going to be wondering why we have this. I've got this is going to be able to ask you're planning to explain about why I'm going to open source government and they're going to create a lot of that they're going to be the product and co-violence of society and I'm going to start doing this talk about the world. And there's the workshop and the methodology. The goal of those people get the most important thing. And we've got in the most people that we will be talking about this whole company was important to having to do that could do. We have a culture of people. And these types of the organizations might be a long term of doing what we want to think that well, you can we're going to do. It's going to get the outcome at this and have to be very difficult. All right away on our idea of this kind of the future that we have been all this, but we have done last two years ago, and this year, but I'd like to talk about this for questions and that's happening as I was the guys who had to worry about the time to make it. And so the next speaker's the co-founder of the first step was why we had to discuss the day. So in the presentation, thank you guys if I have a pleasure to be here. And here, I'd like, I'm taking down for a technical technical presentation of the European Commission and the time. I am I am I'm going to see people who had a little bit. I just wondering. So I am He was going to talk to give you about the time to start doing last year I was a very a little bit of a number of the open source project in terms, really got some years ago. And I think about the whole community. And I'm a thing about the years, I'm using the community, exactly the talk to go to we've got you know how we're concerned about the organizations could think about the things which is they were that already have ever have a lot of the world and then the panel of the project and there was the only one of the people started in the technology. And since then I was a lot of the last year. So you know, I ran on the government software and it was really, well well, I made the community there was last year, and an hour to be only and thinking of the world, not the world and if I was the panel in open source project was a lot of the general. I was on the women of women and then I was just talking about the European Commission at the PLD, so I think we had a lot of years ago. And this was trying to be the product and in the government that was there was originally. And it was really had a lot of legislation. But he had quite a lot of time to identify the Commission, was the Commission's done. But it was to the time to co-dem and said that I was a bit of Italy for the policy for a discussion that was a lot of the moment for our federal party point in the European Commission in the tech law and we've been all of the CRA Europe by government working and the first time of funding in the end was to open source software because initially said, these laws that the law wasn't been really really at the US 2020, but the EU policy and they probably we were still having their public public federal of the European world in the open source to the commission law because they've been there was a different public licenses to citizens was asked the CRA and then they had to politicians and they even went to make money to get open license to organizations that have a software law that they joined the Commission as well, so they have been developed an society. So that they are a copyright law to work that's the market. So we have about the community, there were talking of the world of law that really, for the world and people who are people and then we started providing government of open source law or those law and they wasn't really good and they did not buying and they want to be able to grow to work on the law, a public value to be an hour and they were that point and it often from the organization think it was very important technology that a positive and they were able to try to think that policy act on the public policy and so long the company was exactly the EU law, a world, or they did they're not had to be first the railway directive of course but they couldn't talked about that could be the money with the world for an law because they did we're just have a clear because they have like they didn't just take away and so we have no matter of you should be even be to say is another law. And that we think about the CRA to be the legislation. The moment it's great that to see the copyright, to what we're changing copyright law, for the law and the law law. I think of the law directive after an international infringement. And they are the money in law from the question that is that the copyright. They use of the law and the first law at this law was the commission can also does not only at the law that the European CRA and the law I don't know the law. So the German law first aspect of exactly the way that for the licensee rights or law clause has been infringing to open value and in copyright happens to be the PLD law and GPL States was used. Which is the federal laws law open source law. There became an appeal to German law and the GPL law that there were this was still the license legalmaking field since with law. But as they were actually only open law that is given happened a software law law person and a law and an law. This is essentially a GPL that it did we said, so in law who was one holder was two copyright who was a license. You can be only follow my copyright and they had had to actually used into legislation to do and they have a directive, but he was the law to be not sure what is just to be, also going to be, they said we were trained at a copyright law to want to be some third law or as well very important decision. They decided to do the law and they were wondering. But they had a GPL and they have no, not a decision law and they were to do they've got to a in a copyright license and we was taken that he gave the legislation. And that well. And the law, this was a value changes that public law in first. And they were just they were asked politicians that they should be great bit of those market effect. They cannot be also public copyright directive. And the law they didn't know that the company had no court was always done a clear at the moment. They were saying that they had the time to spend time to be well in a person came from the people had that they want to the law and had a decision that were a copyright license copyright but they were aware of the copyright infringement has a law in a regulation. But they just when they didn't get an copyright cost was exactly the GPL person to have companies and no sure that that they are actually made a license and they had was done to be a legal court. And that was not, they've got a huge history directive. But if we see it was a copyright law and they would be sure and they were saying they heard of value in a law that we have had to be stored but they have this panel and at least on the world as an important and it was from I think the value of that she has decided and to do they had the organization and they had to be a copyright law that point their field they didn't really have then they do not open only in companies don't have to go a copyright issue that kind of the copyright in their signature or the license has no exactly necessarily used is that by copyright's clearly the GPL is that this gatekeeper often a copyright infringement had was in the GPL the market because they don't get this industry was actually had initially they had to make sure that they were from the copyright clause was done the licensee is just thought of the last law policy was the license has I think our future we were already ask but we don't know so we're not understood that I just going to understand you please, or because we were really want to do the world and we're in their rights and they have to do not necessarily know that we're not being it's in the law and they're just mentioned and still looking again not sure that they were changing the rule. I think these terms of the license may be a the copyright as you know the law can be that you know in open source law. And the state is often done or so as you think that the last year we are not seen before we have seen in the product for a copyright work through the source license and political nature so that the copyright rights law to have a copyright law directive. And I have almost enough copyright law of the law is GPL in the work was copyright? So for tax law. So that is closed license regulation and the lawmaking and I've had copyright infringement of legislation into copyright and the product to have the effect of license value that we can be the law we want to always have copyright law because you know that that they need to remember the value and the license and because we need that people from the copyright as much understood as well it all the commission law has been used any copyright law which means that they didn't call they were a copyright decision has an law or people are the law that they're going to follow from law law or not that when the PLEC and they will be a license for a copyright rights and that the GPL. And it's always is in the license directive. The European law, what. We know is the, what you have the copyright value of the copyright law. So the directive to the reason that nobody said nobody had it's an policy value was a value to be in the beginning of law law. And in the copyright forecast and law would be the GPL law isn't the law. And you I found in the law that you think a copyright market copyright holder was in the decision law. I didn't have the GPL law of law law means they would be a big so just be a copyright copyright value of law license and not viable society can if I will only trust the copyright legal issue that the market directive at the copyright law is still, no means the energy law is kind of the value and as I'm just doing copyright law would be used by their GPL and they could make decision of a that cost of the law that they cannot only was that is the GPL this money in the law or not even have said is the, so yes. The GPL law that the law and GPL law sector law in law, I didn't know that rights as and mandatory and since it's the license is allowed the copyright infringement agreement. What now they have the government and the copyright value of the source law license copyright activist say, the copyright infringement would the copyright infringement of GPL law that and civil legislation was only value would actually made there isn't even to law in copyright law and a law be what's only only to a law did he was a copyright law only copyright who were no be, so we had to have a law, we have to the way that they had said that we had about the US license an open source law license that's the politics but I said that they were just has become so the law to that a law from the value as open and they said that means and they have a law, and they are not the law laws that was the cost to be the value to the conditions that nothing to a law forces that came from the copyright law are that no copyright law needs they're not even able to be required sector was defined on the directive that there were not only mandatory value that the law rights copyright of the copyright law should never had that law and and their law of a notion. They are that they were worried of people decided, was in the German law she has just had some copyright that the law, but the copyright holder did, they were not have for decision in a copyright copyright law directive and they had no German GPL they didn't say no, but they have to be aware of copyright and so still to do have any a copyright felt about copyright license but a copyright licenses ever want to the same value and free license gap of license and they don't necessarily notice the copyright law in the copyright license holder gave up and law was the market was actually very well don't think there could be any copyright and we could be the copyright rights GPL policy does it mean that they made really have no longer be open source license is to which I as in this copyright who got answered the court law or law and they are just
