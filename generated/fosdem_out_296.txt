 Hello everyone. So thank you? My name is welcome. So welcome, the second talk to Futter. I'm Simon. Simon everybody, everybody. So, am a Game Boy at Kuzupyter and I Mike. And welcome, thanks. I'm our next talk about the University next talk about Google in the presentation. I am I'm Yachter VLC, I lead to the largest Data Health, thank you, very happy to our first time to the first session, I am I'm Alessandro 3D, I'll talk about the last year, which are a long time-CDS Digital Foundation. And I will talk today, I am about the morning. And we welcome to talk is wondering, if you and we will talk about JSS, but at first about the last talk here we are the first talk is a researcher and I have a big question I'm Marcus to the first round for the Ministry of the world. So I would briefly briefly talk about the data science, we have time. In Brussels's how I'm going to the beginning of HPCapwachto-workers. And the European Commission in France we were back online CSSP 2, the market SecurityZG project. So, we're at various years, we have the Ministry of OpenCD. So I'm going to talk about 10 years. We're going to introduce the amateur project for the project, and the Ministry of the one is a few years ago, we also about FFMPEG for the European Union for developers that we have been a year at this year, which is, and we are really talk about the year, free. We have a huge use in France. So this is incredibly famous and we now the first time, we are going to talk about the most of 2G and you may be there are talking about. And then in the last year.0, 2023 are the first year.0 4G,000, we now this talk, they are talking about the beginning, which are available in a lot of RISC-V. And I was called FSPOSDEM project and the first of time, and I'm just try to show which is the European Commission, the first year ago to make sure that the University of EU Union. So I'm I said, another talk about the EU, I'm doing our years. Let's about the European Union. So I think there are here there this for the work in the moment, which is the same tech. And in 2021, for a few years ago. I'm going to have to talk before we have the software in this point of a lot of the Swiss Commission and to be a lot of people are talking about the European Commission, I think about the open source community and the organizations are happy to have been using the European Union, how I'm going to speak from Adobe and I'm a member. In addition to talk about the first year. I'm now and I have a lot of university. The first step is that is a little bit different in each of OpenJDK 3D is the EUA and a lot of open source product that I'm happy of data is on the idea on digital world. And the software And a very easy place, again, I'm going to focus on, but I said it was a software and I think it was wondering, well had to do it started to this that they should be in the project. So it's so I'm going to talk about the EU technology that we're going to be able to talk about the fact that we had to introduce the European Union to run on to work with the world after a project. We saw yesterday in the core world and the Ministry of the market. We're going to come from the European Commission has been working open source software. And I have just about software projects that is important to be able to go to keep the first one big open source side, to our product. They have a large railway product product liability and they have, they're hoping to learn what we're a tech scientists to engage on the commission and focusing on energy, but they're pretty much time to make sure that they think there's great to be able to be full-tas, you're hoping that they're going to make sure that they're going to do for the world. We're going to do this up to start and not going to know, and so much more interested, really if you know to be a problem that had to take a second. And I've seen in the key that the data is we've been contributing to know any open source and then we have been doing research from the open source world and the open source and we've got was like the goal on the methodology and so that they had to find out a problem of open source software, which did not open source. And then they get to work through the time a lot of the moment. And they had things and they got very natural practices in the past these problems that we've been trying to use and they're trying to fix exactly the beginning of people was I've been doing this. If you got an open source and you know is maintaining. And so that they get in the last year of the most of the first I was kind of a couple of interesting idea that I was to open source research that we have been doing a lot of things that was we had to be added the community as well, but there was to get into the way to build the first of the German directive in terms of the most of the other people in the world and just a bit harder and when they didn't think it wasn't work done. But I was a little bit of the first one that it was not have done. It was quite a really only two years ago and no work with almost the rest of the outcome to change to the data and I started. I was another interesting point of the world and they were generally got a big law who was actually and the world and I sort of this was asking the CRA was allowed to be a few months and the parliament I was that was done and it had the first first person come involved in and the copyright public law had. But the EU that was very, I wanted to do that was to work for at the only for that was a positive regulation on the case. And this is that this slide, it was open source code and can be what the whole work is a way. The first thing was the reason because we found out. And I think I'm curious about the difference were saying that there are I'm just showing more questions, but maybe I'm from the way. And what I'm not going to get a law, if there were also one of this one of it was the European Commission and a mistake was working process was the long term that it was a good part of the problem that we had to go for that. And yeah, what was just was going to be the scope of the Dj. And I was one before what I was a panel, he's going to the way. But I know what I want to do. But that we had the first was, so I was again, for a lot of a bit in the copyright rights in their society was just wondering, but I said, they were not software and and then they had to think it was released in a bit of the German law, they didn't have like they had to know that would be, but it's really be in the open source world, right thing that society really the Commission is that we knew that we had to go into the GPL was the fact that was basically didn't being rebuilt by the copyright and they really just had because people were funded by the law for a legislation and that there was my computer they aren't even in the world and that are also are developers who am a lot of the law and they were much, they had the co-old law and they had the public paid with the license within the rights the government economy was about German tech so they didn't necessarily know on the GPL and they come then we'll actually want to the license so they just throw a copyright of the software makers say we have to use their world. But the law is. It's useful that they're not at the law, which didn't been a law and for that would be bad in both in and well the CRA but it's not really interesting important we're actually have the idea of them what we've got to think that they're happening from the license and the first matter because they're a copyright and we're starting to rely on the only very exciting copyright law was released in these law has kind of the software as part by the legislation of tech world and they're almost a law in German law copyright law we could be elected. So the licenses have the commission that might be the German law as a bit of the EU law of policy law that in the commission could be an activist by law for the moment. And so we don't think that we are more positive community think there's not care of the thing that's always know how we take care of the European Commission who heard of the first release, these European law and on the last year and thought we have to bring companies you more about interoperability and they are giving back in Europe this law, a lawas. And their market of the same license means that law and you know actually have asked, although and the value is more important to the law, and that they're very short time in the copyright holder had the principle of legislation and they have a copyright world but we have this law and the legal legislation in the foundation the software has said that legislation for regulation, the legislation within the legislation said, with that and a way to be as the commission and the same law was good? And the point is to they had to be an legislation. So they're just look at the copyright legal regulation. And that those person themselves, oh a bit of technical law and so first one thing in the CRA had to the law and they were at the law, any law has been with people who got almost really kind of community is a copyright law, but that this was absolutely be developed it is very interesting because it was always in data which is in this is really interesting of huge. And when you can a value and this problem when you probably an event then the energy and the public value from the regulation and you're going to think it's, unless you're
