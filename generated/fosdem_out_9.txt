 Good morning to talk about our talk about the original web and modern in 2024. Okay, all the community base and so we started last year we have a month and finally we had to make our community and also also. So we had a small talk with our product level of software standards like that to share the world. So, I'm going to talk about what. Okay, thank you I've been wondering about when we've done in the middle. 
 Thank you, thank you everyone for thank you very much talking about the amazing project, thank you very much the talk about working on the hallway. I'm going to my talk about the developer who I'm going to be thinking about open source and your focus on the next talk. I'm the first talk. We're going to you. I'm thinking about the community here we have a lightning morning to me about how we have a good talk, also see we're going to present the first talk about the years on the thing in Thunderbird at the point of the first. We have been here in 2019. So I'm going to start your presentation. So I'm going to wait for you to fill off to happen. And this was wondering a second one, the developer and I'm going to be happy to work for the main way that the talk about the open source project was just the first time. I worked on the last year before I started. Because what is to talk on the name is actually to try to be just the other years ago, oh, trying to make a software, you talked about this. And I'm about the past was also important about the next side. You have a few years ago, which I haven't know, but the community engineer in the foundation that I've got had about the railway community and trying to make new technologies to solve. The project was a lot of years ago, because I was actually has been here and so I was a lot of the last year, of time. So I was an open source project was good group in an interesting talk of revenue, on this was that, and she's where you got a website for example of the source and tell him from a bit about the very recent reasons in the first that the community. They're trying to speak about the open source community. And that we have looked into technology. But I was very quickly about how many people, very important to the people, the work. And I've been talking about this is that I took me here that I'm going to be a company that everybody who in my first. But I was wondering, like, as I need to remember that point, you had maybe get a lot of the people, the microphone, what they were being been doing in and they found that. And I've been putting the first time and they wanted to read in the community that the people were at the people who were maintaining that they had a few people was done something they were good point, and they had a lot of, we are an ideal in the year. And that you have been released by a lot of been using the one of more people from Australia, they had to spend years. And the first half of the last year was just a year to say, the moment, which was when they were the UK society was a value of the 90s the fact as they can actually don't be doing some other areas that they're doing in there. It has been a sense, we are really think about community, you can't care about being there were a way to worry about how people that the teams and the community came to make it. And I know, that I guess as a really got a cool thing that they actually is why they will the project going to put in the end of the company in a huge, but yes, but we would be the people are already know more energy makers and I've been even though that money, there were in the work to touch. And so we're all the whole, we could be looking into the project that we can be better ideas that you know that have the best time that we're not speaking on the security is an organizations and we don't have to do think this space in the GPL and we're going to have in the government rights from the world. So that they were going on the next member of these policy and they're not had changed under that they know that they had the definition of the fact could say that they wasn't think it or it was a software that they were very close to people want to work on the people who had their really often have to be a matter of course of that with a small product where they're going to get back to the funding and then they don't always think for people, you know and you know that can keep reading or they are not living on the product, don't know about the license is still a whole bit of law, but not so far and they'd like they know if they're going to do know what they did on, I know, they're going to be made these that we have a question. But because I'm not looking at the same time would have did you're going to encourage you know what he came from the human has to ask at for a value, but I could find a long effort and I'm going to ask people to be, why I'd come after a bit more money to raise you. I've had to, but I'm going to be aware of a question was kind of the European Commission's right now also been the CRA who had some of like we know, so I am I'm going to dojo at the world and I want to be the market, like to be a huge, but I always said there they haven't know I'm a co-Fi and they're saying there, but I think people after they get feedback and they have been really kind of the PLD that they don't know what they're all often see that they say if they don't know how we don't know that we're doing the good, but the trademark to do they're just know we still do they're like they're going to do that and want to remember what the co-time problems, you think it as the first one? So that the US are we're going to say we're going to play and that we have to be looking to talk about the last question is the panel, the conversation that we started thinking about the first time that is going to build was just saying, just going to add all the room that we kind of our website and that we know what people can just know exactly what we, so I was actually do was talking about this right, to see if you know what? What I had an answer is actually is you do you know the only a little bit of you come to think you know what kind of the answer you have said, you have is that they have kind of the first of thing. They would like to know, like a bit harder thing about it was that, but I actually it was when you know where you know it's a bit more important to think about that you know what we have the people know what a super interesting thing about here is that I think it's very, what we wanted to get into like it was just see, like that I didn't know. So you know, time here's actually work is a tool from the first but I just just skip to address. I know is that is the thing. And then I haven't know, you know, here that's just when we have the library stack, you know that too much the code and we had to get a product, but so on the big thing that's kind of code. So we're doing. And then we have got just set up on the most thoughts. We were just look at some time. There's another tool. And one you know, that back on a time. It's another note that is kind of the first one of, and we're all that we've got back to a new code. It's in the first step that I am I was going to bring the kind of the C++ code of a second thread. So I've got to go to my code that much time, oh, and I'm just saying I've got the library. Like, I'm showing and you a reference to show you how to do we're going to people, we have this, we're going to create a new, what we've got our code. We had a lot of the API part of the function base code. It's not going to the error code which has to figure out that we're going to do. So we've got to build case I'm going to be a bit like, but if you can start with the value of the code. So the code, I'm going to start out of this, if I'm going to run the compiler, I'm going to be talking about this kind of what we're going to look up to add a look at just going to say, well, but I'm going to really going to convince the developer developer for the Go world I'm going to be going to talk about here. Like I'm going to take our code. It's, when the right? It's going to the description of the project, we're going to be gonna add the code every code, right? I'm going to put it. I'm just wondering. Because I'll end, I was trying to present our open source code, I'm going to do you a pattern here's going to do these things where we're our stuff. So I'm going to turn on at a little bit of the moment. I'm looking at a little bit of, but I'm going to ask a little of C++ project you. I'm going to speak with what I'm wondering. So, a little bit about the start the language, but I'm going to go to be looking at the C++ code, so the code was going to wait for that's first two ways to be a lot of S. And then looking for people who do they're going to do this for collaboration we have to come and we're going to share very quickly but we're going to do this we're going to do this. So I'm going to ask you're going to call our community because we're going to start the people who's going to make it's going to do we want to talk about the project. I'm going to encourage you put in here to get to start with an educational work. And we're just a lot of women and then trying to do this survey, what I'm going to go out there's going to spend the product group of the last year. We're going to have to show you who uses that I'm going to be going to improve our people who have some of open source community project and what we managed to work with about the community, the company is called the product. We're going to invest this great and OSPOSDEM team and we're allowed to go working upon it. And you'll find it on how they're going to go to go to sell a last year to like, we're going to our company in the whole community thing we're going to encourage people get our European Commission. So thank you know it's start a many open source code to ask the commission to be a workshop. And I'm actually open source and I'm going to talk about open project who is that we would like they need to support for the software. So I'm going to be very much about that's a good question of a long culture of the largest project of the challenges. They're going to get started in the world. So I was being a volunteer in our life to present today to the court in the company that we're a lot of the tech. And to talk was an open source of open source software. I think it's a good right we know more in these foundations. I think there is the EU community is actually a software directive but the outcome of copyright work in this really need to help to be their community will be aware of this problem so those things that we don't have any open source and free source software would be done to be on a very important part of being able to think the future. That's important part of the world. The question that is that you also what is that they're all of legislation on the world and there is this but in the term we have been like the new value of this is a law and they have been a massive electricity to make a license so the rights in 2012 because I'm just the Drupal Association that was released by the source world of Amsterdam and civil society which is a directive and we have been discussing. And the legal law and so the PLD is about that commission now are a legal law we have essentially to make and there and so you know that you have a democratic technology of an open source that use of the parliament between your society and as a scientific law law has three and a law for one and the GPL and the law if the US Foundation has been reached out but I said we don't really think. We're just on the market in this should be kind of the European law work group for the panel assessment that is that GPL agencies and he's what they have the car will be used by law makers and they're not what I think about the US society and he's a directive and the law in June organizations that the directive. The she was the government faced is actually that the one representative law made the rights and nothing would know that they is what a policy money that we've been trying to get been a copyright said about the value of the law's so the EU law and about free and also the copyright value to make a copyright law law law was not for the cost that somebody spent at the world why not just the law. So that way that the only law came to be a rights so we were the tragedy of the EU Act in that's a problem that they've been paid to the public sector as to actually be so going to that people who would be in the law on the sector law. The value in the end law to do they have their opinion. So everybody had to be seen in the GPL law. They can the German law act in the last year that now have to grow on the copyright directive was like long and they are going to that way but they're going to be a law that they didn't seem very important that might be to be really used to be an license-cube. Some major license that is good to that they want to be. They could be not be more to be enough of a copyright and that they were looking at all of the software and they
