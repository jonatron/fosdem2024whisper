 I think about a half of 40 years? And I think I'm going to see the first thing that one is this is amazing to be in the year. And I'm going to talk about the industry and open source development of the research and is all of the day and the other people are building communities to use this research and I'm thinking about this and what do is that is about first of the documentation that like we're going to stay a couple of people that have to make this data we have in open source software and we have to have those of ways that we know how do we can we are going to participate in so we have to look at the world we've been talking about a lot of people who have to worry about the sort of like those of more with the decision from people who are very important to have that we're making funding to focus right in that they're going to spend two years and there and the way and yeah, we're going to be one of one more people not an AI can start on and our science was going to go in the AI community group from the GPL and they're going to do that you know from going on place what they're going to have to do in the problem. And I have to be just wondering that it was just is actually going to be a community in the world of technology from the knowledge that our work on the world and we've got a small research and we've got the way you're seeing and then one that we're interested in the people that's kind of the software community actually just the whole point that were in the project and we're going to work we're going to be a really a time to see the people to make this to open source code that the current in, but I'm going to start to get it's the right hand in the problem of the future and I'm going to start to be a little bit of a lot of work on this is one. But I'm going to be quite a very well everybody alone and so I'm going to re-bomb, so I've been glad that we've said, so we're very good trying to try to have come and I had to understand how we're here because we have you're going to do it. And we're going to be talking about the community, because we've been thinking about technology at that the first. And there's going to talk about the community, we're going to be talking about what the community has some people to be more things started we've heard about over time and to actually came back to think about me, but that, and so we're going to and we're just open source community and some we would go to solve the team and I'm going at the slide. I'm going to get in the right now. So, I'm going to present there was good talk about people going to talk about that we decided to wait for the question about that we had to be a bit of the first person that for people don't have to do something that and we had to talk to build a couple of the community. The first advantage of this is the last year. And we're going to get an infinite time we're going to be here. We're going to show you know, I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk a minute. And we want to talk already, but I'm going to talk about the presentation, okay, I'm going to talk about this the right, I'm going to introduce a little bit about the last year. And then I was working on front on the best question. I was going to be thinking about the open source and open source project and digital work with the world of the things we started getting down and companies that the open source community and open source community, why we've been by two years ago doing AI community in the time. I think it was really a really a project to work and I'm going to look at a very nice ecosystem and I would like you're at it because we're basically call a lot of my market community is something I've had to be quite a couple of open source projects and would have been a lot of people have been at the most people and what's a little bit of open source community and that the point of the people get the future to work in the people are in the world that we can get a lot of that they could probably feel free world. So the only thing is... So there's the last year we don't encourage people who is to follow the world in a lot of the documentation in the talk. And they're open source project. We're going to be a lot of the value system projects and I only thing that we have a workshop and open source in one thing that's on the good point that a huge approach. And we've got the last year we've got the future. We're on technology we're like 10 years of the plan to do we don't want to be a lot of the community that we've been on the kind of and we're going to get something from our users as a lot of the infrastructure on the digital world that we're trying to realize that we have been getting the time to go back to working we've got into open source companies having been done by the projects that we got quite a big companies and I'm going to get to go off to their project. There's happening in the other people get confused about two people around the open source project and they've got a lot of different one of things you've got a community space from somebody's the community. We're going to have to look into the last year so far. And they're going to build in the goal of the product on the government so many years. And we're going to be focusing on this initiative and the parliament to actually in the funding that I've been open source so we're going to be looking at the time for the world to have been at the community and we've got come to keep back to engage with the time. So so many people who are right to not going to make a huge practices to be a lot of people that the work, I'll tell us in and I'm going into the whole software engineer and I'm going to talk about the same challenges. I think that was doing things we know, so to get it's coming up in the commission that we're actually're organizing the EU and I've got to be very glad that we're trying to speak a lot of a bit of people who's more at a few of people who were very much of people in a whole curriculum and because they're trying to get their project. So that was my world that's not just a lot of tech that could be really not the right at what they're going to build a lot of people, like we're trying to get in a free software. I'm going to do I'm going to follow out that people because, but they're talking about someone who? I'm going to participate in the world. And we're going to come just going to turn out. So today. And I'm going to do it's going to the first of the fact that we guys put in the right now is, but they're going to give a lot of project. And we people from the same step more organizations, the way to follow the community and you're going to get somebody who am happy to give you to, but we got a lot of time and I've got the last year. I'm going to describe the people, and I've been trying to make a little bit of effort to show you know that people who were able to share their goals today, for what we're going to the world and we're going to make the best to start on someone who are going to do that somebody who was saying, but they actually quite a matter of the first hour and we could't want to think some of the fact that when you can get your culture of all of what we'll look at this back to do is going to what we've got here to start a lot about it. Does anyone was really have a short to be great. It was trying to get a couple of saying, and he was a lot of months ago. And I could be even mention. So a little bit of some of the idea of the people in the time and the code for the, the most people see that we're actually need to work in the problem that came up here and had to make the first steping, because we had actually continue to note and they're really care of the end of the community. So he's me at a little bit of the people that, we're, I think this year ago, they're concerned. They're going to move to do lots of the best thing, we've got to our first step over the best time. So they're going to keep you know that they're going to be there was a do a lot of the foundation of things so many, for the sort of weeks ago, but it's what somebody who'm looking into the world and I'm wondering about that we have been looking at the question, which was to say it had to say, but actually building that we have been doing a lot of a year. So she had is to make the open source software community who doing that was actually been made in that they could look at the time to be the world. And on the first one year. We had to worry about the point. Most of how do a bit of the idea, the first thing is that they are that was the community was going to do. And if he's kind of companies we had to come to assume that to look at the lives of the product, to participate in the people who had to give a lot of the future project that's the world and then they've been trained on the community and he's going on their culture and they can't work on the experience who has a community. Just went through the work on making and they're just keep talking about the open source communities involved in the good practices down to make a lot of legislation to get from people who are going to the community. The community as they're doing that they're building and they're looking at the staff are the last person. And I'm going to have to be a whole project and that we're going to focus on the European important and we're trying to just doing the people know from these customers and they're going to have in the conversation. I'm going to go to do that a little bit of a lot of an hour that we're going to take a lot of our code and they're getting funding that the term and if they're going to show you're going to do the big people who is going to bring a little bit easier. So we're going to be going to thank you to talk about the question. And we've got these people who can see the answer is coming along the interesting. And I'm going to do you going to get the real time and about what they're going to try to have time over and we've got the microphone to tell you are going to choose a little bit less questions here about the first and how it's going to be open source world. Most of this is that the first step is where the summary of the same time we have a very expensive thing that we have the community and we start in the ones that helps us, right now going to do we have to be the future and open source community is a lot of the right then we're doing this approach was going to take into. We've got a certain number of the product that we've done in this direction of people saying that are going to do we're going to have an agent in one of a question of the world. So we've been having a lot of the OpenDesk community has to be an open source world in terms of organizations who was going to do some commercial product of us involved here if you need to use the open source projects, you to be able to show you need to set up and you about the API to collect the product, I'm going to be open source software and so on the problem they're going to work with the good people to have and they know what we've got the point of open source team who were doing and like open source projects and therefore all just the building on the PLD or I had seen in there's the end of the way of the community and then the decision and I'm getting the second one might be able to make a couple of the person to have a lot of and trying to be nice discussion in what he's going to do is you're going to do for you're going on the community scientists that don't get a lot of people who have found out and the people. And that people keep doing the community, taking care of it's because they have a point in other people and they're not get to make sure that out the time to be a way that I'm really happy to be quite sure that they're going to do that. I'm just see what to be doing is going to do they're going to stay on the way. Some of being able to worry about them up, so much time they're going to make sense to do together and he's going like a way to think about the one or you set up. But I'm curious about the project and I'm doing this company and I'm just wondering when you know, you're going to get that if you're going to talk's going to keep going to get into people, okay, I'm just wondering, but for me. I'm going to be going to work since we are going to go to do an open source is going to make sure, I'm going to write it, but I'm going to take another talk about, but I invite you to think they're just wondering for that, so I think about? I love to encourage me from a good question. I will be a lot of the other ideas, one, it's what I'm a little bit of five years, four years ago because they're familiar with the open source community and they want to do I'm going to know, but I'm not sure that, the place and they're going to be talking about finding this and all, what digital lives we're going to do you know why we are doing. I hope, I'll talk about is going to look at least people. I'm just as an open source because this working on the right now, the moment, so we're going to be as I said, we're asking the time. And that there's focus on last day, one of course, like we're just to be wondering if the year, I'm doing the project. So I just
