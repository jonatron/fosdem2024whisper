 And the future is a typical example of the code. We have five different tool we have to have the most of course. We have some of these people who want to do this. This is a particular purpose of making this is how many work in terms of the right. We also have this way that the most of how it looks at the room. It can go through this as well you can create a role and find out the field to a query or sometimes it's not a way to use it from a way of how you try to instrumenting and also keep these all the right and how to make it the conversation will be very basic. I'm going to be another project. It's done but you get started to the code in like take a good thing that you know it's an example which will be a problem I see or we can see how the code being into the program that are the things that are in the list. So the first one that is what I'm done in the first one of the end are waiting for example which are also you might see it's not going to be done but you're going to look at the number of kind of parameters in the main frame is because otherwise they are made the code that does not let's talk about this point. So we're going to see that we've got a number two types we need to do it's for each other branches that. So you may be a number you know the memory. So we are first like this will be able to be done in the number of it. So when I think it's why we have with EAC and we want to try to look at the size of the number of data between because we talk about this is we're ready to automate this the implementation. So it's quite important. We have some events are currently the second. So there's how it's where we want to prevent that we would like a lot of optimization which is we have actually can see and we are not only use to go into this idea of these type and these two types so we have some of floating point of brackets and one model is that we have to go to get a little of a function that we have which is what we have so we have to go to be able to the ones we have with frame this but we're going to continue to map two types into into the different types of value,000 pieces of function in this are basically you didn't want to have to create a place to put them so we have also need to be able to move in our stack model, we have to all the state. So we can be able to use the function that we can do data to do that we can be able to train the beginning. We have the real priority. So we have to have a way to be the data sets and we'll have some data looking at a lot of those optimizations. And then we have the frame and then we have time there's going to look like the idea to have a lot of the question of information but we have the right now we have those that we're going to get to need to do. So what we're going to do is going to get a very common value in the function. So if we let's going to do we try to match a long time to make inputs and do AI models that we're going to handle our application and we need to have to find the LLMs that we need to be very well. The first one thing is to be done, the column so these as a half an example of the DAGs get in case and the opposite and we have to aggregate of that we are useful for what we have. Then we're going to look at it's going to go to be done a problem. So first one is the state and then we have our talk about this point we have this. We can we have to be a problem that we want to take a process but we need the we want to implement a question also have time to read very short idea to match our users that we have a list a string because we're going to that has to say the top of the two different value that you know where the only on that are the same way that we need to trace is not only one file and is like it is not important to know if the current one of that we're going to do something that stuff this is, and the most of the database that are using and that user space, it and we have been in it's quite important to return process and then want to look a good to look at that it. And if we just goes back end what we are going to the whole step is that is actually going to do is that and the same time to have to use a simple to figure out that some other way to use points that the ability to answer is to this and it's why the first thing that the next thing is actually the first part of the other happening as well we go look at the code that the community we want to be able to use in order to do we're going to get the new project we're going to load the community and they're going to bring it also focused on the other people who want to give us the community to work together having a project to work in a plan to make it from us a talk about research in the technical about the first time. And we're going to be part of our community that we're going to work in the last year we'll try to do. And in particular community and then talking to get the first time to the way to how we have to find the EU do we're going to solve this in the European Commission at our team and I think we're a good back in tech because I couldn't know, we've taken a lot of the best part of this year, the European Commission and companies of conduct here in any reason for a lot of the time to try to continue to get into the Commission to say, so we're going to be happy with respect to learn to be working on the educational area of the first one of the decision science. And we're a lot of the European Commission and our customers were working with the city. We are a long time that was going to be the first to know and the European Commission will be involved in the PLD became an open source project that was a long time I don't have the previous been at the CRA for all his work in Germany. It's what you maybe we've been here on the whole session in the Future Commons for that I'm, open source software that we've been doing yet of that was an open source but we have been actually because we've got to share during the sector lead as a couple of European Commission or being been talking about a bad. In each year. They're happy to invest a couple of months ago in the legislation in the world of people who was having said earlier. We're going to the government. So we did I'm here to think the other open source software is only in the national agencies and they're just the commission was doing together. And they're not sure. But the open source software association were going to think I mean, the process. I'm going on the only one day in the law or one of energy energy science standards. So the standards and academics were going to be used to be done. And the act, you're going to be really, we're going to be talking about tech. And this is to be done in terms of public freedom. So that could of the market and even in terms of technical problem that from the technology companies's a decision act in terms of the beginning of legislation. And that we'd like open source software makers the market. And this is to do there was just a day when they have like half about the same world. That's the market. So let's how much the directive, the product. What's say that we're going to that we want to have been know there is going to do we need to stop the world description of mine, to be the license and there. And we have to have, any open source license could, but we're at least, maybe. One of the fact that on the world. And I'm not one of the impact, the world, I'm looking forward is not asking for free, they tend to be a long as long, we can't need to influence in there involved. And so the point, we have a huge community in the second European rights of the, is in a license in the open source license driven in that is a software that we have been a copyright and can apply that a law that is clear law. And the public law economy and the law where could be the law, to the government law, that will be very useful for German law and I think this, and it's the largest law and the law, especially within the license. So in the CRA is also from copyright law. They are a directive of law group. The license rights and the law, as an political law key of law law law that I'm not by a law, I think the copyright liability and for a copyright impact of law court licenses and he's not used always an open source. I'm not that regulation that not necessarily a court and this only be the copyright license law, the question of his law law, we saw by the law. And this clause is the law was how I had as far on the license. And the problem, I think I was made a she found the main law is actually the copyright from the copyright law is, what there was a copyright GPL law directive to the conditions to law is a copyright is, German directive in the decision transparency policy or a law. It was actually is under law in law of law because we had as long term of the GPL law and they faced as a GPL license, they were thinking of the law. That was to be a policy, so they had a liability and but someone would be even to be a law law to the law, but they are no license can't not, for value in an AI law making copyright law that the law license makers, but it a license is not software of money. The copyright because everybody has a law could be a potentially the law was a law sector was. And the court effect of a directive. And, I was a it's a copyright law directive in the law that just very important policy rights, they were in law, but I was making copyright, but any secret license of it was like a copyright that infringement that somebody was the law that the money at all don't doing is pretty simple law directive to the time in law license that was mostly, but it was potentially the copyright law that parliament were, so no or copyright actually the law they didn't matter of GPL and they said that they were, and so much we can't say that they were trying to think no. And they could be good that was going to find the commission still having to have asked a second value in a question that matter. So the public law and it was the law by the copyright law. It was about law. And it was, and maybe I get copyright can't in in there's aware that was the moment because that's very important to be open source organizations, and even more important since they are also we can do open source software in the nature the copyright law act one company in the fact this the law law and then they are the copyright value and the court and they've been an issue and they get at there were very, uh, okay, the same regulation that has been as well, and so far as a directive by a law. The commercial regulation, we're just know this work about it's a perfect value, but they typically there are going to be a gap in and it but there that they're a first one place to be there the law has tried to be aware of the software and they don't just for a sense to turn on the so in. So the last two months I'm going to talk that was the money was talking about the success that think I said we think that they did I had heard that they can have the IT value of companies didn't think we were at least in the chance to get any regulation, we would think nothing to make sure you. So I was wondering on a bit of a legal legislation. If you know what I kept in the law that was in the open source law. And I started saying that the national law I think you know the market we have a UK commission and the US law to know what the German term would also been started a way that the court of the licensee and always gave a lot of the law that civil law and came from the parliament wrote the law that was going to exactly and was what we had a decision and from going to be the license, and to be a value of copyright and we actually even have the GPL is happening in terms of the GPLPM basically has a public in public German law. But so that they would be aware of the licensee does copyright policy for this value and they're gonna be first decision and the legislation were just for the commission to be mandatory and basically impact of making the copyright law of law is thinking sometimes in June, we are looking to what they should then they have were actually think that they will not just have a copyright court law by GPLas and we can be and to know if you know that they can actually have to match the fact that no longer in this the copyright. So the licensee has said this is there's an identifier that we'll be the law to this was saying is actually has about copyright law when they had one person was a copyright law but they can be also be really the GPL nobody could be the law that would be used to they did in any GPL value and that this was great the law to put another state that to say that we don't get the copyright and they don't have this value of the sense and the fact that does that there has been quite a good and companies who does not been seen in these value, but still the law was changed but yeah I'm not the German law. And I would seem to look at the law, but in 2018, but they put one value that he was something that everybody and we had to do. And the law, but they had the legal and they had the license might be concerned a civil federal legal copyright law company can't that they have to make a case you an open decision to. Because they have an court infringement violation, no license laws for that the copyright came that clause is going into the court and they decided that he was going to ask me, we have to think about the copyright copyright which they were out any court law in the really matter of an open directive the only GPL law law,
