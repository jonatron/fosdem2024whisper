 Okay. So, yeah, then started to do a room on it. So, but if you start and get an example, I'm sorry. I'm going to see it. And if you're going to show you why we want to do it and enable the user IDP, and then we want to create this LLM to generate a user which is an example of an easy point, we're going to show you, which is this library. I found a little bit of an OCP, which is the application. Why can you and say we have this, to create this extension that will be executed. You can do that kind of what I said, this is kind of this is the start with this thing to do here, the OAuth to do? It's basically like I'm going to work. I have. I'm going to talk about it. But I should be able to talk an X17. And I'll start to put the web client. But, I'll explain a real time to what you. Yesterday I'll show the side. I'm going to do? And the first, I'm going to talk about this talk was I'm going to do. And that I'm just wondering what we have to... So we have to get open source to the current. We have a lot of our next day, this Fion. I'm going to use PythonD, which is that's going to make it. Yep, we need to stay in the two years ago. We have a full-spice code in the front to do. I'm going to happen in the moment using Q&M to explain the whole time ago, we should be using this problem. We need to start. We have our journey to see, we have that we have and we'll be able to look at the community world. We have been doing for the company. And I will try to work at the next time to talk about the project, I'm going to write a lot of the company. And we have someone who are going to be going to follow a long time. It's going to be working on. And I'm going to talk to talk about a little bit about how we've been. We need to be talking about what we've been used a company for instance, I think in the room for the talk today, we have a little bit about the last decade here, but we're going to talk about all about that we will be starting to your project in the community, but we're going to share in that lives in the Mozilla software that we have been doing a lot of funding, and we're going to start, what we have we want to open source software, the last year. And this great projects can talk. Of course, I'm a lot of the open source technology, we are the first place to be a lot of the moment since a few open source projects. We've been since we'll talk about the world. And that we open source organizations that I'm going to quickly talk about what we're going to talk about open source projects are talking about we're doing with what we're going to get a little more in a bad revenue in that the community. We have been doing. We've spent a community, we've had kind of the world on our open source community. And we had to know what they're a national organizations in the community that we have been talking about the world that we can we struggle to be doing what I'd like kind of these customers of the people into their lives of open source world. The European Commission, you know, we'll just introduce the things as well because of the German software that you know something that you're going on the moment. So you can get started doing a few people still have been talking about the Open Science who's why I'm going to have to be the foundation. And I'm saying, we're going to be here to work on the years ago. So I did you know the first question was a pivotal point of the number of funding of years ago was talking about the opportunity to the community and the latest economy already involved, which so on the community. How can be a research and what is the main aspect of the software that I think about what we are I looked at that are at the world, what I'm going to do I think about it's going to have to have here? And yes, it has been from the only two years, so, we have to share software engineer at a long thing that project working on a lot of the moment. So the software that I know that the last problem was I think it was a lot of the commission actually the very quickly was actually. The community in 2016, we had a bit more of how this, the parliament in general years. So that the first I had you know, we were a way of a lot of a few years ago so on the best. I was a lawyer and it was very quickly at the community and I had to get seen 20 years. We were their work on the whole projects to see the work on the world. But for people right? That was not the time to be not always not just why we have changed. So the room to get the speakers of the people who were building that I was wondering, I was made in the European Commission was a quarter was always a bit 20 years ago. And I had before you know that did some of the Commission. You know the CRA and we talked about the Commission and the Parliament, three years ago because I'm just take care about this and we had been going in 2005. So that they were our way of the moment and then he had a much time and had to be very much more about our Commission at least that they were the first one year ago. It was a huge, first stage of our world and now, and the community about the community and it wasn't been still going to know the government would be the product. So we had to be a lot of that's going to be important person want to look at least, but we could be like this point, right? But I think it's the digital impact of course after that we have to focus at least for example, a little on the whole situation, some about the city of the US, we think we could be the world of that I'm not talking about the cost since I'm here, because we have had to be in the year, but honestly, but there was saying 2023, you know, FK had to say it was copyright in the definition of computer makers, what somebody who may end. It was something that. So the last year now in the way a very first of the railway and they had this was one and they did not first step of the moment and there was, partially paid for most of the beginning of the community that it was still there was part of the second year. So no, that it was a long time. It was not, which had to these sort of the work, the world, the German rights, and all the European Commission who was very proud to read and they were talking about the money, for the foundation by the digital society, and so the part of Brazil that they were then they were also be important way to think it. They were the way kind of what, but the very far at the best that was a little idea. Interestingly, the last year. We had to be there were in these days. So there was to make the software of people, you need to turn some of the first thing that the PLD decided to work on. The second. So I said, I'm not sure that the possibility to go for the whole year. The system was the software and that he was a bit of the CRA was still had only discussion that was an open source company had to be adapted by any group were the people were supporting both but it. And so I was that was about in the people who were really realized too, the moment in the way to know what I was making it was. It was the company was that were working at the people have been the best to keep the public sector, but I can do that was in the very well in a whole open source and I was just in 2018 it was we also a lawyer really, but it's still on the last year. And then I would be asked for the government and they were about the end users are really have the moment, but it was the product was like the world and the company. It was called New started around the railway engineer and then he was now. And he was just, and just a lot of the good, but he been last year to open source projects, and she was very happy to talk was doing that was made a PR that he entered a political law that she was a long time since I was just wrote back to actually was good idea of Ireland that it into the German since's coming in the commission at the last year, but I had a year. He was an American law. I had a challenge would like the product and he need a standard part of the commission to be really is there. We were a long that you didn't like to have five months. I've actually heard about the project that was a lot of the standard was actually had a new IT project like the past. And while they were a half of EU Association back almost one. Is they were a tech that was still heard I think it was very important to the GPL was a huge use had the court in the space of the CRA that the EU was a small key to be that you've got to know by the council were able to get had some back and there but we were more people who gotten to make in the world. So there was a big release of my volunteer had a workshop. So even, we had said, we wanted to get the beginning of the regulation as the commission at least for the EU of the reason what they had a lot of the European law was really have had to have heard of this was the parliament to be done a US people in the European Commission and they had had a license. That was back and they worked at least on the government field and they did was just had a moment and they were moving in the market revenue in this and I were very last year and they had had to be had this 2023. But there were a lot of the European Commission was a really good one was very recent European Commission. I was an open source law. So yeah, one is also was that was wondering exactly. So there was one by this was first year. And then I did I had to just to share a question. It was about the EU court of the market to start and so he worked on the EU decision and then I thought the past has been doing regulation. It was in Europe now. It was wondering if the Netherlands, the EU association that was really interesting point I had were wondering whether they were doing a big European Commission in 2019 and the GPL law and he was the commission in German law? So we had the license and as it was to the only for 2022 the European Commission and she worked off the commission that the law that had like the German law law. And it was that I was a law. And we were given the open source world. And then was giving the US, I had seen that we was the end party is like all, the parliament were like the digital law. So the copyright rights law and 2020 was, a directive and the tech was only said, these uh open market and they were the rights but we were even improved into the liability that people were more potential value and the source software came up in parliament were open source policy as well, but I was just know they had a value of the copyright policy and the organizations were no I have said by the GPL license in rights so they did you know, and they was the EU product said that was kind of the citizen and just made in a copyright law and the PLART the one of the law. Now it was a very well the GPL that the law. Lastly, has been made us said, but in theory. So I started a clear regulation to the copyright infringement being the EU. Okay, this is just was only person that's the commission and I had a law who was also a of the copyright perspective of work there is the beginning person to have, in the law as a German law to parliament, the EU law that they were the first law that has been paid for the law. And he was to that software law and he had very bad copyright law, but he was going to be fully really amazing in copyright in the EUs, no person who was not just even aware of it was also an open source world was kind of being, but the whole law said there wasn't actually a good license law of license. So there was that was the GPL directive. And so right is still two legislation that they made a policy that means that they've come over to the law and a point that we're actually get it was the court and being this only felt an copyright law was even if they be the copyright felt gap around a GPL law that it was just has been trying to to be worth the license and these law, no no violation. Second license for court of the directive that they could be aware that the source German law. So there would be like to even from the law to make an OPM law Association was the government was there is not intended to value in EU was that problem of the law to think from a copyright last story that they don't really want to talk that they had uh. I said. And that would like they're like to do that they're most decision to answer was saying that they're trying to be the law and they know it was almost only the license law to have been taken into the commission. And I've got to be a GPL are quite about the GPL and government freedom will be in the injunction in this IT value of copyright law of the money and that you know that you can politicians that you'd like a copyright because it's a copyright was really need to get and they are usually have to think the sector and they don't have it's actually there that they're not that, but you're not just no to read so the two reasons they are quite important on the law law and they never and the licensing value in you know that you know that the commission's really do not only idea that there was that the court could, but I said that they could be more cost good that they take the moment in the court was in the IT, they are not for this point they were involved for that they can do value in the current law and they said, so the key
