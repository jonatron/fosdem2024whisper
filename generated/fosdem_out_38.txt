 I'm sure, one thing called this. And this is something called a very important thing, the rest of the entire talk of all the things that we're using the back into the best thing. So we've said, I think about how we've been doing the various types of tools. And of the examples. I'm going to show you a little bit about the things like to wait for the first one. So the first thing is that we've done here is a version of the number of bytes. So it's. And most programming at the one, we're going to look at the code that there's got a look like in terms of the compiler that we've got a first like a number of lines and then to be the load and a size of code here and when we used it, you need to catch, we're going to be in there. It's just a lot of other, but we can't also do this. And since we're going to give you an hour to be able to make this better, but in the code that we don't ask that they're thinking about this, which we've got any of doing. But then I make sure that the structure of a cool thing to create the function that's a function is being in order to the whole function in this is this code, but the way we're going to do we've got it to be able to point. So I wanted to do this is in the first one thing is to come from the space that. All right way to open source code that code that's going to be a set of it means that they actually the source code that the code got ever made and I'm doing to generate another code base. So I ended in the C and I wanted to sort of the question I've worked as you heard that if you know that you can do have to do you need to run. I'm going to get that the state of a good news of now. I'm going to be a bit of a great talk for questions. I'm going to be here after there. Some of this is a question. And I'll be the answer. And I've got some time to me. So I'm sorry, I'm going to do I'm going to do a pre-bomb in the reason to do not want to be able to do a long term that I'm going to run on a slide in the question, but this, maybe the one last year. I'm going to go back into the CERN's going to the time. So I'm going to talk about. So, more important question I'm on. So I'm going to start using the first step to build I'm showing me at the best, and I'm and I'm going to skip to talk about my talk about my questions and I'm going to talk about this year, how do this kind of this work? So, he's going to talk about how I think we wanted to be some people in here. And other questions? And I'm going to talk to teach you guys. I'm going to talk to talk about the talk about, like two kind of the last time. And I was completely technical question, you know that. What I can we have kind of thing I have some people, like, what I'm not going to work in the folks for being, but I'm going to talk about the thing I'm not going to be happy to be to see it. So I'm just wondering about for me because there. I'm going to work on the people saying when they are working on the people are. I'm going to show you're going to come to talk I'm going to be done in there, and we're going to talk on some questions, we're actually talked about changing to talk about the music. We're going to give you guys here because we're going to talk about the right? We also a really briefly got to talk about what I'm going to talk about the main people who I'm going to be working on the world, which has been all of the last year, I am I'm going to be very far in the left side in the audience. We don't have to do. They are at the next years. And I think it. I'm going to speak to have to see the first year? Well, I should write this is a lot of the time. And I'm taking into this stuff. So, but I'm going to click on the end screen on the slides in the slides. And I'm going to hand, that, maybe I'm going to talk about this slide. I'm going to see. I'm going to talk about this was talking about this talk. I am I'm just wondering, how much. So, talking about the more about the future. So I said, it's great. So it's the great. If someone who are the presentation. And each other thing I'm wondering. And he will tell you to you who is, I'm going to give a bit of a few minutes. He's going to the answer to talk about a very much a little bit of a little bit. I am I've just going to be talking about how chatine and as well. I'm just wondering, but I'm going to talk a quick introduction to build a question. And I'm not going to now. I'm going to show you to start with this talk about me, but I'm speaking about in this year. And I was a little bit about the main one of the CERN, and I'm the right now it in the audience. And that was the team has been working on the problems because it was that's going to work I think we're going to talk. And I've seen a great talk was wondering, we've been going to share with the project and I was presenting the context. I don't have an important thing that I'm wondering this really excited to speak to me about the first step. And this. Because I was the whole first because, I was this year, the talk, I was a lot of the first part of the end, and we found this work in the code? But at the fact that we've got like a lot of the first time that when the past we have had to the right now kind of people was the first step that were in the presentation was, but we had, the code to do that we have to send the whole. And these, we've been using the end of the first year, and then we had the most of the main ones that we had to do. And so many people been working had all the problem in the time, I started with different people who got to do a bit to start off of a bit of working. I was there was just saying, but there was like CNS app came in the world. They were a few years because that the end of their own working was about this year. So this is, the most long I see here. It was also a few people did some people, we have been doing that we'll see before the work at the way of the right here. And I was a lot of like the last year and of the first topic in the story. And actually happens. And then we had before this year left year, we saw that. So, is actually, what happened on 3, this was actually in the new release and the year, the years ago, of us are the release in 2002, so it was the release was still on and they were to identify the released for everything was just to the release. And in this and they didn't continue to work and we were working on it took us. We were working on. After that it was working. And we had, we saw before we didn't know, the last year. And they started working on that, I was, we found the year. So before. You said, we had an two years, two years, that they were taking you had a year, but after we got 50% of the year, so on what was, the year, we had to speak about, because I have the year later, and he had five years ago. I also took these days of these days. And I had to went through, we're watching the beginning. I did not going to do something about a little bit of the latest, everything that he was working in that in the years ago. And that was, you wouldn't know. But that the time was doing was done since since they worked quite like that was a big been doing the past and they were the Eclipse was also used to show people in the world. This was a few years ago and before you can see there had to show them and it was quite good, but there's fantastic in the chance to just after were to you gave me more power and he was thinking was trying to work, but he was thinking about this was a lot of the years and they were the year. So first step's a program and he had to introduce a bit of people. And I have a very quickly did, the years, let's going to be going to work at some people. I'm going to be going to say that was going to talk about the screen, who didn't see a lot of the years ago, and the music, that the women who had to get the years here, and he was over the music and he's going to the robot at the person and then he was also asked it now I were not very often before. And that it to be a very happy to think the computer. Thanks for the next, I've been also had to be informed for a little little bit up, but it in our stand in Europe became a few years, and I've worked on the world if I've looked at the University and now in a company had to some years ago. And I got to show you've seen a little bit more people in the French board of the C4 team, to do it to get the first time to us, we do in the whole idea for that people in the data, but I've got the past. And last part of the two years,000 years ago, and the first year we had a few years ago, they're going to see the founder of the first year, but in the world. And this was the talk was, those, I made by here at the OAPI to do it was I was thinking, but it was now we had some more than an open source project, but it was my slides here. And I was a good afternoon, do I was that I had been thinking about the talk about it was thinking. And of me? And if you know, I think it was wondering, because I was then I was just wondering I had a long time to start me. And I had, I'm going to tell me to give you about my colleague that, and all of the open source software of months, what they would do is, but I'm not just wondering, I just wondering if they give in the day and you know, I love to come up because he has a little bit of the reason. And I'm at the first one that a little blog, I spent the discussion, but since he's just saw, because I have had, because he's like, looking very well, they are my opinion, but he's done quite a lot of thinking about the first thing about them were thinking about playing more humans in 2020, and I think that. I think I was asking to start about for the last year ago, I'm going to move the title and he had this one, and he's wondering, I think he was wondering, but I'm wondering, I hope the only one of the current industry and so everybody's a good, okay, maybe I'm sorry, and I thought the time I'm I'm doing the stuff I was wondering, that I also a bit more than, the ones, because I'm just writing that I was just wondering. And as well, I was like they found a very important, right, I mentioned, because I think it was wondering, it's very, but you know, I know, there was like, I was no, but that a case, um, and the problem, I'm not working on the last is it was probably going to it. So I couldn't know, nothing that's in the experience. But there was that was a company actually that I wanted to work on the thing. And I had to be thought, but I had to work at least to do that with me. It was the question. In the history, I was that was in the first step back from the case that was not meant that before I wasn't quite important to know, but I'm going to be. I think people, you know, like on the last year. And I talked about the last one, I think they is, the first presentation were at a couple of the year. I was still doing. And I was pretty happy to the problem to talk is the first thing about the first one of the first hour, we had to start using I think about the community, the talk was going to the back to go ahead of the question. And we did this, less question was that we had not sure that was, but I was you know why we were now? And I know, yeah, there were wondering, but I was a bit of the first. And I was probably started to do I was like, which was wondering, just wondering and, right now, maybe this was actually I decided to do a way to get something what was like I was there can you know what we're looking at when I was doing was having to get to see here. I was this is going to see in the talk. And so there was, last because, y had this was a question was an hour, I suspect I said, there were that was me, but he was an open source code, about me, you see my opinion, in the world. So you know, the last year. We ran over there's 20 years was five years ago that I was not like, the year ago, but I said, which was really wanted to know, but he didn't know, they didn't know, that point to build a look at least, which had then it was based on the reasons. Okay. And I've been a given his open source days about the point was a new people were the community, it was not for making the last year, I got to do the community and they knew anything around. So we're very the community. We're all
