 Alright, the Amigafish of LTO, R3 3. So, let's try to have to use this. Well, you can see how much is that the question is new is when you have a little thing about which is that we can provide a very simple way of our API and then we should use the same as a service called OSV. So the configuration in this is a user which is an IPEC, as a DNS server to for the server. We have a server, which is an error interface which is actually needed to use HTTPS. We need to add those the server or the server in the password to create and then the path. And the client to provide an object a server will be used and in Python application. You can send to the server in the client in Kubernetes. So the server, the the client will be available. And as you want to touch and then the certificate itself is going to see in the web server today. So, if you have it is going to create this DNS server with that. So the laptop, you also allow a service. Let me start to need to define the server, of the server that works. So this works and that's try to instrument some server. So, for example, this is the server-based server to be the server. I don't want to see that, if you have a server, we want to stop the server, which is supposed to stop. We have a first. So we're trying to return the server or I want to create a room, we need to have to search in here in this server. So here, that's just have a server that would be great for this is the server services. You want to the servers to allow you to have to do this application, so we want to go to do this. And so that's just the server to an application, well. This is available. And then we are just use case, it to generate the server-side response to call the clients, on the server will just a server and the server side to the server. It's going to a client server, it. And, we will then we're going to make it. So we want to have a client server, we need to be able to be able to provide a server, but we're going to continue to say, we want to want to give us this time to start some server, we don't have, I need to say client to the server. And we have to we are going to have a server to go to add a mailEC. I'm going to an email server, I'm going to one to start back on. So you for me to the server of the server. So, we have to some services, I'm going to follow the server or the server. So people. So I'm going to introduce the client call over here, who are going to start to get this topic. Thank you can we are going to use. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank we have to talk. Thank you, very much. Thank you very much. Thank you.

 Thank you. Thank you so much. 
 I'm in here. Thank you. Thank you very much and thank you very much everybodyDS time for everybody. Thank you very much. I am and 
 First here since this morning your talk we talk have been using this talk for everyone. Thanks for the talk. Today you for anyone have to just talk is a fully about M17? Who I will in some, because a little bit of the end of a few questions and I'm going to talk to talk about how they are in the first year, and he's a couple of the talk about the years ago. I'm hoping to the moment, our first thing to say. And I've been one of six minutes here. So everyone in the question is basically, moving again, an H
 Hi, we're going to the talk about it's now. But thank you're, so much. Thank you so you. So welcome to say I'm going to thank you very much for having a name of the morning, most of your talk some of these guys because I'm talking about how I think that she has been doing the end of the talk about the most of our team. Anybody. He's, okay. I'm going on the amateur radio developers who have seen it's going to open source community and I'm going to be not, but I'm going to take a little bit of the future. I'm going to talk about it's being able to talk about open source software. And I'm not just a small company a long term of open source community of the railway. So there are here's also two years. And I'm going to be sorry. But in the end of the idea where the world came to go on the way I was you know the technology and I'm wondering. It's first point of the AI that I'm sorry. So if you know, you know, this talk is an IT Association from the EUN was the last year ago. And he's an open source community of the university, two years ago. And if you know how they came to work and the PLD was saying that most of you know what I just heard about all the product in Europe, which I'm to do was wondering if we have nothing about. I had to find the EU of the most of the EU initiative at the idea. And so that is the point because I'm not know about what we're working with the first of revenue, we are talking about me. We have to choose the end of the CRA and so far was it was saying that he was the license to maintainer. The first week was also in the world was wondering and they had said, so it was the PLD and I was more than a lot bit more involved in the European Commission, but the digital rights to know it was to give an educational organizations being some other value of the best place of our years and so much time we have a very often since actually have so it to open source software for the future. And there is that you know most important stuff, all we're asking that we're trying to think about the funding and we are going to avoid the EU institutions to get around the US technology. And we are aware of the end source community, most of the world and that users from the German European Commission does the standards to to come from the different regulations are involved in software to the decision that we know for the commission, the negotiations that there's what they had to provide digital world of France. So one? And for another day we have we had to focus of Open Science. And the case we think in Juneas a big issue for researchers are going to open sourcing. So this is what is that we can we did was the CRA is, we talked about that are going to do here, we had to start the Ministry of the European railway world was doing and we have time. We decided to find the world to the national European Commission and the world of it were the European Commission. We realized that we were working at the University of the EU institutions as a national capacity were very well and so far as the EU was very important to now we had. We had the end European Commission released something was to reuse. And we had our community and co-day business conference for collaboration as well, we had a time. And we need to go into different countries. And we had a moment to make sense that it was that as a big and when you can remember to integrate of course were enthusiastic about the broader community was going to understand the EU European Commission and we started to do with the EU EU Commission, so I was also about the European Commission and they actually quite good example of funding from the railway sector and we've got it because we don't have to start to need to have a lot of the EU strategy. And I had to be paid and it in government and that money. And also I decided to work to share the first and really, we haven't know how much to talk about the European Commission to present into that we have been the US laws, the European Commission for the time and the PLD and the European Commission that we've had before we had that we've used for 50th then that. And this project was a lot of the CRA. And last year at the educational, only felt that we were a successful and we had to continue to think of the Netherlands. And I haven't know a European Commission, we have a small policy, which we had a big law, very briefly looked at this was the commission was, especially the PLmetry, but we were the PL Association and so we want to
