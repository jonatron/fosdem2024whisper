 Hello everyone. Welcome us to live open-end Room. I'll come back in the microphone and so I'm going to my talk in the first I'm going to, everybody. I'm mainly present a very much everyone. I'm going to Alexei Leockas Kth. I'm working last speaker, there are going to talk to briefly to our talk about the Raspberry Pi 5DS. So I think about the next year. I'm Gabriel. So I'm going to 20 years. Today I'm there is going to show it's an example of the talk about our community, and what we are going to start the last year and the years to be released in the largest tech and I'm going to see that's going to continue to be you about 2023. And I'm done in Europe and I was thinking about the Ministry of my first and a CNCs, my presentation. I'm about a lot of the PLD and I am we have a little bit of the most people were focusing on the CripB in the last year. year. There are a lot of the early for my presentation. And I am 2023 in the last year. And I can open source community conference, there is the beginning. It's a science, a year of our organization and I'm the last year ago, a couple of the open four years ago. I'm going to talk to talk about open source community. And it was a lot of Amsterdam. So we had to see some of legislation that the community will talk about and the industry was not been about the EU government sector and we have seen, I'm aware of the end of these companies in digital world million projects that are building standards. So let's going to provide funding in last year, but we are not really the first step, if you know, I think the world, they are the project and they get started to the European Commission. And if we have something three years at the world, but we had 2023 and the year. And we also have been doing many years ago, but we are making a year to give you know, you a point, but we came up to the year. And so you a few months ago, they are all the University of these days in the end of the first year, for the EU for the PLD2 to measure the European Commission was able to 15 years ago, and since that was actually it was open source the technical field was from the Drupal, which had to promote at the moment. And so early years ago, so today was not able to be thought you to do the first year. So what we need to have been doing, there's that were a lot of the whole mission as a lot of money, we have had to maximize open source project for those, which was so they had today, and we had to try to make sure that open standards and think. All right? So I was on the CEO of the end of the future, but I've been doing the next year in the UK, but it worked on the most of the CRA. So still, the European Commission so that we're going to have to be a European IT world. We're going to be the European Commission, since they say this year and they have been able to be a long and they're just do not a lot of the United States, like that the technology. And just the majority of legislation as the majority of the world of our act of the next value of us to be the tragedy of the world of the first weekend was a very important to actually to take into the world. And we're our impact of our European and the European Commission in Europe society at have been a long time came to be taken by the commission. But I was the European Commission had our public panel. And we had we had six-workers had a company. And this and decided to open source, I think that I'm going on the first one year ago that's a two years. There's the world of the last year. And this year we saw about the EU law and they had to know that we have been just as a lot of Drupal 3 Association of experts and I noticed to think it was also just a very exciting talk out there. Now we ended also have a lot of an incredibly active member of open source law and the market, what they had to try to say on us in the CRA and we had to be able to develop their roots of commission and they were going to give it. So they're going to give us a little bit of a five years ago as a half of educational problem of a big practices so far as far as well, well as I'm the number. So there were asked that we have been working group was very important to get at the foundation which happened to go in the world for the world. We had a community and who are the way we skipped to get started to this value. So I wanted to finish. And I don't know what I'm going to have this is still in a lot of it was using like a bit more people can do. So I'm going to do they didn't know, we have seen our last year. So that's the first steps because, like, so I'm very important to be familiar with the last year for the first one. You guys. And you know, people who have the beginning of the focus on the first step was just to be looking for the first step to keep the work, like that in all the last year ago, so forth and they're an issue up to think it, like an example of the beginning. But I was probably the guy. But also thought it's the first thing was the community was is like I've got the people who was maybe last year. And so at the knowledge of the first year, we didn't know that the moment in the moment. So, is a lot of just from the best solution. And I can imagine I went out and he also the list, and
