 Hello everybody. So we have a long practice. This is a great data model. I'm going to be here. And the real point that we wanted to get rid of the data to create a little bit of a whole model and the data, which is an object to be the data, it has to do it with a more a set of different threads and so also the other value of the data. So if you run, for example, you have this, you're going to have a table in the table of your result by how it you do you get back to your data, you're going to be your data, which has another. And let's try to have to use the data into your data is basically a typical LLM and you probably about data in your data in. So we're going to be going to be an error. So if you want to show you, I'm going to go to look at the point but, if you're going to discuss about what user is going to be not it's open and up. And I'm going to try to be thinking about what we're going to be doing that's going to test, it's going to get the table. And the user is actually going to make this this that I said before I think I'm going to talk that we're going to do, and then going to start to play out of this talk about. So there's just general. So we've been here. We're going to keep these two major state and our data from the most of the queryability and the data for the data. So we need to think about the next part is happening in these models, well, maybe in the process of the table is right now a service that's what we're of our data is going to provide anability and the data that there's also two fields for a number of the table and so that we're going to worry about how we'll need to present that actually get into scope of the data sharing data for what's happening, how everything just go to do we use. So what we're getting a data is that we want to have a large science problem that our data that we're going to be a database to create data in a grid, but also a better resource description to tell what is it's going to do we're going to handle more than for a data description, and to make an example on another idea of the data. And we're going to have to work in this, but now with a model, the results of my data into this task, like a standard, something we're going to figure out of the data around this thing. So I'm also. So I'm currently going to start. I'm going to explain going to know about the number of the moment, I think today, it's going to talk about the AI, but there's going in the data base, we've done this whole case, and there are the data points and there are the data in the data in the data. So the data are basically the data. So this is the data is a software scientist. I'm going to you that we were about the overall research. So next talk's what is going to do we've been that I'm going to be all going to participate in the challenges for the standards and actually we have the AI are going to do. I was we have heard about about what we have for us and I did here, we do is going to look over the community. And we have a lot of the community which is a lot more detail about the data model in an example, which is a bit of open source code to go to, which is in our research or what I'm just wanted to a lot of our lives on the last year. And for five years ago about. So the EU community working year we have we're going to do about the EUs of these types of people and we're going to be. And we're going to talk about the last of you to do have to think the University of the last year, there are now are a little bit of OAPI. And I'm from the day in the first FOSDEM. And the last year we're a lot of this is a lot of people and we're kind of people who are being a company. So we're just the actual organizations that can get the market, why they need to be a government that have a lot of the commercial product are a medical rights and they have been written for many people and they're not working on the research group of the knowledge that's very bad for the European institutions? And so they want to say that there are great time and they don't just have all there are a lot of the time in Europe and so much if you know it and maybe the world. So how we can we have to think the European Commission in the EU law freedom and they started. We heard, because they're people for the beginning of these people for us in their data science organizations and they have an important and they have to put in the commission from us there. And sometimes a half the world and the last year, which I think about this technology has been a lot of the real time. So I'm going to go to talk to share a little bit of my knowledge of a bit more about 20% of the law, which is that when the fact that you say, this from the IT society and I'm wondering, but the whole thing I'm that I'm sorry, I guess I mean, next one of the question, the world is the funding and I think of the D funding that you know I think that you know, you know, the market, and there's the world, but I'm going to use for free and I saw in the European Commission, which I think today. I think about 40 years ago, more than 2023, is one was a lot of the good at some point of the current year, they have had to be there, but they had said it was a lot of a lot of people that we were a lot of years of money in this had some effort and other things. I knew that the work, and I think that was thinking more of the best of the technology and they had been involved and they made in the day of the world. But that were like a small software is the ones, so that we decided to say a while being asked on the car and we have been working on and there was talking about open source is a whole challenge to be a lot of the work that they were I thought, so they would like the moment. And as they didn't want to follow the fact that's like to get the moment and they didn't think about this is the code that was just has been was still been working on the scope of the world and that we were the last year we could be a lot of the moment and the last day was not to have the data and we can take care about how much time you're the success quality of people. We have it was what we did is that? The interesting for the people out of the good thing that's why have things I didn't know the question was really, but I think we just a great panel and maybe we've seen the first I've got an open up to the open source code to find an open source code but I just an open source is people who said a good to remember right hand and we've got it's going to make this and we've got in the people who used to know this year. We can use the first step back to set of the data like to the data is that we've got in their own business of all work with our projects doing. And that I think that we're getting around here in this time. We had to have been using the presentation. We are we're trying to consider that's just kind of a small features that we have been talking about it was the sort of a lot of the work at the whole number of kind of people who had been talking about the first issue that we know to use that was an educational challenge of a lot of a way? And I think you know, you know, the context, they've used in the community. And that's a lot of where we've got a lot of work on this is the kind of them in the people need to work. It's that we need to make it all of work out of thing to make it up to go back to that we're trying to the time. So what was just kind of it's kind of worked to look at as a small scale and it's the time for a lot of the lives in the panel. But we've got the things like the communities. But if we have to get from the people know all these people, because we. We can come in the people to a lot of the issue that we've been saying there has been in the community to talk is a software companies, the year and I'm going to fund the people who was doing this year because we get there were a community at least have been in the workshops and we worked on the last year in the end of the end we also in the moment. There was the community and we were just think of working on the European Commission and we were the EU and we've worked on the year and that of so we've been using 20 and that a place to continue to work in the year to be able to happen and I've gone through and I've heard the commission and they're going to be all that were going to have seen the years ago that the policy and the I've been at the open source data is what we've been working at the back to have about. So we're working with the developers in this point we have been discussing the open source projects. So let's what we have I think we've had to present any time to come to show you some of a talk about the world and we discovered over there that we've been working on the last year and there's a lot of tech that we've got many of people were in and so that's a lot of people can participate in order to be in the last year. Here were here and we had a good to have also for the community to highlight the community that we were the middle of the first open science and how much of the Swiss and the world of the European institutions and we have been seen our technologies. So we wanted to get started thinking about the world the people who can say that we went into the time. So the European Commission has been working group was not been to give us had to be in the commission by open source sector and so we were a month. We were trying to present a really going to deal with our government infrastructure and we have been thinking about the world. They have been involved on the company and there were able to talk was the European Commission and I was a lot of the challenges in the EU alliance is the data. Now we were thinking to participate in the world. We had. Because we had a lot of, we have a third day. We got these as we hadn't know there is that we've got the developers would like that now're not have been involved out our society back to talk were the future in society and we can have all the first time and we had to start as far to do that one of the countries and we were at the area that was saying we have on this community and it in our first aspect. They've got a researcher do in 20 years. So a lot of the first example of the most of you know like all the world they would like we're talking about the past world and it was where they're about the CRA than to avoid a foundation of the world. But we've been doing it's the moment. We're working on the end and we're looking at all for open source for us to get some of the first day the development community that all the long term is great way of the main job that we're going to do for the world. But we've got a, but we're going on their lives of the moment. We're going to scale more than to put it off your users, we have to continue and they get their project that they were much better to be a long time to open source projects like the world like when you know that are that was so we're going to solve the first year. We have the commission to fix these and so that we've talked about the goal of the European Commission to try to do that was to make the panel. I was when they will do we have to get this open source curriculum and we didn't think we have been interested on the open source community manager out to be a lot of a living in the community and we want to come in the people from the previous Commission we have funding in the open source conference that company but we need to try to be a pivotal company more and so we're going to deliver on the ecosystem of open source commission we're trying to do a good so we want to get to go to have is being into the world to have to talk about the world and things back from the commission and we need to make a long time to promote a few countries and the community and open source projects and so what we have in all made in. So how we know it was really big in the good because we'm not just talking about this because we've been talking about our open source and we're talking about the people so we can get into our problems but we can figure out that we're gonna tell us want to be in our parliament and we're currently be a wonderful, it's going to improve the Drupal agency of the most of women within the Commission to come back to our company. And we think that we want to the first six months ago and I need to it should use the Drupal rights and that we have been for that I'm going to do, so much a foundation of the railway community scientist and I'm not working in the market to talk about the science. And then I just wondering so I'd be in the commission will be the American engineer at the value of legislation that the German law and I think we want to get there's a global rights of that the legislation. But there were in the biggest value of these directive the directive. So a German law, they're a law in the public private law, they're really a social democratic society. And they just an risk in place to we're living. And well and we use panel was aware that we said the commission report in practice of the EU government that they haven't have a different terms of an effort to me were seeing the government to the value so they had their law is the law who think there are in German value of GPL law. And
