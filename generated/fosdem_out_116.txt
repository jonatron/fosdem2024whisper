 the first thing that we get more details like I know what else talking actually because I started thinking about design and the network of that we're using it so that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. 
 I'm going to start and welcome everybody for the next great talk to starting to the next presentation. 
 Youa, JMAP, thank you very far today. I'm going to talk about two is a project here for staying at the top of the next talk on my talk about the lead to a little bit about what some quick talk about the second talk. You also been going to work in the camera. We'll present for my first half? My name is who is I've been trying to go to the slides and I'm going to be here. So here in here three year and the first slide we were. I feel new talk about Red Hat app. We have a room and I'm going to show you these two months on. And you the agenda. So I am Thomas last year we've been in the first year at the speaker is going to present a little bit about the last year in the first one of the microphone here. And I'm going to talk is a little bit more about the last year. We've been involved in France. There was I'm going to talk about this morning at the audience. I'm present a journey in January of OpenJDK in the University of this year. We've been that was a few years that are 2023. And I had. So when they had about the FOSDEM release months ago. And we had a couple of the first year before the years ago, but to introduce me the people that we did we've had been working with the first year ago. We got five years ago, the second year, not got started about 100 billion years and we had been doing in and we've been doing exactly a place. So it was a year and a little year. Oh sorry. A bit of the first year, who been there was a lot of a little bit of things we see we had to find this year at Red Hat who have a couple of the beginning of months. And we did a surprise of people from the speakers like, and getting left from another at the first year actually. And so I was then I had the time before because we wanted to actually got to sort of the years and we had over to have been an amazing because of a little bit of it was originally in the guys also the other challenges. We had some of an issue in a few months ago because we had to help us into the time. And so we have three of these things that we had to give an RFCs and we got more questions, maybe you some people who are going to start with the slide. So we are still see how to have the stickers. I'm going to do we're going to have to ask us and think about this happening in the people and just a lot of an important thing to use policy here. And I'm kind of the whole and how they been using this is that would like the world we can be the future where we're going to get a talk to be moving forward and what we are we can the project and make sense to step that they'll talk about the last year so we're going to what we need to get a bit useful to do and so we are going to say it. I think about the question I'll get out to work out. I'm going to a little bit. Ah, I want to be the first one is great. It's going to talk about it's going to talk about how you to me here, which is a little bit about the first of the maintenance. And so this is the goals of the perfect and the world is the goal to get into this in the open source community is currently the community where people in terms of the last because we had to see what we had these years around the world is that you can use in this way of the first point of the end projects were moving. And we had to share, we've got spent for the whole problem that we had before were there was probably three of us to find some legal approach to use really cool stuff that we actually got that first person that was just thought working on just been co-tuning and we used one of them in the organizations because we've done with the future. And so hopefully you have heard about the idea of the general people that I was in the European open source software. They have been doing the topic that came to dojo. It was missing that they have been working on the first piece of the open source software and they had to have people to say I mean this job to keep that you thought as well. And then they've actually got to ship the project. And they were not going to do a bit of you know one to make sense of this work to be first year. And they were if they remember what they had on it has some new community at the foundation and so many people really know was trying to go back to what he, but I was the best to bring through it. And if they have an open source project that's going to share it. And they're gonna be the room is I was basically, a, obviously going to me. I'm going to be looking very hoping that they found a really excited to know about the Open source, not everyone's just going to be happy to work. So they did I'm going to think about that when there's, there was the world of the group and they're going to try to be a couple of that open source project. I know. I'm afraid that I'm going to encourage you're going to show me before it the end, I'm going to have to tell. And the part of a little bit. Thank you, thank you, so much. Thank you. 
 So I'm going to come to ask us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

 So hello everyone. Okay, thank I'm the next lightning talk we've been going to talk for the agenda, what I showed you. I'm going to be present the S-Wiki and about our last 5G infrastructure of 3, so much. I'm speaking about what I'm going to talk about today. Please will talk about FOSDEM. So let's actually give a couple of the title about about that we've a year. We're going to start over from the project that we're going on Rust developers since we've been starting to know what I'm going to let me see that you a bit of a long story about how we're on our talk about the next day first year which is it's going to make a talk about the founder of the internet to do is in this panel. I think we're a lot of the first time, right now I'm going to talk to talk about because that we are still have a lot of the future. We'll be talking, as well, we're going to talk, we're a little bit about my first and I've been working progress and I was working on the first slide of the panel. The question. And I'm talking about the talk was a good question is I'm an next talk about the panel was the beginning of an open source project called the audience and he comes to talk about this, so. And I was I'm going to a little bit of the entire phone is, I don't know why I know that I'm going to be saying the long time, I think I'm so thank you know. So the speaker I'm going to talk. And thank you. I'm going to have a very much for the next one of the time. We guys. And I'm excited to see the time to continue in the presentation. I'm just with the room and the presentation I'm wondering. So I'm showing a little bit out and now I'm going to see, the microphone. I'm going to give you know that I'm going to talk to the speakers who actually saying. So do you know it's like I'm going to add another speaker that is going to work on. I'm going to be looking for a lot of my presentation, I'm going to be a little bit of, I'm going. So I'm going to be going to talk about this one. So I'm a bit. The first five years ago, I'm saying, how do I'm going to introduce people. I'm going to put the talk a screen. I'm going to show you a few years ago, which is with your program and I'm curious about what I'm going to say everybody. So I'm going to talk about the agenda. So I'm Karen, I'm just wondering. So I'm going to start with the beginning of the top of this talk, three years ago. We're going to go back. So my talk to start at this talk's the room. It's a lot of a little bit of music and I'm going to come to about a volunteer. I'm going to just going to have a very, to just wanted to introduce another speaker and I'm going to explain the music. I'm going to discuss about the first. I'm going to wait to be wondering. I'm going to get somebody. It's going to have to get to talk about about that. So I'll talk about folks in my name of us, who is me. I'm going to my question. So that in mind. And I'm going to be going to have a bit of the panel that far here, but we decided to show a warm welcome my mother on the room for our next I'm going to see here or something I'm going to talk about half more questions at this year. We've been going to talk about a little bit about the last year. The last year. I'm going to introduce something about a lightning talk was working on the last year. I was talking about this is a bit about this was an engineer. It was incredibly, it was this was doing a very important thing, but it was a lot of a lot of a future. I was asked the good thing to see the most of the question. So if you're the work, the world for an impact by the community that I was happening during the speakers that this. And this year, I've got the co-to member of the Commission and the first slide of people know how I didn't know what we're doing. Okay, we could be talking about it's going to be so we're trying to have any what the opportunity to invest and why not just a half the best law and they are the beginning of just to be a European Commission. And so we're looking at that we're making people to sustain the beginning of the last year, I'm asking the technology. But I think that I'm going to introduce that if the idea, you know. I think I'm not going to be the first one of how we need to change this year. And they're going to figure out of people and they don't have to give back to get the people and hopefully with in their open source community. And we're going to ask a quick, okay, we have a few people of people who just use the time to be in the product community. The current society and we got a little bit of this topic. First of just ask us and to talk was all about it was doing a little bit of our good reasons until we have in the people who have had a little bit of all of the world of the people like the talk about it was about how you that the energy or. And I have a lot of a little bit much the energy are already said to work has been in a few years. And they are already have to think this in the value when you know that you have to get the time to look a big one. I said that everyone's in the end, the technical discussion here is already mentioned before. And I'm just part of this is a little bit of a small time to work that I'm the ones, if you know what I think it's a lot of the copyright holder. It's probably one question was thinking, and say it was to. So actually coming from the whole project was the French company that had a lot of the first thing that I mentioned. The problems was that were thinking that was that we said that we're done. If you would have so on law that were doing to make forward to speak for our CRA we'll present that we're you still being able to the right now in this journey to talk was not to what we are right hand will talk is to get an open source code and we were to know a small to be able to one of the countries. So the first step is that was a lot of the people with the same as far when we want to use the time when we are working on the one of the issue to know that is potentially, when we used by default issue in the development, we tried to do that you know what we have any of our community, we are having been using government and we have heard about the commission, but we have a community science. And there were doing that's a million revenue what was that's a legal issues with people we had been talking about this, what are we were introducing the fact that we have been having a copyright, the most important thing that somebody who comes with the court. There was also a lot of people and so they don't have the US that we were the law, well from the EU people in the European Commission and the EU organizations that we want to get funding and especially as well, there are very long as far as we have said in different organizations, so there are a lot of the world that the organizations are very important to make the future law and people just being open source in this is the world and the European law and we always had to know, but a long term of the work with the CRA, if we have the world that the CRA, you think what happens in law license to think it. And let me, but you know that is that the first one of this is about the problem of what does it has actually the general proposal is the state is what we have is in the software is that we really the software that we need
