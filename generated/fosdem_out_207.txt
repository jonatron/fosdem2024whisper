 Thanks welcome for who, welcome for our name. He today we have a screenshot of a few years before we have been. Thank you very much joining us to the last year, which is about working on about the talk was completely in practice. So, I was showing a little bit of the largest month in Europe. And from the European Commission in the time at FOSSTEM. And from the 90s and a very important to do it on the EU. This is what we have in the moment to be in the railway transport society, a long term in and also the European Commission that was intended to overcome to and we had a big question. So there's a bit of Surrey and they also from this year. And why you're a few words about European Commission in France, the Parliament. And we be happy to be here, we have one of the European Commission at the beginning was one million months ago, in France, I'm just wondering, if I was wondering, your first time time the challenges per year. Can you do you speak talk about you know that the talk to. My name was to what I'm having to do the community was the power as some panel of the years after. He was doing since these two years ago. I have a pivotal day to mention was the beginning the European Commission. And then we have the first time. It was, I have many workshops to introduce us today. It has got to give you thought before a little bit less energy, so many years ago. And I was also thought, I think I'm just wondering from being able to the co-option that I'm going to be seeing the Internet of the European Commission, with us and then one, well, because I was getting years and I'm coming to make a lot of the rights because I just excited to be surprised, open source community had some people that I think we had to have had a way to get that to that they were doing a bit of a long time to influence the open source world, but the commission to try to apply this point of this project, we did research in the product and we know, in the US that I think was the organizations. So the most of the last year of the majority of the funding to talk was the community was just developed today. And I think about the panel because I have my PhD. And in there's exactly the person. And it's also European Commission has been working on the fact that big thing because in the same point of the value of the product that I'm wondering what we started the panel we're looking for the time. And that was the panel, we just wondering, but the product. And at this is there is a lot of life and it was a few years ago we were a commercial project member of projects until we have really want to go to be talking about the most people who did to this thing of our governmentists aware, but the way I thought it's hard to be an open source software engineer had their software and I was someone who were making a big funding for each year, we came from the public sector and is still mentioned, well we had heard about them in Europe and then came to find the council. I just wondering and think there were I was their law and they told people know what I would like I think this year, but in the thing I think we would like the digital rights that they were, but yeah, well maybe just like I think we have time to share and we should be there to have a long term to do that that want to be talking about the world in the open source community and I think we have other people who have to look. So we have to do this point to think the first step to have to make it's not to make it's going to be a great, not on the German law but to be. And so we've still find a more in the idea of software and most important. We've been doing some of them. We have a few people have been working on the product and you, there's one of a huge idea of the last year, like these people are really have been really many people who are helping and so how do you're thinking to do you're moving on a lot of our product and the product-one and then like we are great win and we don't need to use this much as long as a great as far as well as a culture and for the fact, then we want to do it for the open source and the first group of all of the world we have to do and we've got there was a lot of figuring out that we have a lot of years ago in our project now making the work down that we have been working on the product that we've played with the right. We have a few things like I think how a good question. And I'd like a little bit of the current person in the open source and there's currently two group? We can share and get into the room so we do we'll have a little bit of us with our first step that what are doing is that there's a number and if we're looking at the next three ways of two years ago. Okay, we do we have some accessibility that we have any questions like just know what I've been talking to do I've been doing was the good topic of the year for people who's about getting in the first time. So what I'm asking the question but I'm going to ask that I'm going to convince me. But if I'm going to be here, let me to be talking about the the question. Or going to be there's talk about what we have in our engineer and the open source software community and we have any thoughts on the open source software and I said and I'm going to be happy to focus and I can I'm wondering if you, I'm going to have a long time to say I'm going to start to speak a more about me like, but I'm probably heard of the world I'm going to start the question because we're wondering to be wondering about the first and we're thinking about the first one of the first of the interesting open source software is the future of the most about open source software is the past part of the previous talk I'm going to me on the last year. And I'm an open source world of the point of the community that the railway world is, the CRA, but at the code that they have this slide. And I'm here. I'm curious about the most important because we have a little bit about the European world. So who is the question and the product perspective. And what we take the data down the challenges. I'll talk about this one is a little bit. So here, I'm wondering. And this talk, is I'm going to the whole point of a fully open source software under the world of the source. I'm just wondering is a three years and he's what we talk is the challenge. I'm going to talk. And I'm going to start by the next year again I'm going to think this year. It is getting the first one year. And I'm just wondering, you know, the second thing I was allowed to be really a little bit of it was going to get the second way to get a little bit more into the impact on the right now and he has to be a better. I think that's going to do one, about the open source approach. But I think he's the work in the beginning of the things that. We're going to be an app? We've done that they're going to work on the whole world. They're going to be as well as a lot of like to be a couple of people who are using building source code and we're going to get into people at the project. It's going to be something like a little bit of the world. So I'm going to talk, you know if you know, you're doing you're going to know, people, you're going to do it's a bit of being done. Some of the most people who's like I know, we're going to find the business is going to make it. So let me, the whole thing that was going to be, how you know, the next and we're going into open source conference, how do you can you have about it? What I'm going to know some questions? This is why I'm going to do you guys, what I'm going to give a little bit more about not talking about that the idea. And if you to start around? And at the only two years ago and what I'm going to get over there's this? We want to work. And this is when I'm going to remember, you're going to find a full time. I'm going to find a little bit more plans to start to be a little bit about what I'm going to turn on. I'm sorry. So yeah, I'm thinking about, very controversial about me. And I'm going to say I'm going to try to explain that, what I'm going to be going to share the way to present here. So, I'm going to see an introduction to start with the start working slide. I'm going to talk about one of the first talk about the next question was looking at when, but, we were an office in the first. So I'm going to choose the world, I'm done. I'm wondering about the last one of three years ago, like. In Python program and I'm curious to show me and I'm. So, is, thank you 
 I'm going to talk about the talk about this talk about five years. Thank you, good question. And thank you. So I'm wondering, okay. My name is that I'm going to talk. So that I'm going to talk. I'm going to keep working at the microphone. Just to explain about which is the name is a little bit of the last year when I'm doing. I'm here? Okay, I'm right. I'm a few questions. So why we're going to help a little bit of a, I'm going to introduce the community making a little bit of the co-time work in the product. And I'm going to talk about the first of a lot of our project, so we're here. So, the previous talk is the people're going to talk about the community, we've created the first slide. As a lot of the first. Just a developer organization was... Okay, I was the open source activity in the other foundations and I'm going to start the first time without the product. Thank you guys for the talk. Thank you, so much. I'm going to talk about five years, right? So, but now I'm going to about our hand. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you, we see here, so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone.
