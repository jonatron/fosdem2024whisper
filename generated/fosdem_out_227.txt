 I'm happy to explain if you see. And the next is how much just put it? Five and you pick time. So this is the first one is the first step. And like this is a couple of steps in this part. So this is quite a very important. And CERN, the first thing that you guys have to see here here. And that I'm working is basically running in the next year. And how does this really get with this. And I'm very much more boring. I'm gonna be here. You saw the graph. And so I'm going to talk about the Go back end of the Python, I'm going to talk about. And you're going to show you many of Go. That's the first one that I'm going to see the Go ahead. It's going to say the top. You have the project we can find the language. Because there's going to have this Ruby and you can get back to show you a little bit, which is the Go routine. It's an interpreter with it's going to the class and a Ruby to be the code. It's a cool. And so that's great. I'm going to parse that the CERN's kind of text or it's a lot. And I talked about JavaScript and that. A little bit what I'm going to build a C++ code engineer with the most of Ruby Ruby project. But I'm going to show you're going to talk about it's going to look at a simple, which is this and it's going to be waiting for the Ruby build this one program. And we're going to come up here's sitting into this. It's going to come back in. And what the JavaScript is going to give you're built, in Ruby stack. And if you're going to you want to know. So the Python is, of concept of code base code code, with Python code to be a C code. That's two back to write code in Ruby and we've got a lot of memory. So we're going to do this, we're going to start to have just using in, and a base. Dynamic in, in this Ruby code that would have a really like you're going to do. So that we have a look at the interpreter and then we're going to kind of the Ruby library that you put. So there's different namesy. And if you can see when you can see how you're going to get something like, you're going on. So, to be a lot of a lot of things like, these. It's kind of the other documentation, this is as I'm going to go to say, but it's a lot of a lot of of like a very different types of code which is going to look of the reason for this kind of the way to see how to continue to be there. And this talk is a lot of the Python. So we have this is the exact Python code will be like, because you know, right, and if you can, and they are going to see it is a really like, well. So it's a very interesting thing about this is, so you can you can see the code that it's going to your compiler is a really available as well. So we're going to see, I can happen in Go routine is the fact. So the Python is interesting. And what I'm looking at a JavaScript code of case, as nice project that we had on that we have a whole level, we had this. So we thought we need to see that we have, we have all the web code because these Go code. And also do we were thinking of the library that we've been writing code base where we've seen JavaScript. And so we've got the base, we're going to do our code, we've got as well. And we're going to go back to the whole GCC and we didn't want to do it. We just wanted to be just put our code and we're going to see our code. We're going to create an API is going to start back to get the native code, so I'm going to make sure we're going to use of this? So, our main version of the C++ code. So we can we can add the library. But if you know, there's run this sort of, there's going to be the C code, the future stack base is where we're going to be, we want for our function that we are going to show you know the code to deal with our code base class from the code and we are the stack function and what we don't really want to remove some code so we're going to look at our C++ code into C code format for this function with Ruby to be the C code, very active when we have the CripPad and we had like code base Java code for Java functions. And that we had to do similar, we've got four code base. And we've seen this. And we have some we have a Cly. And we have our problem in the stack was the GCC and what we're going to do is like the C and we need to find the Ruby code interpreter thing we need to the moment for the work pretty big code, the C++ code to point we'll show over the C code into the Ruby code base in C code and this case, we're going to go ahead of Ruby array. And so that the C code will end is going to the size of our code. And one thing I'm going. So we're going to show you to show me a little bit more about, it's maybe we're going to go to see how it. So we're going to talk about this one. Next GCC code base, how long. So we're going to make the code is, we're going to build function a C code. It's going to do we're not use JavaScript in it's going to use a JavaScript code, but it's not going to be nice. But one of course, we're a similar to be a generic code. We're going to make a common. So, we're going to be talking about the C API API that we want to make our API and we have a developer using native code where we need to use this code. We want to look at any interpreter is, we're going to be going to come up. We will be able to be able to work with our things. We have a lot of what we want our code base functions that we want to look at C++ code. It's going to say we want to build for, it. We have to build all of C is the Ruby stack, we're going to be using C++ code out a code. So these++ code base library, we've tried to have a C code, we have an API for the C++ code, which is our code. Or a whole developer stack. It does is this code for JIT code that we're using,, we need to create the code and JIT looks like this. We have this Rust code base, and we have some C code? We need to talk about the stack. We do this Go to make errors. We're going to compute JVM, we'll have the C++ code. We don't want to merge is going to have a lot of C code and we need to be too. We're going to make the D code. We have code that we know, we're going to read it to write code and it's it's just kind of instruction. So, we really important code with C++ code up a BTLP. So the C++ code for example, we also, we want to do a C++ code libraries and we have a string, we sort of C++ code Rust code. We need to write a lot of size of things called Ruby 3, an error function, which I can be able to know, and C++ code base, I mean, and C code is called Mambo level. We're going to use C++ code which is the code that we have a number of Ruby, which is how we're doing C++ API library, why it's the code base code is important to, but if we need to look at this is not going to do this code and if we have to call this. So there's a bunch of those code is still the way. It's basically most important. Okay, in C++ code was probably the C code. I'm not going to what I've taken to do is we've got to go to jump on the code base. So, right? This is a C++ code here. I'm going to be there is my description in C++ code. So, we're just just looking at the same code base and we're just see doing this code base. So the original thing we've got a C code base will see this talk about. It's the program. You can change the C code. To do I had. You can run it, with this again, we can try to add the J Rust program. So, the state of Python compiler is the code base. And I'm going to use in this standard type, we kind of the vector code base. What we've got C++ code. And the Rust code block code program in the C code base stack, we had kind of code in Ruby Ruby to have I'm going to be able to set of this C code, which is to add a JavaScript function, which point here. You can, so they're going to write, you probably did this and you can be able to make the C code, but that you know, for example, there are probably can do kind of code, you know this code called Python compilers. So it or like the other compiler and you know that's kind of code, the code that's not often with the stack, right, we are interesting. And because it's the compiler in Ruby compiler that I know as a function will be the code. So what we have we're using the idea of it is things and we need to implement, but if we're doing is going to use a function that we have a native code, so we're going to pass it, we're going to build something that's pretty nice. We have the code base is we can't need to be available to be able to be able to do. So we want to do we have some like we work in Go type of the first function call zero to do. So we need to do this argument? And we want to do this with, we do it in a pointer and we're going to deal with our library that to be code and this error to be that we just going to update the code. So we want to match the description that we will be an error pointer. So we need to actually use it one side. But because we want to basically, we are going to need to be able to be able to implement the error to build request to make this in our process. We're going to create native code, you're going to change this the blocks that code, the code, but you're going to do is, and we can only at this whole thing because we have a function that are not going on the code. So it is the result, we've going to use case of a pointer, so we added these. So we're going to another function is the first. So we want to provide the main function which we're going to do we have to build the code pointer. So we want to store a lot more function from a different, we can be able to be using some things. So we don't have this is not want to know this stack stack for each address space because we're currently had a instruction and we're creating our pointers going to deliver an error handling, we have any class and we need to do so that. We have to add. And we are the address but we just like we can configure for our function that we have the right now have a error error file, which we need to do experiments that we provide some part of the function that. And we want to have to add the execution of an error and we haven't need to be able to return function and so this request for each iteration to doable function names of a function. So in the future, we have these hash from the instruction function we need to define a way to zero of each function. And the function to have function pointer to be not a function, but it will be in the value because the end it's generated functions as a function register function is executed in the string in memory that you have to have a class that you will not the attributes that is no deserialize a string for function that is in the value to then we would be executed in the value of a function we can be able to be able to make debug string over the symbolic value which means it overhead. And so that the function might be nice function instructions in the function is going to match case they are going to be we need to make. So if you want to set and then you'll see two. You can add the function. If you can have a string to figure that are using any pool and it will be used in the value because it'll try to do it's not have to kind of a function can be empty, it's the whole match and the number of that state line and or not a variable fields takes the rule out of the number it becomes only or less than if you have a function or the type of value and if you are used to do less and someone has value that, you might end and you could be five frame, you may not change the value to not pass it. And that I'm going to another value into the return the object that goes into this table in addition to the question, I'm going to string could be a type of the error. They're going to happen. But because you have a string in the object for that, you know it. So it's a function to be the way of value to do you have this function and you want to access functions where your table will match the first function that it's also the value in the classes that we have been using only way to a function that we've had to call that the memory so the stack value that it and the string and that we get into the object. So I'm going to call this result and that you can then you don't have a struct that you can do is going to create a table. So there's what you can have some variable that effectively the memory files. So that's a database that are effectively using memory
