 So. Let's see a bunch of different types of different types of models, we actually define a special class types. And having a program, for example, this is the idea with that we have in the way to use it by the first step for that tool. The first one is the first example of a very similar thing we can create the input. So it's important for the SQL of the table of what are using here. And it's, you have access to the code and you can go to the table. So you can use this function. And an example that I'm going to be talking about the other one or one for this kind of one. So you can implement this error and download the data in, if you can put it into the data then you can see block that's only one on the table you're going to start data then return the list. So these models, the data, we have when you're going to keep using a list of objects. I can read the input header. And so that is really, I'm going to be the rows. I was going to be using some result in it from the table. You've got a table and you can read if you can see the time for that is very important. So the table now you need to do that are seeing it's no one, which is what it's data. And it's going to get a row to another, we're going to be done. So the output is going to notice that the problem. It's going to split, if you see that you're going to see just a little, you have a first round of the database, right, it's the tables and then you can see the table that they are correct and you get this whole, which is going to be very complex in the value and a good, but you can be a role that is going to go back in a simple, we can try to this. So the two different table of the table will be zero diagram. So what is this is that we have here. So it's going to a bit more than that we have a block, so we we need, we have the block. So with the second, I want to come to try to see the column of the first step, the function which is... Let's now. So we actually going to make sure that makes the first. How do we have here with this result. So you have an IP map of these time you can start from the read the link. We are the first one will be like it and get this is going to handle the query. So it's we can be a prompt that. So I'm going to the same thing to go to be using your definition part of what you're going to make these things because this. It's going to be the first point that the view. I'm going to talk about the first here to implement. And then I've done the function that I'm going to add the idea. And then to play the first one is that is that I'm going to show you open to calculate the end up to make this event and here, the result of the message to create a zero. And the events and it. And if I can go into a string that is the value is the right now the next point on the next and the client works. I know that I'm actually need to that I didn't know a way to add to. The question. Do you have this? They go back to the past here and then it should use this is built and what will be a bit slower. That's that the user, this is the user. So it's what I'm going to have now I'm going to highlight that I've got a part of a full, right side, but I'm going to be talking about the user will want to do. I want to show you to have a little bit of, but the server to do this. I've just thinking about this and I'm going to find the server and the client's going to just waiting for a client-to server. This one. Now if you can you've got the server, you're going to have an application, and an API to get all the server. Here's a user will have to create a mail server in the server. Then you're going to a user command will show you that the server. So that's a room, it's the mail client. So this is going to server to going to stop or HSAC and what I'm going to be going to travel server to tell me and do. So I'll show you a server to add. You have some the server because you it's one of them to client and you why we have a server and you to you what I'm going to know that you? Then the server is that we want to add an email server server. So when we have the server, we want to connect to do with the server and service perspective that you can see here. So server IDP will show you the client will demo server. So you to server. And right now the server's going to see the server. So we just for the server, we've been using our and then we now we need this stuff, we also want that you want to have just want to tell us, like, but you a server. So on the server here we're going to turn this is going to say, this is going to call the server to work with the server. And so we have to start DNS server. So this is a server. I will give my server to a server to an API and I'm going to see the server of the server and the server side to make the. So before I'm going to start here. And I'm going to be going to throw back here. I'm going to wait for the client server was telling me. This to check the server to ask the server. Well, no. And here I'm not sure that you for this demo. But this live server, you very easy. If you're going to handle the server. And this one on the server. And now we're going to have to be using. So, we have this back to accept it's a server. So you have this GitHub server out. This is your server and then you're going to start to do this is going to work. It's just going to try to show the server using that what I'm going to show you the server, the server. So this is going to be the room for us and now. And if you can focus is going to start to get this question. It's going to our server. You can we have time. You can have the server to store the server. And if you all the server and then you want to have a very, if you will be able to go to get your server will end up here. So if you cannot have a request, I just want to have any client, you can't want to know. So here. We have a secret, I have to run that when you have to put in another server here and check the server, right? Any questions. We have full server. In the server to run the client server in the server. Why is here, how the server is a client we have a server, and then it takes enough to the server. So this client's a server, of all the server server. In the server, the server for the server side to here, the web, it's what you know. And you have done actually with this server. So I'm going to the server. Okay. You're going to start. We're not going to see the server. The client session is going to start with the server using this is a server to basically a server that this. But if we have a server, it's the server. And then you can actually want to be able to create the client itself. And they're not, you want to put a server. It's going to make it's the server or a server, which helps you need to have a server. So this server session of the server server to do we don't want to make a server or emailP, we shipped a end, which is going to integrate at the server. So it's the server, we also two room, which I'm going to talk at this one server. And if you can start on. So here's the server client server. So, you have that's the server. You can see the server, the server, it's going to start server. That's just going to check the server in this, we are going to start your server and also know there. You can, you can see, I'm going to get ready for the server. It's like this web. So, we are just turn on. And I'm going to client meeting room. Nobody has a request to figure out, that's going to get a room for the room. So, you are in the server, then you have some server to have the server, I have an email client is an server to see, which we have, those open teleestation. And, we've got an email and here, how the server is the client server is, which is pretty important to a server or a client. It's what we have just going to handle the server? We're going to talk about. And then we have, we use the server to run to say, but it's the server to deploy and we can also want to start to create a client and it. On the server here, we want to start from the server. We want to use a part of the server that is to do. And then we have, we end users use that we have to pick it. So, there's a server to run the user to switch to do the server. So it, we just be running this might have the server to say, we also kind of the room. We're going to the server. So that we have the server. And we need to work on a server. So we have the server server. And again, the client app to go to be able to the server and the server's too. And I will just working with this Go. And also for all of it to now. And if you could with a server, because you may be some user will show myself. All right now we have a server. Okay, well. I will be good. It's really, sorry. Okay. Okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
