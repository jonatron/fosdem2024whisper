 Hello, give me a brief introduction about the talk of the one of the power. That's another lightning talk, I'm Karen. I'm going to talk about things. I'm going to discuss about this, am Manuel, a bit in a lot of background. I'm going to be interested at the last year, the 3DS. The first of all of I'm going to talk to the last year. Today I'm going to talk about I'm just just wondering. So as we did I'm a small. Okay, I'm going to talk about all of an online and we have to talk to the first one of the OpenJDK and I'm saying, Andrews. We have over time to talk with the last first talk about the end of the European Commission, which is the history of the EU product and the one of the German German activity or the Europe. So I'm going to talk is a bit of the world, we have been using an open decision is looking at the European Commission in a lot of people. And I've seen one that were seeing that they've been at the company and as the last half it was also a community maintainer for the year in the years ago I'm going to get had to make that that is that the EU and I'm going to have in the IT to mention that we had, I haven't seen something, and I'm starting to be taken some women in the member in the open source of talking about how I know, although I came to be very first but I last question about is for a year on the community, but I think this talk was also I'm going to the last year and I'm going to mention what I'm going to be in the impact in the end of what one of power. And I'm not saying that, as I think it, I'm just wondering because you very, you know, your software really not an open source software in this code, it's super important is a lot of the railway and the code that the only thing. But now available, for free, it's the first aspect is that we need to keep a good. It's that the data that the German law. So we have seen there's very important to go ahead of all of the things that I've seen that we have been doing in fact that the difference from the future, the community in the AI that and then we get into the work on the space, there and then the years. And so we're just have, we've heard, we have we've talked about the future. And we got the main thing we do so we can, we're looking for and we're going to work on the community and we're super happy to think we're going on the next speaker here. I think we're going to do this is going to be hoping to follow off. And this room's going to be going to start with it's always for us as a good. And I don't know, I'm here. I'll be a lot of this talks about this is, we need to focus on the tools, I'm going to reach that's on the first time that we're done. We wouldn't know it's going to be going to look at the first slide. I'm going to present which is going to talk about our lightning talk. I'm just wondering about kind of the folks who's going to start getting open source community here and the community and open source community and the community, we have an open source and a lot in a lot of people who may be getting on these efforts and the agenda and people that really love the European Commission to tell you know that know they're going to be quite an open source. So I've seen the community part of the open source project that's how we've been with a company and open source group and also going to bring into looking at the technology in the day of it and we have been talking about funding to be a huge impact of the model. I've done here to people who was wondering they did a pivotal member of a time to try to have to give some of a bunch of the tech of people in a lot of people to do that has been with people have to do that, but they've been talking about the issues to be a software being a lot of these words, but also a very important thing that we've taken to use and we have been doing a lot of things to be different types of engineers and we work. And this ecosystem has been working on the definition that's open source community like something that's like we've got in mind that. We've been focusing on. We've developed in a lot of our research. So we're going to provide a lot of other people who have these people that we're getting the company that we're talking about to people who's a lot of these systems for it's moving from the other people. And I know the Open Source group of course you know what are like, right way of people are the first one that's my years ago, but the same, these things are about how we talk also saying for the things like, we probably was going to work on the last year in this collaboration. And to be so we've been doing an engineer at least the goal of tech of our new communities. In a long time we have been thought about the world for the WordPress rights at the open source community because we've worked on how they are going to have to look at the world to have a few months at the moment. Why we'll be a lot of the end of other government the tech team are of the way of the people who be a community in the developers and the whole number of society were captured the technology freedom and they think that said we're going to be all the Commission and they've been talking about the last year and they would be paid as long as you know what are now we've been very cool. And just a big tech concerns of what's the audience that is what are on the beginning of the point of product was they had a lot of a good and they're going to have got a lot of people have the last year and they can do most of work and they're going to get to say that we're going to get it. There is a lot of decision to learn in the negotiations and we're a lot of the US days in the world and they're going on the open source community and they're like and like the political thing that you're going to think they're making a little bit of culture in work that a lot of course it and a foundation as well the world of where people get into a whole right, you're maintaining and the company will be in the product they have been some money. And that they're building software but we're trying to have to do you're going to spend a million people to make the last year to know our decision on the last years of the world. And they're hiring away in the best to keep over time. And so we're going to five years of it also there's just one of the first room and I was the negotiations you're going to say like a photo of a big win and we have a five years ago are also an hour of the best and the success of the world and he's going to get out of it this conversation that we've been looking at going to be the world. He's going to do it at the European Commission. So I've got a lot of the first he was just had been thinking about an important idea of a bit about the rights and the United States and they didn't get, they had this time you know about the panel and like, I was going to think no, they didn't know, because he said that's going to be wondering if there aren't have already at a good. There's going ahead of this point. So I'm going to do we have any of what the last year and I'm going to follow the room for the community that I'm going to do is we had to stop. And I'll tell you know what they got to explain why we're going to achieve this? So I don't. I'm going to tell you heard the real time for you one of today. So the way you more am here's why I'm going to make it's a question because I'm going to show you to have a little bit of the audience. I'm doing something that? I'm going to know, the question. We think we have another open source community that the project can be speaking of open source or other money. I'm going to do it's the same conference to do. And I'm going to look at the time. The fact, I'm doing. So I'm going to talk about the community of the presentation. So they're going to be working on the people of the open source community here we have been going to see the project, as well, I'm going to talk. In the European Commission and the presentation. And I'm going to have a half the Drupal engineer. So I'm going to start getting to talk about the time for the research. So today I'm I'm going to talk going to you a little bit more or less European Commission, we're going to do the beginning of open open source for us heard about the people who were being a lot of the open source community. So I'm saying, I'm just saying I am I'm here, like a year. And I'm going to see here, let's okay, like I'm going to jump forward to do that. And I'm going to be seeing today when you said, hey, what I'm going on the question I've got a minute. I'm going to bring a little bit of the new one of time. I'm the first time over to me. So I'm going to show you know what I'm going to explain why we are the most of the questions. And I'm getting a lot of the end, yes, I'm going to do we have my talk to tell me here that. I'm going to do I'm going to thank I'm going to be talking about a much. We've got into two months before and I'm going to wait for coming on the discussion about the end. So I'm going to show this going to talk about the next time. The first talk to talk about the first. We're going to talk about what I'm going to you what I'm here. I'm going to have some people on the question. So I'm going to talk about is from we all the future and I'm, I'm surprised about the talk about in this talk. I'm going to the hallway. I'm going to come to show he's going to work on. Every time. I'm going to see up next speaker, two years. And I'm very sure I'm going to try to come in this to talk. I want to speak about the talks about this talk, that I'm a little bit about the only been going to talk about to do to have our next speaker? I'm hoping that, I'm really going to present here. I'm running. Yeah, so we've been part of the story, I'm going to just wondering about, I am at the last year again I'm going to put the time and I'm going to talk about the presentation of software engineer at the CNCFth from the end, and I'm a lot of computer. I'm going to talk about Mozilla. So I'm about this is a lot of open source projects in 2011, I'm getting free source. I'm here. So I'm going to present I'm going to do this talk about the Red Hat engineer at the first round of this talk about. I'm going to do you the future of the talk was going to the last year. It was wondering, we started just wondering about open source, I'm hoping to be thinking about the educational community. I'm going to introduce a huge talk about Python development funding and I'm going to be a lot of tech activity because I'm going to speak to give this is a lot of the rest of other people, the Ministry and how they also very early year and we did you see the year in tech in the years ago, which is that we were a software and in the moment at the software world. And I think we started along and the same last year and since we have been working on the Future and there is really focus to present to people at the back in the community was a living in the European Commission have the years. And I ended up the German commission had that we had a couple of been the EU which got a member of years in October we were trying to have this and we were doing our community and I also talking about the last couple of our goals in the main community. And he's a first time. He had the last year. And in the European Commission on a lot of the world. And it was not a couple of funding in June 20 years of years ago after the beginning and I'm only been here on the world, and that I had these are able to this year ago. And so we want to see the European Commission for new one of us. So I'm happy to be a lot of the world and I'm going to talk about the last year. So we are all the time to be great thing in the US the Commission, there is coming from the most important initiative, the open source law and we had to talk about this, which was a way to have had some moderators and I was more positive and I was wondering. That was an last year. Also, oh it, when I started to be talking about the open source topic about us, trying to the idea of the EU. I was that are the world, this. My name was kind of the law. So to do I've been trying to do this. So I think it's true is on the last year we have a community. And that I've mentioned this is actually been working on the open source world. I think there are now a way years ago, the beginning of course. And as I'm going to tell this question. I'm going to be the office of the first, as I'm going to be talking about my presentation of the European Commission had to be this, which we have been back back to any way of the end of the first of open source software and the software software that in the software and I mean, I think there are still so the tech law of a community and the beginning of the Commission, I've got in the end of the only heard from this point of the Swiss law which was only in the liability to influence in the
