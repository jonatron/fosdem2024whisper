 So I'm going to look at the previous speaker. I'm like a lot of things that you're going to be making a copy of a bit more of a very clear. Well, I'm going to be from the three years ago. We have a video developer developer engineer at the question or more than we're moving to the speaker. So in this is about the first one of the screen. So we're going to have an app but we're doing something like how to call to have the browser at the GitHub IDU to go and we go to a JMAP rooms and display we're hoping to create an Dalidibility and we're going to be able to get over to see that we'll get the room to get the front end, and then we're going to make the time in a place to us in and send our JMAP and the browser. We're going to stop to cover it. We want to send the website and we have this. Okay, thank you for we want to start working with Alex, I'm here. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Hello.

 Good morning. Thank you. My name of the morning to work. Thank you. Thank you very much for the first name is the room thank you. Thank you very much. I have a third speaker to talk about all of the name any questions. Thank you. I'm a software engineer in the first time, first name of my name of the talk. This is Open Science. Thank you about Vax, that I'll present you for the Netherlands. First of the various challenges are the European Commission, the main goal of this thing about the European Commission, but I'm Robin who is in terms of we are also have been using the EU EU institutions and the world using a lot of how we have been thinking about Europe for EUN6 million organizations to use digital rights. Some of accessibility. Because we can we have to make this, the EUN to be able to use institutions to have our goal of our legislation in front. And the PLG funding to implement that we are ready to think we do some cooperation, but we have an open standards group about an EU to have a product. And I'm not aware of all these requirements are coming to influence the first problem to the first year. So there are the tech institutions, we have to have these free software-called society. Okay. And this, I have some of what we had in production level of the challenges. And that are now, actually to see the data that actually what society and a large law of the moment. So let's the first time organizations in this way to the first I don't have time to be on the community and the panel, the market to have also to talk to be a question is what that the tech is also a lot of the question that we are? We have been already a question to think about a toolkit for this interesting thing that we have been doing and if we have been thinking about the European Commission into the German law in Europe. We are called OpenDesk, but I'm a funding that you. The, as faithfully as well, we have about open source open-source software, to invest into it. But in the goal is made by the EU association of the market. And in open source software that is, in the European Commission, the end-end the open source and the Netherlands, they start and I think he's the political, very good news for us, in Europe. The other people are more importantly, I think, over the software. And finally, you know, the world, in this was a commercial definition is the world, and you know, you know, you know, but what about one the German law, the product is actually the PLD was a road by the science decision of doing is a directive. And I have the world. We had this is really important to make the whole challenge in journalism and a software. I'd be an open national railway tech sector. And everybody to know, of course there are the EU. So this point, we also heard about the past. And I understand about the law that we will have a lot of legislation. And so well, we've seen, you think that, for the government organizations are we are really have the EU that policy centers, when we also for the legislation, because we have got our funding in the science and looking forwardability. And you might think there are also a topic. We might be open source institutions, the law for open source law, well in the freedom, and then the technology world of the laws and even the commission actually I think about the negotiations, we need to speak more and I think it because we have seen this is also some market of the court law, I can be surprised that it's a methodology that it's how the copyright sector who are in law, it, so the market could be there are a sustainable and they think I think this society is some impact in a software to be a member of the sense of the EU Commission, and to this is the sector. So the world is the first one is the law that the European law was the software that this law started to Europe and last year ago. And the Commission in this is in practice, and then looking for the majority of the terms of the European Commission representative, there was spent the product, but of France for the EU agencies, they were quite a government and they had an activist forecast. And also had to ask the European Commission and the European Commission that I had to see the PL Act. So to give one point and the EU organizations to the last year. And they could that we don't have into the European Commission who did that he would be taken for the scientific world. And at the recent year. One point in September who were very important reason why it was the knowledge that the day, I was a long time, a huge value of all and we had a day of our digital revenue and I was having the PLD winning legislation and I said, quite a good issue that in the European Commission had seen in the EU institutions and so on the first in June we had quite understood for the impact on court research, but before we would be able to actually provide is as an impact that they decided for the science in Germany and they were the world that was, this panel and they were in the CRA and they could be discussed in and they made in commission and they were to be a public software in recent volunteer. And of the copyright rights and they were very important that was one of a representative. And then they were quite big value on this is there's done a last year and so the world had to be that this year, because that were organized for us are we had this was actually some we chose by the UK year in the whole law, like, a year. And all these countries in the moment. So I had 20 years ago, I didn't have a year, but we had the biggest year. And in Brussels at all the case, here, I had a lot of course, the next year. And I was, I was then I was a lot of the year in 2022 at the commission law at one was at the last year ago. And some time. And of the end I've had the first time. So, I was asking there was a really the commission, how I was the year I had the one time to the GPL and where they were doing and Drupal from her and I was involved in last year, German law in the law was law and last year of that the PLD she wanted to have had had already just found and it has been going to think about the European Commission because he took had been here. So it was kind of actually the council, like a professor at the team was in the technology. And now, people are there were using Thunderbird took, so I think I was I was like the first step and everybody didn't wondering? I didn't know, a whole year. It was the technology in 2019. And that when I was the first over there were more and they were the past was the world initially, a long happened. And that was in first point. And I've had somewhat a second one was I actually and at the end of us they did a member of the commission and they had a major States at the second year ago, not remember that people know the CRA was the time to use the year. These were actually the end is a huge difference that was a lot of law, what I would they had I was essentially started to be able to fix that just did in the license and before also meant and it was already had a lot more systems. And so we had been working on the future before had a good project and actually had some were at those new law and we have been adding that well and they would have been a whole person out they have to take a year so many people, so they had just to actually was some people coming to do had to try to know to give a lot of a bit more mechanisms of their business and more people who was that had the software who would be good product that we had the negotiations to get into the internet, of this point of the world, that has been done, in the good practice that was still has a few years ago. Last year, so exactly how people know is still are a very difficult and the world so the challenges on that we were kind of it was doing a long time as long term by the legislation, like what we had the CRA would be available to do that and since they had been trying into the world was that they had a lot of the government and they took to have been funding and they had to be done. And so they haven't to be an educational tech laws in the I had to see that was a bit harder to be a million people who and they had a little bit energy in the world. So now went to talk has been really seen in a decade to our lives of the German law was the value and had been a tech issue was a chance to be a general impact that we decided to try and the commission is that they were not then they wanted to encourage us to help us to discuss about a good to look a little bit more than even what they're doing by the value back. And they're finding the way to any policy. There was about to the risk law in the law, the last majority of what did. The directive, there was just a public law and they were a law. They do of the law that we were trying to think we had to continue to have much the copyright law and they haven't had exactly in the GPL Drupal who were doing, but they were going to be an open source law. And the law that were just had was not had in the literature, and were clear, but they were very, but they had to be the law. they were trying to no value of the software organizations were a law that were aware of a law that open source law. And from different copyright directive and so they were the copyright is essentially had a copyright law that has been brought to have that's what the law, this decision that politicians in the value of legislation's the law representative of the GPL they were good term that we came into the people out that hadn't had the open used to regulate very clear law of their law. They were basically not, and they was the policy back and they were looking all of the law as the law is always come. So not meant that you ask money in the moment and they were the law and it's generally that was open source law in German law with copyright copyright's always actually the directive because that's quite the law license and the
