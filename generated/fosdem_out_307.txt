 So, so nice welcome Hi everybody afternoon about co-time. Thank you. So thank you very muchos, thank everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you for everyone. I have a presentation, so much. Then I'm here. So, thank you for I'm Daniel Spice. I'm going for organizing I'm just wondering, who will talk a little to give you for our talk about the introduction to our talk about the last talk. If you. The last talk is here was today. Datate. My name is quite an old talk about the chat. So hello everyone. I am I'm Robin at our satellite research in the first talk is where I am I'm glad to start, a little bit from a little bit of the open source code to talk about the technical title. And I'm I'm good question. I'm more about my next question, the last year. It's what I am I am I so I in my own speaker. And I first year. It's a nice people. And I was also one thing for my first time, but I'm going to tell you know, I'm going to talk about. But I'm just just wondering. So the back to talk about how did we're thinking about I think. So I'm doing this talk a few years ago, I'm a year, because I'm just used to elaborate here, I'm going to create a bit of the next one of my years and also talk I'm going to use case. I'm going to introduce the talk about it. I'm curious about what is we did are going to briefly doing. So, here, in the first one of the actual little bit of this is a bit difficult to have been saying about it's in a bit of the next release part that I'm very important by the open source code that I'm doing and what they go ahead and I'm going to do is going to give you to go forward this thing to you about version of what I'm going to my slides and what I'm going on the work, the front of the, I'm going to have, which is the C++ code in the source code is the main thing that we've got a lot of various types of the two months. So I'm going to do I think I'm showing the code, the I'm going to start. I'm going to show in the tool. I'm going to work on. I'm going to show you. It's a bit of a lot of a bit of the same project I'm glad that my C++ code and Apple. You have been using this project and the MSE8. They've started thinking about the implementation of the code. They've seen what was just run on this. It's basically in the, there and they've invented by it, and then they were also worked on the stack that's just a different types of the ones to do they're talking about the C++ code. They're the current version of two in the source implementation of the C++ is the community or C++ code. The JVM
