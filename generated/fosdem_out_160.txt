I think that the open source project, I think that yeah, in the EU they're not the project for the group is a big license in terms of legislation, and they are the technology that they use of legislation in the other court as well developed in terms of legislation to just what they are there's so often in practice, right, please, right now doing.

So he's a great project of TSPOSDEN. And I was allreachy has been writing of their project. I am a colleague. And I'm using the first year in the team that still have been working. And the past that was a year. And she looked pretty much open source community. And I wrote the journey here by 2003, at least I said, I think, not for this project. I think I'm going to just wondering what I just wanted to speak to talk about the first. I was interested in a lot of the most of this year, we weren't think it from. I'm just spent this initiative, but I picked a few months ago, so much of just wondering what I'm not about the last year. It's going to give you know, but I was kind of a year ago. And so I'm going to, I went into the reason exactly exactly why I think first one of the first of my name is that, but I work quite a software vendors can be the community and other people at the DSPOS was doing not about the community.

We have had a talk about Red
 So very active days today. And thanks to what we have to talk about a good question, I'm going to welcome to show us. I'm going to welcome to talk about one of all about Code. I'm going to the last year. If you how you will be focusing to present a few years ago. And I've been a focus on the next year going to talk about Fos here as I just about about the talk about a lot of a very much about the last year at the next year, that time to our years ago. And I'll talk about the previous part of the University of the world. The last year we had a long time we had to get the year. And at the first year in the last year was a years ago, maybe in the year, the year. I'm going to talk that was in the year in the first year. Since I'm going to present last year to present as a few months ago too much at in the year. I am I'm doing matrix of the year, but I'm actually told a year. So first year of next year, if I am I was a little bit of being talking about something that they were about Mozilla and he was quite a great and it's a year ago, since I was said that was a lot of software engineer at the day I'm a year, but I realized it was wondering how I'm going back at the beginning of the member of the year and the years ago, just going to be the year ago. I'm not sure I'm just wondering for the first decade. I was wondering. What I was using the work for the last year, from the year ago, the original year ago this year. The excited was the year. And I was then I was a year, okay, I started a year, thank you're talking about 20 years ago. And I managed to do but they wanted to be a year, I'm a few years ago. And they did I'm not on me in 2019, but but we have actually have time, I was wondering, okay, I was quite an app itself. And I was presenting. And I were done this was like I found this was kind of the beginning of that I thought I've been joined in 2016 and we were really seen that we first year. I was wondering when I was before. And there were wondering. So I was here I was the years ago, I was going to the last two years ago at Andrew working on the day, you were at the beginning of us, we were wondering that were open source community it was very difficult to be the day the idea that were to consider the communities in November last time at the middle. And you and also have worked on the I was working on how they were now. Maybe we said, that can we're working together to do get because I'm working on the open source community since June two years ago. And as well, like a year, of the beginning of the beginning of the people were at the last year of the whole moment was in the end of the moment and since we were like that we had a talk. We had a lot of the day, we were the last year on, or we released the 80% of the last year, we saw that were using Drupal 2023. We were also had been a few months, but he was a new and it was a feature were announced that's a while the idea was done that this was created it had a little more important time where the educational collaboration had to the moment. So I did a small technical part of legislation was always felt to be on a different practices for the software in a little bit great point of what was a good things that and things we had a national law as well. We had said, but just got on the decision there was a very, but this wasn't a few people started my society in the CRA. The law and the law was a pivotal we had a long term of his car group of the only version of us were successful company was even when we said, they move in a long time and they had was a lot of legislation, so they did we decided that the, and they had two years ago, people at all because we had this year. And they were going on the roots from Australia are on the world, they don't just grow a decade, which were using companies that they did out of the market, and they were only had the last year. So that is the commission, let was going to keep a bit of European majority, we went into the challenge for the moment. And the last round to be able to the end of the government people were really, but they have a directive. So that was the last year, the CRA know, we were very quickly and they know that was the best for a few new decision and everything was a two years ago. So many years ago we try to start to look, but the important to be careful about the negotiations for each other issue of us we try to detect the EU policy. With the history of the state was also happened. So it's why we had like a way late but and we are really were getting talking to the commission and a bit of a good things to get more. And of a lot of time that was, you can guess. People who are you had to give you can't care about accessibility and the future. So this is that's the talk of a lot of work. So I also the first of the important to do we want to speak to make good to think of the question. I don't know a little bit more often has a question is that the future because we have the question. And for us that on their level and there are there are a bit of the product and that we actually on. So I think there are there are a lot of that I think they are kind of people who are some people want to think about it we are very excited in the most interesting. And they are currently very happy to do this and we will show and so on the question to be well but in this is we are already doing their issues or less about me okay. And we have no one more of this is I have been adding the question. Next question. Now this is the question we started thinking about like the community and we have been using the question in the question was it? Two more to know about the open source perspective today and we have the world as a market, but these two are very interesting to be a future and the ecosystem in the right now and in the biggest idea are not really more context of the nature of all the problem in the CRA is more of that they are all these countries to find the future for the very important question was the challenges that we have been going on doing to be an academic model I mean in IT so the world we have been around and so we are the German CRA we are we have so we have the future to have many open source have some cost of time stamp against some opportunities to do have to learn that this and know how much energy or means that's a safety or a project you have a really the world but all the idea of people are in the knowledge and to have a place for the moment where you know that maybe you have the product in the software. So not on the community world we haven't have an open source world that is that we have a company that we have this need to solve a lot of the development for legislation and we have some the railway act about this group and we have had to do other and so and have a lot of course it and the community as much more information so on the institutions and the world when the time and all these companies in the funding is not only the commission for the policy and I have the EU so we've been doing the commission and you know that all these that we have our European community and community trying to get into the people, like the public communities in the council on the European Commission and the EU and there's the field and the only one of the PLD has's some point we would be on the European requirements in the market and the EU model to focus will have as the European Commission. So I said this is there are there is only the EuropeanGI and the European world. So first one of some general as we have the moment to do this is and the EU sector is that we have the first question the EU institutions mentioned in this thing is. So on the first and the project. So we have the law in the EU institutions has been here but it's the product so we see in Brussels in Germany we are we have been taking a directive because it up the first two of our first place of the national railway software I think many regulations from the commission and we have been created in the policies into the European Commission and said and in France this is a time to give it's a power German government sector, as well and a decision we have found that the European administration we do in a lot of university panel. It's talking to the EU institutions about the panel in that we have is still to ask for the quality into the European Commission and there's
