 Hi everyone. Thank you about that. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 The first I've been here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Thank you very much. 
 Okay. 
 Welcome everyone. Thanks. So our name is a lightning co-time talk. I'm going to Alex. So thank you for Calico welcome to give me for what I'm going to start the panel, welcome everyone for the talk to you very much. But Jflow, first introduction to present our lightning talk you start about the first lightning talk. So it's today we'll talk about the next speaker to'm going to talk for the hello everyone morning every day we first talk about all a little lightning talk about our current 3D was that. I. Okay, but I'm Karen. From this year as I'm going to talk about three weeks to help you about the open source, so much. We're a researcher in the open source development project of the first year, but we don't understood the same talk about the room. It's open source world. So I'm an open source technology and as a lot of the technical projects in Europe which is also for the agenda to the world and I'm here on the German institutions. Here, that's a couple of the energy grid from the world of seven years ago? The world. The moment. So these year I'm not like before I think we are I'm the history of the time on the moment. So there are here we are a long time in the world. And the European institutions were the first time was a meeting on the impact of the European Commission. And I'm the last year. I'm going to give about the CRA, which was talking about the last year I'm just showing you a brief introduction to go to see here, which is a really important success and find the Swiss law. I'm not sure that there so I'm going to discuss with open power energy. I'm sorry for national and after we were in the beginning. And it and I'm going to present the EU technology. And to be here we were in the US and the 90s are now we open source software community, because there are part of that we're there's a lot of the problem we have time to help with the amateur electricity to do. And I'm going to get to have like to be in the sensor to be a lot of course the railway world. And this is I think if we're in this. I'm just going to be even four years ago. I'm going to know about the main year to be on time and the day or less in the time. I'm just looking at least if we actually it's two hours of the effect of the panel, the world, I think it's the open source law. But in the main impact of the world since it's not in the good, the fact that the future is open source software, I've talked about the EU law. I said that they know the years ago I've been thinking about almost, but you know, yeah, okay, but you know, well, I think that like I was like there is a GPL and we were a small year for each year, we know, we have three months maybe two months and three years ago, six years ago. We have heard about 50 years ago that when we have been thinking about. And so there's why I think I was a small world. And that again, I've seen the only point of our law was a directive and we had an open source project at TPMs because we were also because there are not for other things like five months, but if they were there's a few countries, but they had a lot more difficult to be a small to look at least the next world. I'm just to say, but one year, I'm just wondering, okay, and I'm sorry. So the first, I'm going to do a little bitmap, ask me and we have to do something that we have a couple more complex part of years in the same idea there. So that the answer is that's there is the question there the question. So we are some of the question. So the question was the question was as you about the question I was the question in a question from the question of the question about the question in the question. We are like the right now we're the question and you know it was the question and I think we think there are now last question. We should we are like how we know, do we do we know is going to happen to we have to talk about how this? Yeah, right and I don't look at least what was a question, right? Yeah, the question. Yeah, these are the question. We also the question about the answer for the question is the question. And the question is the question. But that the question is how are we are we use cases. So what is, right? So we are going to work about the question, but it's as the question that it is more question is I mean, right so the question. So long and maybe are you need to see that that you know I mean as in which is the question was still you need to think you know what I mean, the question is that because it's just as well I think I was like that is this comes coming to that you know the question is what first question of the open source code again you would like this is like
