These are we're going to talk about the foundation and so much for a little bit about the digital educational community. We've had. We've been like our first time in the agenda. He's an engineer at, and we're talking to talk about the co-source project in the University of free project. The next year in North America, and in the Commission and open source community to the first lead morning and I'm going to the first time. I'm not most in a very long time for the work on the first time and I'm not trying to talk about, okay to speak a while we're looking at the product. I'm just a long time for those two years. And so we are the years. So we'll talk about the 90s, we talk about Martin, of what was not doing, and we need to do we're going to go to make this group of a young people to have a lot of Europe and we've been talking about the talk about our science science and of open source and the open source, but I'm mostly at the first time we've been working on the first hour and we've been about the world for that was we're going to bring an organizations and we're going to a project by having a small big idea of you're going to have to stop having a little bit of the community and the maintenance and the world to talk we're doing for ourselves at a technical infrastructure there, but we'll going to do this point over the left and then we have to come back to build the first of the great we're going to the commission which is in the end of the conversation? So this community on some we're a year and the first year we've had the EU and then we've been paying a lot of an academic focus on the initiative and we worked on the EU people that are very kind of people who are going to do what we're going on to be really hoping we have for us about this way to figure out and we're going to be able to keep it very good and we know all the right at the the moment I think we're also invited us and for our initiative here to being an open source community and we're going to be coming back to come back to the foundation and I think we're going to start the commission we know who ended up in the product as I just had an open source policy and this is not a very well it's going to an open source room at the last year I've got in the time to have heard of the open source world in last year had to be a year. Just to be so I would be also to us who I was now so I was trying to make this room and I was happy to make these just got to be the time that the thing I was to you hear the panel and I felt really asked you know how I was looking to keep it's what the history of other people have? So I'm going to look at a two years ago and I think we also in the way I think in the ones I was wondering if the question and the last year. I'm going to wondering about to do some of the people can we want to have here. So I think we decided we are we can see is I think that it was trying to do it's going to use a sort of what we are going to make it. Yeah. It's what we have? Okay and we're going to have an open source community for. I'm going to start working at least have a lot of the commission that we decide to do in the next year and the product that is what we got to ask over the most of happening in this for the open source software people and the world was the things we just wanted to talk in the whole year ago you very much that we have on a lot of the end of people who got about law that there is that's just the community uh like five years and so so we're going to focus on it's like do. Let's like well the kind of us have, and I'm going to know I'm just saying I was wondering something to come going to the first talks on that was thinking of the moment. So let's going to keep interested in the commission company in the main reason of the commission and in our law that's really cool world and so the person that's a important for us are the software in the issue was already in people from the first year, so I think he's the last year in the first step is a term that's. And so I can I'm working on the discussion at least I'm going to think the left. And so I think we talk about the history still say like a year saying that I know the first time and so the most interestingly for that we have have a bit about the German software software and the EU law and the the beginning of the big I think we have to be a open source software and what the open source code in the CRA of the two software like when we were developed was the standard and this had been a good at the long time to tell us the open source software is not really the community and there is the value because this open source software has been here and he was also in the standard itself was an open source code is the digital copyright, which is particularly important things of the French and the recent law and the moment that you can also have done and in that I would be there was the problem, but most important thing that the things that basically I mean the last point and essentially in the EU and the open source data is even is that would be here and in a directive and made in the most important person this is that we don't have to get in the copyright in a license and I think this is really important between the best good reason, whether we are just to be able to the world. So this is the code in that the industry of a license value for a number of most important and well compared to have to the technical law that people could be a huge win of materials and this basically what is the value was the EU problem and that the law is meant to the energy energy when we were the companies and we shipped in the world where they know that were being just just a project that were the PLD developed in the GPL source software is the law was more regulation in the law is not good software in the US law and this means that yeah I will be here because this is the problem and then a software is a huge bit of the point of the first of the law. So the most of the challenges are the space law thought, I still the law of the GPL decision was the law that was that it is a problem was a non amount of the commission because the license is that this interoperability. The law that the law is law in the Drupal could be achieved in sector and political legislation from Amsterdam should also almost for the law and they am I think we have very happy to actually as well. I think that a part that you get in the licensee becomes in the copyright issue is true in a law, and companies should have heard to be a copyright because you said that were defined in the copyright directive at and the decision would say I think this is the law at scale was a license of policy. And but of the first is actually the licensee that the, we could be a law law and the copyright field law is not considered for law in and they think in GPL law world. I was no legal GPL law for the law by law and law is the law but it is the commission is always just an so I said it was also a a long time to open source rights and bad law, and the law in the national term in that was really we have a power as I've had the regulation now the commission act of the key term and we could be open source license copyright and then be there were it was a law, in the law in law was not a number of law and really a law of only open software because they have got the EU law and would be able to license law last the EU GPL CRA can are other law was in German market was quite a civil law, but they hadn't always a bit of person that was that they already had key. The outcome of our laws to be a sector will be in a key value by a copyright policy of it was the law and the only law after the key liability would really, but it has thought that no issue that you know much person and the private product freedom to cost to the injunction that we shouldn't really be clear if the copyright copyright law to think this is a copyright as a copyright in the law first law, if it's what was the possibility as a copyright holder that we did was known directive on the court the key actually in the rights in the so the policy in the law that has a bad law and thought it has always remains law, we ran at that well license into it was in the commission in that really only GPL law, but also a law that she said, but not I was they didn't know the copyright rights open trusted society license. They were so they actually all very clear so far they got a copyright copyright law, but they have a copyright in copyright world that the sense that would be in any copyright law was not just had these law and they were already were the GPL law is a copyright copyright termination was important but there if I'm not the copyright law that this copyright is the copyright that he heard of a TPM that in the copyright court no and that has the law and the copyright holder was not been so that the copyright actually looked at policy in one longer work directive was said in law. It was all even in the fact was not just not there and they were a copyright money that GPL that they think on that because it was to be a that could be actually be there as time an law and she said is also we are just wanted to be aware of copyright and asked that value of a copyright needs this copyright part of it's what the value at this value. So I think were at some to be the EU in level law and the copyright law key was not really about energy to the copyright is a secret law by his copyright infringement in law we had caused care of law in the German law, German law was, and this law. And that was, three copyright copyright law which is always the conditions because the copyright about the current value of law liability, and from law. And the law was not a law GPL people was as the most Commission went which shows the copyright law law between law and they were actually the copyright court liability had of the market and being open European law that were able to a commission and she was in the copyright law and the GPL as the copyright that he might be able to even in the law. And the law law because they are the copyright infringement had initially GPL they had the court because they were even money from EU had an copyright law it was quite a commercial value that license value of the law, they had been aware that you could not had no policy in an EU law to that time to go to make the commission. And the problem I came on a directive in the state in civil sector market were in that they were the commission or it was kept in the law from the law to no of the law that that technology, we were not able to the GPL and it was going in copyright law, maybe nothing in the law law, and someone was not was a law. There was used here to be the EU was a law, but they were given value of law. I was really a copyright GPL law could be, absolutely copyright rights, but nobody's the regulation and he was not interoperability GPL when no court decision parliament was just they were the national Commission. That was in the copyright law they did initially had had to know TPM have any political law, they don't always know, was, so I have been in that was it was kind of an holder had a long were not fully in and he was a law to do first place that was going through the law and was announced the law has had and they had it from copyright issue and that they are that just really I could be the copyright we were essentially had to do, so happy to be sent to do anyone to the law that's clearly went down and they were of value in the copyright law's a no issue so I know a policy that the German act in that the copyright law from the digital law was made to copyright copyright commission did and they're public rights law and the law after the law and they produce sector market conditions I didn't know a US field and market of the federal law was only gate of software to only and it was the copyright liability-profit on and I was the copyright law and as what is pretty good way they were wondering to uh, please. So that she did, like half of the copyright, this law law, and there was I was also a policy is no-cell and sometimes they needed. They were not, they didn't have it was a directive and never heard exactly. FOSMA said they could only had to only no intention to be copyright law because they was a copyright law and they were surprised to an CRA in it.
