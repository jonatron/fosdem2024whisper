 Hello, I'm introducing a little bit of a researcher of a year, and was concerned in his career than its company and I was doing this, I'm wondering. I'm a very quickly as well. I'm trying to keep the next presentation. I'm glad to talk to ask the talk about earlier. I'm going to show you the previous presentation. I'm going to be part of all in my next talk about the first goal and how I'm wondering about the interesting thing which is, about how do you want to be sure to come with the questions? So I'm not only one of that all is that I'm going to talk about the next six years and I'm just wondering if I'm going to tell you. I'm going to talk about the microphone. I'm a little bit to start with the end up in this demo of the screen. So the login open source on a web web media like I have this talk, the room. I was the Ophono. Okay, so I'm just wondering if I'm going to talk about a little bit and so I'm glad that I'm going to talk a very happy to you been wondering about the most from this room. And I'm going to say, so I'm not saying, so I'm going to talk about the talk up. I'm on working on the browser. So I'm going to be using the web server is based on. This is open source server, I'm going to give me about the server and it to a browser, which is showing on the server. So, this end is the client, because the server, the end of the server, I'm going to look in the server side. This will be an client, so I'm going to help in my email server. So I want to ask you a server to use this room. I'm going to share this client and the server is part of the server, I want to try to share to do that. So I brought me, that was going to do this job data up my services on the server. So I said, I'm going to start. I'm showing. I'm now I'm moving to talk today, so happy to talk about I'm going to the server. I'm ready for us, really wondering the page, you're going to open SSRC, as an application, but I'm going to have an email server. Okay, if I'm going to show you already going to be going to give the server to speak a server. The server and then is going to go back to all the server. I'm going to my client. And I'm going to start to talk about the server that, and the server. Okay, I'm going to go to have the server, because I'm going to be happy to do you as my demo, right. So I'm going to write the server, I'm going to show the server, so I just going to mention the server. I'm going to go to stop, I'm going to talk about this API. Okay, I'm going to show this talk, I'm going to work with my URL. I'm going to talk about the server. You'll talk about a self-do thing. I'm going on. So, and I'm going to present out. So for a first I'm going to say I'm going to get the server to be a web that I'm going to try to go to help me. Outbernetes browser. And finally, I'm going to talk. I'm going to talk about how I'm going to start with my clients, I'm not going to tell me. It's going to talk about the audio is going in front-side talk. I'm not sure that, but we're going to talk about X Code, how much. So I'm going to talk about. So I'm about the rest of the OpenTT is I'm going to show you about the browser. I'm going to talk to talk about the first, I'm going to create a presentation. So, I'm going to start thinking about the internet. I'm going to talk about the WebSocket and I'm going to start working on the agenda about today, and I'm going to present in the Dev Code. So you a few months of the fact that the whole one of the CNCF. And I am in TinyDR. I? I'm just mentioned, the way to talk about half, C++. And I'm presenting here. And I'm going to be a tool for that I'm going to talk to talk about the next speaker is RISC-Fi. So this work as we use the open source code. So, I'm going to be speaking about it's amazing project. We have we're going to do some open source project with the end-level community. We use case, we build on as well, we are trying to apply in a community. We have a web browser and long as I'm going to talk like that we have heard about open source projects and we have a little bit of the next release. It's a long it. I'm a small project in a very interesting project. We need to be able to make the architecture for the community. We're using the things that a question. We're going to talk. We're the Android. And I'm hoping to have a lot of the documentation, where the project is happening. So it's a lot of things that's a lot of work for us like the web browser. So there's, we need to switch for us to give us, a different servers when we can go forward in a community and then we're going to write us the community and we're going to give you're going to start in a good project that we're going to maintainers. And I'll have it's probably going to show up doing the market in our product. I'll end, the end. One thing that's going to make a lot of what we are actually have to have to share our organization as well, I mean when they're going to keep up our code collaboration science project from our goals of people from the community. And some experience and that's different communities, we've done and the world. And I think that's just a lot of all kinds of the software and we're going to work groups that's going to work with building and more of people in the world and at the other projects. And also way, we're in our community. And we're going to think that we're going to have to, why we have, we're going to do everybody that? How to do we want to be going to do not have our next to be able to want to find that kind of just been doing some people who want to focus on that have to share the product. Okay, I're going to know how to come on the documentation and you know what is then we are first step in the code perspective. The first thing that we're trying to make that the data based through a world and how they're not a few other research of our people are often provide a little bit different open source world and all very important ones that we have going to figure out where they want to do. And there's going to make sure that we have to look at least 10 years, but we're going to be in the way they're going to be really trying to be the long as well, but they're going on that needs to be a lot of a lot of software that a lot of interesting to look at the system and we're going to be aware of work and they're using the product management policy space where you're looking for all like we're going to have a lot more people know it, just a huge use case and they're going to take care about it and we're building a PRs and they're going to integrate and to make it and we're going to do at the EU government and we're going to open source community there's a lot of the government world of a company could go more and that I'm going to the knowledge we're going to be a lot of the civil society and yeah, uh so we know that's a good license but if we're going to talk about that we're going on that we're going to have, why we've been trying to be trying to do these are a whole projects and think about funding and how to be a bit more expert with something that, uh people went into a lot of well we're going to go into the last year ago at least in the world. So we've been seeing some of open source people get around in Europe. And well, we have our first year, there's coming out the first year to be a big big concern of the GPL Foundation, which is just a very active law. So not necessarily a world and the commission coming into the third but in the German law actually last two years that was like the CRA in fact that. And that the EU and a key, these procure in 2018 they know it was the European Commission and the EU world and it are the European Union and a federal google institutions developed in decision was actually quite used as well, was able to be paid for the big tech and to go more than 2023. From the beginning of that she was really much of the EUs are in the first member of the world and humanities law and the possibility to open source laws that we did I also. And I didn't think we was wondering if you know that I've put into the copyright came to you know, in the end of course, but we are there was like were some of the world and I said that we had to do was kind of what we were being a law and what I took is that. I was at least a product was was a thought it had to ask after I was a government in was now have heard about that I was a success that got a bit of digital German law that it was 20 years ago. And that of the outcome was you know about that we had a really, you've found that were thinking from the court foundation and we see the policy did I'm done on the EU and I got to that I was just saying that I think that the current knowledge was just decided to know how it was the PLD was not really because I was the law and was allowed to be quite a bit more European States and who came on the commission were doing the fact is coming to come and so you see that was like two was the one was just used to check if I just don't know why we are going to get that the law and so much. The copyright was going was in so I was in there were saying we've got a long worked on to show up on the copyright law, and which I built in the copyright. I was what the ones was this is the EU rights that was one that she was happening that they had to make well which was to the German law. So that they was, you know that. So finally there were really interesting had a copyright EU law because they actually like they did this copyright as a directive and they had to have been added a value in a copyright in the moment we didn't have in the nature of the license under the copyright since we had the idea to work. The commission is it was completely, in their public law that the end is not very famous law that were at the world. It was a legal and since now. So they thought that this was like that he wanted to think that was just a German technology was even was a last year, is more important to something that was just started under the copyright law. And they did not a law that very important point they had a GPL law, I was about that was just a GPL and he just wondering of the value in a free that we did in this and saying what was this has got the license came into the value and the theory is that he was the parliament by the law and I knew two companies here at the copyright law was one of the copyright of the law itself were a law. And they had five law because that had just nothing was made a license like a law. Another thing, but they did was a GPL and they went out this copyright needs had a copyright value that value of the legislation was not doing that the law was the law because it was a copyright legislation actually to copyright rights. And I didn't heard of you could just know if why would be a was just by the same laws and the GPL and in that they were under the value. And they were in the council did they were a copyright only difference that the values of course the policy was there still a legal legislation that person they were in the third law. And they just didn't exist at the American parliament which was a definition of the law. They have thought that they had said 10 and they wanted to work to also had like in the negotiations decided to be also weren't at the Commission and they would be forgotten they did not think we were they got three day they were always think that they had that was done having was being known value of the UK court and they had had that were their license really far when they introduced at the value to summarize an had also know the license was okay that happened together in a value for the copyright state of legislation and the people were trying to know, because it was like a license law of regulation, so they had license in the copyright law. But it was that was a copyright and I think it was not every day. But they had been an commission law made but they had a key value to point in the data. And eventually not the question that wasn't, we had to make a policy so it's going to get the public value to do there. The law was there were also google policy was no copyright would actually a copyright. Actually in that has had thought don't just made another person had been doing that was the copyright copyright licensee did to that they were a civil rights license that they actually been an issue in that would want to change the policy issue with actually happen. Now that in the license and I don't need this discussion happened in how they were some way they made for they could be very annoying that this open source law. We have no act and they could need to be a copyrightaries that you didn't even get to copyright measures that's not only one of the work even had to the right person that are not just the value and the foundation if they were very confident that they would be also to be better and they would have to do not that the license in actually means only the value and I didn't talk to do that the problem and then they ran into sense because there were kind that would
