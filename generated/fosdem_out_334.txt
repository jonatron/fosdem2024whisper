 Hi? The question is the things I'm one? That's it a very good. And I'm using my slides. Thank you very much. 
 Okay. So this is our main question because I'm quite curious to talk about the talk about a about what I think about the work through those are like 10 years when I'm going to have this information I'm going to present in my presentation. It's going to introduce a bit about how we just going to try to use a job and talk. So this is a part of the main thing to talk about what I had. And I have here in the fact I've got actually use Juple board. I'm going to talk about the JMAP and VLC, because I'm going to talk about writing this, but we have a new web-netes and working at the talk with Astro Project. And I've had a European Commission and they're currently running in the work in the background. So the chat and the main piece of the company, which is I've had by the project that was called Project the first, and then a CSSD. And he was able to see on the first one of the company, he wrote here running in WebSocketP,. And he was like a lot of the Veralosle and he said, the name of people to introduce an Open Science Leb3 billion dollars and they're going to take into open source project. So, and I'm presenting. You know here at the last year. Okay, we now. And I was the year I was open source software with me have a maintainer and the ones. Backtracing with the first year ago, I'm wondering about a lot of open source project. And I don't have a lot of friends with that I was, I was working on the history of the WebSocket to talk to open source projects and I didn't know that gave a developer. I'm just learned about the work in a really, for this talk about this code in the beginning of my back to the whole community in there were open source project so I were the time to be also open source and the one of the years. It is been started with the DensorFlow Europe. So there was also some other organizations. It was a security community was very recently so many projects that are also all the UKIX has been created by a lot of what I'm going to make sure that we have been talking about the tool that we see that we're going to do you know what are going to think what I'm going into the open source project. We're open source software involved in the community. That's going to be talking about I'm going to make it to talk about that. And what I have we see from the code to say, that in the first year in our work on the world, if we're going to start, you can talk to look at the work on the work into the commission. And we'll be working on on the world and we'll be discussing everything and we're coming into the community and we're going to go for building this company. And so we're going to be looking up to go through a very quickly and we're going to look at the main people who's going to learn to talk about the first day of the point for us. And we're going on our community, we're going to switch. And we're starting to start in the negotiations, the last year last year,000 companies that's the projects that we've been using companies, we have been trying to share from the last year we're talking about this to do the collaboration with open source organizations, which I'm going to keep the last year and I'm going to introduce the work that about having a lot of the community, well, we're excited about them out in the future of these. We are also have been a lot of the development for the moment. And we have heard that I'm wondering, how many people, we kind of the co-called community, the team, the organizations are we've been also heard that we thought about AI thing that we're trying to do, people in open source projects that and we talked about open source contributors on the community needs to do have an expert and so we have their mission with the best society, very exciting project and we've done with the world and so we could we want to make the open source software and we don't think there. And we have an open source community to do we'll talk about all over the community science and the most of our challenges, because community and open source project. So let's fine funding work out, we can tell us get involved in 2021 and a CEO and how as the community work, open source communities. You're the people, they are interested in Europe, and they can be the money to join us to touch community in open source project. And then they use like people on the community and lots of the product to integrate and so in a community of people and we just some organizations and they want. So they don't think, we've realized we're talking about today and they're just be on the product. And we have been talking about this project and looking forward as I'm going to do some people to contribute to be a few people are so on the other years. And the last year that's the other in the policy initiative that's sort of the definition of the really the world. But they're trying to be an open source world. But let's no, I mean, we just hit the way that we have any right. But we want to go to have this. I think we want to discuss a little bit of a technical community in the world out of open source community, but we're doing things and I'm just a year, which is great job to talk here because there's a lot of the way to talk's stuff. They're here. We're all in this community that area like going to start a community and doing this what you know that we've been hoping that person to look into the first time is it was going away a culture of their community would be a and should be open source systems, these workshops there last year, I was a bit of these projects. They got over you know, but the open source projects went to be often worked in the time to talk. And then they're trying to give you know that people in that was starting out there's getting able to the community and actually worked on the, and they're the world, so they want to spend what they're using this in another company that they have called a world. And they're going to play a community and they've got the number of different community that open source community will get left to the open source. And what this was one that I guess here. And I started working on the right, I'm doing were going to come out there was there. So that there's like that, so many people are people want to do you know that make the people are going to go to be a lot of the only one you to share this room of this, but also do you know, and sometimes we do you'll we don't know how many people've done. So the community we'll work. And when we have a lot of the people ever did feel like we need to do we have to turn out to keep in there and see a lot of the world for me to find the project to build a lot less tech people to we were a bit and we're not just a lot of people who only thing and we've got a few people who we use. We've got a lot of all know how much people who're going to get too. And that we're having to do we've been talking about the people who are trying to go ahead of people, right like five years, okay, but, we're going to actually going to do this project to be a lot of open source project at the community. We've still have the last workshop. We're going to take a nice software project. So they have other people in the last year. And this year, thank you the goal of this was to talk was very much everyone. We have been the project. I was a lot on the first talk about the EU to talk about the 3, the first step of the last year, but we're the European Commission in the sovereign issue of 2018 and is open source projects and so we've got our last year, we're going to be so if you know we're going to share where the standards. And the European Commission decided about this was the world we were involved in some point in a lot of a nonprofit Association is there was going to be great product in the fact that was very often been really interesting that came to work that. And who was that we thought we had to actually had to go to work on a bunch of people to their own world in the world. And in the people got the EU initiative from the European Commission in Norway were working world. And we thought this year in this was three years. I'm going to be trying to really a big job through the European Commission. And so far here I think we didn't see a long. And this slide. I had a long time ago at the first year. I saw in that we were going to see here. We had a lot of the first thing about the very cool community and we were there had about the past year now and let was we have been working on our work in the commission since we had a professor in one year and but then here, I had one and this year, we did back in any of the beginning and he was taking a little more happy to see on the years. And I'm hoping to have two years ago at a year. And they haven't really been working on the people from people going to continue to get started working on the market that and then we had to get to show up them to work on their community and I was speaking and I was then we were working on this six months and I've been involved to the right now I didn't been full of mine yesterday in and then at the CRA and we had this year and so too crazy so I wanted to go back to keep this year and the team was someone came got the stuff and got started with a little bit about the CRA, we had this year and we wanted to think that were even one year. And I was actually worked great forward to show you actually a moment it could do everything about the last year I didn't know was just was the audience and I was all the morning and I had started to get started working and I worked and went on the work out how we had some year in and he was to work with the Commission decided to set up to actually so there was very well in the chance to get started the workshop. And I was that was just was a good idea we made a few people like that we have to see and after the journey like people involved at the years ago and I was that's going to know it was not a lot to be the years ago around right now but the European Commission in the way that what I had this slide back and I was the project was the fact that were living in France in OpenJDK had a few years ago. And I had to talk really had a lot of a bit about what I knew that was the first but and how they were going to like here and I was the community went through and I had that about this was also was going the technology. We had to talk was in the things that i was I was that was just for the same option to be in the workshop were to the CRA and then that was and the market as much money happened to have some talks and he had this point a year's going to look at the ones and they were somewhat happy to be some sort of the problems that was to speak this year ago we started trying to be the time and that was a part that they wanted to build the way to be a lot of the big thing that we had the company had to know about the things I was looking forward to do because you to make the point better in the digital in the ecosystem of the software and there were you were both of the source community started the community so I think you have been working for people or we have to discuss in the good and they were the world we also on the first and I were having to the best to be the past time doing together to think that I think the world and I may be more than that I think and we in this thing you don't have this because it was that there was quite a good and the European commission is that he gets part of the commission in this is that I see in that the presentation is actually is like the open source software like the most important one of the law that we have that's not just in a country that they were only decided that they are going to be a legal needs to be open source software and so nothing which is needed in the European Commission and they want to work right so the whole to be used software so very well he was basically because so many years so I mean that was in the copyright but I think the policy and very big problems were in practice on the German legislation they were not aware of the foundation and often good and the government and they have looked like this planet that I would be a good that we also has to care about rights and so these business uh like for time in these agencies just had like some time there's also the license and you know too big in the law and that money and the commission to the policy should be in the regulation and he's in the license to get the court was that is not the current law in two government but they've got around a policy in the tech that are the first law in in the German law key that this German license is the first of copyright law and you know exactly what the software certification that I'm all know exactly what the first question and I had to explain about someone for it was looking at least and do I come out the world so that I have the panel and he was a year in the directive we do was wondering I have the good place in the copyright money that far and the law I knew what I said how they couldn't remember they had been, a way there are some of the years. And I was a young person who was not sure that's the CRA that they kind of the previous Commission and they had made a bit more power and the moment because they were the world so they had been the German law? How do it was exactly are you know that's, but the government would like he might be paid to be the technology and there are some European commission and the
