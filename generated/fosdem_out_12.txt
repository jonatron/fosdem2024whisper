 All right. We're going to meet up and get to what's kind of a pain of a lot of work in. I said open source code stack all really just like it is not one. I've had this point was like how to do you are going to put into a new version which is going to run a specific way to go through it further and show you something that you the code that you can do. So here's a lot of other bits have found this and what I'm going to be kind of a lot of things going to be messed up. So I'll imagine I'm looking at what I've got a little bit of a little bit where just one of. I'm going to show you a couple of examples. And this is for a little bit about about the past. And so that I talked about A few things that are really nice thing that I'm going to talk about what's kind of kind of like a little bit in a very close to be kind of a lot of things in in each other are going to go to get it. And I'll send a new image to me to your app, a real level of the first I show you if I'll be my, maybe that's the next year or just going to be actually. Also, I just a little bit of a little bit of documentation, and more than one that I'm going to talk to look in the issue. It's going to the documentation. I'm doing that I think I have a lot of a couple of the best thing right thing in my point that we're going to be captured like the ones on this is that this talk to show you're going to say. And that I can I'm going to show the time. What we want to start getting the question was going to start. It's going to talk about how we're going on our community of our AI with those models. And I'm going to give a little bit of the answer to talk about the first person from a little bit with a very interesting thing about that are the first one of the question. So we are the presentation. I'm going to write a few the energy systems and if you can we have to share data into your data at three minutes. And so the university and I'm going to learn that are going to stop the last year. And this is what is kind of the last year, here's going to see that means that we're going on the one of what we're going to be first one of your data is a very important thing that we're going to think the main thing of the the data to be for the very important idea is that means that it's the data into power that we don't need to think about, what is that the things. How do we get into the ones going to what we start right? Where's the distances the first, is next one. And then this is going to see, when we have a value of our open line as important thing we have to do so we would be looking like to read the right now be consistent. So this is the question of one is it's the same way that you want to make the first. In general value for each one one of the slide was the world in the project and I think of the same values that the start to be done by the data and the data in the very low problem. And that when you have been doing this is that other ones. But as it's kind of the smallest of the human, we have been talking about the right now going to think that when we also in that in the future is very firstly and the first thing that I think that we have even less of the LLM is to make the human should be able to be clear in the way to be, if you need to get the right now we trust in the information. So I think that's a good. We have very short question is a question for performance is one we want to be? We need to look at the most of your audience about the question the world of the question. He's okay that this. I think I'm not for the question I think, great question that. How can. I think it's the question. I'm going to about this and energy question is to the question to talk about the question about what we know about it is just a more about this as we can be in terms of the question. And this as you're going to come on and and talk was we've got a small question. I've got into our attention and I think about the first. So yes, there are here's a lot of things to talk to use cases when you don't know if you're going to speak to have you've just have a lot of time detail. So it's the way to talk I'm wondering. So, what's mainly did we just going to remember people just wondering. Well, but just wondering how much. I'm going to skip the next year and I'm working on. I've done is Matthias, I have our talk here. And I'm going to start looking at 4. So, a talk. I'm going to talk about this talk about it here. I'm going to our project. I'm going to talk. We've been working here. And I'm going to look at the work for children. I'm going to give you a good talk about open source project. So I'm trying to talk about it's going to tell me here about this way to convince the most of the question, exactly about the new people, like I think is some people that are sort of the people who are new community. And I think I'm also my life community. I'm going to talk today we're talking about, so many other thing for the sort of my audience. But generally very good ones and I'm a talk about the last year was the OpenJDOSDEM that, and what we have? So let's here I'm doing is, but I guess, how I think it's only, but also working on the more complicated and nothing to go to make a couple of what I'm going to the future to be speaking about the first two minutes here in terms of the project, but so I'm going to tell you. I'm going to show you guys. So the time. Well, I'm going to see now to see my name of my talk about the future. The talk about an American talk about the moment we have done. I'm Karen. Just again, I'm Okay. We have any thoughts on the presentation. Right. I'm standing on the talk about the agenda. I'm going to talk about the slides at Fos and I'm a little bit of the slides. I'm going to think I'm going to take be happy to be a few years ago. I'm just wondering. I'm currently to talk about going to talk about my colleague talking about this FOSDEM I'm going to the presentation, we in the Fos. Right, I'm going to present a lot about my website. Okay. Okay. Let's welcome to talk about your co-tuning. I'm going to talk about, yeah, talking about us. We have to our talk about all the next questions. I'm going started with the first one hand. We can find a little bit about the first one of open source. We've been the end of the last year we had a big point of the first speaker is a year, but we worked the year before. We're going to see a little bit of all new release in the year ago on the world that we're going to focus on the last year and I'm working with us, I'm curious about the last year. And I'm a year and at the year I think I'm assuming I'm going to talk about the last year? We also here, we have this. We are in the session, the last few months ago. And I'm going to start a lot of us the year there's going to be two years. Okay, thank you very much. I was wondering in this year earlier in 3D-test of the year I'm going to talk a bit about the first year. I did the talk about the first thing this year. We had had last year ago. It was a great. It was, I was really to put in the Open 3. We actually. And I started. And unfortunately. And I'm going to find that was not sure I'm going to be pretty sure that the last year before, I'm going to talk to continue to be going to be, on. And I'm thinking about all a little bit of the plan for the Linux 3Dius member of the first one was just to invest at the year, but he is just from the early year. So you know what was going to be I think, right? So this one of GTKyter project, the moment they have is not been thinking before. And yes, the most, the community, in the first release was released in the big decade. Because this was like, right now, the time in the world they are in the whole work on the fact that they were to deliver in this whole situation. And then the years ago we've got the history of the year. So back to also launched the last year again, which were using the year. It was just to the other project. And then I was not open source situation. And I was speaking, the first year. And the history was the first year, we're going to be in it's the community to talk for over here and I've already mentioned some point. And I was the last year was actually very, the last year we have actually have been working almost what was allowed to be asked to prevent on the audience that we saw that people. And we started by a few that's a year. And in June, in many people. We have been doing the beginning of these years was starting to be quiet and looking for doing some of a long time, this until all the day. But I gave us could do something that, like really happened at the technology because we got to review. And the part of the years ago, we were thinking about the community when we had had a new initiative from the same time. Some of the beginning. And I'm a lot of the process of the point. So we had a company, I was wondering, okay, we said, after some last year. All right now we had been working and that we had the beginning of the current. We had to work, this was we had the three like, and we were the panel that was a lot of the last year. And I was really the first year, really a lot of the last year ago. I am at me so I had been doing that's going to talk. I'm, the beginning of those year. I've got a lot of that that had now had been doing later, but that's in the time. And, how did this year ago, we were that we were a lot of mine yesterday, well a researcher in 2011, and we'd like, and it had said, or two years ago. So I had to give the two years ago and I was here there. So we got so I got to the last year ago, the year. And I know, then I said it was very nice to be very well, the moment, but after the first day. And the days now a lot of the years ago, which was just took six people were the end and 10 years ago. A little bit of like the last year ago, was a long year at the first. And I didn't know, like the years ago,000 times were there we started from the beginning. And he was a few people had, when they were talking, yeah, the new sort of the next year. So of what I was, we started to the other people, and they had a little bit about like I was telling you know, and they want to make our co-tools and they couldn't just get people that they've been done on, but they had a product, so don't know that they could try to read the best, but they shipped the people that there were going to support in there were like the idea and then you know, I think, someone is nice know, because they are their community. They're the way they're trying to get just the right place away to get to share the most people to identify the tech people like he's just got there and we're like we know somebody that way of that they're trying to know what you know that we're going to get experience, I think of all those who has been using these to do this. I think he's gonna briefly, we're being doing is, but that I think it's always had a lot of maybe people that is the outcome of time, the people that they come in the people working group, you know. They're just been doing on this as often said at the people, they have kind of like they're the person who can do they're asking to ask people to work for people. What in your software engineers of these people for the potential people who are people to be doing their communities, but even in the people in the people, you know, yeah, and they do have people still have all people maybe everybody and you know, so many people don't think my good chance to think there's the things that I guess that. I think I'm going to sort of the like it's one of saying if you know, you're going to evolve up to do something that they're going through the I know is making it, but I've got a lot of the idea because I just last year. I did not like the result of the last one of the beginning that was saying, how to be the challenges right person, if I said there are the world and I'm going to talk was saying that we had like I then, because people had this is going to come next presentation and do I was going to be at from just saying, I've got a panel. I was going to know that. And I had kind of, you know that's the best thing, you know, I come along and I like no, with the question, but there's going to have, sometimes that was, you know, right, you know, so they know the community, what not too, we were asked. And TPM project, we are building itself, and so that they were, so like, you know, we are going to do we have like, we're not in the C as
