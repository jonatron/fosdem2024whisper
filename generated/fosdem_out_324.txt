I will talk a few questions, thank you everyone for us who was working together and I'm an operating system support for the founder of the Open Source Act back in the big talk was just about this year. Strbuth Initiative. My name was a few years. We have been a lot of the new sustainability projects is, so wonderful company and I'm the French companies and I'm going to share and they aren't coming to talk about open source projects. It's one of talking about the end now. But I'm one of the ones today I'm going to kind of the founder of the project of this was working on its community and I'm going to talk for students. The first of the first one is we have heard about the Mozilla and for the work in the university and the last year we were the community and I have been running. So I was a lot of the way, and I started making a high-on and the University of time, which made a lot of the lastly over the first year. So I'm going to talk was wondering in our next year and I needed to be a long time we're just an open source projects in. And you can I'm going to show you a couple of three months. Thanks for the first question. I'll make the story about the last year? And thank you. Thanks for the open source world, great time. Hi, if you, but it's this is a great. So we're going to use in France. It's the CRA. We are happy to be the moment in the educational piece of a huge question. And you can we're going to do is we're going to work for our first office for the EU Association, the European Commission and to be started this thing of the workshop with 2021. And the European Commission. And on the most of the first year we had to want to do that the first is the last year I've seen this year to work today, which is the GPL and we also related to make a new funding to us to both the EU community Europe and the European Commission and a recent law. So not the European Parliament. And I think is that they are. We have a whole parties that they're going to use court liability here, the panel in the person, including and we're going to have an idea in the commission to create more than one to have a year, an German law that we are a French law and then also as the organizations for the public sector with EU for those rights that is free law we've been doing that they would be removed in the government, but they wanted to encourage you to have a really interested in the end in the world. And like national industry which is the European Commission in a regulation about last year and the world, this directive as a very high point of the European Commission and humanities group we actually had the CRA and we've been doing these roots in June five a world was very first year. So I said this was with the left, the point. In Asia, you so I'm just heard of the tech field, but the product that the market, the court they didn't have had an court law in 2022 it was a European Commission. So there was for different one of civil EU that this year or really important thing we can be to have got a challenge will also have to us at our private value of the national agencies that we had a huge directive in the current organizations that this kind of the digital rights in scientific process of legislation were probably we gave us done to have a nonprofit commission to keep the EU law and then the year. And they had a very long term that they can have been involved in the world of our product and they saw a free liability in the product to get in the ones that the parliament were talking to develop legislation in the idea. When they were asked us a good way to help free software. And the third thing it's saying how to have a bit of the government money in terms of Germany could be to make that they are connected as possible to having any countries, but they could be available into a particular law and they had to understand to share software law. So this market services and always just an AI in terms of the cost of scientific law and then and they are there is, but there, they just a legal market in terms of open source and they were like a new society might have said that they have to say and they know in open source software to be any idea of what we should was thinking about their law in the tech because we're going to do. So they come up the political government but they have these organizations should, they are not need to be able to be aware of the open source law and out of law, but an open source law, though they kind of the value of thing that the copyright has done in the law so that that I think that we're in legislation was the copyright legislation and they're going to do exactly always think of the law and they're actually a copyright law who are going to be able to have that sector and they have that civil law and they know a GPL law of EU and they are always been talking about law and they're a value of legislation. In German law but they've shown all their copyright needs to that they don't seem to be able to be a commission that they are talking to put in their notion, they now they have the rights. The rights of the term, that they're the law that there. And they have had no clear directive it to the law and it was more government standards that they were not a copyright. So laws who knows that the law that they had to in law, but they came into order to be no regulation directive and they would be a free license and they need to be clear that's actually because it's just not actually the license, but they didn't go back away in the world that they want to the commission now and was a democratic law that law as I don't know that. So this copyright holder as a tax is the negotiations did we have already know what the fact that were the law. And the beginning of the directive that the one of the GPL does is what decision they tell us there. In fact that the law should be used to get the law and but they said, but they don't know what the license, but they had the license should be, they didn't have to be. Because they were the copyright of the copyright world in law and they come to copyright could be the copyright and they had the law that they found until there and they want to stay in the copyright would need to the law law, and that I think that, that sort of law could be a laws, which is a law called the law that needs to do the law license might be a license free license for copyright that would be a law and that same value here they have heard of the copyright that regulation. They had this value of the law's the courts had been a GPL may a policy to also a commercial value to have heard of law cannot have copyright he said. But that, it would it was something they knew to give the license or a copyright idea to the value what money this that's like that's an educational law would you have this license and it would look from that would be infringing that was that's better that would be the law that can I think there just mentioned, but no of the license where you could they could do the license because so and this law and then the parliament has been a copyright policy in a sense of copyright law to have a interoperability field that really copyright law the law in practice that it was good license think it's as I was released together in GPL and I was the law. The second is the beginning. And the she did we started law has thought with law or the keys that they just would be on the copyright law at the digital public law going to open law of what they have in scope of policy. They didn't what the copyright directive in that they were using copyright in the organizations know there was, and she's much sense, we had to know there were a law and we have two years and we had the people found them where we would go to be the law value. These political thing that I would come to you got some copyright holder are we had to open source world and the question of the law value of the value of the law that they were doing the money in the value in the law becomes that they had been aware of of the law and not to actually in order to the law saying there's what she had they have to bring a GPL government rights of the first. So the EU and he was there was actually were any law that shouldn't found as far away from basically work, it would actually as people to get a license and they can't have to that meant that it's going to reduce the law and they've seen in the value and that political law, still have the copyright law has been achieved we don't always get that that we need to one person is only have to be happy to be speaking to consider that they might be the value number for that many commercial for this public copyright issues so the only the law that's being the law. So to the copyright legislation was that we actually the open source. So in a directive that's all the German policy and then the end, the GPL, we just an injunction and we had. And that the world was asking for they did that was so that I was to we heard that it was given in a directive for the law. So I think about the law and the impact of course it was not perfect because that the GPL law and kind of the commission policy and policy that is always came out. And of the decision had during the world ago, I think the license has quite more money, that I saw to be competitive a directive had to be in two law that they had had to be a problem of GPL the value to do on that in the public law in the commission that were made was going into the first thing or a big value for a public license that were a really not using court of it was a value that they released throughout the way the commission and before and the national law and they were actually have been said, super, I had a sense of European Commission. So so it took that was the value to be a copyright conditions of the organization is not affected in the copyright directive? So I think, for you need to grow into more or money and software in the law was, they would be able to be like that you that maybe if you have to do so you don't believe anyone in our law. But that the law said, like GPL was not only like a law that, but being the German license law and the GPL law? And as that the fact, the copyright law, in law was on that the copyright license and that the legislation was about law. And we had a principle where the law was that law that interoperability law. It was in an license part of a violation that had, but I was actually the rights and just used in the GPL commission decided that the world were a copyright license law foundation and there were thinking of the possibility to be at the copyright had, and as a law space, but the world were doing this regulation that was an upper and long as open source law and a law were just. And not tested by an activist point of the copyright law member in the software law, when the licensee directive and for law policy court law the copyright law, okay, there I was a was what that means. Why could we had to do we not as well for the German law were the commission is a law, we had had five government court was supposed to change. And the software, yeah, but we knew. He said, we were the GPL UK law can't had in two, even over in fact that to be asked us were a copyright license at the law and I was done in the cost world of the European law? It would. It was the law copyright sector that's not being been law, for the global law was it was also intended to a problem and they had a point directive in a law and they were a world so the community had given country to always said that they would also said earlier, right regulation. And after that they saw that the country, they're a law for the court law, and they have had some things to be thought that is that we had said that was at the source act that we have had to know, and they have to say that society. And I said that was the
