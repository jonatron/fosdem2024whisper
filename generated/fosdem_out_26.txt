 Welcome to my Pongden. Thank you hear your question, I'm going to tell you how to update your voice. And the first step is going to be in the speaker and. 
 So first talk. So I'm wondering how this talk. I'm going to talk about how I'm just wondering, hello everyone. The talk we have about that? Awesome. So, as fast as a lot of work to I'm just wondering, so I'm here for a modern question. I'm currently going to be here for attending. My first time, that I'm going to start up to talk before, you just wondering about 10 years now here today we have a matrix up the next of a year ago, so I'm going to make sure that if you're going to talk to what we're going to talk about RISC-Fi using for a little bit of you to explore a little bit of an example of a new time. So I'm going to talk is going to go to talk about the satellite. I'm going to do a little bit about the talk about, which I'm going to see the first talk about the first year, and I'm going to talk about this. So my talk, first talk I'm going to be using this is going to talk about to talk about. It's a little bit. Not very important. It's a bit about what's also a good talk by the web working and the front of our voice. It's all of the features to the communication teams in the challenges, but we're not getting time. The goal of the world we were more people were working, four times. The first round of the work that are we got on the community we've been working in the data in the first step of the time. We want to make an open source code of all about the people. In the project is the time as the standard. We need to make it is kind of a very important thing. That's the ones that we have been working working. Actually, a little bit of a good idea which is more important. So I'm about the energy in our community. I'm surprised about it's a really a lot of time to be more than a lot of a lot of interesting stories. We have made a lot of different things that we have two years ago. But it's actually. It's a very exciting thing that you can, when you know if you're right, but it's not just a bad software engineer in the rest of the reasons for enough impact of the open source software was as it was a question for us, but the software. The big source software perspective, the fact that you know, think that there are just to think then you know I said, it's all of all of us to actually a huge use it's it. So for example, there are plenty of the thing that means here are being a lot of us there are many women in one of the fact that the future changes already so on the long term is the law in the German law that there are very different legislation and there are most political law level of legislation. So it comes in a GPL law that there's also a copyright law and the law in data is a German law,. So if you see on the EU. And I think the law to the German challenge we are very diverse law in a copyright and commission to give out there are the law. It is no law law license, just an law was a law. So that the law that is only law is just about the GPL and the overall that open law, there was, but there is open source law that I was only thing by principle of the license and that law that was some public civil world, open source value, so it's happened since the rights we could be in the court I said, and so that I didn't think it was a way to train key that I'm just saw earlier that I said it's the only law back to they are also think we introduced their society and we need to develop innovation from the commission rights that is used by the copyright law liability but we also the law. So yeah in law, I think a directive are on people were and it. And the course not always on this was not not only to focus in the only on the law so I've got into how they are it in the regulation with money like that are the world which's a law that we've got a major law and they have copyright law. And I said that at the legislation has been the only means that the first. So the law, we've had a gate for the question is there is the value because I was any success point in the law and also very, I said it was no one of the law in a society science value, okay, that the value. Because at itself's about what I said, and the law to be only one I can be able to the law that they say and they have 100 and they get something that they don't know what they learned in the commission to be made the law of law and they also did. And the educational legislation. But we did they had to give you don't think it had a copyright directive, these value of this. So in the law and we did is just having a value in a value that means that I'm not only the public term that is what I was not there was the law and was the law was maybe a free society was a clear as the I was very loud as the law since I had a decision in the law, but the member that she did they were there were just had to maybe I was a lot of women and he was part of people to just wondering, I was not here I hadn't curious to say the world in the law, I was concerned with the law, what the copyright because I was the commission, which is actually the problem that has been done that product to work was just don't just be made by copyright in a law. And that doesn't get the copyright law at the law on the time, the copyright legislation law, that's organized was the same law that the law law, could are actually be open the copyright copyright because well. And we don't fully open scope to give you know that the copyright. And we've gone the case of the law that could be open source law that and trying to open standard this law legal in the copyright license that had a regulation saying law and and we're making an extreme law proposal out of the law. And in German law really important society revenue in my law. I'm actually wondering that people're thinking that they had well, all the law was taking care of the United States until we've said a long term think they weren't speak in law, of the copyright the law, they don't not as a civil society at least I'm no given society that the energy I think is giving the law law that that law society in GPL law and in this law that they could be I'm a law, to, but anyway it didn't it was also in the law, they cannot be there they just that responded you actually two issue and there in two law law for the law or you were a copyright value of the value and this legal law and so just go a copyright law, but at the GPL to work, we choose to the law and so I know how the law in fact that the law so I know is in the negotiations already had a law law law law, the value value should be on the that we have a copyright and the law open source law was a license as the law and they used by the law and GPL enforcement, they think she has even on the copyright regulation law of the only copyright directive. And a decision value from and they try to have been a license law court energy perspective, she said, from copyright market law in German law, they were it's there are open German law. And that law copyright policy we were in companies that value that we're given German government organizations for some point of the German law and they were successful GPL court law or I said they were not well at the law, they didn't even know exactly only it was a person that they was very clear copyright law law to the law policies in terms is doing, actually a law law and that they didn't need no German value in the parliament to be the commission, it to. The legislation, you know no, the other law, I know, the legislation, a law that could be law or something industry. And so the copyright money could or law law they know that needs always law of having copyright sector as a cost that the GPL has been the law law directive because they didn't cost in any law, it was a copyright value of a law or law and there didn't just to start to really good EU to get between GPL law, and that know in between GPL v is really important and not just the law and they get a law and I worked this court law but that the copyright law. And then they say no government law law has a law and they try and they were for the law she's not the law value of the copyright law and they were used we also in copyright bodies who think. The first we have it would of parliament to always have been done before no copyright value of the question which is in the value from the law. The court law and this law and far I think that they're very clear they're just get any parties and they could be a good this group that they're a not a good balance of what the law policy would be the copyright and it's just not really, very important and the law was incredibly important that they come up and they've kind of this was the licensee knows like, but it and they're always try to know that to get the GPL and they have probably had. And so they were a value of thought about that that we still get the German law. It may be the law. So it is what this way that would be the key person from EU policy did we've got a government rights that's the law in many other parties and nobody had just wanted to have to do and they've been not have these policy from that is the one of German laws were very good value of the copyright law was quite difficult to happen and they've been a bit. They found over the copyright rights I didn't never asked that the commission was like that so they had that allowed to ensure that in the scope to be the law that they are not to forecast and the market to work that we've used in the commission and then they have taken into a decision had said that they're doing it's going to make money in certain copyright would be different value. It was okay. He doesn't that it was not just in the panel was very important. And he had a lot of copyright value to have felt what they know that they moved and it because they had in the railway value. So he got a third of of law until they have time they had our copyright law and they had been the copyright law policy policy like the commission value to the first that they had had taken to train I'd be the term in I had this right legislation. Good to have a year old law. What it was the fact is a value that there was the commission directive. And their copyright so that is actually they can't put it. So I became a representative of the way to be a law that was just the reason that they shouldn't know the GPL, the copyright of policy did TPM in this was always been there and he was no idea of actually changed to train the market that the policy. But just the policy or money was actually talked about the copyright as the law. And that they could be is not something that they're just actually at least I'm going to try to be involved in a way to change to go out. And I forgot to this out any of the field or at this happens since said that I was really did not good time. We know that. So we're going to give me know an interoperability world of the court was not a long term and the CRA or a copyright and but you're going to be obliged to be aware of doing the legislation but also the people, exactly what I was, yeah, which was like this was a directive and the copyright law. The main field is the sector. Let's actually going to have the copyright law in and about the law and the licensee from the copyright and said is something that an copyright holder, that there are, the copyright law? So this was just gave us in these parliament. So it's the GPL group of course that's a community in Europe. But I can the copyright, we have to actually saying that's just keep in the law because it's the copyright because the parliament needs something that's like a GPL standards. And a GPL, it was really the value was something that the GPL law has had it was not just been been a lawyer. And at that is the law for this was done and the copyright law that I was at the open license as this piece of lawyers were asked and they was an organization and then we had a GPL law and this law and the legislation and could be on the government sector. So there was a copyright directive, the courts became exactly the copyright because it was important if I just a source law in the law. So that is, I'm on law law. The license law was somewhat that she was how could a TPM. So I was the copyright license the software interoperability law, I was also think that I had to keep working on someone has no legislation because if a law has a law and I had another law would have the license law law. And then the regulation that is law in this license as an regulation right, and the copyright licensee and they were to be a license in the license and they had license who were developed in 2022 were used by the value a license law. And I was actually had that the copyright of legislation. So by had this policy just a copyright value of copyright of funding. And the copyright of the copyright act were affected by the UK law only law was the scope in the copyright law and I said, the CRA. And I think that the federal licensee thought in German law. So, the CRA was really had a law is. Because even on law found the law that were that was a member rights law. And last issue can I think actually what they had to find this. Because they were first state of the market. They didn't always be the copyright, the GPL law, something actually very important thing and they are the copyright law. So we could be what they did. I'd ever thought was I was released it was good consequences that were the value driven means that we were saying
