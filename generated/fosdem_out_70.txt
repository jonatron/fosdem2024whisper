I'm looking to start doing this in the community and I thought we want to speak a lot of this because there with it's an open source community. And I'm just wondering, there's a bunch of a really looked at the first one of BERN has been discussing the data scientist. And it's in Vienna in the Ministry of the University of the first Fose, and an app software and this year I'm going to speak the last year of mine. So I'm a month, who's lots of a university at Fos Europe. And I'm going to the background for 2023, since 2020. I'm from Brussels. And I'm curious, another talk about he is Andrew in 20 years.

I'm supposed to make a very proud of the next six months ago, I will come to be some of some very early year for the last year, which is too many years. I would like I think about all the last month ago. And I'm not going to be, that. And with the first year time the first time is the French working in 2008 and I've got to talk about 10 years ago, but with like in 2018. I'm sure that, it was talking about the first time. And then I was a year. I was Robin, at all of the Netherlands, which is I have to talk working on what was trying to us the co-source and I knew about this year. And the first year talking about the last year I was in 2014, he was very excited to focus. So I was the co-In on the open source where you have been asking people to be doing this day. And I'm going to build. And I don't talk to turn the first question. Okay, I'm going to try to happen. Okay. So I'm going to cover the previous speaker here.

So I'm going to be happy to talk going to what I'm going to talk about how you. The next talk is going to talk about in my talk about how we put a talk about to we have a warm welcome with this speaker. So yeah, first talk about this already working and I'm going to how it to do I'm just about the rest of the next summer with the talk about the right day. Here's going to just wondering, well. I'm going to be talking about the last time is going to talk. We're not sure that we're going to show me. We have my next seven years. It's going to be better if you the story, the first the year. I'm not just going to go on earth. And I'm going to be wondering, okay. And I'm going to talk a lot of my great presentation. I'm going to talk about 100 minutes, but that I'm going to talk to show me. And I'm going to the first video here. We're going to talk, a brief about it's a bit about the presentation in the University of time, which is that we all of an briefly working. We have a super exciting time and we have been waiting at the people who are going to focus of. But I'm going to start the slides, we're going to meet up to go here for the presentation at the last year, the slide. And that we're going to talk about our slide, I'm going to show a little bit of people today and how we have to be a little bit of this talk about the years ago. There's a very popular community was about 20 years ago,000 we had like this year ago at the day, I found some community. And I was trying to have to start talking about the last talk. So this point of what Red Hat version is a year, which I'm not being forgotten the community, I'm glad to talk. We have been working on this six months to be on the first half years ago, we've been a time around 30 years ago, six years ago. So how, I'm a few years ago. The first time we're going to talk about the slides, in the last slide that we're going to find ourselves and we were working on to keep our first time. We took me at the first one was just going to discuss was to see that we were very excited to start back in the next year. We worked on it, which we had almost have a workshop in Copenhagen had before. So I was almost six months ago today. I was a little bit less time to give me. And I was the last year while we didn't know we'd like we could be interested in 2016, okay. So I was a year ago here. So we have a little year, so I think we just a number of the beginning of two years ago, but it's what was a little bit of my day we got a year over again. I had a power over here, and I was like I entered by the baby, and I did was wondering, so I was working on to think we had to make my hand. We had so let's cool, so I had to make this point. We had to get really... And I did quite a little bit. Yeah, also go from five years ago. So I'm making this year, because, yes, yeah, I'm just going to me a little bit for attending me. Sorry, we should be here. No, yeah, what I'm not coming up. It's going to be interesting. 
 Okay, if I did I'm going to talk about that we're going to make the slide. I'm going to talk about this presentation for the first talk. So what we have I'm wondering, we invited to do is we have a talk a few months old speaker. We have the My name of having a lot of the one on my first slide. We have to introduce a good person and I'm going to ask you had to get the demo. I'm going to tell me a little bit of this talk about the next talk in the talk is, and a talk is at the working in the workshop in the day. And we're going to let's going to follow to talk about our main part of our project. We are the world. We've been talking about the speaker here with our back in terms of the years here. So, we have the tech sector in the first step of the Commission recently. We have to be a little bit of the European Commission, so going to be, we have learned about a member of the best-source market, the European Commission, more about us. We were thinking about the team. We had a lot of the world. And we started doing open source team like to talk about the European Commission which was a Drupal had here and we'd like a lot of the company. So we had to try to be sure that had a very different world, and the big thought, the work that was the tragedy of open source community and the technical government services and more in years and society also had more and we want to do some who are talking about the world of our open source and the European Commission, so we're going to share and we are not like to feel like our open source software. So we're going to be able to be talking about the community. And the only open source world, how we're going to improve the reason that we, I know what the US and she's people were about us, there and the open source community of materials that they are really a regulation the work as well for the open source community, they have initially said, and they're going to do not just take care about what I've done to get the whole thing. We'll also heard about that could be really think about the European Commission for that were happy and the number of the issue. So we're getting involved in the sort of the first thing for me and we have the world now and we saw a few months to follow up with us and just having a good time for the panel. And also keep people to get down a long time to be something for us to be just talk. They don't want to dojo. People don't have any other problems, we're just have a few people to do you're looking at the new world, why we're going to make sure. The second question is just this a lot of being a few years ago the panel and there are there is a very important thing that there is that we're very often doing in the work. We're about our beginning of the energy management point, but they should you have done in the software so you can't be a very much of the world. I'm part of the first year, here back to continue to the open source community was the amateur technology. And a long time companies. Now where I would think I just had a work on the free the world. And then I'm going to talk in the world, you'll come to encourage you to be doing money. I'm just wondering what you maybe I'm going to show the last year, but I'm wondering about the years ago, I was going to keep in the first version and then fourth or less than I'm going to be wondering that I'm just wondering, but still I really glad to do not looking ahead of the end up. So it. So I'm going to talk about the first time had to be the tech in the outcome and I'm going to be talking about the definition and a kind of what we also on what I'm going to make it's going to talk about this panel. So I first thing, I'm going to think about the community-the-Fiibility are the software and I'm gonna be that we are very easy because we're going to do want to have enough to download the very happy to work on the product management or so we want to evolve with a lot of the community. So the community, we have an organization. The main project was the work well. And that I do I'm going to talk about the world of the community to ask the talk that we're looking at the software and if you might be the software engineer in the first goal of the world. We need to be part of the project to be made that we thought that have this was about the ecosystem in the point, the CRA was just a really, but I think is to think that we're an community. It's still talking about the last one of the world of the other open source community in the community project that get a lot of the world. But there was a lot of people would be a general in the code and the community started to be in the world of the product and the community to have been and the community right and think that they're there are more people that you know many technical things that people who are not going to talk on the people and there? I had as we want to work on the software and we may try to get heard about the good point of these who are there's just one. And the last
