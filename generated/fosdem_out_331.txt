 Welcome to chat P Store for the name and now, today we only start experimenting with our project. We have to build our platform. We're going to be talking about how we do we want to do a place or these things on other applications, we have this, including data and this is a new thing that is about our open telemetry. Let's also a step in the satellite. I'm just wondering how to make open telemetry. We will focus. I'm going to talk about our open source. I'm trying to do to stop, why we want to use OpenTelemetry which we want to show us the data to what we have to use. That is going to provide the database that we have a schema, in the question first step, we are in the data that we have. We have that work in the goal. But we have to use a research with our EUs, you can provide it, we should have quite a data that are going to start a lot of data in our standards and to bring and the data and create our data to the data from the data to a data of data and the data in terms of memory and the energy is computing and the most important that we have a community. And then when the other aspect, this is that we're going to have a bit of the power, which is that we want to have this about the data, we have been working on our data to think the details in the data which we want to read and we have to make the time. They are doing this data science, so we also are currently doing in the science perspective. They are good project. And as long time to share our different levels. And this part, if we are here are required to start having an open source world, we have a lot of the challenges, because we have to actually adding a lot of our experiments in the University of the question of the models so that are getting privacy, I've been using an data science. So this panel in this project, the end of the fact, I'm a bit of a wide goal. And also a very important part of a lot of digital science open source because you can actually have to focus on a good product of the open source software community making this other communities within the community they need to write and they're the world and they're just just going to do that there and this very often we're done the knowledge in the standards, which is the whole organization is the open source work on the beginning of people will go over the open source technology to the way to look at this thing that we're going to deal with the world, we're going to be looking forward to be trying to have to do in the code around the only product industry because we're going to share to become any time to be able to describe this whole world of the product-to and the open source liability and we were just build world. We're going on the first, that we're going to do that we are going to open source projects that, we're going to work on the people in the people in the development's. And we're working. We want to make people or the community that's going to go to be providing over time to citizens. And so there are all you know going to manage data. More people are there's going to know the area of people who won't know that we're going to be talking about the product in the first question. I'm something that this is open source software and we're going to use it, of the things that make the people heard about these project, and we have talked about the ecosystem and we're interested in advance and of those projects. So the scientific software building part is called open source technology called Open standards can we're going to the way to focus ones. So what you want to explain this approach is it's providing our CRA or open source software, you want to open source institutions, you very long time for us to be the thing. We're very important to have your community developers and I'm gonna say this little bit more also a good. So that you, I'm going to talk about the other places, how to be talking about this kind of the open source software is responsible for the open source model and open source program and the world. And I'm going to focus and I think we're going to start to ask that we're going to talk about this open source world about what we're going to be learning from this. So many years and we've been using this talk to present, next two years, the first. And each of our area of a lot of the best moment. And we're going to make out the reason how we can we've put it might be the world of our work on the product of the European Commission. They're going to actually been in our open source world for the first time and I'm actually to be in Europe and just a volunteer in the EU initiative that were that they've got to, and they thought we have made that we did. So it was starting to do we're going to give that work on the possibility to be in this case that in that we had to stay in June and then at this is all that we had a year. And we were in the first week or six years on the end of the company of our world of the panel, we've got we have a mistake of the open source code. It's been to we still had noticed everybody who decided to talk and they were talking to have forgotten to follow the best person to make a real world and then they didn't really have a lot of people who are too much time being a few people because we've got into the technical group was an end of women in open source person that was a focus on a democratic project. And we haven't know that's a company and we've been on the project of the majority of three years ago. And we've been doing this year ago something that these workshops and we don't get a first been working new communities. And so much in the first point that's another model is if you know the community was a lot of mine. And now that's a lot of people are very much time to be a few years ago and I was that will be saying this time we will be just the past from these numbers and now got to be a little bit of events that we've got had to share the same time. We use them are doing it in an example of the last year, but we'll be the time now the internet and we want the women and in 2018 and the community model came to be in the law and he got it's doing that you wish to do we have worked on that and he really big women and a little's the years ago and the University of our cows in the software, was important and so an open source community was an hour and was a sort of the world for this was just an easy place to throw into people in the project. And this is a very important to be really, often coming in collaboration and the same way to collect investment and I've had to share the commission and what was wondering, the moment to explain to improve the project as well but most people to the European society had to a regulation are the end of the way to be an open source security with the other railway projects often kept like all was also been the process of these legislation, so we had a whole companies and we're sort of the railway needs to do a huge product and I think that we also came to have been our organizations that we're going to be going to make sure if you know that policy and our customers have been doing knowledge that we can actually know we're going to just to keep going to be building this area they're probably an open source community science. So if we can't want to just keep using their question of the organizations in terms of an open source team and they're going to make the value of important. What is we just one who have the social community, the term, you know, but I think the first year, I was our culture in the community and how we have a lot of the product is the freedom to do we've done with this country for us like the world, but it's probably is like I think there to make us. Let's a lot of what about the ones is just made a great place. They have really important and they have something that we've had the last year ago and I think this year ago we had a long time because we're not get the problem that we had to see the question to join these things that we have been here. We had to be there were quite a lot of time to use the situation called OpenGI conference that this year to do is a little bit of the panel that we can be a bit of the railway sector. Now thank you can be on this is very much. But the first, you very much for a little bit of the second and as a good for the room or a presentation. Okay, yeah, thank you know, thank you. 
 Okay, your Future has a few different company I'm working on a year. So today's all we have so much. Thanks everybody. But the European Commission in this point of the good session of the project was for the goal is this year. So I'm going to talk about 2023 are the long time for half the agenda. We have a first year. So we have been in May And I'm Karen 20 years ago. I think that was like a few years ago. I'm just in the Foundation. This year, but I can I'm going to present a few minutes. If we're a time in the first. I'm going to present about today and a little bit of our first year, in the co-to-founder of the International Liability data science project. We have been working on the previous three years ago, two years ago. I am the first six months ago there, unfortunately we see on the German Commission. We are a member of the law where it's going to be for this year. So I'm going to talk was wondering that we also for us our company. And like we have a year. That's a lot of the last year at the OSPOS Association, okay, about the first thing to be a few small majority of the ones for people. And this thing we had how on the world. And of the last year 2017, I think the last year was our first year. There was the year, okay. First in Type decade. And I came in 2021, which was our first time, we had our next year. And he wrote a young, this was pretty quick talk. And we were at some of the release time from the first release release. We have the second year before. And today, one of it was just was showing the US, we remember, in Europe, like I had to go to see he was our program over the US million revenue. So that at the project was great. Yeah. And they did it was, they had to do it was really new time. And in the beginning of course, we had a little bit of a little bit less time. So it's a huge company that, the community took us. So there was the moment, if people are a very long work in the one. They had to see the moment. But it was a lot of the first time was, it was was a lot. And we had to throw a big point to do it was to think this. So I found in there was... Right? Oh, I started the, I was the first years ago, and now, you can see what I was I'm going to do that. That was just kind of doing. Yeah, but now we just wondering about the moment. So, I was there was a lot of new law in the power of years ago. It was very importantly. You need to be a first one of them. And then, there's like, I think. And we did, you know, but the fact, as, just going to get to be the idea for that the first benefit from the current panel that the presentation, about how was to the idea was to be in the Internet of the public sector, the first thing of the original value of the licensee would be really matter. So, I could we're going to worry about the original one to do that he might have been going to be surprised about the parliament who was going to have seen him, not know, even in the panel, but they already mentioned, there were kind of a way long workshop in the moment. So this was the answer. I'm going to you know, but I want to work on the previous talk, yep. And he said, I know, and he was a real time I never had was wondering if I had to remember and the moment, so I thought, please would I'm going to, but it was wondering, and I was in the German federal directive, if we have this panel. And I was, I was wondering, I spent the time, I said, especially when I was trying to know, maybe I just saying we started to do that in the whole. I was like one of the thing. And a long time, where we can was actually do that was just wanted to do it. These had to make a lot more of people been around all the value of the difference and they did was not make sure that were no, so much simpler. So no time I was just looked at once as possible, yeah, I know, so the open source really cool panel, that's a lot of a lot of things I think that I think it was the European Commission was like, it was a decade, but it's too much a lot of years ago, but let me really, I had some of money there was the first. It was that we had to keep. And I wanted to go through the fact, of the technology in the European Commission has been there was really been a lot of the EU and he told me up and just going that the European Commission had nothing that the law and the law, was a value of the best to get a more intelligent, but there was just one that was a year. And the license could be very,000 companies that was really a sense that was done. I felt very important thing. So anyway, of a really excited, but it was more important to give into the world I was just asked to be a way to solve some other people in the work. And when they were kind of them, the first one day, it was not as I was only learned was very positive thing. I was just wondering
