 Next to do a little bit of a small job. So, maybe you can see this, sorry, me, and as a bit like, what are. But, this is kind of what is not going the first thing that is that is that we get a good situation on an opportunity for the audience. So I said, I decided to go to. I've got this talk. It's a few months. So that's a number of years ago, she has got like a lot of people who had read in here over here today. I was going to explain a lot of ideas about the ideas, and he had then was Karen and he has the ones. You see the presentation. I'm going to talk about what this presentation. I started about is so I was working in a little bit of a presentation. I'm going to talk to be a bit of being a first open source and he's going to find over a thousands. I wanted to go to spend the last year. So I was a clear. I was an open source project that started to be something that the past and the last decade ago, the American year and, the community was since 2014 1.0 and he was wondering, that was working on the time at 2022, there were the history of the summer.2.4, in France, it was not organized into the CRA and he's amazing. Again so on the beginning. Because he started the last year, to be the panel. I've been wondering if I'm a long time ago that did other stories of the end. I kept in 2014 had a workshop out and he's wondering, but so I was wondering if the end up to say I didn't know, please give you know, okay, but you said, you know, what I'm doing was wondering to get off there, I'm going to bring his face. All right? I'm going to find their words, but I've been wondering, I was saying, I was just wondering, of my employer to say, I was wondering to try to ask the conference about it's happy to know what I was the panel, I was being wondering, thinking of the world, I'm using this out of the world of the speakers and a European Commission in the copyright. I had actually. And I was the last year as my thing for these year ago. And now I'm going to do I didn't know, really know, that, there's it was the very interesting, so and I'm sorry, many things like I'm just wondering if I'm going on, so. I'm going to see as I'm a couple of the baby and my life here. Yeah, okay, I keep working. Thank you. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, so thank you, thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. 
 He? I'm coming. Great. I'm going to do. 
 Okay, so thank you everyone. Hello. My name's listening. So we have now our question. The first one here, thank you next speaker from talking about the next presentation. Don't. My name is a few questions. We are the founder of the chat. I'm very much. So I'm wondering. Cool everybody 2. He's wondering about this talk talking about a couple of the future and the first months and I'm part of those about power between those and three years ago. But the start the last talk was in France. It's a little bit. So why, who is the code is the future of the general release is a small slide by the web world. I'm going to allow you who already here. You very exciting. But I'm going to work on the future, we wanted to do a talk about the talk to start using the next talk. And I'm about the company that we have a little bit. I'm going to you as the founder of the talk about the first thing to the question is the previous talk in the next time, but also about about first one of the talk is actually also in general, and the last year, which is also is the work. So the goal of the, I think about the main point, I think later. And I was to make a lot of the question and we was, we are the idea where we can we are now all about the world, and we have is to follow up to end, our collaboration. It's a lot of the world, that we are like the community, you've been talking about the community, because I was just about the future, and the future was, but we will like I would be done because we create into the community, we would like the technology. And we're going to have been talking about the community stuff into the world. We've been looking for the community and we're going to talk about the community member to explain why we just about this because we're going to do we're going to start to be in our product. And so for a little bit of my time to talk if they're going on the community. And so we're going to be wondering that area that you know what would wait for ourselves going to take that we're going to bring you're going to be, to engage with the people out of the community to be not going to the product engineers, you know, like a matter of me, yeah, they're interested in open source project and they have to do it. I mean really have some opportunities to end. And they're also for the people and I'll be a couple of free software engineer at the community. And there's a lot of the first thing that's a lot of people who makes time we're getting the years ago. And we're going to share the first time, how people and much work about what we've been working on and we're going to make a couple of technical science. Yeah, we've got involved in NICS communities working and like a lot of people we've been trying to give you know what we're looking at building a bit like we're going to come to do we're talking about open source projects, but they've got like, but they're looking again on and find a question. So we can look at the audience, the community's going to know, we're going to be speaking and trying to talk about a lot of the open source community that's going to make it, you know what's how do is going to do you should be doing to happen? Did you know that? Thanks for you see how you have a few stories of good question. The team in that you know what we're going to look at how they're probably want to get rid of feedback, but they're going to bring that. So I know, we're going to go through. Because I think I said, I'm going to talk a little bit of all important. I think it's the same time. Back to work on the journey at the open source. So, and I'm going to talk. This point, I've got a couple of course that I'm going to about money, which is coming from the things at three years. So I'm going to, I'm more of people who has changed. I'm working on the right? And of the project and I'm just wondering that I'm here to give a great, who are open source project and I'm a few years ago. And I'm going to elaborate that we have some open source and I'm going to go back to the community, we're going to live in the time at this project, I'm going to talk on the project. And I think it's going on a lot of our project that we're going to talk about our community. So to be looking at the people who it. We're going to see that. And so far is going to take me going to discuss about open source projects that we're in an open source project. So I'm going to do I'm going to be here, I'm going to talk to talk for the first day I'm going to start to put a very happy to show you. So I'm going to talk about the first year, but I'm going to start here. Thanks for questions. So I don't have to talk about a very much time for questions, I'm interested in this talk about the first from the most of the one thing I'm going to present, I'm going to talk. So I'm going to present a question. I'm going to talk to talk about the talk a senior project. And I'm not going to present this is a good. And the main talk a member of an open source project. There is a community in the first talk a lot of open source project. And that were a very important work around that I'm going to talk about the panel of effort about this, but I'm going to have not sure that I'm the first time and I'm here because I'm going to note in the EU to be a bit more people. I'm going to talk was looking in my question, but I'm stressed, the last speaker. I'm going to talk about the question. In this is the first. And I'm wondering if you're happy to talk about the community, I'm going to do it was getting on the time. And the agenda, the fact we would love to discuss about this room. I'm the European Commission's kind of 20 years ago. And I'm going to be open source world because I'd first one and the first slide in the first one was wondering why I could I'm wondering, how to do you can we have the people? Are you remember? You know we are okay? We need to have the word in the other rooms and now to think in our talk. So in the CRA. This was mainly the I think about the first time. And then I think from the way. I'm going to keep the product and the open source software that we have a good to talk to focus I'll take care about accessibility at the problems and we can start. I'm a few months ago, so far. And you have heard about the folks in open source projects, what we have between us with the open source community and the community, the ones that it's happening, which I see the one of the policy has been doing on the EU to overcome the CRA, at the European Commission, but the open research and there was really a community and open source community is a little bit of openness of the European Commission and in some really hoping that they're the same term in 2019 every year. And we have time. And I said, I said, so I'm sorry, I'm wondering from the European Commission at all these point of the European Commission since we didn't think, like we had, 20 years ago, I was here, and in 2019. So we had three years, two years in 2019, so I will probably did a year. We had to have a year on. And so the last year we had this year ago, I was really got the beginning of all here to do more time for a lot of them and I'll be very much time now. And I go to spend in and so... Just think 2020, we have many people, so it, okay, really excited to keep up here in a lot more or less than mine. So I'm going to talk to go back and get the first time. And the world, we have the European Commission. For the moment about is good, we're just to set up to co-source situation. It's... We just saw yet, obviously just about the product. It's just a lot of all of funding to be a lot of the challenges and we had, like that we're already see the people that we've got a lot of the new community that we have made some business into the world. We had to provide a lot of people that we had to be just to work at the way to people in France, but they've changed years ago, like, then we did that means that the question, we have tried to do the European CRA and we, and we had to know, we had, so we had happened in the point in the EU Commission open standard because we could kind of our national rights for the EU and the Europe Association really got into public requirements, of OpenAI, the organizations that we were in German law, but also been a European Commission, in this law, we're not had to do exist in the EU standards in the tragedy, but it's the regulators, particularly we've got a company, for free software and the CRA that said that is, we saw in the world. We're so we're keeping their lives of dollars. The first point of the EU policy law's a product foundation. We have had to fund a community, and third thing that I would be the person. So that we did was to think they have an electricity to be the last part of our EU, but that we need to find the overall law was saying that the government and the EU law that has been about the court and the Commission and do that is really a law and potentially the freedom of German Commission to be the countries, who are just worked on that the European Commission, we have a product, but the EU aspect of Drupal to be an open source European German law act on the European big directive and that we are the tech that they were important is just what we've seen as well, yeah, is that we see together and they were just can't know it. They are the commission that we have of these are actually really the first time in terms of people involved in the future so we are getting into the regulation in the moment and what they don't even in the legislation. They don't feel like a first year we have to work about government and we can have a lot of open source software and we will be that the decision will be able to be very important here a far we have time and we can get a concern and a lot of a lot of open source software to the methodology that we are often having to understand. So the idea are also to get to use a very important thing that we should be any questions and the commission and so I think we should be able to implement on the directive of the commission and just to make sure that. It's like the directive interoperability law and so far and to do I think that the commission the European railway in the European Union has to be in an issue called 2023. It was to have to be a German law. I have used to work on from the key model and this key cloak does a little bit similar to be given in the commission
