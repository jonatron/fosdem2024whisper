 Welcome everyone here in the University of Asia. And if you're starting to introduce more about it. And the same thing that you call Jupos? That's the same time. And then I'm just going to explain what about. So this. Or the highest talk is why I'm going to make the LLM have a lot of more? So, this is the thing, of what you need to use it? You're coming in front of building, you have an example the problem. You've got into the LLM? This is what you can write with another event. You know I'm going to be the next. You can see that you can also the size of the other thing that you just like one. You can see a good thing is in the topic. I'm going to look into how the future. I'm going to show is that I'm going to do if you. Let's talk about the way to talk about the LLM of me back quickly. I'm going to use the error. I'm going to be using this. I'm saying I'm going to try to be going to work that. And finally have a lot of years ago, we have a lot of of things. It's a lot of ideas that something that are the most of things at your API. I'm good people, but we have a very happy to do we could we only say that in fact that the end up here is a bit more details about how the web API was the API, in the Java code. So you can I'm going to do you about the interface to talk about writing code that it and this program or not going to show you see the main code. I will put it and see if I'm going to talk to keep going to really a bit of the world. I think about it is the first-source code. So in the idea I'm going to start being sure we need to do a lot of this context here to do not the product perspective, but this the tools that we have been using a little bit of the building, which is the big. We have a bit of a lot of the other people in the models are currently have a challenge for the future. The problem in the world is a good. The question. And finally, that we need to mention what we don't have is coming to make it to make people a limited to support to be a new needs to the source code. I think. It's going to be made it can't going to work, I've been creating code base projects that we need to think it has a project, we are going to, we have, we're going to work on and we're hoping to have a lot of the product. We've been talking about that there are seeing the ones that we have a good in a couple of a large community. And the challenges that would need to make a lot of people who can we need to get down here. In the most importantly, you know OpenJDK. What we have any person about the fact, the world? Well, this research version of the OpenJDK, the project. And this is, this state because we've been using what we've got a project and how many other product is sort of people who are at this kind of what we're here and it's fine and the companies are there kind of like do already involved. So we know, we have this, we have a specific for our software and I don't know, but we're going to have to start with the AI and what you here's the knowledge about their own tech team and we have to be doing and then we're just make a software and we have this in this question. We have a situation. It's, this talk. We'll be a very good question. And we're going to I'm a lot of the idea of people. We have a lot of a very nice question. And so because the best to make this is if you think it means that you're doing this issue that you need to find of you're going to do, you know that. And when you know, you get a lot of way you can get to know, you can, for that you know, you can see that, they're going to figure out how they're not going to think they're doing them together and the software, the good part of society. And people, they're going to be done people about people. And therefore you know, you're just give you're going to ask a technical things, we have someone who are going to open source out at a very, but the, we go to make it's great and then there's going to do the world that. And in there's going to focus that we're going to say I'm going to be a little bit of what they're going to want to be there. Outreachy's going to be, we're going to be talking about that we are looking at one, we're talking about is that, but he's about just very important that's going to do think that in the second. But the talk was just going to continue to try to make a lot of the question. It's going to focus on the question. And so much as we have a couple of the people who come out in. I think we have the next time to I think that, so many people have time on the technical people in the developer, but you know. We're just looking over to get a strong. I know that, but that they are as a little bit of some questions that we're having a much as a very little bit, I would like we were getting more at a community, and the reasons, but we just wondering there a lot of the number of people who was some people. I'm going to see one that the community was the first year. And so much, we're really been showing me at the first day and I'm going to try to be, how our first person who had time, if you know that you want to do we actually get open source software. So that can try to be in time is an example, because I'm just interested in this is like, we've been happy to build collaboration? No, I think that. I'll be talking about the open source community, I'm going to introduce people, like this, we're wondering. That was trying to contribute to share the last year here and I think you're just a couple more and I'm going to do what I'm not a few years and I'm some people who's going to be talking about the I'm someone interested in the moment and I'm in the end of the right thing I'm going to see here. I'm just wondering. So now I'm the moment. I'm not a welcome. I'm going to share my talk to be wondering. I talk about the best tech of some questions? I'm going to talk about me about the very happy to you are able to talk about the Mozilla people that? And I'm like I'm wondering. So I'm the last year. So I'm a few questions, so all? I'm going to go ahead of you so I've been wondering the EU, we've been working with the world and I'm going to start to have to be I'm going to talk about the open source community where I'm going to talk and so let's going to talk about the future. I'm going to be the University of the last year, I'm out as I'm going to talk about a couple of the speakers and an open source community that I'm going to talk about the end of women and they will be looking at the first iteration of the most of the decision in this to learn the community. Because I'm going to try to be in the EU last year ago, something they're going to do not going on the day. So we did I'm pretty next one of Out'clock a lot of that the last year I'm going to keep a lot of people, just wondering that people who got really got the idea for the first thing in a thing. And I'm wondering, that I'm just had to present the way of the question. So, if I'm going to show that I'm hoping to read over here, there, I was telling me here. So we're going to be looking at the other people in the start doing the hallway, and we, I'm going to talk about the first sentence. I'm going to speak to go to be wondering. How would we're going to me. I'm going to add an example of the speakers from the moment. And I'm going to talk to tell I am you to be talking about running in the first year. I'm going to start to start using this year, I'm just wondering, I'm just wondering, so I'm going to share the room. I'm not going to go. I'm going to see my blog because I will see the end to be talking about doing a little bit of the answer to talk about how you talk. So thank you are going to the next time, I'm showing that are a big focus on the audience, right? Okay. I'm going to continue on the talk. So I'm going to be talking to cover the room. I'm going to give you going to create this talk about the name is quite a little bit exactly. I think this is a long time to be much. I'm going to give a presentation. In fact that I'm going to work on this screenshot up to talk. And I'm going to talk, let me a web and I've got one of the end to use the browser as a project, but I think it to really important. And so I think about the last and I'm here is a real time. I'm going to introduce us to go to talk about a few months ago. So now I'm a little bit more in the people here. So I'm working on the first version of the project engineer. So this is called Andrew. And I know, I'm going to be not supporting. And I'm looking at the top of the open source community engineer at least I'm going to be a little bit of the foundation that, a bit of a little bit more important if I'm going to do some other people to think I'm going to keep watching on those things I'm doing work around in the other people from the panel faces. And I'm looking back at a lot of the community and I'm going to try to start from the talk about six months. I'm going to say, more people in the talk to focus on the fact that were looking at the next year. So I'm just wondering when I'm going to tell you're going to see there is that a lot of applause for a lot of people who's going to talk to be going to talk about what I'm going to talk about it, an hour to be the people to repeat the big point. And I'm hoping to come to find the world. And I'm going to talk about how many people that the people are the beginning. And I'm going to take care about the time, she's kind of money. We have to ask what's going to keep doing the problems here where I'll be interested, I'm going to give you want to acknowledge that we're going to ask for a lot of the whole and the way they're going to do that. I'm going to show some of accessibility. That's going to be a lot of a lot of people just wondering and what we're going to show the community that. And so far when the talk bit more people and we're going to talk about very happy to tell you why we're asking people who's going to present in the people. So we're going to make the team who we're going to go back to that we want to try to this. And I'm going to have a little bit of the conference is going to try to finish doing this. So that we're going to show me. So what we've got from the whole little bit of us. So I'm going to give a little little bit of my heart of the new app and what we're going to be trying to be open source work on the community technology is the open source project was something that is like a great project you're trying to be able to get into the company and I think that are going to get on. But the people talking about the foundation of the software projects in the community companies and open source software was, the source and the community came out and had said, although they're the most of the community. And they are a lot of the people in that product, the fact that that the open source product and they're going to be more people who's going to talk, to, I took over time to be just learned that they were funding and. I'm going to look at some opportunities and they're going to do this, find a chance to bring a really passionate of the world. And they're like, like you know, but there's like they think there are you know, they are us funding to do have the right? And that we are a lot of open source software and we like they're trying to do their work together in the years of the world community companies and are going to find out because they have like I know, right and they have at the WordPress projects are the research and they know people in the community, but they are you know, they know what they have? They also talked about we think of the product, but they are, right, right? And that's why they have to have a community and they're going to be talking about their community science. But I know, I think I think if people and really think I know, yeah, you know, when you know, for these companies want to have I think that we also why they just mean, a good tech and we do they really think everybody who're here in the last year because I think we're one of the open source product practices to get a free on the European organizations and open source community, but then out the people, we don't have to know to apply the world because they are like, they're talking to follow the companies, but they can be able to think, right, right, everything, so the end-host as well, so they're a first person, like the right, then they're coming the big sort of the companies and they're going to make in the value to work within a value of money. So they're all of the open source, they're, is kind of the European Commission in the open
