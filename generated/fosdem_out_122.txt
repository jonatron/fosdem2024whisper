 So we are going to get that. So we had one to say, hello, we saw this is basically in the top, hello and join us and introduce a very long time. And now, so I could like, like, the speakers, but I'll have this, hey, this, really interesting. I'm going to go back to us this, a little bit of a little bit of a lot of things on and say, we've got into an application that we have a bit about this. It might be a new one that it. So I would like to do this, we're going to jump to you know, like this. So I want to talk about having a new thing that we've got any questions, there's a little bit more more information that I'm using that we have to figure out what we have had to generate a lot of thing to implement and of things and then we can do that we've got one. And then we had to create a few other questions on our talk through the next thing we have all this. And this is like an application to make it what does is it work and a sort of a separate thing that this kind of sort of language, but I've been trying to do. We're going to be speaking about how they're thinking about a little bit into a lot of a lot of things that they're having files that we're going to run that they're going to build with a lot of the whole building and then we want to get the structure. But for example of that we're going to do of your LLM project kind of our cluster are going to be a very interesting thing that this because we're going to make it's a way to support for free and we built-based tools that we don't want to find a single tool and there. So here is that's a lot of an open open source is a lot of time to ask you can be any other questions and we want this that we can we have fun talk about this kind of interesting steps. So we also encourage us because we need to integrate our front end, okay. So we want to build a little bit of our examples of our new tools. So we want to have to create a template, we, which we want to build a project. So we need to do some other what we need to make sure that we also have seen that we have some work and open source code so we need to be able to have also need to deploy it at the source code for our community and then I think that when we also we want to implement our community of their community is done as well. However, we all the last year. We need to have a lot before we want to provide good practices for the team and now have to have some people who are trying to work at the community projects and then also for our communities. That's a lot of people to go for having a lot of our experience in our skills, but we can improve the people. So we probably think we have a big thing that can be better into a community. Are it's okay? Thank you you very much. Thank you.

 Hello. I'm Simon, first talk. Thank you for coming, everyone. Our name is Welcome. Thank you. Thank we have a few lightning talk about those the very much. I'm going to talk about the thank you for the challenges. Thank you for this talk for our first talk we are already want to speak a project and talks on the previous talk, and one of the first one we are the main talk is our name about it is an open source code has been working. So I am I'm going to try to talk today. In Brussels. I'm the first one. I am I'm a time, as I about the name of the new talk is an end, because we have the previous talk about the last year back in the most of the slides and we wanted to put over the workshop, and we started. We also have some of the years ago. So I've been open source code of the time for these two years ago we're all are going to keep getting involved in the things. So I was going to be. We're going to talk about the people in the whole lot about the community and the community. And I'm going to talk, I'm going to talk about the main point in the ones. Let's going to talk about accessibility. Thanks everyone's talk about how we have been doing the talk about the first of the audience that we're going to be going to be very early Commission, very often we're going to ship across the good idea of the reasons. And I'm going to be the big. I'm going to talk was going to really a little bit about about the last year. And for the community was a bit to talk about the last year. I was like to the technical point is about the number of the community and we've been asking a year ago for the most of the years ago, so much energy transport projects, they had a time long time in the Swiss open source software as well, but we do I said, I'm going to talk about all as well, mainly in the EU agencies. We have a lot of the organizations into these organizations, right? Like we're looking into the EU institutions to have moved to use for 20 billion revenue. But I'm not talking about the national science from the impact how much time we're doing the community and we have changed and the market. We have about the world and we are going to be a lot of legislation. And so we're also the world open source law, in the legislation that is that open standards and is called the open source world is the time that the European law in the digital America Europe and and the next product infrastructure was very important and the definition of the European Commission, open standards as the world, it was successful software Association is important in the end of companies has been with a law there is that we're a global open source world for software. And we saw in regulation for the company. And so long-GI because we can be able to give us to this time to have a small economic model and the third party and how they're a researcher at the community and the CRA has been a full time from Europe and they did we see you guys in a million companies in more people from the city institutions and they are thinking. And they brought into the EU model in Europe co-jmic technology. And then the second person that's my open source organization is a few weeks or we want to discuss in the first point of a lot of the idea and open federal tragedy of open source law, open source rights in January, their science. And so I said that we had and a free world, in that's what the other people get from the community and so that we are very happy to make it's a bit of money. It's the world. We always really clear to be a lot of legislation, but it's very often the time. And the future in the product. So that I'm not just going to me. So for the world, we're going to be shown the moment. And then we also in that's, you a great, right? So the Commission is what I can we have heard the fact, what I haven't recommend. I think in the moment. And this year I just two weeks ago, where we call was wondering, I was thinking, okay, how this because we're pretty quickly up here, but I was the open source software came to remember in the whole world. And I had this year ago, I started doing a year. And I was Robin, I said you know, this time, I was this year. And then I was trying to actually going to have to start about all of the time. The last year, what I had a bit of the panel was, we had to see here. So we had to use to have to do for the European Commission had a couple of the whole bunch of women that were the current world. And this year, I was the EUs. But as I'm going to give an interesting is from the CRA, there was actually going to talk about the first year. And I kind of the Commission, I was very happy to give the main organizations to me me a lot of the CRA in the time to be a lot of a very good thing's like many years ago. So the community at those challenges, of the commission and I was asked about the European Commission in the Foundation. So the EU we also that we have been working through a huge tech time and I was not doing something with the Drupal Association to say a minute, so then the EU institutions were wondering about their electricity and she was actually. And I started a few months to do I knew before. And I was kind of an end of this point of a long time bit more important because the first one was to move to the most of the commission and that was published together to take a given to do the commission and was to the issue that had was actually was the commission, was not just a lot of the European Commission in the day, I had to continue and the PLFs of the law that community had a world. So we've was, which had some energy software foundation and the software had to open source community and I was just released the digital AI technology but maybe to work, but just had a software in the civil society and I was an expert to be a long. Why would come up to people on the EU I was looking at the standards. I was a lot of the way to be able to solve this year ago, I'm Robin was wondering, and doing this year old year. So the last year. He was very good because and all of the first speaker was just a little bit of free world, I always the last slide, I was doing Drupal to start. I can be a little bit of the EU PLD 20 years ago I've got to be a little bit of being, I was in the European Commission. And we had so, I was not happy to talk about the world that he was having went off and he was a little bit of just really kept going to be like a lot of the software who had to start with this year to a few months ago. And I was to look at the first two years old elections and then we had this year, the projects to start and I remember the workshops, this year, who had a few different community was in the main talk was done in June last year and we were a really getting a lot of the big point the other projects and we had. And I was just wondering after the law to see the last year. So basically, if we couldn't have a number of how to go into this was kind of women to be very big thought that he took the last year, we were using to basically taking a little more people could we were trying to look into a lot of person who knew a few years ago, at how can get a while so much better and now. So, and so that's a law. We did we haven't know what we say right now. And before that. So, how, our problem is the world of all these words, we think we support on being understood and we are trying to get started talking about the best-head and the CRA was that we are only want to get started that the end and I'm going to this was going to be going to be a good to take care about the people, but we had this during four years ago and they made us to have been doing our community and time. And it's why I mean we just sort of people to move to be very quickly. And we had to open source at the only reason until the foundation because we got, we have the last year ago. And we get started to them back later on the idea to you had to the first. So the other one thing is an OpenAI. Today, it's a whole project that kind of the most important part of the whole picture, very well, the community. And just our community like, okay, hey, no, yes, an, this was not the first year. And that is like, there. And actually the last year, it was a year. And what is so it is the future, yeah, when you know, you think, we already have some people from the best of the future and the source, the whole thing that have to kind of the world. So there's the first of thing was a little bit of a little bit of what I had to get the reasons that it was really needed to follow and after that we've got the people from these words when we had a new product that we used to do this and how long time you've been doing this was actually don't kind of the best to work. The only a bit. And the benefit is to also for the right now we have ever talked about the whole thing that we have to do is the people into our things. We have been a lot of the source right now not you've got a lot of people and then make a little bit of people, but they want to work on their open source and they have skills. You're now have to have their lives of that sort of the project. And you know, you've got really good thing you know, if you know, most of problems. And in the whole program, this is that I think, I know, I could be a couple of the fact that is a lot of these things that the process of these companies are right? So I'm really, right? The developer, I'm a lot of this really difficult to see what
