 Welcome to open telemetry on-ups, and I'm not sure that a huge matter. I'm wondering. I'm the first. I'm going to keep a bit more than just wondering about the slide. I'm just wondering. I'm just wondering what we, maybe try to look at the moment. I know what I'm going to start me but I'm not wondering, I'm going to be talking about how to make it better. I'm going to say, okay, so I'm going to be wondering, thank you very much for your 
 Okay, hello everybody. We'm Robin, I love this morning that. Thank you. Hello everybody. Have you ready to talk about the name. We are a talk who have a co-Fi here. So thank you very much. I'm just going to talk a talk in. How do you have some open source? So I'm I'm going to like I'm going to speak, what you a little introduction about how they want to me a different talk about about the first. Okay, I'm going to talk about what I'm going to be going to talk to be thinking about what I'm being thinking about in the right? So I'm actually going to talk about how we did we need to be a little bit about what I'm a bit about this at the language to mention that we do, but it's not just going to provide you don't really start with this, if we have a bit more low level, not just be very good and sometimes you get the world, you to start's a lot of the situation, we have been doing something that. So the last year we have been focusing on one of the goal is that there's why we have time. I'm going to show you. Thanks. I am going to start with this in the whole slide because you. So this question you is the talk is about the answer the beginning of the best job is like this question to just a human standard. So to the question was something. The first thing that I have it was. I'm just trying to the I'm not going to be going to do, this. And it's at the last presentation of the question was I'm going to build of all the last year? How I'm working on the years. The first talk is there was right here in the time to see what we are working on the future. The most years before we had something like, which is done by the power of the first one of the next year, so on 100% of 1% of the years ago, but we are the years ago we have started working on the same time, which is still work on the world. So that's our first one of the third, we have was trying to have one that the time to implement the future. Because this, we need to do some of the software to be able to use cases. One, we want to have some people to mean, I'm sorry. We'll be able to have a better but the question, we have to do we have to have the communication. So I think I said we have heard about three is a lot of the next-prem work with several steps. How much on. Here we have been doing the session-wise with the main year. We have been using to say we have a new product, but I think we are a lot of the ones and we do that we have another one. We have to have to go to have the challenges this work on the time to a good question that we just for us working with us for the question. We have. We have the future and we have the future and for the community. So I think we want to do we want to understand the company and we are thinking about open source world and we need to work in more people to have the rest of all the project. And we want to get the world here about this talk about the first one of our back in the first part of being a lot of the question is the question we were the communities. And if we were mostly got mentioned earlier when we have a huge talk of our own market. So we had some people just, there we have to pay off of the community. So this point on the future. We have not tested the product community community and we have been seeing the next. We have been done this year. But I found that was just all of the world. And we were able to our software software working by these months ago. And we have been working in the project that would be a part of the world at a lot of Germany. And we have a lot of time that we found that we had to keep on the time and we did anything that we have seen to have been able to work in the development. We tried to work on the last year, we had a second. So the workshop we had for the new community towards the last year I was the community. We decided to have been released-term and so we wanted to have a few years. We don't have some people who cannot be involved in and we just went in the world. We have that we know when we had to get around the technology when we said exactly a couple of Open society and we have to work at the product and how we were the world. And the point, so we've realized more organizations are looking over or the beginning of the time of the European sector in the world how we take over the open source in France and we've been using the end of the US policy we've been trying to present here, so okay, we did we wanted to collaborate and want to look at the end up. We're going to turn the city from the time and we didn't have some European Commission, it to call the world. They were responsible forward to see the way that he's my first of the world that was wondering that we had this. And they had, I said, we had a good point to people had a lot of a lot of time time more and so we can see six months. It's one, then we can we're trying to get a lot of people that we've got the whole area of money to make a few people already wrote the community with us and the community that we actually I took us on the organization who were doing the European Commission and so we're doing a huge initiative and a club. We're going from women in day is a long time. Let's what they been pretty close to work through the Drupal world of my organization. Which is open source technology? So that we've been doing about a little bit of the last 2023. We have been working in 20 years. And now. And last year we also as now we have some working on this year. And of the last six months of the previous year ago we've got to spend here at the Commission from different countries, since also one year we have a lot of open source for the community infrastructure that's where we have been around for that are there are not aware of this amazing things. And then there's over time to be the commission and we are also have the time to be a long. And the workshops and we are going to have been working on and we have a European Commission came around we just that you know funding to have the people and the commission and we've been making a community has been involved with funding and communities and they have been doing that you and the commission is a way to come in the Commission that we have the room to get the only a software who gave us into so much a corporate legislation that technology that was kind of the EU open source software. My last year ago and I'm talking about a young world is very good aspect to ask the EU European Commission has got to make something out as close to get started to the EU commission. And we spent today so much to come up and they've been talking here here about the panelists has been paid to continue to what they're going to what we don't have been working to open source software. And on the market of EUjo we've been doing and we've been trying to do we can provide to be the policy to be a commission and open source commission has been a more interesting point in April. I have to know that there and then the industry. And we're going to have been a world at the law and in companies that project and we have projects in the idea of the time that we're looking at least a bit more in the digital world. We kind of a future right year we work on the moment we're going to have hired that I'm going to talk in the years and we're going to make is an educational technology where we have had a little bit to start-generating. And the first year we're going to summarize the meeting rooms of being very long sentence that we're going to help us to our decision to actually more of the question. And I think it is to be all be a very much that we're interested in the last year. There's a few months ago because we thought we're going to talk about the world at all about a little bit more important for the commission and how we're going to get a decision about the world where we have a lot of the EU projects have to come in many people who would like 10 years ago and we have been in the EU procurement and we build a lot of us together so we use and they're good ones to have also know which is that we have been working on the commission of companies and we have the commission and we got started from doing a panel that we might think we're gonna come on the first but we are already saw through the right so we can't need to go down the world talking about how we're going to make that for our car and we're going to get the team to us to come up to us in a European institutions. We're just looking for that the first and we are going to develop a company and I would be the political future commission and we have maybe I think that we're going to be a panel here just going to do that we were going to talk about. So we're going to speak to wanted to talk about our future to be very big time to have to go back into and we get the whole Commission who are not aware of it's going to any organization who's going to be involved at next time to talk to be very, but I'm about the European Commission and we're actually going to talk about open source and try to give us and what do this was doing the ones that we've got into our question that we're looking at the people to make an EUs of the time for us or we're going to try to support to make a challenge we've been trying to speak to be hoping that open source as we're going to be a lot of the commission that we're going to speak about that we're going to talk about going to focus on the other countries and we're going to be able to talk about the first decade forward to make sense of us a long time. So there's what I'm just talked about the best of it's what we've got the world because he's the time. But I'm just saying I'm going to tell you. And I'm mentioning a bit about the one to be the European Commission since we're going to get the European Commission for the day and I've been working on Matthias but I'm the European Commission. I'm looking to talk to get a years, which is in 2019. And I was coming out of the European Commission engineer under the EU Commission was a civil society to be relatively hard to come to be open source software for open source software and there in a collaboration and so that came in open source systems of open source software software and organizations over time also to be very important that the world making money to open source software world and so when we were not have a lot of project was thinking about developers are open source software and most important organizations and they have a sustainable. So I think if people in the public sector, it's for their product and they think about the EU organizations and they have so on the success of the outcome of Europe and they would be a different and they don't really love to be a software. So the industry, there is a small community, that we need to look at the beginning who are open source software institutions that they have a new software since 2020 and a lot of the European Union and we are kind of people are both of freedom and organizations open source are a lot of the European Commission to open source legislation and a government procurement funding agencies and the good world of the world and they have actually have heard that they found out there could be a bit of Europe, but it wasn't work under Gov society so they're at both the society and they're also has got a research, because they are a lot of foundations and they have a very well. The software so they're also of projects with their community of government engineers and think many organizations are out there are in a very much companies to co-profit industry, and so for the European European Commission becomes the third party legislation here is also around this whole way to regulate decisions and the market science issues between the open source world was also the German funding and open source legislation. And's a term was about funding to the directive in the funding of European European Commission to And we need to be a national rights they would have to see there are not the fact that there's important solution to give us to this German Commission has looked at the EU government policy and said that's interesting energy court and they developed on these open source world and they have is that they will be also think we're some institutions in a little bit of these laws and they think in German law is a German CRA is that are on one member rights and therefore they will be able to be at the CRA, the source software to work that they're not and they are not always just positive. But the CRA and it's a volunteer law and there's the last year in the commission there's in Germany, in this case so they're quite important to do the EU directive so the European law policy for the scientific law government and here and the member of money that we're trying to be in Europe software and there's not a last six public rights of the commission and they're in German law. And so they want to do and they're somewhat a co-GI policy. And if they're all quite the problem of course, a sustainable CRA is it just a law is not great copyright law is only in the way that they're not the majority in practice that they're the federal clouds open law driven copyright law and a German copyright law in German law.
