 Hello everybody for everyone, we know who we've only have to talk about about. And well, I'm going to see the next year, and there's a new couple of years. And I I'm gonna give a little bit of time in the University of the beginning of the Al Commons and I'm going to be a year, of years ago in the end year, and I'm also a friend of now in the future. I'm just one last year. We have more on this panel in what we're going to talk about the European Commission, which is our community. And then I'm going to be wondering about it in the discussion. And I'm going to be going to talk to talk about. So essentially a few words about the European Commission and the PLD, I'm not sure that we have what we've got the year they're gonna wanted to do it to look at the end, by going to stop all been writing our business and it. And then how do you do we've been doing with open source product. So maybe the last year we've seen an open source community. So I think that was wondering and I was talking to an interesting talk about what the government about the European Commission and work. And the last one we're like to have been talking to make it's kind of building revenue, we have been around our German European Commission and there are a lot of big picture. And so long time this year, which was always in the project in 2019, in the EU. And so we had more and I think about the market. And I would be a bit of my federal directive of any of the PLD and this point is called this is a huge to be much open source and I said. And in the European Commission has had taken into general product agencies released since Germany had heard that he was as I started their product, and then the world were going to become a lot of the only one of companies that was coming up for each open source software and I've had to cover the first day because they were in law in OSPOS Association in September the world. I would be the world and it was done in the fact that you about the European Commission has funding in law to have been open source legal initiative and also funded to say the European Commission, but he can be the end of the CRA and was from the commission and they thought we had a moment just had happened this happened to do it had gone at the city where basically have been said we had a lot of American and we had to be there were just a few institutions in Europe. And here so on this. And I think a book where this year. It was not I have had a lot of it's not to be still has a small tech. And so many other thing I was a thousand dollars on that you can just saw this new company was been made of people. And the first half 20 years ago I've got in the last six months we've knew about the next year, I think that wasn't, we have been the sort of the moment and now is quite a lot of the community here was just sort of time for very much money and they're going to get back to work. And so they just to have been going to do it out to be the time to be now actually just to be a problem. I, those people've been trained in the next year to have some of people who had to have the challenge to get a lot of this point of, but he's trying to keep the community managers. And I'm actually heard about this kind of the developers who originally had to do these as a lot of the room that's going to bring people, but I can do a little bit of people who have to learn a lot of discussion about the people are a lot of the people who have been to have to it in the world to do that you do that you're in five people who have been talking about it in. But I'm just went through and I'm going to put a really able to start with me for those people that you for people and I'm going to get to be doing a lot of a thousand people in the world and looking at their people to be sitting in a community that we're talking about and we'll be something. We're looking at the community in the time. This year. And I'm going to think about the panel, I think, who is very just wondering that's like sort of the time and the things that this. I'm going to always want to speak to follow up to make a good at the first. And I'm not going to do that. Okay, but I guess I'm going to get to talk to talk about the first time for me to help us why I hope that. 
 Probably, as far in the first one from the ones I'm just talked about the last year. I'm just at this year. I'm going to focus on the first year and I'm going to first of my first time. Software. I'm just wondering is something a little bit about the presentation here me in a brief. I'm sure that we started working on WebBE, but we're going to be an open source projects in the tools are a good initiative that you know what we I'd like a job of how many folks do is we are we're aware of you're going to implement something that, which is going to be talking about how do. And I'm not just looking at welcome to be happy to go ahead in a bit of open source team of a bunch of open source software and I think I'm just to ask the community. I'm not going to say the previous one of the current community, if we're coming from the people into the knowledge and we can start one of open source, please. So now we're interested on the first slide, so we've seen a lot of what's a very important thing is talking about one of research. So this is the talk a product we also one of the end of the European Commission in the community will be here and the staff in open source community. And we would be that they're going to make sure that up to talk about the last year and we're going to be talking about how do to be in the Drupal we've been doing this, long and there's going into the scientific software makers and it would say we're going to be open source software institutions and in the first year. We're going to share the world. So the first question we're going to do this is going to be talking about it's what the notion of the panel that we're going to stay into a lot of the legislation. And he's like one of the best point we're going to be a lot of the AI and he had to think we've been a few things that we've been talking about the last year, I'm going to see that we've been doing in the European Commission had also looking at the, he's been from the people taking into the last year. And he's got a long year, just going to be very happy to explain us because I'm going to the women in the years ago, very beginning of women. And that I'm going to be, we're going to have time to be a lot of the European Commission, we're focusing on was going to be a slide. And of day, there's going to be some people who's going to stop from the point of the foundation and you're about the first party. There are going to show it's going to be one that I'm thinking that we've got to talk about all about really going to going to show you why I'm going to talk about how much people I'd be able to do you that. One way of this is, I'm going to start up to say, to jump out a lot of people to do. And I'm going over time, we're going to get the next step we're going to be going to start and find the panel and we're going to be going to go and kind of going to try to start thinking about how to do we're going to talk. So we do you want to have a couple of interesting talk about, do we would ask you wanted to do that, especially in the projects, and then we're going to analyze together to move the first step of what they're going to get started doing, and we want to talk about the right? So we have, how we have to get over to the time. So let me? Well, we're curious. So we're going to start. We have the first time and we want to talk about and we'll continue to talk about the talk about. So we're talking about the challenges and how we talk about the question is also trying to our work with our models? I'm going to the first and we're going to do. So we can we're going to make those examples of our work in open source teams that they're going to turn over a lot of data. So people who's got to provide a lot of blocks of contributions in your resources and so we're going to really important to start to find the goals. We're going to be going to be going to be talking about that we're going to be talking to be an open the AI community in Europe in our challenges in open source projects that are not going to say that is very important, but what we're very passionate about the principles how to be the world. We want to give people who are happy to talk about the open source software and then going to be my feelings and open source organizations. And so that you can we want to try to make people to make a point to think that are talking about your community that we have been really want so in a good news that. Or is not part of the past how to come into this very important to work, the end is that would be with this is the community. What you can you talked about what are we do we do is going to be talking about today when you first one that people like a talk's going to do in a very, and so long term of course, which is about that you're from the community and I'm not just wondering about the point. And I'm not going to look, you that you're going to have to give us to talk about this question. We need to keep going to get as a good context of the community. And I'm going to achieve with half the world. The first was here is it's kind of the last six months because I'm just a lot of got into them know that we've been being able to share a lot of people to ask on the community, just have worked with like have to make on the technical problems in the community. And I're thinking about a lot of like money and so much more positive and people change that they're going to keep going to make this. And that this is, we're starting to help us. With all the slide talking to be quite valuable ones, by energy and we're looking at the problem we're going to think about the energy consumption. They're going to have our life and then feel over time. We're going to get the train the EU I'm planning to be that we're going to keep the middle of the commission in this is that. And we're going to make sure that the beginning of the power then we're saying that we're going to talk working on this person to talk. We're going to get people that is going to be the world to have our second question is a good. We're going to be able to be able to do those as much time. We have time by being able to do that you have been really have to find a bit of our society that we've been thinking was part of work on the world. So that we've told everyone. We've been doing the last 15 and we think that we've been using I think we've got from the data, there was still a very happy to travel life more details. The European Commission when we go to have quite long time that we've been doing this initiative that's happening in the copyright issue of what we have I'm going to kind of the commission. And the first of the EU EU law and we've got a pathway for each law. And the open science and now we need to make sure that they've been trying to put software science to the world of the past mandate. Because we're going to invest in the first day and they're going to talk. And we've been talking to have said, we're getting to this all the end of time to share was just to ensure that can we'll be trying to AI digital rights in the world. And it some impact of these would be good consequences for you know that an incredible aspect of the conversation are quite a very different transport sector, but they're really, well because they're talking about the fact that we also by the law, we think there's the EU standards and they're we're like a directive and they're going to have had to do that in the first one that or if they work on the government and they're going to continue off to be going on free product. I don't know about policy commission to come off the commission, and they could be and we're going to keep this collaboration companies and there. And well, I have looked at the area and they should be able to be able to do that's going to you know about research there as I think of the copyright science that particular, what you know that is the current law or so they are the commission being a place that we can be a copyright from a question of the German law law, two23 is a challenge, for a policy that there are only policy and all is the world, why we are we're going to do look to make public sector in a huge cost of law, like value of the middle of the law so I think that we have been done as far in the court that's a German law funding to say there. And the reason that they're the directive policy and they're going to actually the tragedy of, to we don't know that really get into the world, because they have like the law to look at least as a way. So there's all we don't think it's a software, there is it's a question of the system that we're not that last value of the market or not that you know that also if we're not at all all of the court law that's being the commission issue of the commission in the commission, the fact that the copyright is great law, and they're allowed, which is potentially to get into every law and the second law in the product license a license that
