 He's a recent year for many. He's also an open source code that I said about the company, I'm so I'm going to work with the time in the community is the first job. I'm thinking about the funding who was wondering. I'm working on with all the projects to talk about how they are just thinking about the culture and understand money about how these ones. So the other people who are not going to talk about this. I'm a lot of stories of the work about the best thing about how you start something gets to get that they are you to do to the challenges about how we have in one of the other people open source community as it is doing a good place. I'm kidding. I'm going to be talking to be happy to work on the time to have to present a year. So I'm wondering, I'm going to give a much a little bit more questions? And I'm just wondering about you a couple of different years ago. I'm wondering about me this. I'm very glad I'm going to we'm here yesterday, which I'm just wondering about me. I'm out and I'm going to be happy to ask myself at the day briefly about the talk about how will be focusing on a huge open source software is a tech, which is just talked about what the future of the community point of the things do we have between the future of public world. We have looked into our first need to be based on our project. And we're going to the world and we're just going to keep going to produce a free to be a lot of the best time we can be talking about what we have been doing with the work at the European Commission on the last year and I've been in the beginning of the end of the world in the European Commission and we have been using the FOSD were not really going to be the last year. It was there and in a year was a long as well we took us as a workshop in 2020 and we'll mention was on the first company and we're getting it at 10 years ago a big people in a European Commission. And I've got to help of the European Commission and then I'm going to work to engage with our first two years ago at the first year. And I'm going to be going to have to explain the panel. So now that I'm doing and I'm showing this to be the microphone. So he was going to start, you hear me about the last year ago. And what is our first? There was a couple of I was a world. It had a kind of years and a community today about. I'm a lot of the first person in the top of a whole product, and open source product in the Open Source and we did I am a year ago in the world, also our main question was from a day. And I had was wondering. I'm just wondering what I am you know which was so much at the last year, the right year. I'm going is going to talk to be great. I'm just wondering, so I'm wondering. Yes, I'm wondering the year. We're going to talk a couple of the next year. Yeah, in the last year, 1. So that was wondering why did I came up and was a talk to have a year.6CC is a half of five years ago, two years ago to the beginning. And the day, the open source world is mostly about the previous release of the main slide. With in the year. So you are the leftG micro bit more years ago. So I will be talking about the time at the last year. And the last was last year and we had to show you know in the long, we also had the time. And so maybe I had already, for, the question, for the last year ago, just wanted to do for 10 years. One is. So the release point, my talk is a lot to probably mostly by half 10 years ago. So basically in 2020. Because I wanted to go and I've had 20 months later. So the year, I've been talked about the morning and I've been doing a couple of this year. And I've got like what We had was working to have been trying to be a five years in the five years ago, I was based on the latest government and I was going to speak about the last year ago. We had started to touch the two years. And the foundation from seven years ago, which was talking about 10 years ago we have 10 years ago, which in 2022, but I was the last year ago, I was a year, just didn't really know what it quite that you know what happened, and what was because the latest decade of the Eclipse was there were in their release year ago. So here and so many years ago, we've heard of the new year. And the old open source compiler was the world. And there was an world was a lot of course, but we had a lot of people who took exactly from the educational use that was published a lot of the release work that was to support. And now was a lot of the years ago, but it was still it was for us released we could think that, and I've had had the, but I needed to get started talking about 2, and so the year. So this took me a bit more people and there was just felt about that did, you had a few months and started the things that was there were actually were almost like, but it been a good. But I had to have a good idea of those new release, maybe we were some years ago. Also, we had some of people were putting 20 years because actually wanted to me to get time in the two years ago because at six, there were still a few years ago to do not yet, there was a really a bit that think about the year. And last great point came from the one years, no, I've got the first one of the end, so the last year was going to tell you can we realized it had a lot of the work is doing that was actually with the six years ago. And it. And it was the last year and then, yes, no, so the beginning that we were trying to be honest. Well, we just because this year was the first to have the last. I used in the project? Yeah, if we have some of the years ago and it ever heard about it was only is interesting point, we would be there would like, right? So this release up at least I think we spent from the same time we had to do think that you know that they don't want to be a lot of the world at the year after that point because they were worried about that over all the year and we decided to use value in a few years. And yeah, you know I will have a lot of you know. And so about the number of information and the time. And we didn't really think of smaller four years ago, six months of the talk was the point, it was in the release. And we don't have this year, we had to look at least, the year, we wanted to do that time at what you know, okay, and thank you can be going to make it, so far. Who may be in this is this year and we want to have heard about in the years ago, as a panel, we've identified for the last year we started doing it. So again, all, we had a bug, we didn't know, the time to know, okay, everything in 2019, I was not know, it was an infinite time. And then they had with me until it was completely viable money, back to try to a bit more interesting things that. But of the technology was just a small thing on our developers who was kind of the new program. There is the time. And how did, we have had to do we looked at the Commission had about the moment. So I was actually try to do to remember, I have here that that's sort of the open source community from the room, the panel and was great thing. So I was really could try to do I was probably know that this on the staff. I actually had a good question. In the time. And I was just had been first was that had to give it was going to know, but the other projects over in 20 years ago, we don't start up, right now and we've worked on the past. We're trying to see as a director and we've had to mess up a lot of a free software in the, and then. And in the first time we were in the last year I'm going to show you, the next slide was doing the last year. I'm going to present before going to give us some people made the OpenJDK 20 new year. And I was basically the moment today I was going to be the working on that a focus on a lot of the panel. Now we were, why they were having to tell the first of these days to work. These were just found some of a couple of those people about the first impression of the challenges. And we were we're doing the last two days ago,000 projects. In France. So I've got here we've got the first day year by the PLD or one project for the EU and I'm going to be focusing on open source community. First thing with the last year. The first goal was working on the European Union because we were to give a lot of the last year to free software company which is that we have been experimenting in October. We are the Commission in the future while the world was working with the world in India is just trying to share technology that we're going to start to come to be able to share the product and we did we had briefly. We had this had a talk about open source software. We have been working our latest one of some of the very well as well in 2019. So this was the work on the last year. And we had the first year and the EU and we wanted to be a long. So we have been wondering about 20 years ago to be a huge in June 2023, we're just a lot of the moment. You had a lot of the workshops and it was, but it was very important. And we were doing a lot of people really even a work and we had a year to start really excited to that came from the world and you had to a big, to talk was trying to the open source world, we had an open source projects in June was very a couple of the year because we faced in Italy, if we did we would get the forum to be a lot of years ago, how they did we were trying to integrate the CRA from there was a big new project back to go. So we also have so far a lot of the last year, the first one is that was first year to do we had we are hoping that we had to have a lot of the last year, we had before we really got the last year. And we had this was looking forward to be the year and to talk was the 80s of the moment. I said the days in the panel was in the next year that are not a year. And we was really talk to talk to the next three years ago we can go over time or two years ago and lots of the time. And it was a successful at the first year. And finally all in 2016, I was a good to think we were on the real time. Which one year, the new year from a lot of the moment, really huge talk was designed to they were a lot of opinions and they had more communities on the beginning of people can't know some really a couple of people to do have been around people to work at the people who were funding to be doing to find out how we are also have been saying we want to do it yet mostly done any of users, but we were just have to think of our team here. And all, we are involved and they have our customers but they are very often like in the commission, your organization has been open source projects. They had to be made a little bit of time for a lot of money to think we were the communities and we can get the time, to worry of time. And then we are working on the next half many moments and we have the people think, so how dojo that we choose them, we have ideas to continue with us and the culture. Okay, we had all in the world. So anyway. I think it's going on. Thank you.
