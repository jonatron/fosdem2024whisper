 Hello everyone. I'll speak an email. And let's show you how do you see it? It's just try to build it and get to that. So this is not going for the first step is to join the first. So this is a call line. If you pull request. That's happening in the server from user because you're going to be able to actually putting an actual request. You have multiple keys or this new keys in the room. You also some kind of a proxy page. You can connect is a container to the rest you to the client. You don't have to create an IMAP. And to be able to go to it into this mail is in the server but in the server. In the server you can see that this is going to talk. And then it's going to be a server. It will probably going to make the client side. You'll take the server in and also the server as we're going on to do to use the server or if you're going to just find some in the server, the server is going to load the request up to have some response to take this server to drop the server. So to send a server server. We want to resolve the server. So if you're going to just a client server to be. But if you're going to go back to the back to me. Where the client. We want to the clients. So, I can we want to show us are going to apply to start looking like a server in this server, this. Let's the server. Okay. I'm doing user server engineer here. So maybe we have a server that's going to happen. So if you have to start to want to start that next server, I want to start with a server and say this is an server one server. I that's going to know if you're going to work to start in the application that's going to show your server. So I're going to come through, the server, an email server. So the server's going to this is going to work kind of a server. We have their server and the server provider that's going to be going to an email server who are going to want to check the server. And from client. If you. And it's the server for the server, what's going to do is going to be part of the server that is going to share and be going to have the server. So this is going to be this service that would up is getting a server. The client client works, the server's a server and where this data interface, it's going to start. We want to try to authenticate to be going to give the client server. And this side that's the server to start to say, we have a server and all the server, we want to have to implement this server to create the server. We have a server, and we want to put the server ID. So you don't want to use the server in the server server provider is going to want to send the server on which allows us to have to WebSocket server in your back to deploy it to Kubernetes and you to the server to our server. We want to make your server. So thank you have a web server. Please want to just for everybody very much. Thank you for coming. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you afternoon.

 Thanks. This is present you very much for working up for a few questions. We are this talk. 
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Code and hello everyone very much. Thank you very much for our day for staying in the whole talk. Thanks everyone. 
 So everyone. My talk for showing up doing our talk. Hi, I'm working on a really well for our whole thing that we have first talk. So the talk about the I'm speaking about the founder of our name is the GitHub. And you guys had a real talk about this talk that you mentioned, which are we have been going to talk about how do with the first one of the community and how many different communities have looked like who have a little bit of computer and the year in the software engineer about what I believe is a national agencies really are an open source community world and the moment in the community is exactly the open source projects in France. And for the other companies and they also about the open source community to turn on which is really helped us to look very important. And that they can be very important that don't work. We have some of the first this new technology in legislation that data in the current law and I've seen this research is also has been the fact that we keep in the European Commission alliance, but a really got a lot of course. We have been half a lot of society of different things up and we have done our scientific community organizations and they have more of open source agencies to start to have some research in Europe, we published all, as it's just a little bit of the community and they all the world and they have not even if they can be a single research of the world and both around quite important thing at those things and they have been involved to be there that they want to bring off and this open source software and they're really, so it said in a lot of us in that she was totally useful for the last year at the EU agencies in 20, and I was happy to be done in Europe and really interesting to help with digital digital work on and I'm not open source communities and just wondering that talk has been involved in the big world. And so much of the last year years ago all I was that, that we have been really, I had a little bit of a really do one thing of the main volunteer sector and they are we were very angry and of the moment I had also half about it was kind of open source projects at which was wondering in this research. I thought we just as there's there was the last 2023 would like a bunch of the first step of the last year. And it was very important to be an open source software to be paid for the key from the last year. And we've been looking at the people who had been to actually to be done at the first year in theseGI. So that you know, in the end, this point, the open source government software. So I have for the court of software was the world. This was the years ago because I didn't remember the German technology was just released in a little bit of contributing to be, but also been organized in the world and I will be the challenges and it was going to the room. I think about the Parliament and to be said that is just the act as well the rights that big point is really important law is that the commission act of the rights policy of the market of the market, the railway law. So I see the market in to be the first aspect of the law, I have there were just one that not so that is probably actually in the CRA in fact that only the European Commission in the ones that were the software and civil society. And the world were organized and last month, there's the world. So the commission were some EU and the success we were a bit of the federal Commission, we were started in the capacity. So as you had to make it was really often done, there was good law, so I would be on the open source world and I had to be done the law in the government. And then I'm gonna be a law has been a long time to make money for a money to. So, we were time to be just wondering in the law and the big tech law is what are also part of the EU point of the commission law did we have found that we can solve the market is now. So I think I think it's the law over software transition came to the time to keep the policy than the license and we have to come to the definition of digital software. We will be the product of the digital law and the policy in a copyright law that was wondering that I think the CRA and I'm not to be open source source legislation and we had a copyright law. But to have a GPL, but it's not just a great way that time. And so it's perfect to have the world that we did they were going to come to be competitive to share the third law to be done in the parliament and copyright law is the only an open source law and the law, at this rights could be the government and the licensee the law, well that the laws was the fact and they do not working group and the GPL is not be the first society that we had said. And it was able to be a pivotal law or also an open standards foundation, so in the copyright court law of the court law that this is the politics for the commission of the policy of the parliament was the public regulation perspective of the license. So I was of that we have, we know that we also have any legislation. So why we talk about law. Now in the law and the rights and I'd like the parliament could we're going to be able to look into data that that you know they're going to have a way or at FSP as far to do not on the open source commission directive. And in the rights to send a law laws, but there and if they can be a directive of the GPL law that they didn't know very often to do. And if you know where you know that for you can't have a copyright should be there is still a great policy and we've asked and you need to do that would provide the market and so that that they had to prevent this context, they are not want to think the law and a way and when the German rights to be any copyright keys, they don't really have a law to read from the negotiations and they asked, so they need to know that doesn't have, then they know. So there's going to give that's a copyright that it's a copyright in the value. In the same gatekeepers that the law, far in each law, is actually. So the way to the software decision was, we've heard about that. And of the copyright holder the policy as I was that we had the American law was not the law would do there was more copyright value on. And the directive. We were the copyright copyright law that we had a copyright law to change it isn't there was, and GPL. And that could be the court law in IT that value. And the copyright nature in law in the law remains law was like the digital legal law, I have had could that we have is a law value of copyright license even in this government law and so that they were related to saying the same law and they were a value there's not license act in court only German copyright they are someone should say it and they have enough legal decision, but they could be there said it. But of the way to have to copyright does not sure that there's the GPL or they don't the law we have copyright a law and they think this law, we have I think that's a value of the law we need to say the GPL law and they would be money and doesn't think we don't have any license and we need money, would be taken to work but at interoperability. And because we need no, with the rights source person that I think there's the years ago because it's the scope that for Europe asked for us people. Of course, there we think that we think they're the law term in the copyright term and we're a definition of law copyright regulation in any free law license practices because they have no license
