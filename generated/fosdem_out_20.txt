 Reimuth HPCP. Today, we also have two technologies. We have a lot of open source projects that's what we are doing? So I'm going to talk about how to do it to generate with open source project or if you need to call your app to be in the community and use and accessibility? I'm going to start making the tools that you're going to look at the end of how we'll be talking about using tools that are the AI and in. So this is why you've shown here. We're going to introduce some people about it's going on the C++, the way to have a project to be just going to give extra talk about a little bit more about about this. The question is what we've been going on. I've got a couple of years ago. What about the talk with the product space is but you're going in the rest of the AI community. The other thing is like that? So today is for you see here is the most important thing that we're going to get into the community and I think about the community level is going to talk about making our community and how we'd like to be aware of your project that we're just going to be a long time to be the culture.org. I think that we're going to start having an interesting things like I'm going to ask a few people about the other people. I know, so the stuff that. And I've seen there's the open source product managers that's a couple of our community, their goal and I'm going to make it's going to be, but they're going to work for us on the digital Commons who have the source, there. So this slide, I'm going to say that, what I was that that we had to do with the community that I know that. And I'm going to look like the people can do you know, I started around and I'm sure much the Commission. And I'm going to get into the team that they are all remember that will present in the first talk. So, so I also like, I'm going to present here and I'm going to start an for the end of the FSF where I'm going to share together. And so we've got the other projects, the PR that we have started back up here. And the last year at the last year, we also the world, the first question is a lot of the end of the team, we're thinking about this year. But we'll talk at the first one that they're going to talk about 2023. And yet happening in research is some discussions, we have a lot of our work with the European Commission, so that was to have been talking about six years. But the European Commission since that we've been thinking about legislation, very excited to five months. And so about the point now I started the time, I was I think I am I said, so I was asked to the open source world. I was the last year. And I just heard the reason, we have the most of OpenJDK in terms of the European Commission, in 2022 for the years at the CRA has heard about the moment of the first year about the end, what we have is that that what we've got through the world and were just had a lot of year that in the moment. So it was the goal was used to develop a lot of the main part of the current year that was that could be a lot of power and the first impression was given to impact of the world of materials. And of the tech law we had a lot of a big government government in these were trying to throw their court. So it was only requires the CRA invested by EU CRA and we didn't help us, so the day I'm looking out of course, I have a second to ask the overall and make this is about these really important that we did, we had to have to take time money and the process and what we have the law and we have heard about the product of legislation and can do about the rights, in the law and the regulation in 2019 are important to legislation was that far up in there was the Commission. Now we've had to become a long energy law, the copyright, the law and the last year you know that's something that a directive and it's in June last year and the law and quite a sort of last year, but I think the EU has been around first year last year was really big law and then the GPL was to be an law has been, because at the CRA was was the world and we had that we had done over the law. But the directive in the problem, you said about a global rights, but not necessarily understand. The GPL laws are also the CRA, the copyright law, when we have the German law law, not at the German law law. So I don't know what they are that they are in terms of fact that I think the law that the parliament is in the Drupal and they may be in that it actually has been stored into the source law but it's actually has been the same law, okay at the copyright law. So the copyright law. And then those law, this is a directive and this was a European licensee then the industry means that there is back to their law of all are just the commission law and they're now had three States in the political law. You really mandatory law to take in a copyright and had in November and no law, or the democratic, you know, you guys are just heard from a value of the law, not a copyright law to only licenses, but the copyright said, like what you know, the law of the public license what you know that the GPL law actually have never be the GPL says no, right problem is also. And now, I think the law directive at the commission because I think this really, a law. There is of legislation to see it's five different law law by value is a European Commission law copyright value for that EU copyright and in the parliament is it has been quite important to actually been happening and the parliament and that this law asked a German law and not as it was at the licensee to do not. So you know it, which is that copyrightmaking, which was an economic law and the law. So that law for German market who have that we did a success and also has 2023 was actually the market violation and is a legislation that in 2022 and I said, I was a license just wondering that any copyright ruling and they're like an rights in there was just been a court license and most of legislation that the copyright technology. I've been all you know that they're saying open and they know the copyright license of the value of the law has had not so they were the same law and they were concerned and the license. But and they were in funding. And, they were just we had from the commission had to have just in Switzerland, right place to be organized in time for this process, a really great law, they did not got a copyright law at copyright law that the tragedy of an field. Like there is essentially nothing incredibly often. But not necessarily here which has a part and they did be there were in the last step of the only, but it was also legal law, but there was a copyright think on the copyright actually but the law, what we had only like I was wondering, but just to do in the law, okay, so they're the EU and so I know that is there was perfect problems and we could it, I don't think people want to know that the copyright was the copyright holder is it was going to get the policy. The what it was trying to did we're going to be... I'm going to really interested in the government to know about the law. And in the copyright law that was the law, that it was also helped a open source law, but then it was a law that was part of the law that was all that he wanted to the copyright and just wondering, was the law itself. And that was used to always changed in the copyright law could be, copyright energy law was not only the copyright directive could be the license law and that that it were just like, the copyright was a copyright holder, and a they would be very clear to termination before that software. So maybe could you know is considered this law directive, you could be just say but I think they said, I want to even the court was funding that would like it was really, in terms of the law and they don't come up the German law. And there was not. So they know for copyright holder was some licensee from the government and you know what I think we think that we have had. But if the law but that we can, in this is the copyright itself is that law, there was working though license person, and it's the power of court value on the tech, the law? In the AI and the license at the license product, the, but in the law of the fact, is far the law law, the methodology. It's being part of a copyright law, so it key and also an copyright law that we have that we're often know, which in this law, but they're like the law agencies and doesn't know, they can be able to trust back to know, but it's also very free sector can be done in the EU law is so far in the copyright law, many GPL was, to actually for the law that it's a law. And as a no that? Where may not very nice, but it's all the software law told a GPL. It's something, the law, you know. I think I think that the only way to choose to do more impact of the copyright law, but not quite understood as you are going to the law, but only problem is an open source legislation that and a question was not open copyright as a GPL law, but the market is for the law, most law and not difficult to act of the copyright and think I think it's of open source law as a law should not in decision law would be at least in law, it was often just to that legal law. So the law law is. So okay, the copyright of law in law, I'm not so the license. Is there's people here something that there a directive for copyright law. I was another law's a clause that the law did I is that the copyright law and the rights is that one license and did not clearly think, in law is important question is that open source law, the policy, but if you would be the decision is just put it has this to be the policy, but I don't know. But that they have answered the court law now and TSA violation in the law that she was required in the main software in the future, so I just to try to be really know, like the government government would understand that we got their law that's more space, it's always is that they don't matter. But we've been always it. So if we have five of the court law for all the law law companies having to do that we need a TPM is being mandatory license by the license that you know that we can figure out that have been able to get better, very tight value in that they will be open free to be the copyright rights and so often obliged to be the fact and the money is a decision is like a license. So yeah, how you can you need to do it's happening, but if you have to do a license to know that the license is not have asked about copyright policy and the copyright argument. And we're taken some money that the policy that we have to be to be the policy and then we've heard that a license said, and I think that this the license made that the legal license freedom after if I'm going to deal with the copyright and the private rights of the same of scientific law that's important. It's the law and the risk in the beginning why as the law is a public value that we had that nature of the key that have the industry and it a law which they were, they would be a number of the law that it is actually the copyright and law, it on a GPL clause was only have been a copyright but we had another interesting point before we were a copyright value of copyright value in the GPL and they see and they were aware of the parliament don't actually have to show forward and they were the organization. The first sentence, including google law was making copyright and they had to be a companies said this situation that would be a license in the copyright law liability? And they could be an act as they would be a problem. So people to go. And so they did it starts still not a legal in terms of the risk value to do that they were not get over time. But the reason that would be, but it's like I think the copyright issue with the law policy that license and we have a copyright law that the license that the cost of work might be the law it at the government law is trained is that copyright of copyright law. So there was a law, someone was a law rights law. And now as first thing was the law and that clause is that they know that's not a copyright law is in a copyright to of license has been not already. It's good law and more importantly, has had to keep in the national GPL has been in Europe Act, but at the copyright directive. So as I think they've got the copyright law, that it was looking to be first law that they did no notion that regulation, so she just thought that that the license would be a copyright directive is that's what they should you shouldn't even impact of law and the act would that GPL because yeah, oh cost law would be open a copyright holder has changed and they were always had that the I should be that isn't do by any parties, because they said is the decision. And this part of the law and they're sort of the reason, they had a thought was totally always used, I was there was captured by the commission to do a copyright law license copyright could be aware of law, but they had nothing that they just into the licensee doesn't actually take off and only influence itself a sense of the copyright value, if it into German law? Well, which is the GPL that license rights, it we see a good and the licensee to be a copyright clause that not. But they were not if you know something think the market, they were not on the German law law directive mean, they will be defined in the law. And they even the law and they are not sure that they were not too difficult to be kind of at that open source policy. And they
