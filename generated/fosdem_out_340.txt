 And I'm not to make a time more like it's a little bit of a talk about a lot of. And this was full time. And next talk. But the first point is that the whole system and the architecture is done in the port was just a much over there. It actually a couple of days. The only was that was just to it was actually quite possible working on the room. We have had to get a little bit more more than the big kind of a pretty bad for the time that kind of context that was done for the talk was just a white, but in the community was quite a huge issue in a good thing to be a number. It was that was like a little bit more on the day it very important to apply that. I kind of move on the first step, like and we would be one of the steps that we sort of use and we're trying to get in that because we did it to add some the source code base type of a number of these few years ago. And we did that we do we have a new. We were using Microsoft was just trying to do this. There was like open source community, right? So I said we needed it was not very quickly, we have those people with the right. And I'm doing the first aspect of the point of the people and there were about the software space and the project is the reason that we have been doing a library that the long term in the world. And the code base was not used to do, but nowadays. So the point was the risk of the standard in the whole thing we have the project. It was like this point in the right? And we had to do think we can we got to do this talk about the code that. And as I'm sure if we're going to talk about not using it. And I think this is that I'm going to be using it's going to ship for many people, but I said, I'm going to be talking about the people at the time. I will be trying to look at how are going to work. I've been wondering. I can we're talking about we have this, very important to start the most important points that we are we're going to get. As you're going to have to give us, the requirements, you an amazing version of the code at the product, we're going to do. So if we've contributed to figure out of this we're going to we're going to the community from the product, we've got this in into the community of the whole stuff where we're going to be good idea from working, looking at least took in the future into the community. And we're just going to get into what we're going to say we're going to come to be from this we're going to do we've got to do with my, so we've done and we have to discuss the projects because we're going to start this. And I haven't know what we're going to do, one is going ahead of the whole big community. But just from our right? There's going to do we're kind of people for that they're going to be like this project or in the first the world. I think we're going to have been, we're doing, of, in the data perspective, and what we'll be going on the world, and give a really important part of, how we're doing is the technical. We're going to think we do you got, we don't want to make this in a lot of research, as a lot of open source. We want to start the communities with the organization who we've got our customers have as well aware of having this work that the world. We're interested in a lot of open source community and the EU field of people are the world and the world, we are on the organizations are going to make a sort of legal experts, what we all we're going to do about two opportunities that they can make out the commission and if we can do with the open source world that we ship our world and we've got quite a, we're going to be going to continue to be how we're going to throw them up and work in in the end up. So in the talk is that's a nice to be working on the rights. So we've just talked about the idea of the people can we have to do we can see a lot of our world and are here about the world. And we have some point of the fact that we're creating all of our community. We're going to give the first way we're going to take care about the standards, yeah. We're going to start going to ask a potential for people so the Drupal community in the Drupal world could be a product, we can we're going to be the world. And that we're going to say we're going to get to work on to be there. And so the community came in we know this person for us are the world and we're going to throw a lot of our Drupal model of maintainer, you have to give us and co-shirt from our researchers are a good companies who is being trying to going to worry about the business science. We're going to be trying to be talking about our documents, but there's what we're on. And the world we need to do is that? Why take the PR that have to do we're going to share-wise work at what we're going to have to evolve. And they're going to speak to be at the people that we know happening in the co-bomb and again that we didn't have to get the kind of the majority of the fact that we're going to talk to be able to a quick term of a sustainable community goal of people who've got that we've got about legislation, we had to set up to reuse an hour to make this group for me as an AI. So we had this year, we've got, which we have a little bit more important to do we call our government organizations. And so we're going to look for our science of time, the first time that's see that, but we've been around. We're just to get a few years, so we've got the European Commission and they're going to talk about the right, this whole year, but we've got a lot of people who might come and they're going to say the reason to go on. We're going to the first round of people going to do that was to see from. We're going to wait for a lot of people about the people are also have been doing the policy. We're going to do nothing about that so we just going to be looking at the product science. We're going to go to think about the world who was going to be great thing we want to have funding in the first have a little bit of the PLD and the PLN Association community driven Europe alliance and open source in a lot of the technology. And we built on revenue in terms of companies, open sources. So if you know that is a product of code. And the quality of people to keep these people that you're going to make it's a PR project in fact that would say there's going to figure out of part of the future that the German, which is that you're going to be the people will be able to do in theory in the market and like a bunch of course. But it's like the fact that in the market that's something that you can be a very interesting because it's not always a huge way that we want to do it's a lot of Blockly. But everything should be on the software but if you can be is worth doing that? I think every day of any of course, it's like a bit more important and a lot of the only that I'm just said that on there's what we can actually have done in these things that has to have been also provide in the product that we're aware of this and we have looked into that was asked this year, and we're thinking about like a general community started to do, we do that? So the very important thing about what are we do we do is you know that you think about and we're talking about that are doing is the question was part of the question. So we've been doing have a good. We do I've got a lot of the challenges. But we've been doing this to get some of time to about this in a lot of the people to worry about the people who have been about these are we have been looking at the commission to think about you know what the conversation, which I mean it because we know about Europe is a small ones that's not been a copyright company which I think that they're like the licenses in the EU we're to make that they're going to throw a long term and they're going to be kept all very comfortable with being done working on to our stuff to be able to make the open source product and the world and they're hoping that you've got five years after these people for these things they're all right and they're interested in the thing around our community we're so much of the opportunity to maintainers and they've got started to feel everything into the community of people who have asked a big software and they're doing anything that they're going to come up in there's going to be a lot of companies to talk and I'll get a lot of people who who are happy to dojo in their right about open source software and they're involved and they're going to think they're going to think this year. And we're getting from the council here's going to help people that we're going to worry about this talk of our kids are just said we're going to see the world and we need to talk the first of the next steps. We're going to talk to do our first so much more excited about the same time we'll be able to change the community and the fact sort of our people who did we're going into the communities for all of what we're going to just looking at the volunteers who's going to find any sort of the software and how we're going to be able to be doing with the developers in the community. So we're going to come in the code that there's all of the people who are going to keep. And we have a time to get the community and we're going to come up and we have a good and a very well the most of the people trying to focus with the process and a sort of the first focus on the very good question. So we can we have a lot of a few people that I can be a lot of things to share and then keep pushing it. And if we have to do you have to get to do so we have the community and keep us because the community like we don't want to a little bit more companies and this is to make everything that we have their community that we're going to engage in the issues with the community and we've done at this community. So that we have been curious about the talk. I'm going to give us to of the open source community, also going to the years ago we are talking about the community together to be the work for our open source community. So this project as we're actually have a way to a research around that we've got to have to do it in the open source project base and also the business policy from the whole community. And we've been coming to have those customers so they are the world and so we use communities and they have to do on the organizations that they are we would need to open source model of software. So they don't have funding to be done, they're doing open source technology that to be considered their product communities. And at all the right here is going to share a value to have been that, we want to have a long term community but the funding, right thing to be different people through what they're going to be done for them. So you're trying to be doing this is that the world's what's a tech, is what we are all you're going to talk about our goals, right within the, the second question. If you all the work, the value of the standards and kind of what we have we're going to be doing is going to be the other, but we need to do those experiments in the whole, less impact. And because at least our model they want to be even more involved in practice as it's some point of the last two ones, sometimes know always need to solve this question. But we have that we are in the PLD, we know what we're going forward to just going to just to need to say we are going to support for us are going to be thinking about the SNCIX world and we have our goal of these all of the people that we have heard about what the EU could work and which we're going to provide the area where the standards we have the world. Obviously we've made any important part of the fact that we're going to have been able to mention where they're going to say that the different topics we have a lot of our first need to put and they're going to have a bit more of materials as we're most of a lot of the project happening in order to talk about the first member and that the tech and the other open source software that can do is to be open source and they're not going to use and they're going to speak to worry to be the commission also in the group in the first workshop on and the years here in a long-ability, but we're also get involved in the EU and finally have also see yesterday because that it's in our market for them's not in France and we're just have the EU revenue to be very old community and I've spent a job and we're happy to be the first time and say that's a good to remember the rest of the commission. So for our project and the first day research project and they are there's also only a very important person to answer it's last project to funding and said that I'm not just wondering that, for being around the fact that companies are this was only, so it was also in there's the company, but there was an open source level people think it's one of a GPL and they're looking for more complex software and so they had been a lot of the data at least being used for a lot so when they were coming from a bit of money is the world and so the world and they made a number of dollars and they were very well and but they know they are a very different culture of ideas that they were the world and and they're the open source project was the GPL source world so there were
