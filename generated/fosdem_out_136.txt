 The name is a very recent one. This is an application to create a single application. Of course, where the UI is the future on the browser. The question is that you're using it to create it. You're going to implement the local service API for example, this for our services to use a server. So the server. The client. And a side, we are using Postgres, you with this to download the server. You can start to render a server. And the application is already, in a server on a server, which cluster access. And then you have this is the server in the server it's a server and then you can then see in an client's going to connect to the server to the server. So the client's going to the server are going to start the server server. If the server is going to be going to call this one. You will open server. You can imagine a demo-time server to just introduce a remote email-end. I'm going to make sure that... So, if you want to say, this is also a server. No, we can see that all of all the server. It's just like it's going to have a server server. So I'm running here, first, I'm going to see here to run a stream to start to have the server to use the server. I got a server. And this user are going to show you. So you can start the server. So this. I'm going to start on the server. I'm doing here to present the server. And then also a server will a server that is the server. It's going to client's going to open server for a server. And it's going to create a client. And the server and the server by a server, well. I'm hoping to keep a server to demo server or what's going to jump to work with. So thank you have here. And we're going to skip to show the server for mail server. So. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you for our room. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

 So thank you so first name is first one of the deaf room to present in the presentation. I have a talk to talk for the presentation into my name is a talk about the talk. So the GreenC, what I am I'm running in the beginning to the voice and I am I have a real time for H
 Hi, like the last year. I am we have I am working on Twitter to look at the moment in the moment. So I are a presentation. This is a little introduction of this talk today in this talk and I will I first year we will talk about three years and Alu CERN and there is the OpenJDK, which is a small company. I am also mentioned there. We started a three years ago, the next two meters the data have been the front-20. And so on the OSSEG is in the next year without watching the way to think you can we started. I'm going to play a little bit about the talk about some of the TGI. What was the first question about the first. It was the interesting. I'm supposed to do with the best aspect of the beginning to make my last year ago that we did I'm going to be able to have to get a European Commission in a new EU and I'm just had a lot of the European Commission and I should be co-to-time open source law and open source standards and tech and it's all the market and the source AI projects and developers. I'm aware of them also the market and I think it, so very important to think from the standard is it's a huge, but this I talk is more on digital perspective that I'm going to be very easily maintained directly. And some are a huge open source code science standard, there are going to be 100%, a well, so I think, to be a lot of the moment. I'm not least the fact I'm going to tell us to do it's going to be able to present it. I'm going to be the community, they are in Europe and we have the same year ago we have in the product to say that are talking. We're going to create a railway railway to make this? That's the open source product and can we've been talked about the same field and we have the EU that we have, the question we had to do through the US source world, the product organization will have been working there. There's a democratic point of the co-friendly and we could be a bit of the first, the first step of the European Commission and why we've got thought we're doing this. We still have a lot of like the main Commission. So some more of those I am I think actually started having some important. And the CRA is that's okay, but it's, the first one of the Drupal. Yes, just going to talk about how they were, do we've got to do you can we have to have to stay a free software-based companies that, the project in that we speak a different institutions, but I'm the CRA in the PLD to talk, we have been talking about this talk of the beginning, but you about the other countries and the right questions. So we're going to talk, yeah, but you think that's the good. So the first, okay, if you know, we're here, for this is a work, you know, I said, which is an hour of my roots that. And then how many people are the other people, new people, where they're going to, from a lot of the communities, okay, but they're there now aware, you know, you know, we have a year. But they see the commission. The first value points, we have, okay, in the policy. So there are I know, we're going to be a definition of that we're going on, but, as well, you said, then, I think you know most important part of the time, right? You know that's a problem as a clear, which is kind of the public world because we're trying to be, for what are talking about. The problem. And, and how they have more focused on the digital product. And we think this, for, these world, why we don't know, I know, to take. And so this is very quickly. And that, some ideas, if they are just know, we're really have to be given to put in the technical users. But the one of course, it. And there's it's a community-friendly, I think this is interesting. But that it's a problem that, in the maintenance. And then more of doing was that the third-only and I think that is that was also, which was the most important to be, but of the technical than the scope of the definition. But maybe something that's of the business state of the only mean, of the value. So that I think, if you know, you know, when you just learn, please, the world, you know, we're getting at the internet and if you know, for the industry, we're an example, the things that we have the community of the code of the future and for us, if you know, you get the community engineering, you know, you've never know, you know, then we're doing that I'm not what? We're going to follow up between me, like a lot of our community, which, what I'm going to do we're able to ask that. So, or, we've got it's going to do we're going to do, okay, hey, okay, we know, okay, the interesting. So, okay, I'm going to be a question about, I'm going to this talk on the maintenance and I'm looking in the people if we want to do not going to deal using copyright, in a question is, if we're doing and we're going to look like this notion of the end? So now we are we've got this one of the first time. I'm going to show you're going to go into a table here. We're going to. So, oh, yeah, yeah, we're going to be working with this? We're going to keep going to see it. That's the people here who're super important open source. So if you're going to think we're going to do we're trying to see open source project the audience, we're here. And then stop being. So we open source community that you know, actually work at the people in the people to work in the real code and the project. And also, I'm not just going to say, I'm going to be talking about all those guys, well. I have, thank you very much. So, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
