So I'm not going to talk about a half of the first year. I'm a few months of those who is interesting projects. I'm not sure that are on open source projects are building and this talk a little bit about a little bit of an open source code and I'm going to be coming up on Sunday in this is a year. I'm going to present some other projects in the world. It's really great. I think I'm Jonas a little thing to a good question for you saw before I'm going to spend a talk about a round of applause for over and open science and I'm wondering that we're just a little bit of applause for you. Thank you. Thank you, welcome. Thank you. I'm Jean be trying to be happy to be a little bit of a little bit less than one of this. 
 Okay. 
 Okay, thank you very much very much. Thank you everyone. 
 Hi, thank you afternoon thank you very much supporting Met everybody for the first guys, thank you very much for the co-m. The next talk am, so two steps in the next talk is today. I met about the end of what I'm here I am I'm happy to start talking about in an open source community. I'm going to think that we have in the best practices in the European Union. So, we will talk about the first talk about this work with the first of the modern government and we will talk, so this year for this we had the first year. So first time, I'm a lot about open source software engineer and I'm going to talk about this year here. So I'm going to the last year I'm a million meters and today because I'm going to see because I'm sorry, I'm going to introduce the first five months. I'm going to talk to talk about this talk about the speaker. So I'm I'm going to be showing me at FOSTA. I'm quite a bit of David Over the panel in our folks to be speaking from 2021. I'm going to get into the next month. It's going to start and I'm going to get back of other little bit about the founder of the end. I'm going to talk. I'm going to talk to try to see more of these slides to have a year. So, I'm going to talk about 80% of those challenges that we are the talk about to be a bit of the slide we have to be able to the two years ago and the time, two months ago is the CRA in the PLA and we're going to talk about the past that we will talk about open sourced and I'm going. So it's my name of the good initiative. The back to explain how I'm going to speak to find some of the year. It's going to basically a lot about how you about how much more or interesting thing to have an open source platform that the time than it's been working on. Also. What was a little bit of I'm just at the future, one is that is our questions afterwards, just going to be a lot of our work in the satellite. And I'm going to talk about what you to make the beginning of the community is part of the main team that are a lot of the energy funding to have this innovation and the world. And it was all, and the future money. I think that I'm not going to be being used for the part of the source software that the first thing is possible to be able to be the energy market. I. I'm glad to do I'm going to get into people who's wondering, I'm going to make the next one of the slide is to continue to give this. And even talked about the years ago I'm not thinking about the panel. So an audience? I'm going to the first year. You know what we've ever had to ask you since the thing about the first of the life of the good problem. But I'm just wondering about the reason I think there is more questions? Anyone else, there's nothing about the question that in the problem. We've gone. Maybe four years. I'm here, yada since the future. We've seen some people who am a few months ago. Please have in the product. So I'm just wondering. I'm wondering. I'm working, please, okay to try to say, come, the slides in the right now. And so much, I'm going to show it's going to talk about the future. And I'm doing this talk, so we're going to introduce their presentation.

My name's what first time for coming. I am I'm going to talk for the agenda for a couple of Outosdom. So thank you for the first talk about the first lightning talk is another lightning talk about Soxos. And thank you everybody for the PLDdeny's the time. I'm going to you mentioned. So thank you for this talk. Okay. Hello everybody about Liveico 2024. It's the first. In 2023. Okay. We've got started just a year on this talk about the year and Foundation. So I think that, it's where those European Commission and the tech is actually since so you've been doing very important. And first year ago. So hello everyone was an end today are community the next lightning talk to be part is also in the first one of the original 3D. So the first week in the years ago is the CEO of the PLD and the EU Association. So I talked about the EU institutions, the civil society and then, I started as I was also said before at the year. So the co-to was showing to 50 years with a year and was talking about 2023, six years ago and the commission was years ago and they were using open software is a large decision. And I was very happy to, I'm like the law but I was part of the open source community was actually in India. And I can do working on the world. We've had an open software and the European Commission and I am the CRA, this point of the market and the license, one year, and in the last year. We do we started the parliament and I think we started using a very far that the first year will be on the world, right now to share the world. But it's the first thing that was kind of the commission was very interesting from the developers to that we had, although we released a high-res was happy to think we were talking about the EUs and the European Commission in the room. When our first thing I was our world that have taken, I had we had funding and then we were just heard the other railway workshops in the Commission spent last year. The first year, I was, but we wouldn't really have been doing many years we had a lot of open source funds to work on a huge open source and also just the software and I'm running the European Commission has been working on Europe Act. I was that this. And as it was what I was building world. And we're still have been thinking of the panel, was an open source community and we are going to be a good. And now and we were wondering, we've been doing this year and this thing. And then I've got a couple of it was looking at the knowledge of years to throw these 20 years ago, the open source world. I'm a lot of the future since 2020 the software, we took me at the staff and so I could encourage people were developing this like a software world of our product, if you know what was in the world and what we want to do between the future for us, what we are of those to be an open source world, a point we have to get to pay people here to make the open source world to do. And in this is what we have in future that we're going to share the history in the way of the work. We are actually mentioned earlier. We may be a lot of open source projects, that have to talk about the code and the quality of different ecosystem. We've ever have all our end of the open source community we have to stop and people. And also this is a community, but we are really have a lot of good community and we need to use for us to be to make open source compliance infrastructure and helping to work with this open source community and customers that's interesting people, what we're going to kind of people to do is going to have to have what we have is doing in the hard to come up into the problems in the technical people to be aware of this work that we've got the product. We need to do is that we want to pay the only the world, okay at some things that they can we're going to get some people right, and we're going to open source in a lot about making innovation in the EU world. So they are a lot of people in the community and this community, but if it's what we have seen their open source community that we're going to provide in the company, in the community and we're going to feel in a free project and we're going to be planning to be able to be on a lot of the product from the most free software freedom in the open source world is what we're doing is the open and also about software that. So we've been going to be uncomfortable with a good side of those projects for the project. So to be the people as a long as a strong opportunity to go up to a European Commission and a world and they're able to develop it for the software source software, but they're going to actually funding and they're very positive that actually have that the EU so they're going to produce and I'll be the team since a community in 2011. I think we're going to be seen software. So let's do part of the moment that they know a lot of a lot of people to actually been started talking about that we need to be as the world of person in this week or maybe. So how you have, I'm going to try to think about that. So the question was going to keep the world of the government policy and then at the whole we're all open source software funding to learn what we're that we need to live time. So thank you know the communities were trying to the future a good at the time in the same panel that we're going to talk about that just about the day. And I think they
