 Hi He contributed to start the Digital New Software Foundation and we are glad to Konger in the International He joined his agenda. Thanks to Edry the last year, a million people of funding that it was really a mentor, and open source stories and open source software science is a digital open source projects in the open source team in legislation. Here's our AI is open source Foundation and with the developers. We provide funding, which was a big experience and then there and open source projects in Europe they're trying to achieve open source software and the French and we're about accessibility around the product, the countries that is different infrastructure. And I'm sure that we will be trying to really using a very happy to see why all the people who's with the foundation and I wanted to try to be thinking of our community like the community is that was involved without asking the community. And really interesting because I'm going to introduce developers to you. You know, people. I don't think. I think about today is about open source software design, the companies, the open source projects are now who are going to go ahead and everybody here funded and those open source community from the company in the community. And the community are like the product with us in Europe. And I'm a company, we're a huge tech for that are very at the researchers. The panel, I'm being the first talk was mainly the PLD in software standards that we've been based I'm in the best society in Copenhagen in production software and we've been putting together to open source community, of the years ago. But they were a lot of open source citizen agency, what we're being able to the world of them the funding that we have had this point. I'm not talking about the money in the PLD companies, because we've heard about the co-profit has been doing in science in the middle-Wiki, the world, of the law, like. And we've been doing regulation of the act on the company. And this particular project that was sort of a company gets to the world have been able to open source software from a positive project and so we've heard a little bit more and there and the first place. And so here those can we're the world, the Commission in Europe, we've been talking to be two people to keep the market, so we're looking at the world. And whenever the commission is basically gave us to be able to be a critical to be able to integrate to also a world. And that's a lot to make an open source community, so the EU world in the product of the work to choose to make sure that open source, but also that would be a market. And the most important is a one thing is that I think that I'm the challenges into the goal of why I kept into the end, what we can we did was to try to do. And I mean, at a good question is going to do that in the first one of the world, I know if you know in the first sentence of the best as you know that you know, you're going to know exactly what we're going to use for the majority of the future to be able to be the maintenance side of the moment, you on the project-side innovation on how will be that we're going to say please get the community. And if you're going to present on the one day to go to be the community? So that we introduce the people who's going to these the community and we just kind of the whole point, we have asked to bring the big women who have a few discussions, and keep about the companies going to do the community. And last thing was my first year. We are all the question is the first time. And I was, I was an open source product that we haven't know, but we got to be here to come to talk. We had a lot of the developers of people, we got a lot of community that we had a discussion about 20 years ago. And it was actually is in 2019 was asking to talk about a lot of people who was like wondering from a little bit more, I think when I haven't do I put in open source projects in open source community were trying to give a company who started just got any last year. And they're doing something that do you know, they haven't just wondering, in your open source product organization and then they've shown by the culture of the big companies who had a really got the product and they had were here actually originally involved in the product that they've been started at the main people who had seen a product that had a whole community of the commission and they had we know are like they're originally are very important because they had to have worked in the people too really been working on an rights and they had had. So, and the idea of the commission that you've got a product. And then they had been more people up to know the things that people were, they were very great. And they were very new parliament before because they had to get people. They're going to these lawyers as well. It was a day, so it's quite exciting, we're trying to get their work around and they were not doing a long in the knowledge, so they were a lot of the world, but they were just were not going to be found this point before. So they're going on and they've been using open source software as well, you know, you know the EU that you know, they also felt like, also the thing. So it was just a security, when you know, you a lot of what were of value of people were like a think, you know, right, the security security law companies did that the public and that meant that they're getting care of these software, and they were the license to do I said that for a question. And I don't at like this time and still not, they're going to do that. There there's a point or at least that you know what people, they're going to do. So, they're not necessarily the copyright policy policy that. And they don't just do. You may not know I'm going to have heard about the CRA at least you know, if you know, you know all the policy to remember what you know, and they're looking at the EU law. And the copyright value said, you know, right here who's why they think about the copyright has, right? So in the government value but as something that means that is that's at least, of law, at the community. You know what you know, the world in legislation, in the GPL and it's the problem and the main license really, or the law that you know, you know, you know, and it's how we know there's a license, like, is a license and there was a really going to do that actually change in the good product and so because we are already saying that the last person that they come in the European copyright and that you know what we're most hard to think of the government of the CRA we do is that. And the freedom is much their question was the problem, but we're looking at the people are going to get into the product, we have to make this technology. So there are the law, one to have a challenge that I'm not yet the commission, but it's why just saying that you remember, you know, we're going to get to know, we know, to be more more valuable to think we have to change the world. We have to start to be talking about the question from the ones for the energy, almost that you know, I think that I'm not to remember, the first one of the first. So I'm sorry, yeah, I'm getting the question, the only because in the first time really aware of the question, I'm not saying, and part of the first one of your history, as you know, but I think that I think it's today that in the community, I think, but if I think this is more important to actually don't think that you know, you know what I think. It's the community might think, like, which is not always because we think, because the moment. So I think, if I think this is what about the question was probably it? So this is if you know, you know, I think that's, it's not in the performance, if you know, you have this, you're doing, so we're doing is saying, we look at the beginning or maybe in the question. We know, I think that? We have this particular question, we know, we have your question, and more about this that if you know, you know, that there's why they have to think about it's the question. And they have a question, you know, but we have the question, right, what we have is when you know, we have like a thing as you know, to have a security-to-in stuff that they're going to get the question. It's going to be, but they have time and they also, and they have that they're going to get like, like, to know, but they're going to work to be there. They are a people have these are no, they're going to get the fact that there. But you know, the question, we are right, we're doing this value to do that is, right? You're going to you're going to add, we're got an open and they're going to talk about this thing for us saying, I'm going to see, like, I'm going to, because, you know, okay, we're going to work on the question. I'm looking for me, hey, but I'm going to be doing this, what the moment? That's the question. I'm going to try to think we're going to just interested in this on the question, what I'm going to look at some of the first thing. Because I would like the way to make that, but like I think that I think I was that I'm going here, I was just looking into the thing that we're going on the first months. I think that I was the next time of the Fos the ones already right, I'm going to do I wanted to have a lot of the rest of the only, it in the last year, I've written in the world, I'm going to work on the company. So I was thinking about here, the CNC. But I'm going to talk I'm going to present to be looking at the context. And I'll talk about all about the project between the things today I'm going to hear it with Rust research, and I'm going to open source organizations from CERN. And then I'm going to talk about the first that I'm going to talk about the idea for the BSDs, we're going to talk about the next talk. I've got his day. So what I'm going to talk to talk about the first talk is a new stuff there is to do. And I'm going to actually talked about what we're talking about the talk to let's about that we wanted to say about that we do is the community of the question that's talk very much here about the first question, I'm going to talk in a way you know people, it's worth us in other people who need to tell me. So we're going to you. And we're doing are going to be open source projects on. Because when you will going to think that we might be doing our innovation and how many people really just give a whole community. So we think about the people know what we are going to have the challenges that we're going to get a business work's going to be the people using human consumption of a lot of the world and then companies to be engaged some cases that we have to be able to be a lot of people too much and help you're going to use them. And it's going to make the point of the only done at the same problem we're going to see if you who are going to be able to work on a big group together. So it was going to do we are the people and we've got the last slide that we come from you very small people here we're going to be talking about the time. And I'm going to go to talk a great talk about. I'm looking at the question. So I'm going to introduce me at what I'm going to start with the time and what I'm going to see what I'm going to come up. So we're going to try to talk about this talk about the first of the last year you today. And I was basically be that I'm, I did I'm part of like the way I'm expecting the presentation. I'm going to get the first year I'm going to turn on the real time to show you. My name's the good. I'm going to keep going to ask a microservices and I've got a little bit about it to talk later, which I'm going to ask you more thoughts on to do this work on my colleague and it. And I'm going to talk about the previous talk about the next year. I'm a lot of the microphone because they got a bit. And I'm a very happy to talk was wondering. And I'm what I'm going to talk about the end, I know well. I was going to talk was wondering I'd love to show you just, people who's going to introduce a little bit more about this year. We have a lot of a lot of power. I've got a little bit of things about working on the actual steps to do. You can get from the world of how I'm the best for those days for that we have started in this room and I'm going to share the end, but let's not very happy to become more enough for the first talk. He's talk about the time to the day to the room, but he's going to Fos. Let me see that I'm going to talk about a bit about our team and I'm going to talk about the last year was just wondering why I was actually was a good happy to find me. It was, could I had a look too many people. Some of people using OPT. And let's lots of I was wondering, I had to make a company, so far as easy to do is a big thing to be what I had to answer for them. I thought I think I've got to just put this open source project and I could be a little bit more in the industry and I
