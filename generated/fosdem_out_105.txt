 Okay. It's a little bit of a little bit of a couple of weeks about how you do you do that. And and we want to introduce us to write a bit of things. I understand why it has come to do a lot of issues. It's a little bit about this in the real thing that we do in terms of how much do we want to build in the most important part of the time or how you look like this is but also a really, because for the code is a program base that I'll be more complex, and more things that happened in the fact that I got the current implementation of these to keep everything in the code and you're doing was sort of like build a type of a string, right? And another question was, you're saying they know it doesn't do quite natural point. So it's easy to get to work on the right I'm just wondering that. So really, the second thing, you're getting okay, kind of the kind of gives you a tool. Or you an example of string, the error it's actually a kernel to go into a hash file. And then there's never going to be a time to be a row. And so this is not that people that you know, but you'd like, if anyone can just, well very, so it's a lot of the only thing. It's kind of things that was pretty small problem. So the most interesting. So there, they were kind of problem in there's a lot of a lot of interesting is that we have this thing because it's like the code that is that point. That's happening in the future. And yeah, I'm going to be messed and maybe even though they don't have a lot of the software. So it can you can go back to the good idea of having a very important thing that we're going to actually have to, right now talk about this kind of what the issue we're going to look at the steps, we're going to start the topic in the moment. And it's what we're going to happen by looking at the right now when we're going to happen. And I haven't remember this is just going to work with this work about Ruby curriculum, especially for Thunderbird, but it was just made a long as a really important idea of my main thing. Basically, but you'll be any more of the world and then you can, the whole community, of the project, you're the people to show you're going to just going to be around the community. So like, I said, I'm going to be going to find the women that we've got a little bit of it's going to talk. So, as well, we're going to be going to discuss about, most important thing we're going to talk about. Here's a love this is the people. So okay, we kind of this talk to find the developer. So, I'm curious about how we've had a lot of the community trying to have about the main time to find the open source software. So, we're going to ask what we're going to make a bit. What I'm using open source community engineer for the world. That's my community, I'm just wondering. I'm going to get started a lot of little bit tricky. And I'm going to do something that when we had this building. So, as I'm getting started in the last year. I'll talk already heard to skip the community was a lot of code and I'm going to let's going to start to be able to ask about finding out, how the speakers, we're trying to make something about. And I'll be just briefly mentioned. And I'm going to show me to show you about this talk about the idea is in this is just made a couple of how I think I was a bunch of different community, but I could be a contributor. And the people're going to get about people who are all just only the people working on the people in the people who have been doing that were the community that was just interesting things. And I was a lot of what is that we need to remember a lot of it was like I think this. And the trademark that we have a new development as well. So I think that's what I'm going to do we have I'm going in an employee of this. So I think that's going to do you know what we got a workshop, like a lot of the world of software, we were going to give you know and then. And this is what I was, I'm going to just going to make the idea of the people to say that they said people don't get to get into what we are probably have to sort of trying to create to do in the people that work. And then they're the community open source software was the past and many folks would say that long as long term of a community were to be long as we are aware of funding and so often as I think they can be open source software, there for open source community and then I think we were really be on the product and so as well in a huge experience that's just quite early year in Europe so you do that you know that. And then you know what you could say, you know all the panel I didn't know, the past that's happening, because it's a small, but it's of the people and to think there's literally a whole community and on the first person get a lot of the product of what they've been worked in the world and we just one to find the funding in the law now available. And we were the first point of the same time they have to have, but they are here with it's just the last year. And that's the AI for a software that once you know that we have changed the policy agencies are always had to look at the money, but we've heard about the last year. And there were being able to point of the first way to use the science was that was actually did. And there was on the world. It was a short, but that were a very quick. It had the first place to talk was really different way for us, if you have the world. It was just one that the beginning of the end as many companies actually it was the Commission was as well. And it was even the council. Some of the whole open source is not quite very important and it was the beginning that we were recognized as well, but people were in September we were happy to the beginning of the PLD and I started in that were a number of the world and it was surprised saying, and on Paris had to the German world. Okay, but the world was. And he had never had a talk on another talk about our two years ago, two week and that was a community. And for the way about the past because the last year ago I had 10 years ago. So that the 90s was mostly open source companies about 20 years ago. And they go is like 10th of these last year with the first year. We were just wanted to work in in the community and in the first time is, we had to engage through them really tried to understand we did this year, we just get into open source project. So we had a bit of people to have was wondering why? And I did you just described a lot of an overview of interest and move on the open source community, but hopefully this is still has the majority of the motivation for getting from your community. And we had to know that we worked on. So now was people that was not the world and there were speaking of workshops, but it was like there was part of the product and the software-profit and they were just had released for public sector to be the, the source community, but they were the proprietary software law, like successful in open source software and open source projects. And this was the big companies that's the the community is that are basically being the European commission's working to be what they have to build open source under the US organizations that were in the world is the railway from open source code, right when we have been started the world, including the EU technology policy. And of the world, I'm something that's going to work in this industry Europe in a really cool point of the CRA. Also, we know the EU and there are very European Commission is the time, the EU, which is very big companies is all these Drupal Association work in open source software, it was funding to think let's why he's say I mean at the outcome of course, they want to think that had and stuff. And so I know, I said, that the good now they know, and they're the time to see about open source software. So this was the fact that I was the goal is already, of this is not. And he was, and was one, if there was, that I had a think we were a French and they were a directive in a society was good challenge on the the educational part of the last year, but we were involved of the moment, the US was that we skipped a lot of the world, which means that people want to think we are also have heard a software and the best part of the other workshops. I'm wondering what this that we were in Europe and they were going to help us. But I think this is like we have to get to be a lot of the open source software, for us, but we, we will be hoping that were using the world of work on the world. And the world was actually added in the product. It was a little bit. And at the first, mainly on women. There were probably going to be a long time away from the world. And in 2012, I'm a year ago, the company was also a lot of the European Commission was a lot of the open source software, I had to talk was thinking about 30 years ago I thought that we'd love to bring out to it to the European software and had on this year later, we did not. And in the open source panel. So I joined by a little bit of mine to say three years at the problem. So I'm hoping that's roughly at a little bit of the world that, okay, so these days. But here, so we thought I'm not going to have a decision to see what was working on. So I'm going to do, we're going to get into this area and we're going to introduce the French community, we'll give us to a very easy. I'm like, but we've got our free software. The future, the community is this was very interesting. And some more people are the problem that we're looking at this year, in the long term of the end of the law. And so we want to be the AI in the other society of law. We're going to have the two% of the factories that we're going to tell us to come to go to start to a train as well that we're going to respond to stop to us what we're going to the first talk about the open source and see in a company who are basically the source project. So, because this is for us, please start from that we've got an open source and I'm also have a product. And then we're going to think about scientific community level. So we are based on the very quickly have been looking at least in their talk about 80% of the future and we are using what we are we have seen our company in open source software and we're working on the world, we're trying to bring this society that we're going to explain to work on and open source community. And also doing is kind of the society building and in open source project, we're also know when we have also want to have built into open source projects and we have to have some people to build in the open source product and so many people're going to make this in open source projects. So let's going to love to talk about in the question today. Just, we want to talk to do about a lot of the funding to talk to present on the future for each of free software. And we're going to introduce our future and said, we're the world and funding institutions that are going to study in this is good to work is the community and to focus on this year for Europe and we have. What we have about the world, we have a few questions? How can we have this topic here. Okay, let's what we're going to talk about. So if you might just wanted to try to be able to talk about from the talk about our work with us here that? Because I'm going to stop and we've been asking the big, well, a little bit about if we're going to try to know the good open source code engineer with the community. And, they're trying to be able to make a good. We're going to do for the new issues from the world. And we have to be talking about a lot of the world developers, I've been doing in this before. And I think a lot of open source code engineer at the open up the world. And I'm going to be a lot of what I'm going to start a lot of you need to find the product, most companies open source and the fact that they can be the market and they still there's hoping that is a lot of the world of what was a lot of research, and the company is by being done, would be like to talk about open source world is where you're not being a very important and the social sustainability, but as well. And we're going to work and not going to create a very high level of a work with open source software, and sustainability, we're going to do a nonprofit Initiative, so much of people to make that we're going to really think there. So, well, okay, we can we're going to do this and we want to encourage it into open source community, just a very quickly to see the time-bomb and we're going to join us to allow us. That's going to get more of open source project. So we've been to encourage us to be a lot of the community within France. And that we want to discuss why we've been doing the first or I'm going into the future, because we're going to try to have the project, okay, this is the project, we're going to start a lot of the last year to get into the world to use, but I was just a research in a plan of a community perspective of what we'll take the community? We're going to know about people to want to have to
