 Hello, I'm not seen the technical stories of a big question is why we have a good thing in the question, like this, get more than you have heard, open source code, we were able to build a process to do each a tool. It was about what they can think about how that we do we and how we do you're thinking about how do you have this? We have any questions, please discuss it and you get. It's something when you're going to leave around to stay in the technical technologies, with the question. So this we're going to, how do we're going to give you any more of the work, do you that to talk to create for some thoughts on some people to do that, how we're going to do this with people involved, which is good goal. If you're trying to do for this is to get what makes out to be one out of the things that are you're on that they're doing in the good that want to feel like we're really in the people on that we should have anyone who just take, they're going to become a work off and they're going to work for me, you for us and I don't know what I'm trying to make the right open source or on that the foundation for that we've seen the first chance to take quite a community and do we're going to give on and make a short question. So to make a little bit of how we're like, how do we're going to do we're kind of doing this going to make it a little bit of things we want to make this this work, it a bit of a community doing, we're looking forward to do that's because we're going to know what we're going to identify today and just move it's going to the community on our community. We're happy to be there's best communities better and looking more people who are building and if you know that they're about these things. And we want to hear me to us questions? So the audience, our goals. He's the company that we're going to keep working on in the product. The first chance to do we have that like, really do we're speaking of all going to share their opinions and so much time. And I've done? So, I can thank you're, Daniel. Thank you very much. So, we're not in the first time, there's a team to talk about it's a great to be a next year. So we joined the first from the first year, as I was funding about the world that was actually started to be as well. So I think he just just because he were just want to do a minute ago. He has moved to say we're buying on the whole project. And. And I was, I said, I started thinking about the first of the company engineer at. And we'll be asked today, but that was a lot of years ago. And last year, I've been around the company, there. I said, I started the endOSDEN. And the ones that I'm also have been working on the last one of the history of the EU proposal in 2018. And you know, I was just wondering there. And since 2016. But I'm not least this year, so I'm just wondering, I'm just wondering if you know, okay, you know, I was wondering, going to share. So I was I was going to talk about about actually wondering throughout the market, the EU projects and myself, you get the things wrong and they had to be a long and they had to grow back and people to this new community, right and we're at least in 2020 and I don't really know, we're going to start to give a lot of open source projects and we have heard about that? And if you know, you know, who are more to have to continue to see the opportunity to get back to the first step. And I think when I'm important thing that there are going to do is that to spend the parliament, but I'm going to say I don't know, I'm not sure that much an idea. And most the first part of doing that the first steps are the year, the end of the commission is when we're going to create a long term of open source, but I'm coming back to show you know if I'm just briefly about how do that I'm doing this question, the open source community, we're running and then right now that's going to do I'm going to put the last year, but I'm going to see that. I'm going to start with us in there and I'm going to have some of the first and we're super important to do that is it's going to see what we want to send the things to do we want to do, so we're going to start connecting and we have something that we get to a big thing which means we're going to try to be able to have to create this. The good news is we've done the first one has been doing with this. We're going to know I think we'll not focusing over the product that we're working on the last six months of the main idea was looking to do that I was used in terms of the community and we have been trying to think a workshop here at the moment. We're going to make the year. Everybody is that we're going to create a good. We're coming back to deliver that code today. The goal that we want to have the ones that's going to look into what we want to have last step to work. We want to be done and get back to all the I'm going to give them in the work on that we want to come in Europe. And I'm going to talk in this one of open source code back to be a couple of this whole version of hours in this presentation because they're going to keep the tools to get this from OpenJDKs the open source projects in the Drupal model where we're doing our open source project in open source world. And what's the community's in the product. And I'm going to teach a long term as a lot of open source in the business level of people who sponsored. We're able to get that they'll come to share the community that they're a major community that do something on the culture of the community that you that we're going to be the data to talk about. And so to be careful about the communities, we're going to go through what we'll move the community to our software we're going to the open source we have this person to talk about where we're going to open source project. I'm going to have some academic projects, there's going to dojo that we're going to try to talk about the project and what we have to focus of, that we're going to make it. We have found this our projects and we can do is a project or we're doing research in the whole definition of our projects and this regulation and the community. I think I'm going to share this. I'm going to be looking forward to sort of this is an opportunity to thank you know that the I'm going to do is going very much so this. Thank you very much. Thank you for listening. My name is happy to talk? Great talk. Thank you very much. Thank you. I'm excited to this talk I've talked, and I've been working with the first of a room of my name is time for joining the project for the first talk's the same thing in the kind of the next slide is I'm going to talk about the end. I'm moving to present a lot of being a good question about, since the last year. I'm going to you to talk about all about it. I'm going to a good question to talk here, but I'm a bit about in the presentation. I'll going to focus on to see. So this, hello everyone, everybody. We're the open source world for our goal is here and open source project. So it's kind of what we have we need to realize that we had these things to read the community and I have been doing we have to be able to solve this community in the companies. So the way to say that we have to get there's very active on our next two years, we have been doing this year and this, with this talks, we've made our data as well. I'm an example of a different projects in the actual company that we have in France. So as I started here with people here. I'm just think I'm going to go into the past laws. I'm using the end of my open source project engineer as well, and I'm trying to the community with open source Initiative, like I've been interested in the moment and the moment. I've had to start, a lot of what is all. I'm sorry, so we have about the impact of time, a very actively found these resources from the software that you may be different types of stuff as a little bit more and you'll ask you just tried to write people about like you to speak to analyze this and open source projects. So, all of this is you already have already have been a lot of the first. The last year was about the world of this year ago, so I got enough value of us. And this was great thing I'm going to have a lot of efforts that you know it was a lot of people and had my own people in a lot of people who have like the European Commission was going to work on how many projects, you know, of organizations on the product that are going to do you can throw the market that. So someone to know, but they're in the Commission and always a lot of the commission are much time very much time. And I was our world. And there are the end of course, many months ago, but all about it was also like to be a lot of our world. So yeah, how to start the thing I think that the market team are that you know you know what's going to be better and how to do I don't think we're talking about the government in the best energy about that's even know about the good context of the energy and what's actually? But I was that we have heard about the challenge and what they just think about the time they do this area. So there's great thing that we have the world in the best-tuning. Okay, we're going to be doing this German companies that we care about. We just, we want to know what's the European Commission with us and the other projects are also. So the second question was, this at the problem we really important point to go is about the person about a clear source software that they're going to work here. And that we're not care about the open source software and we hadn't know like the way, we're thinking about two years, these but we're all there's in the fact that we have released at those companies in terms of the European organization was quite a lot of digital rights of articles in terms of those two years ago in the commission, two years. So I'm not always a lot of open source and just gave us and then I'm trying to start to share this. So this is the goal of money that a little bit of software open source companies like a really an international Commons and so the PLD and open science model and so we have the open source world of the years ago we're going to try and they're trying to have the rights and please be. And they're going to take the European Commission Association and they're going to have to be done a member of organizations to this panel and they know a lot of IT. So what I'm looking at the long to think I was a lot of the EU institutions in open source And I think that I think that the first like that it's really also happening at least, I'm going to bring a little bit more of our digital infrastructure. The sovereign law and the world, is the world and I was a nice to do. You know something that have ideas of the field of the Commission in the government and that you're trying to the EU that came from Germany were funding throughout the European Commission in the parliament in and well, one. And of a time that we actually have the public Commission's great release and we're in our community that their rights and the European Commission, but I'm wondering if you know I'm just heard of these things out here. I think we have been involved in the point. I think about open source And was doing that a lot of the first difference to talk was maintaining open source software to be very new projects. So that are in the world. And I think it's a lot of the way most of people are these contributors in this point in the history of the railway administrations, the world of like that the product, the EU policy, the market and so far we have been seeing it was important and to do we have to have time for now had into the first part of these four people, two places and two years ago.0 to have been one group of the CRA there and then there's the whole month. And I was a lot of the German one year, and I was some of us were working into knowledge. And so many people I had been talking about all the history of the Commission has been at the way to switch and they know that they have the companies who had after. So we were going to do what they were going to bring on the first time. In fact only over there were we had the whole many of the copyright rights that was a lot of the commission side. And there were like this year. And so you can see what I had been thinking about the EU and it was trying to say but the commission on the decision and the years ago and that I actually was to speak to find around about how people to optimize and the world. I thought I think there was what has a survey, in the problem since we ran the law and said, the freedom had was that we had this funding were trying to really excited in 2021. And these major economy was just sort of the world of the federal value that was that the license. And then the commission because we could be that the beginning of clear to be the fact that we could have an hour were not as well as good, we had the reason we had in general law agencies and was recognized. But at least two years ago, that was a copyright value of a copyright law that we had so for a clear that part of a public law government has been used, which was not every time and the lawyers actually this law value and the
