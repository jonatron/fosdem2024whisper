 Hello everyone, I'm going to talk about the Cyber Reseur is kind of a few months, which is a little bit less than the European Commission and the world, I'm curious about FOSTA and we started thinking about the open source Foundation and from 20 years ago. And I'm a bit of international model. So, I'm going to do the last year, I are the first year where I'm going to talk about a little bit about the satellite projects since we're going to have a way to discuss about what if we're going to start changing when we're going to tell because we're going to know if them actually looking forward, okay, and we're going to go on the door and you're talking about the time. So the first open, thank you everybody very a little bit about this talk was a little bit about the first today we've got a little bit of the next slide. We've seen first one of the end that we've seen before. We've done a lot of people that decided we're going to get an office in the product that we have a lot of communities in a lot of projects. And of open source community's a lot of things that we've got as a lot of people are doing people in open source software. I'm a little bit of things. And the AI association in my experiences around some stories that they're going to try to be open source is the fact that it's been in an open source world because we're just trying to try to analyze the project building and community. And I think there's a lot of community engineer at what people in the open standard models for free project. And I can think I'm going to make sure that we're going to work on the future of open source community in the first five months of the EU that we're the panel. And we feel like to encourage people doing the industry, really love these projects to try to fund the very positive and fund for the community. And I'm not sure that. They have been actually taking into the sustainable software to stay in Brazil in a time for the world and if it's easy. It's just a professor of course. If you are very good. We have all these projects that we saw that the community, also the world yet we need to give us to discuss about our rights to manage their companies and we're in the long term. And we are the commission and we also the world and also need to have that they work on the moment where they're doing the organizations in the open source software involved around the project and what we're looking forward. And they're the product for us know, I think we're interested in the European Commission and they're going further out to do, but for us thought that's from the community was kind of the community management and we're going to focus on the European tech. We didn't just going to find me. We've been using civil society and they're doing a job that we'll do a human rights open source community needs to be able to be funding to be done in the time they're the people and it. This is going to look at the way that that we're going to make the funding can we're very interested in the customers against the product with the world and we've been getting a strong and in the whole community. You've had a long had just got an internal member technology in the US society funded by the CRA and also talked to make our idea of open source projects and researchers in the open science standards and in the various open source projects have been the first part of the first person who are actually the EU. And so on the world of a whole company actually the same time and this point. And the key to be in the open source product community. And I don't think it's nothing too far. And it's going to get back to the European Commission lead and make that there's the world that the government, and they're in the world. And so many people are not just learned in the European Commission in Europe. And then. Well, you can so many years ago, people in the beginning of the world. And we've had is the European Union who already know that to find some representative of the CRA is the policy is the panel that the commission. So the world is the CRA that the day were very important to spend policy technology. I've been spent in the regulators and I think we had a good. There was to be the PLD research that started to be a lot of it was that. And this year, by the commission are the commission, a longer, that was a great to be actually I just talked about being part of the majority of the copyright policy and they had, which I started this is an Drupal in the Commission was that got funding when they had. So I wanted to speak in the idea of his last year of actually kept the IT in the time? And that was still had heard about that they was over a bit of the Product Liability, but also from the European Commission has been, but and law who cannot be in the policy was what came to make out to be aware of the CRA and they had been involved in the digital commission is just came up this and have in the court thought that the reason I think that was wondering, was really a very useful panel was the German court because they have was meant to be aware of court law that they did now had to have been there and was a civil society that would be a license about law. And at the idea, and they were a year where they were that it was where they had. So we've been doing is far the commission and they had, including agencies a lot of and so they were basically not a copyright in the PLD is not only a citizen of value that when we made a law in law would well able to be the law to do the license in the copyright perspective of the software is it would be done in the copyright laws were not always some policy and the law and they were asking in September and the law and they tried to also always think no copyright law law, they had decided to happen, but they did was actually need to get the parliament and they were taking in the law. They've had forgotten the copyright value from software policy that that law and they had that they have something that we want to be kind of the copyright GPL law people would allow a law that they can know what that they are going to be a public problem in the EU and they don't even think that we have was a closed for a google I just wanted to do they're putting those elections and you know that I'm not been doing this well and they're just thinking and they're not going to have to think that point that you're on the law saying they're going to be the third political point and that people went started to just started in the issue away so they're gonna be really an was being so you know the law, in that we will do the GPL law holder. Their opinionated work, to tell us that we're gonna be actually starting in money, but that they were just in the same way to know that the copyright goes a copyright is done. It's in the legal keys. It's not the rights that the companies are speaking money did the law, which is going to it's not going to find out of a law and in that they can really the copyright rights to politicians in the value of the CRA of the German law to think and they did the licensee because this point they're saying and they don't just were asked it. And it's going to be it's more law. And you know, you know the license has to know that the copyright and for the policy from the copyright directive since there that GPL because like they're asking the lawyers have been any copyright and because there was asked it was a copyright certification as many parties who get the law. The license, what they have? I was made it was the EU that had to have not because they had heard of civil society with liability actually in the foundation of the human rights as well actually, they had an injunction is important law that she had to the PLD and they knew that was going to just decided to be been in it's actually and they wrote it was going to be related to be now have been told their copyright for that the copyright to actually she was going into a long because she has been said through their money the EU that they never been to be a law that he said the person. But on it would use was like to have copyright copyright. And I've said there were my question that it's also found the policy act on the digital law of why I think that the copyright infringement. So I would think we're a copyright copyright parties had some value to their law that it's on the policies that it would use source license policy, it was actually doesn't a parliament in copyright. And then the policy to do I think there were people were to value of money to turn so happy to basically the copyright value that you came on those value and just had a value in a copyright value that they discovered the economy of the value that she could be even get the GPL. And they have just stop an impact the value that copyright directive. Because because they were the tragedy of the good person that matter of the problem happens I'm not some political law or the copyright means even in decision. And it was about the copyright law to the law. And in this part of this time's true as the next person that we've got a third issue. We had to assume that. And to be great license for the law who have this the parliament. So the copyright license and a copyright copyright copyright license. And I think this know that. And if they have to provide that something else, right way to the GPL is only should not the GPL license copyright policies and they were the market and they're the copyright infringement to say that they thought and they don't have the copyright law, but they're in fact they're a copyright policy in the copyright law cost but they're the PLD. Maybe they're kind of the copyright law one place and they're in the policy. But they're just had it, in parliament would need to have this point. No thought the public policy doesn't in the law that they are in law that they've got these law. And they're not aware of the law it was still need to take to make it still. So they basically the copyright law really they are not as well, but that there's never been in copyright German law has a law to interpret that. Let's not necessarily so that the world is what the GPL might not necessarily be in the law is the law is copyright could definitely not aware of copyright law that was license was a copyright copyright and it wouldn't that they may tell you didn't necessarily need to keep using the GPL said. The German law that we don't provide a the court rights was what it was that I was made in the open source value I originally the copyright and that would not exactly, but it was not for the law was potentially act and they also used to be able to be able to be a copyright because it's perfect, they were considered value of the regulation in the law, but we have just so they do a value as well, but I also the last value of this, because they were paying a policy legal license can't have their law in this value say we think that they had to think that we feel good point. That's pretty much as long at any copyright we knew the government rights and they did and they can't think they had in the decision rights act here are in German copyright law society who will figure out when they have to forecast. And that was nothing on, you're hoping to stay in the way you're not saying that was going to do for the one is just in a bit people that what we started making it is where they know what you might be about the AI, nobody can go over it is, would not the very hard because we want to say I'm not saying we need to do that. And so we get to think, okay, so far and we can't know, but I was saying that's obviously some people who was not the GPL that's just showed in a good. It's... They just pretty much money to be in the law. And so long. I'm thinking about this panel and I think you know the policy to put in the commission. I would have any point of the moment that copyright and then companies are only one of that the point, right? Why is the law to do they can you know that they're not know, but the law goes on the law technology. I'm wondering about the way that part of being the law or a lot of GPL law, but I think the fact that they would have now the court law but they have the license in the law and copyright as a directive they have nothing to be an open source policy to be copyright law. In fact that there were a license and they are also know, but they mean they can think in the law in a money. So really, for the way right? In terms of course they tend to be, but and I think the license law that is an standard law and they're the copyright, but they have a no European law and they're always law, but they're more often so they are hoping to share that they are always have access and they're not free and a best party in the rights and they're not just open source parties that has copyright copyright directive or law and the holder has no as time to they might be just be an open source policies of money of the copyright principle that we have a copyright copyright law needs to a open decision under the license copyright law that sense of open civil product of the moment it. So the time don't really want to be made in but please for the value of course. The German law will is an GPL, since I think that the I'm going to think that could it's not necessarily very much enough in my copyright but in the problem that we keep the world of legislation. So I think there's why they know that product they're afraid in the GPL, there's no copyright only going to be the law organizations that there's going to get the fact that they're starting and you're at the GPL said well in open source community person that they were there's not an educational law for a license space in the copyright law and they're not as a German law to do that means they're going to be just going to be at their non-on was incredibly important directive to think I would be able to be being the source and if they are really open source law value for the regulation and at free act
