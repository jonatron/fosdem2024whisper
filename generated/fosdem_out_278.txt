 Hello. My name is an internal structure for this, we saw before the next week. And it's the Python. So in the current thing, I'm not as well. And I'm just the end I'm not just give an NGI. I'm going to see how many. And this is actually the word that is the first top of the world if you want to have the same thing. And now, I'm going to show this kind of thing. I'm getting to talk about this with sort of a little bit of just going to do why? If a bit from a little bit of a query to create a template, you don't have just kind of a new that you want to do that. I'm going to break a full the time. You do create the server. You'll give you a local server, then you an application for instance it's not just a JRuby. If you'll give you a whole user that's the client, a server that will get to a server. And then you wanted to want to use the server and play this. And the server will put it a server and for each server will go to the server will try to the server. We can just use to resolve the server. We just keep our server to kind of service that our server of come back to our browser and we have a server, but that's a server. Quick who are some services and we are going to enable a server, to pick and also want to deliver your server. And so the server, so we still don't have structured email, if you want to have a service. And you have the want to give you don't the API in a page application client server, which is not going to share the server. It's just to run the server to do a server. So when you want to start up a UI, we need to run and just want to just want to have the server to deploy and a server interface, and what's doing where we want to that we want to download an ID to make the server, this for it, right, so the server? Because we have an API with, you're just want to deploy the to have to try to deploy because there's going to host the end your application, we want to send DNS server. So, and we want to each, you going to do our server to the interface of other methods because we want to start client server, we want to create the server manager or the server. And then we want to start some end-Click API to're going to say it in data, your server that's good to the server. So let's a server, in, the server server, what to want to give the service as an open, we have to make requests, our server, we want to get that? We don't try to expose our own server in the server. So everything in the server's in the client. So, we're already have an open-scale server to the server. Let's your server to read to start with a server. It's a server, you can see, from your servers, and then you can see, to resolve the client. We'll see the server. We need to tell my feedback. We need to keep the server to build configuration server. But now we want to do a clientP server, we'll show you. Most of the server's going to share the, because the server, we use it before, and then we want to provide the server. We have to call them, and we have, we need to do to switch that. So that they want to the server server to the server. And then it's the server server is all open, we want to fix it as the server and we want to try to do this. And this and what we need to handle those Kubernetes server and we want to build your server. So the browser for you need to deploy request to do is doing our user, when you want to work on a browser. We have to need to have from this demo server, we want to be on your end. And this is what this. So this, I'm trying to build a server, we have your server provider. And this side, we're going to start out the server administrator to read. If a request, this data, we're going to just going to be able to get in the server for the server from the server with it for room and then we have the server. So the file ready, we have this, we don't have like the server. And we need to look for instance, we want to create our talk about a stream. We need a server operator actually have a server server. We want to have two credentials, we want the server to create the server to configure data. If you want to create the server and then create a server in the service can do this server and and then we want to resolve the client server. Otherwise, it through to do anything that. You can have to do, in your server. And if you can just say first use a server to go to see the server. So for the server, it has some server for example, right to the server to this's going to network in. Then, just sending email. It's here, it's just going to load a server to do this work on that? You can already have a server that's actually deploy a server to your server, and then you take the server specific server. You have a certificate which you can insert the server to an environment, it to a client's the server image on the server. And then the server's in the same server. So, then I don't get the server because the server will not want to a email server to do the clients. I need to be built on your service, it, you want to. And so you want to write to want to the server. And it's about network, we want some other cloud. And if you to do the server, there's just one room and on that. So the server will help you can see that's a mail client to understand at end. So, here, if you know what happens. And now we're using is, we want to present the server. So this, if you see here. And now. You would make out the request that I'm going to implement it's going to have to be a client agent that's going to talk to show you to be able to be a server. So for a server. You can also want to tell the server. So you a mail server that's part of it's going to do that we will create a server to create a server and we have a login server that server and then this. And then you have a recording. You have an application for the server, which you can replace the server, for mail. If you so the server, the API, you want to end or in the client up and so your machine may be able to integrate the server to show everyone. So this is your service. You have your OpenGL, which is inside a server to do you have multiple server with the server. And this, the server that we don't like your server. You need to do with the server. But, you you can want to do a server to have your server. You want to create an application that, you need to need to, you can create a connect to a server. I'm just put an email. And this user IDP server, MSSP, you have to deploy. The client server to have very secret. And for basically when you do I have a server from the server, then this, you can start with the server. I mentioned, the server for a server. You also for this server so on server is going to deploy in the server. You can see here and we have a server. You have a server. And each server to. You can keep this ID agent using that like the server for a server and then you. Okay. We have a client. You can see this. And we have an client back routine you have a service. And you get the server and I'm going to have a server. And if you can just need to get an end, even even if you're going to wait for the server that I want it's going to get the developer. And that's going to add a request from the server. I know, and then there are not going to set-based server to clean up it's a server to modify the server. So you want to set a server going on one server, or your server or mail server. And on our server at a mail server, you want to authenticate and password, pull up to create your domain for that they're running the server. And it has our server. And now, everything that's going to figure out of the server. And if everything, you probably happening to start this to get this. And then, if you have a password, user ID. And then you start to this, you can see the server, we also a client, but actually know, I'm going to also going to have our server. The email encrypted server that you're trying to share your server. And this request, when you want to do the server, you're not just going to use to store your email server, you're going to configure your server or your a server. And you are trying to create that. You read client. And then you're going to start, we want to do that. You can, you have a server. I want to go to do open server on a server, on their server. In an app will explain to put an email server. And the server is actually makes your server to the web server server. The server or you can just use cloud field of your browser, you can deploy that's going to your server, that I'm going to go into the client will be looking into your users that you can share the server. I'm going to a server in your server. And that's going to send to deploy the this server to IMAP database. And that you will be running the server. You can start to the server to end server in a new server and then you can be you on the server. The mail client now tell you get the server, what gets a server, the server's going to that's going to going to start the server. So, right right side of the server, thank you have I have my server. So the server. So, for a server server, the server, this is useful, with mail server, right server works. It's the server. We have a client. So, at all the server side, it's going to the server. So we have our server on. And client to start. So, the browser. So, we have, for the browser. So, we are here with a video. And the client server to only there in our server with a page server. And now we have a web server into the server for example of the server, this server server. And then we just want. Then we have to create some client to be able to use, how we have your client. So, it's a server running system and it's a server. And that's a server we are currently about the server. So, it's one of a page. So this is the web application of the presentation, I can to start the client server. And that we're saying we are in our data to add your browser. So the server's only need to a server. But, first part of the server. I'm going to server for the server, the server needs to go out it. And then you can be coming on a client side server. It's going to continue to send server. And then just wanted to? You can use it to start to modify the web server to start up clients, and call the client, the client to. You need to start up a server to fetch to create a server. You can the user server. And next server can use the end server, if you'll just create a service to the server, then have to, you will be able to configure the server. The server or your server to customize it will be a mail server. Okay. And, please want to the server to download. If you won't have the server. And you have a gateway, and you can call a server, you can also, see the server of that you want to set that to be created to have the client server, and we try it. So we are a client session. And thank you can see a page. Thank you about your server is your server application, so much. Yeah, we have a server server to do we go to have a server. And, we have a server to login server. Thank you. Thank you and, but, we don't have this in this room, thanks for both in the server, we have to thank you. Thank you, thank you very much.
