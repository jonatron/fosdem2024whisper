 He's a simple thing. I'm a few years,. Okay, sorry, then the next talk. So, this was very simple, we generate them, where we see. This is a little bit of a lot of time. Okay, so we already have their talk about the details. So I'm going to be an array of that are going to be able to pick over the one. And I'm going to actually going to do that. So in this. You can, because I'm going to take a little bit more details. The other, the actual one is that I'm going to be going to be going to do this, okay. And so I'm going to show you how I'm going to start about about. And as I'm going to talk, because I'm going to read to show you a next one of what I have to see on the details. And I'm going to talk about a bit of this is. I'm going to work. OpenAPI at that point. So, I'm going to go for some, there's the main idea to start this feature, I'm going to show you today. And I'm going to stop working, you going to do this, where you want to go to a little bit of this. And it's all these, on what's it actually going to. It has some of, the product. I'm going to go to start to be talking about the most going to the effort for that we're going to think about is open source software and the best impact of us. So this we're going to do we encourage us working on the year. And then going to see that we're part of interacting with us with some of the place to start the beginning of the community. We're going to start at the biggest one that, we have we're building product, we're going to try to make a good, and we're going to get into our first. We're going to have a great idea of the first time to have been seeing it going to be great thing to try to work on and to be able to start to make a little bit time. So what we had to throw a lot of the source code? So this is the concept of people, I'm going to do this. I'm going to try to build the kind of people without having a lot of a lot of important question. And I'm going to say all the software and if you're going to show people to work in a couple of the right now I'm going to come back here, I'm going to do I'm going to make the community worth open source software. And I'm going to be a little bit of the time and I think there's going to sit on it. I'm going to show you're going to be sure everyone, I'm just wondering that back to have people that my hand speaking on that. So I'm going to go ahead of. So, the next lightning talk I'm just going to be a great to worry. I'm going to do something I'm going to turn that today. And I'm going to focus that you very, on this is going to work pretty cool. I'm going to talk is going to be talking about this to put in my own first of the Internet user, but I have some, we have to give me what I'm a couple of the problem, is I'm wondering. And I'm going to talk. First. So I'm very curious about the first one of those who's going to talk about open source and we'll show some people how it's, what we have is we have we'll see what I'm going to speak to come to just a little bit about what was to look like, so much faster and all what we're going to did for the beginning of the time. And we're going to look at the next talk I'm going to talk. And I'm going to talk about this about how to tell me, why folks, the way, all right? So I'm going to us, what? And we're going to talk about just going to try to start the title of the open source code, well, what happened, like I'm going to have kind of the new code in which is the moment, and I'm going to try to take a couple of a lot of years ago, right now. And so big tech. There's the end of the open source code is something that people and the world will be the panel. And so that we're going to do that, that you're going to have, we're going to do, that in the community. And we're going to ask me to work on this, we're interested in advance it's going to see some people that. Thank you, going to go to keep our co-founder and be just going to be a question, I'm going to speak to talk's going to talk. How would like, the day? Some of my talk in the European tech, how I'll give an answer to look at the project in the last year that's going to the last year that I'm just starting to talk to talk about what you going to talk about the years ago. So no, you've got a few minutes? Okay, the question we've had to be sure that we've got time to get into today. We're going to a whole process. So, if you're going to be able to talk to start about the car or you're on a mentor, so something that's all these people. So in the lives, they're going to start to make a first time. I'll come up to be going to keep here to be speaking on the first one of this talk of this to this. And for that has heard about the previous question was, but I could be a bit more interesting. So what is the question. And I'm just for me, I've got this talk to deal with one, of the first time was the time to look up a half of the people. This year's the first thing, OK, but I'm going to say I'm going to talk about where it to get a member of us about how much more questions? I'm going to do that is more questions. I'm going on about the middle. It's how you've got the world of the room. It's a little bit loud, but if they have been the people in the long time. So people, now this is cool. The next one of the EU. And I've already use a community and can do my school. And I've been doing this morning that I'm you so I'm wondering about this, and I'll speak to come back to that we all about coding. It's a lot of the first of people who has been talking about the knowledge to try to ask this and they have to be a bit of us to look like, what they don't want to focus on our data flow of this. And this is in the second, we get a bit of the right now. I'm here, I'm going to say, I'm going to talk to show a lot of a couple of a little bit of numbers in the history. And last year, we're looking at the first one I'm going to add the last year. So again. I think, I'm going to present the slide. They're going to the first one is our first one of the first company were doing this was more on this year. And you. And with a little bit more people that had to do we have these in the idea of what we want to do. So the EUF project that the European EU Association, which is the idea of the PLD. And so what would you are we have started on the public policies of the European Act in the governments. So the last two people had a company that we had to be to see from the most of the initiative in the PLD and the European organizations as the EUists because there were from the EU and the fact, the PLD was a year by the moment that you know that the EU perspective and the IT. And when we had that the EU level of our EU, for the community, a lot of those aspects that the commission would like PLD had to the EU Association for open methodology that we had to set to make in tech agreement on the open source projects to the government agencies and the Swiss European world and they had a company called So the EUEs in a long year at the day of civil society. So if you have been living at every year and I think that we're a half November and with the commission should do. I think that in German European Commission since that would you're doing with more and the railway agencies were like that we're not this? We're hoping to have been looking into scientific government within the workshops in the copyright world as well as a gap of the standards, this in the EU Act. We spent in their countries. And then we are a general law and together. In Drupal is to the EU companies, as well, but also impact in Europe world of the EU sector? And very well, I think the end about this in that we will get first state, how to have a US and it first thing called a software, right? It's a free to try to make energy and to be in a very carefully. And so I think I know about the railway interoperability. And also a long time to the EU policy in the German EU institutions in Europe. And if we are also have over I think we have the commission. And as I think there also a lot of these rights in these kind of open source software Foundation is a community of interest in a great community in a lot of Open Forum law world. And then the world now. But also what they have had to implement and so we know that they have some thoughts on the tech and we're going to get the member of the EU directive of the German law to be able to be great legislation and there, a very important idea that we have to need to grow in a community and a directive and there are at the law and so much the world that the first year that they can be the CRA, the federal gate laws of our German tech was the last year I was one other commission we don't know most of the EU and still thinking that and we don't know and we don't want to influence the EU and a bit off the law organizations in legislation do we had that so on the German law issue of the law has been a source law and they have had the last year ago as a non-source business as well. So on civil legislation that's one of the EU value of the EU law that's just is the German law. In German law of German law and the EU people and the EU law that the tech in Europe of product sector to mandatory law law and the US should be 20 years in Drupal. So the last year that the first court was a open source value of law. And they had a legal software. And the law would like in France is also quite a European law is a law and the law directive. This is actually a law clause in a policy because for the law and a infringement happens a very important of data would I'm probably because we had a law that the GPL law that the law would mean law they would be public world as it's an only obvious national energy law as well because in so it's going into the law liability were to remember so-profit is that it has the notion of legislation and policy to do they did not fit in scientific law and it is represented by the market is important world that the EU copyright law was that we did that is going on government money in their interoperability policy and money that do this was we need to follow the time and open standards should have was to go into that said. So about about legislation because the UK law, we did the regulation that we have been thinking is very important to choose in the Drupal copyright law value in people that, in 2018 or should be used in the licensee by the copyright law for the rights of US law, so that law law and this law. I think that was the same, which we will be one million thought about legislation decided to the commission should be a solar in fact that forecast, the first discussion was a law is a representative of open the decision now the CRA by law. So just the world, they were like some policies and then it was surprised because it, if they are looking at the law, they invented by copyright officers to their regulation law and they were the notion to actually open law and they were in a law that they need to become always made a copyright copyright law for money. So I think more was so they are very copyright holder that this said that work's what was given because that we had in a law was going to the open law because they were on the copyright directive and just worked in the copyright sector then they have a sector don't really need to happen and we have a certification and they don't think that could be it was a license to worry that? Sorry, no. That works? I think it was that they are also give a gap some entity that the liability is that they had to the copyright sector and they were just found so you know that will be made in the impact of the copyright for the license to you know in the law because they were not stop the political so that that the first court has put it was a law on the legislation to and the government law in the license and open source software for the value. And I started in there were the law he also had the GPL she had and he was a GPL license law copyright value and they had keys to know in legal law directive in court of the copyright rights and they were really want to what they had a principle and it was also kept a law, but they were being not going on the commission laws. So I think that's what the law after the person, so they had one year they can always know a copyright rights would be great copyright that they can have more democratic so I was aware of it was like and not a law was trying to the directive that was a German law. That was a copyright point of the copyright that was going to not just said because they had to have the policy. And then from an law has had no end open case that they get an commission were very angry and given their time they didn't have considered a GPL law would cost to be that they had in a good thing not always on law. And this is there was still there was the license and honestly thought that the key keys get started at the rights law has had to mention for a German energy, in a
