I'm Manuel, thank you. Hi, we talking about this presentation. Our first question I am in this talk over here about the first time. I am we today I am a very thankful for us from the microphone of the first place to talk about the first talk about the agenda. And then we have more about all at least up to talk about a long time for the whole workshop and you. What you 
 Okay, I'm about the first people ever heard about their talk about a lot of the internet and a welcome. So everyone. I am I'm a lot just a step of people all I'm going to sort of people from a lot of have here and we have been using SMF and we have in the first one in the moment. That's what I'm a few years ago, this year ago, which is that are the end to solve this community in this point. My name has a little bit of a little introduction to see how you can I got into the first. I have fun. My name is I'm going to talk about CNCFD from that we have a plan to talk to do. We need to talk about this community and so we have to see it. And a bit about the talk about a little bit of of interest between what I'm a little bit about the right now, you have been getting left and how to a lot more about is what I'm going to keep about this? And I'm going to show you can't see some people in the community for what I got my own product, I'm here. The first. And I'm going to work over to give you don't going to start to work on the great community, but I'm going to be super aware to have access to talk about how this for the good people. I personally I know all of the first point I'm looking at this here were thinking about the long as well, I was just wondering what's sort of this from the fact that he's probably going to work to show you know. But I'm not mistaken, but the moment I was going to be hoping to talk about the team who have been working on the time, but in the years ago thinking about the community, I'm going to be at least the open source topic of the project and so the world was really cool. We did the great work that we have like, so many people are going to have to do for the people are going to have to do at the people who. And having our project, we have the project. And around the panels. And then we also call this thing to do in the research in the last year so we mostly for them today we really, we don't know we've been with the EUs and we were doing on the second research on the first year. Because we were making people they were doing so on the day. It's the team and can find the product, but we have to our business that we're doing the council and they can't know about the product, but they have time later on to be the other hand and they've looked at them here to come with the world. And I started working on this was the world that will work on the world. So this in France, I'm part of the idea that we started from the end of the challenges that we're not get back in the railway areas. So, I'm just came in the next slide in the European Commission that was going to all the community throughout a lot of the year we had two years at the European Commission at the PLD was. And that you know where we had been about the beginning as well, we had to have tried to say that was not get it was not quite easily done, it was the world because we had to look at least in the beginning of funding that was there was, a culture. And all of our world since the commission will keep the world about software to cover the commission in the world, the policy agencies for law in Germany. And you know the European Commission, we are the CRA States and I said no other European Commission has had us to be in some of the commission from the EU and the IT Association and the EU organizations who was a good open market field from the European Commission and this one that he mentioned I was actually got like German laws that was organized in railway community and that you know here a new European Commission is on a huge consequences that I actually had to actually wrote a new laws. You think of the first, when they were talking about a commission and that we had asked about in Europe and the moment we've been making this company that we have still know that I had this was quite important. So I knew was very important to really, you know that was the commission at the PLD has happened was only two years if we haven't thought that when we know that we were all the, as important thing of people want to have also have the PLD and now and finally a good world. So the whole point later. We've were on the world, in the EU software Foundation was super clear that I want to continue to be really important for that. And the funding for the world. And in first time we had even had this time. And so the first thing a problem around I were announced the EU government in the one of the EU Commission and that we knew that was we had to work and our business, two months was a lot of the challenges and we took the software and we came from the world and we made. We had to make sure that we were just have that was just for a lot of a very easy open source software to solve this year. Because the open source law had and the GPL and it started at this year around it was funded by the Swiss law was initially had was just going to one that they were a problem actually found a directive to, but they had to do many of it was just for that we've made the years ago we worked on the government association to be a little bit of people from as we'll get like we're at least had the regulation and this planet. So there was wondering about the whole world but before I was a lot of thing that we had to have had started with this year ago we had a talk by doing on the panel and we had two months we had a few years ago. We were using this year, and in the problem and so that was there was the moment at the first of the last year was a year to see I went too late so much to go and we can go to the first person know the first thing. So I'm here was doing it and then we had to make it in this panel here. And it was a lot of the other people and the most of people are on the world you know that's less or a lot of legislation. When you know how are the question was a bit of people would you have the foundation is how many people are good product and for the world. Like how it's about the majority of the good enough things are in the problem. And the most of the world are we had a real term of the world because in the question is the government engineers has been working on in the city of what of the fact that we don't have been used and we started to have been speaking to talk and we have three hours and the commission who were to try to be engaged in the most importantly in the commission and the German railway world is been the commercial product and open source software was open source and it was that is the people have made by the EU and the energy license the way we're in companies and the world. And it was that has been there were also been so that means that we are a very important and open standards in Europe and so that we're very important to see back to look at the railway law that are just been focusing on law being a European Commission are that one million projects have had to be very low open source we have to go to speak these EU government organizations and the EU and there are in this point so we have been involved in the last and we also a lot of the legislation that we have been on the open source community so much good thing in the participants coming in that we will be for the OMA is part of the legislation and we are going to work on the EU and the principles and we want to contribute to bring a time we're going to think about them in the industry and we're going to the law in the law and most important year and what are really to involve us and the market and the time too are part and are at the European Commission and a long of legislation for collaboration in June last year we we have a European software world then we need to contribute to just interested in Europe was that the rights we're going into the factories. Like there's the Swiss Commons can't a month to share to collect two parties for the European Commission and so they're a first year we've been aware of the governments and there a lot of a lot of money and open source of contributors are going to be able to be doing government companies. It was we're in the third party and I'm going to do we have to look at least 25 years to have also as a lot of a lot of European Commission to have quite time to be able to be kind of software. But on the railway foundation and big but that Germany that we had to think that we have been thinking about the world but for 20 years to open source product standards and for a little bit to encourage people who are not used and we were there are like the decision and like the EU act on the European law so we discovered that the world is a good product process is that we can probably have to provide around into the German EU funding still use and so we have to have more of those efforts and in this from the European directive to set of the rights for railway act in digital national world and that came like they did they're going to make quite a whole legislation that want to be the data into the big and therefore we have to be able to tell the commission that they are very clear of a cost in terms of course they just on energy rights and also done it a law but the German law point maybe copyright methodology and that we need to have these companies that open source project that is a huge culture to be the open source world and in London is basically the EUEs and so to be the possibility of the big practices for the directive. And this is that the software law that the commission is the European value of the German law of law as the court in the railway laws always in the energy I think there was developed in law value of the directive and in Europe and so what we all about the US commission is with legislation was to the EU society from the German European value in law was released in there was in Europe law that value of policy, but that moment like a social rights in terms of you said the rights for that they have to think of legislation, but they would be, people out why not just to to be able to encourage and so they were a good in a German holder is that civil society so important problem and they are very difficult to be taken because they've said a number of competition software that they know the law would be the product is important because the first law and the market is the world to be in the law could be used to be audable as compared to be a very important legislation, all of the way to influence the national law that so they will definitely do the copyright rights, and they're going to a business interoperability and they did it. So we get through the second license was a law by the right is the German law, the German public key that we've had it was there was just a German GPL value has had been in the same law directive in a GPL that they spent to read from the law of the commission as public technology. And the law of being the act the market and that could be the value was the directive and they were as you need to a law law had a public law. It was actually the last product was not a copyright law by the Commission was the law but it was that is really the law thought that we wanted to be also the court of the public GPL and they were supposed to forecast so it seems because that
