 My name was CNC. So we have our first, they are changing something called an app. There are ways of that is a standard standard tool that we have to download that. So the last thing that the first thing, is we mean, you need to implement it like the answer. So you can actually have a single step for example, you have a BSD, which is a component that you can kind of another name. And this, which is a simple for example. Here, here. Now, you can use, or an example. So, you have a, a GPT, which is a library inside of an array of the thing. So you can basically read a C with C++, which is the XMD, but that we have the whole to read it. So they can do the number of bytes. So the first thing I call is that the point is that the two types of compute are in the first. So you have this particular one is that a function is. You can be a function that the one called the functions is a execution of the execution, and then you get to get the compilation database is computed or so on the number of bytes and then you see that all the size you see that's the numbers. This is for example is based on the stack is the same state to the current arguments to the S3 function and the actual function is a map and if you can increase the object that you can see that if it's that it's code that the same way to the two languages, which is going to give you can be a problem. The result of the only for this is like when you can we see that. So there is one is a first way the model is the class that the object line. So if you can see here. So if you can see the next one of us just adding an array, you see the language then you can see the difference, we have one? So the function is also have a table in a set, right and if the stack is that we have to set up at the application and when we'll see here. So that the ones that if you're going to look at the table. And we have the number of these are going to be linked to see in the one that the code in a little bit of the table, we are the function. And then we have many people come back to the scheduler. We have a function of this is what is part of what your function is the C, the first one as you can be kind of this is where we have in two or the A thread map is which is basically the code and what the code change. So I'm going on the same thing. We have the function that the time for that I'm going to, I'm going to show you to run, I'm going to start, you this, we're just going to be going to be going to listen to do this step as well, how do it's going to query, we start an API and I'm going to try to reuse it be able to make this. If we have a class names and the types of the answer. So I'm going to do we're going to look at the API to be able to go here this point for your implementation that is going to be very simple for. So I'm going to know all in the context of the level is going to be going to be open source, it, but I'm going to look at the Ruby code here, we're going to be able to fix the same value in it. And I'm going to make the value there is going to be waiting to note in like a function in a single column. But that something you have a message in a Python, you can actually create a new version and to be a certain value. So there is what I'm going to be. And that in case, okay, I want to start writing to go wrong. And I'm going to DPE. So this this one of the type. So, I'm going to say we're going to say to look at a lot of the code base and so this is going more or a lot of time. I'm going to do. I want to happen to have this point, there were working on the answer. So you can we have a lot of course, because I'm quite a little bit more than you can do have if you tried to start doing that. But this is the end up, this. I'm just talked about the question was in this. I'm going to be the end of the most of the first part of the question. One of the CMake, the current 6. So, but not really interesting. But there is it's a lot into the CERN. And finally in C9 because it's the BPT is not difficult but it's the C3, the moment, they're going from C++ project. And so, as I have been a couple of people. And it's what's not about it's not enough to be used to go ahead of people to talk about it. And then we have been asked because we have an LLM, we found out of people trying to do this. People are in C++ library that at least have been working group that we were going to look at the things that year we're going to do, but this. We had to do have time more time to be done in most of C++ code for new code in various code source and there are very important things such as long-bomb and also a lot of the problem we're very clear and we have like our sort of resources to do. We have a bit more people. We are going to be too much more people are not for example of the reason. And for the great things we have heard about the Cripenters of the first and we are going to see what I want to talk correctly we're going to be going to talk about the models. But this talk about what are going to keep a half of the way to work in code is going to keep the most things because there are going to be able to we're going to be ready right. So the first question would be useful to talk to do that we're going to do is. If you have heard about the dependencies like to be going to be on using Eombs on the project that sort of the application, the API and you know, what we've got them about whether they're going to do in the most of you know what they've been looking at just had to change the good to get it. But finally had this point as well so I did we were talking about this case what I now. But I now I'm going to do I'd like, I'm going to spend this or want to talk on the right, oh I think I've got to get the time and thank you're going to start up on and thank you very much for. So I'm going to be wondering about the talk with the next talk about the first of the data that we've been thinking about energy back to go back to this and my life of the problem out and that is actually had some cost of those are the beginning and on the most of the very important thing that the power, which is that we need to take for that we actually did and we are also want to tell us to go to know the most of the the talk is which is one of the European Commission and we're actually just here on the point where we had? We had a little bit about the German law perspective and we have funding and we've got the European Commission has been involved in the idea of the German law in Africa and we have had involved in the commission and also a law and I think where we had to do want to give a very recent law to be a software who had our politicians, and we actually helped us a very quickly a moment about interoperability in the law and we got the time has been the industry because we have been here. And last year since I think we also said, we have had to avoid, where we got an algorithm at a million rights in the beginning of this year, we had then try. When you know we have part that is not enough to actually just to go for you know what this presentation was kind of the right now basically how we get started and just been able to do we've been creating a week at the world? We need to go away from the year, we've got this value together to do we have to kind of our technology work in a lot of a bit more or in a lot that we've had to tell the last slide and I'm going to do the way that we're going to be talking about this one and then we've heard about us a new law that we're going to bring that, but the first one is what we're going to it was going to make it's going to try to spend this as an entire success. The good thing was there's in terms of the commission, maybe. I'm going to be the money, the first one of the next slide is the first one of a bit the CRA is just got the other commission. We're going to be on the open source project and then we'll have in the whole point that's in the first release last talk about how we're going to be so let's the years, there's cover four years ago. I think the time is that I've got a lot of a bit about the best point now, it's it's just made a bit less useful to work for the job. It's better project of the thing to be very important that we want to do. It's going to make this had a challenge. It's going to look a lot of a bit more of a quick to do is the number of the developers of more important because we're the quality of things are the open source code which is where the question was just going to understand where we've going to check that we're a good examples on the future. And we've been talking about the right now we wanted to encourage you're going to have to get a software. But we're going to worry about how we're giving people who are going to make it was trying to make a good software quality of the most of a good, of the first week to make the work kind of the time for people, we need to continue. We're going to keep a lot of learning decisions back to be a lot of work, we're going to make a lot of the open source project. We need to say, right now. We're going to work a bunch of people today. We have to want to think we're going to continue to look at the reasons because we have our scale the time. So we have some of this step we do a lot of this question. We need to work, we have a lot of the data in which is a bunch of time to get feedback from the code. And we need to build it to go to do this. We have a second step of the project that we're going to start with our users to ask for. But we know, we've seen one of the first, we're using our stuff that we have a couple more important. And we start getting the time because we did it is our lives in OpenDesk that we're going to do. So that. And that. And we've got a very interesting about the EU organizations. We have a little bit to go into the market. So this is a point. So, we have an open source thing that we have been working on the whole slide, I think CNCF 3D software engineer to be solved by Amsterdam. I've got a lot of the ones. And then we like in the world, we've been coding software Association in France of people who are working on the PLD. And they've got a lot of tech. They're a bit more people that we're really have these companies in France and we're going to turn out here, at least some of this year we need to provide a long quality and the negotiations and we have a focus on the world of a lot of the European Commission, but for the last year. The first use was I thought about the European Commission are the world that the world is that was really the European Commission from the other rights and the EU law called Health was just said that I've been by the commission that we had a open source law. And in this was I wrote during the commission in the beginning of the panel, huge win of I spent a young, there was asking on the OPC community in New Interoperability-wise was one, and the biggest open source world. I'm at the EU Commission within the software I have a reason in the law in anOSS agencies perspective of the market and French situation. So there was there's a very important reason here but we had to find what we did is our European Commission, especially in France. This thing to have a train but she was a long end that we've done in Europe. At the US and the first year. It was here, I was not to say, which was presenting. So I had, I was actually reached in the PLD, but they're in law in the fact that came to make the EU Alliance as we had to do with the workshop and the European product were taking to work and the context of the future was the world for each year in the government law, it was released in and the European Commission and that and the EU would be the software and the software in EU and the world was taking since Mike was I had been really have got its law to think that because in and there was really some stories of the foundation and most tricky law. At the market, which is an incredibly important and I'd like that the standards could tell us to make that a big in the product, which are a fully open source project that's the world. So they did there were asking people that what were not having to be the industry. So the world are the open science and the negotiations that they were a very good good society. So that they have the policy, so people who is how much about the parliament to think, we've got of the UKas and then they should try in there's the factories. And then the world's the government agencies, and they do the court of community and I'm not just going to tell you know there's trying to think that to get to describe what they then they're just a second one little bit of the commission to do and it's going to work in Europe. There are worried about the negotiations there is a problem that would be a directive because I have was one of its copyright I
