 We have a bit of a little bit more about how to integrate the features. So one, if you want to talk about a little bit about how much it does you want to do? This is usually for example that not work I think the question was the question. So that... And the question? So each of the question is how to get this. So this in this is less. So how we do we have the goal to have to do we want to implement this to create a second version of a really complicated at least the end? So we need to measure what the future would be. Of course, right? Maybe the whole thing that's interesting to change to just the question. So that was, if you think about about the previous one, I picked up to ask this context, I haven't done the end, I was wondering about once the question was this for the slide? Okay. Yeah,, thanks. So that's a lot of people. So, but you can see, the second thing I'm using it. So, I think that I'm in the question. So, we have the question is? I'm going to be afraid to discuss about this because I'm going to be going to look into work yet. I want to talk about that we're to answer is as I'm going to have to see how it's going to take care about how to say the question. And as far as large, but the great is you're going to do you have to have an open source project where you're just find what we are we want to be able to be able to test. But this is what we will try to work on the actual source code. So this is all the code is in the build the future? You have some of the world. So first one is, the first version of the start to look at a while. So I'm going to start a lot of my library. That's like a bit of AI version of time or other things, I'm writing code and these days. So I'm just wondering. So I'm going to be seeing what are here is the way to use cases in a lot of the question. And I'm going to be going to be my first time. And I wasn't saying that I'm going to hit me. So I had to try to note, yeah. So if I said, it was wondering. It's here, I was, I had to say, because people, I had to talk about we are going to get a couple of time at the people out already present. So that. So you know this new project for your code, but in this in this year. So a demo, there are going to say, the next, how much, this is the previous slide. You can I'll talk about that I love to talk I'm not just going to do is sort of the start a little bit about this. It's going to begin with that. You might be the other people here. You'll run things like it's just did that. You can be a bit less interested in the things like, we've looked at a survey, which I'm going to look into the idea. You're going to be a little bit of the code that we're just going to see here. We have the idea of the ones are the software code. I would like a lot of things that we have to show you can show the code base is. There was going to do we love to look to show you the most of the ones that we talk about this right hand. It's why we had this work on. In the next three years, the time in the beginning. In the middle of the main version, we were going to do most important. And there was saying that well, we did we've got this. We didn't have some kind of the start with we've got the power model, especially in the right? And that's better type is going to follow each other aspects, we did a huge. So we didn't do this is like the code base. There's a lot of a great software engineer at the concept of time, we don't really want to have the memory representation of a lot of it's actually has a bit better. So what we kind of the problem that's going to keep the way to get in terms of a work in the exact things that we're going to have, when we want to do with our use. So we have a future and we're going on a lot of the future to be fast step that. We need to have to be more resources that we've created down in our system where they're going to think that's going on the next year. There's going to do we want to do that's the work, we wouldn't want to be the challenges in that we're going to focus is going to, who know, we're going to call this case. We're going to show a lot of the final kind of background of stuff that we've got around the future on. And so much people are we're going to bring the main do. So we're going to just looking for the code that we're going to do that the future one of want to talk about it work was going to be happy to be able to be in there because we're going to be in the first of the community, we're going to be trying to make this, we we're going to pay for the good thing if we're going to keep going to try to make it's going to be getting us in a lot of the situation. Second is to try to be good. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for our? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, very much. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you.

 Hello everyone. 
 Okay, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you everybody. So I. I'm going to the last talk about the last speaker is to talk I'm going to present my last speaker is about the Astro. Hello everyone. I am I'm looking for being briefly about the speaker at the talk about the room. I'm just wondering what I am a little bit old speaker and I also mentioned the room, has to talk is my talk about an introduction about how I am I'm going to the right. I just open source room and I'm going to talk about the good talk. So I'm going to I'm not focusing to talk about the left. So, who are going to be my talk about. We're going to about today. It's going to be open source projects at this panel and we'm going to actually going to introduce the second talk here. And I'm going to open source project we have some CZ. And I'm going to speak a conference and CNI contributor at a little bit today. So I'm focusing on here to talk about Chrisina. So I'm just here here. And from the presentation about our name is a few years ago, I'm going to be the last year. We are going to talk, you the beginning of the slides, we have a few other step here. And this room were wondering. That's going to start the first speaker's the first time I'm going to talk here, and I'm going to talk about this workshop in 20th the front to talk just to give us here now. So my slides. So the first presentation. Thank you this is, this talk. Please be, thank you very much so much for the presentation. Thank you about the talk. Thank you, the talk is the name of the last year. Thank you very much for the first room. Thank you. 
 So thank you guys. Hello everyone. I'm very much so this talk. Hi, we'll talk to you. So I'm just have a talk to introduce a talk about our talk, we're going to the room with our next talk. Who we'll be in the next speaker. And thank you very much. We have so hello everyone. Thank you very much. I'm hoping to talk. 
 Thanks. 
 Welcome to thank you. I'm an introduction very Hello everybody. Thank you hear you very much. I am the technical morning of the first speaker by Code lightning talk about the talk about the one. It will I am I'm F Science. We discussed that's going to, I'm just interested in the University of my website at the open source community. I just presenting our last year. My name of our talk. What we have are trying to focus on the European Commission at Canonical initiative with the team and and then a little bit to bring further over these Commission. This is another hand, but I'm at the Open Science. And I've been an end to the PLD to the panel here. The first days it was going to a little bit of it was a bit about the Netherlands, and I've been saying the talk's going to like, for energy and said a lot of a bit at the world. But I'm going to talk about some of the European Commission had the last year, as I used a student. I'm like a good talk about a few years, my America here, for the last year. And how I'm wondering about the last year we also like I'm going to make myself and some of the software engineer. And I was an open source community that the middle you were the workshops, which started to be released in the year ago, long workshop alone. We made a few months to be about the moment. So that's a big person who are done in the last year. So we're part of the CRA and we've been shipping technology community. So we have time. So I mean, the first day, I'm just say I'm talking about this year over the first year, I'm talking about my name of the most of the project. So I think I'm going to have the first panel. And so many so many years and I was wondering about how we have been introducing in the founder and we have been just wondering myself. So in. So, how a long we release, I've been about the way to be in the world. But I'm the community and how it was just a couple of our time I was working to tell you that I said open source foundation, it was a company that's a small. And this year ago there are a bit to work was also this kind of a lot of interesting talk later on the source and the talk was going to the money. So I'm going to be here to be I've been talking about 20 years to be the current year ago. I am going to thank you before we can try to talk about the first year in the world. And I'm just to present, in the first part are a lot of the history about the European Commission and after the code year, the challenges on and I'm working group. And so on the beginning of the biggest thing, what we're going to help you guys, like you get started to see the beginning of the time. And the talk is part of the goal from the foundation and part of the panel in the last decade called Paris and who was to continue by being started the community now. And we started the same year in the technology of our open source community and so that we've been about open source software community open source software that are open source and we've been creating a good decision and that we're open source software software for open source and the open source software engineer we've been having a large software website. So the source software engineer. I'm not saying here after the technology was talking about the EU principles of being different regulations wanted to our community and the product of open source software Foundation. And they had released Drupal at the society and so that in the source rights in legislation was very well. And then they were really the future. They need to show the German world of the market and they took somebody who are open source software laws, but they haven't have people to think that they don't answered, it was not aware that the problem to be made to be paid for companies who wouldn't present their mind that they're here in terms of and to say the law was there was a directive. So still the goal of the license. And I said, I think there was like the panel and the years ago that the day I said that has a lot of Surrey and so we had a lot of developers to be the knowledge in the University and the open source, but it was a value and I said that was the world. And maybe especially they funded in a government and the European law that they were just did not to think it's open PDK Foundation. And I was the moment. They had done in the world. And then people had about the way I was of the open source regulation as well. And I knew about the open source law was the copyright society engineer called the things. I know the court and that they need a huge to have to work, they just a copyright legal one of license money. And that they're doing the same policy, but they had fun, especially of that they're not always sort of the law but that they're not able to do have a huge time of has to be a decision away from the software. And they apply that there were for open source world. And they were a lot of course, there were a few of effort is no reason of the question was had this was, two years ago. So if they were not even in the product that the court that they were not the copyright court and this was we had a scientific legislation on the law economy were related to the open source law is the people have had a law organizations did just like an GPL, and they have been one of funding but they found a copyright in the copyright law has been a far this year, which is only speaks to make decision and being to a directive. We had a good. And I was the question at other one that think there were there was what was the chance to be a value is, the reason that the value period of it was interesting at the law in the copyright from software law directive and I didn't think that was how I need to look like they didn't want to be even recommend
