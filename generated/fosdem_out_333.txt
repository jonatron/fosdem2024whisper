 Okay. I'm going to work with this with the open source. So I'm going to be a day. I'm going to be talking about how we want to do this tool where we are using our tools. And is also a first one of these sort of some a good thing in the last half in the OpenShift and I'm going to talk about this from the language. And so the next code of a lot of people who has been done in the purpose. But I'm going to show you here. You can do a job, I'm just interested in a little bit. And so that I'm going to ask me, we'll get a lot of learning that. Of course, if you are using this experience in there's little bit of a little bit more than that you're interested in using a bit of the open source project, I'm hoping that like you can just a little bit, like it's in the development environment and more interesting. I'm just wondering if you need to make a lot of people who have a little more details about this? We have heard about a small talk about how I want that what's the CNCF, and how many people can be how they want to express out how we don't have also want this? So I have a lot more about like two people that I think about the systems and the first part of this is a very important question. So in the most of the next part of the user space. And I saw the open source code is the most important thing I also a little bit more important because this is that's great because it's all the previous versions of the most difficult to do we have to have great and they are like we have the world and so I think about the question. And there were trying to do it was about it was great for us aware of the important if I really a question of the question is this the most important question is is, but I think that we have any other questions next question is and in the question that the question is which you remember here. Yeah, if you know the question is the challenge of the right now we had to do what you have as possible right and the question. The question is that we are more important thing that in the only an interesting that we have had to follow the question. Where are still know what is there is the question is there so right and there are that you have four the question that the compiler as you have that you're the right? And of the reason the question is there are this is the question, but how long in the question is this? I think if the question is very different what I said the question? I'm sure that I'm saying you are actually use... Yes, yes, right? I mean the question in the question is we're talking about three of the question, still not for instance I mean that we don't have to do and I think you know is something that right now but for example is I mean what if you have there are tracking and if you use in-t is a question to do to share there but as I think the performance and things like right right so there's also many different the most people were more efficiently you have been done in that's still working on all of the things we have to do. We have only have to work for each question there to also some people that's so okay I think this is that it's more. 
 Okay, I'm going on. Yes. In this was one is easy to talk about is a year. I'm going to thank you very much for the talk to present we have a very briefly to introduce the future to the question. I'm not working on the end of the talk of the beginning. Hi, right? Okay. I'm going to introduce us today. I'm going to be wondering what I'm going to talk about the first. I'm going to you going to try it. My question. I're going to talk about my talk to do you what? I might be working in the talk about my name and how you mentioned before there? I'm going to present you to talk about the most about this question was an educational plan is my experience about the talk about. And this since there is good news for the first is about the first day. I think I was wondering if I'm going to know I think it was my goal about his talk and I think there's mainly in a little bit of the DSEF's a bit to be linked to about a long time to four years ago and I had a lot of the new four months ago not here, I'm sorry, but they had heard about two years ago because they were like two years. And I didn't have like open source and there's not one, but there was one which was a lot of some question was that it was very important for fun. I have no, but I had said, but I was a company to do this year, so far the idea that like, trying to keep it was there were trying to go through the last year before. First of us to get from the past decade now. I would last year, no one day in the last year, but some of the other years ago, after who love to the summer is they were saying 10 years ago, which was wondering which was exactly this year in the last year was that the idea. And since it was there were added it was two years ago. And we had to see the actual people were like this was working primarily in 2002, of the year was in 2014. So there were done the moment that was a year ago. It was actually a great. And then doing that was on the Drupal published and moved things were just had the time and it had the main way that were released in both we can't have to make it was, but also really, the educational panel, when I was very soon, just as we have in the time, to be the EU, we had to ask us, we've had the European Commission's starting to look at least one year we were using the world in our government, but there were talking about the majority of the European Commission, but now in the beginning. We're about a lot of legislation actually funding that we had a new law. Any of fun things were talking about it was a little bit about their law, most years ago for example of the German 2020, so the work they had also have to have been like years ago, which was an scientific law, in the legislation, but also a European Commission and they were only say she has a big work as well, we have been working a law of the law of the software right the law, and that the law. And they we started, so far of these institutions and so they're the value in particular government and they are we have been trained a software, we're in particular world and we have released, you may need to get more power and any energy and so these values to figure out some organizations. So we have any of the world about the only have in a legislation that we have to do more information of the court in a copyright directive and the energy electricity and that it's got in power in a bit more information that's not only also very fast. The Commission's often there's in 2020, they have also in the world that's a half the Commission from the American software I think what they are, and software industry. So I was a moment that there in here they are only the middle of the railway was actually the CRA and of the third country. And that we know it's really important to know that what I'm in practice. And that I'm just was going to follow to the panel and I think about the one here. And the last year, the long term, I'm a member of here is often think we need to look at the goal of the last week that this year if you know, the world will be in most people that's going to make the future right directive using the cost. And that to be the best? It's also more good thing of the CRA is that we might be able to make a very easy to continue to have to have a lot of software that we apply by the moment. And so I'm only know what we had to do with the software to do is we had to look at least the slide. But they were both of the law in the overall European Commission and the only one is only office. So we have the European Commission. So there are we have a company to have some European Commission but the European Union. So there are only least in Europe that we are a European Commission of the EU and the first year. And we have been using the open source world. So we are a long time to have this year, which is the European Commission and if we have an alternative to be done together to the first couple of this year. So we had the European Commission and we had to speak to look to be in our EU institutions in a lot of the European Commission had to be a number of open source panel and railway world where we have been funding to the European Commission. And also in Germany, I'm also European Commission open source software in Germany and I was a successful national time in practice and I said in Europe in Europe. And yeah, this also to be a community and, what I have is an hour Association, all about our world that we would say it from the European Commission have been in terms of the Foundation or also been working on the commission law of energy value of legislation, the government will be adapted to open-term society and that our national court on the European world of free source software to have used started said from EU. And then we need to encourage electricity and they will be able to do and it to regulate digital sovereignty and so we want to find our definition of our main scientific future zone and the term in this year at the last year and about 3 because we have got to have three, because they have any time, you and so this is what we have been doing as we're going to get into this together and we need to do that we have and we're going to talk to have this great to get a good and we have to do the world. We have to share a new satellite and we can have to be a lot of legislation, we have some funding. We're going to help us to touch our goals for the work for us to try to help us to share ourselves and that also having, but we're going to be doing this knowledge. We can think we're going to have our community with our community in certain policy data in the energy science because we've been working on our software science science in Europe is. So that's our last year. So we have a good to think that we need to probably have. This is going to work in the first year in the PLD agencies to do is that we're going to be able to be able to happen in which we have a discussion here in the middle of legislation. We're a few years So this room, we're invited to go to talk about how to do we're going to be able to contribute. We're going to the commission. So the commission is also in the PLD society and there is happening side in our technology, that can we're looking at this room that we have been working on the end, so many railway and we're going to be the commission and we have time we have some funding and we're the last year and the first day we're going to talk about this and as we have a bit of our journey for the panel and we also did some efforts of their efforts to share society and we have to change of the world. We have we need to think that is to do funding into this new sector, we have our own project. Maybe we have our community, we want to talk about our users and we had to go to provide us to share services, we're trying to funding to be able to do the other countries that. We're trying to have funding to interact with the time as a situation that we have time to reach out of the European Commission and it more of people and they would be only challenge. And the time, because they're doing this open source is a good important way. And we can we have these institutions can need to say we want to tell us to do as well, nothing. And so far as we have to work on the product science. So we want to discuss about what we need to have to pick them. So we need to think it's happening in Europe, we have hired a few years ago or the EU government law to have to be open source world which was also more often aware of photos to be the European institutions of the challenge in open source software often and European Commission which we are just hope that they want to have been using with the world and we have been using open source world, and we can't know, and thank you very much for a month. I'm kind of here to have to participate in more questions. So we have a little bit more folks in the policy Directive. Great last year for the founder of the second person. 
 So hello everyone doing here in Brussels and we have five of the European Commission and I'm going to end. I started to give some the Open Science Foundation. So, y'all to present will briefly about the time in the University for the European Commission to the first decade later. Then I'm the beginning of our product of that we are a next two years ago. We are the first talk called Gov society and 2019, in Kododojo will give the EU alliance here into the Swiss Commission and a bit of open source communities and Wikis and research and I'm just talked about the previous company and said in Europe and I was the first year ago. And we worked together and we have got a really a large world where we also in these challenges and I see there we can't said that there were a lot of interest in the team and then there that we were so it's a PRs often working to look like in this point of the Dias and also had an EU as a bit of law or open source software. It was a solution that the only in terms of a term in the Cyber Resiss society. And then we have more time to be in terms of open source law. So in a global law, the first open source product policy in Wikimedia EU. But there's the fact that this company had was that we had been running a way we had to train in the law, and there was going to maintainer. But then the parliament in France and they had a living to actually thought that they had heard about the German
