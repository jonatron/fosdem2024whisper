 Manuel last year of the talk was called CU and to work with like we have support for this. We use our open source perspective to help us to build a lot of work on GitHub repository and so we're on the first of the main talk to the end of us to join this to talk to us to the whole session that we've been doing with sustainability in the community. We're moving to the big talk very important to automate all of volunteers on Kubernetes community going to come to be involved to talk about the product and we're going to be making this into that a few years and what I started to be able to make the world was trying to be great things I built on the work to keep in source product and the community out with like we're hoping to spend their people who don't like we're working on github and we're going to have a part of making open source open source open source code in open source software people of it so we use that's a lot of like and also the best to be done about a way to build communities and things for us and the ways they're going even a new project in and governance and we get to get to focus is already in the process and make there to like the community issues around this sort of team there are kind of kind of like a community team in that's literally had the people to make people in the project in this product because they're not very important product is the open source project as a good to have a better issues and to make it as well working as you're coming into the community so that helps us like just give the effort as I'm going to get forward to another organizations that the educational companies're the world I started to the community and just like to talk here and then the world of the world I think that I'm going to show up together is a business and I think that at the community they're going to talk that their work on the community to give a model and I'm just to the project and I found out of that we've done that we've been talking about the last year 20 years ago is a thought 10 years ago we had heard about how we have ever had to be honest so even here and so the panel was a year here about some questions at so on the panel from the top of next year and the European Commission and we're just take care about the software is that it is what we've got funding and he made a few days in a little thousand people to take that was wondering that we have two years in and we were to do a little bit that were thinking about it was just been a lot of European Commission people of people that we've heard about the commission and we've got a lot of their co-violence of people came into our challenges of people were able to think we were the people have to talk about how we had a little bit of the European Commission and really important question was more and like this is in there were I've got a few years ago but they were a couple of our open source project but still a lot of months because these two years ago so and we had a lot of years ago but we had worked in a whole people kind of people to say one year ago for the moment the first of work and so that from the European Commission and many years spent the year and we're allowed us in the time or the slide in France and in the first step made the first one day. And we have had to work in the same in that the fact that we're done us co-site the European Commission in the regulation and I would be able to be used and so to get kept with now and open source projects and the next one of like to find the European Commission a lot of the EU agencies and that we're very happy to share the big big awareness. But a point people who have these regulations are around the CRA at the European national grid of the last year and the company. So there are also very first year were a year to be the EU EU Association group was it was the University from a gap so we were not wondering about the beginning. And this year ago we present here and now there because we're really think that we were asking about this is a great to be like we know it's now in June and now in 2002 and they from the German sector and they are the US society and they were moving on our discussion to a regulation in North rights to also at the software funding in different Parliament it's mostly on the world that the European Commission in November a little bit in this year before who were the public law. Because the factories were mostly there are other law in this case of that we have changed in the AI and they are quite made a challenge that is really was also a mandatory over a second year and the commission who came that everybody is a good issue that they're done in the European Union and they don't come from the end agencies and they were that they were the regulation community would have been just a public sector to have a big policy. Because also been involved in and then a big thing of value of the moment and a really would be a thing was going to make the railway rights for the regulation and and that the law that has been so so it's of the law for us can be as long and the regulation from a number of American law that open source communities and they were used in Germany and there were so you know there were some German interoperability in national software and they were some mandatory in this citizen but that they had to make only on the GPL and he said that i said that would be able to be open source liability and they are actually their software could be in mind that I think the commission is a good and for the the sense to have any gatekeeper. So you know it's the OSPOS can find the federal institutions to be aware of this civil market is the second challenge and what was a way that should be the world but then for the the impact of the commission in the US law so that the representative of the European EU were and so that should be announced on the commission already in the licensee is that it and the value of the US and the commission field of the rights were the German federal States are even one that was the rights of the German law driven Act are there were shown a public rights of public law that they were released open source business policy to a decision and the open law you know that is that open legislation would be great technology to act I said that had a law was enough law and I think they're in a law when the license and said in a policy I think of the right at least means much the law and that the law for that that i see in the court or it's on the government law in its rights here that she has made the commission that it didn't really have a directive and I think that and he had to go to be better and they don't know who were also on a parliament and that they have to the directive and they get a question about court act down that in Drupal because that's open source software is that the mandatory in the day in the commission and they decided to like to put it would be a national elections and they had this field where they're able to be there was the law that is always been participating on the copyright law and we shouldn't have public world in the open standards and in the CRA to know a value or the parliament and then think we didn't have a trademark law that the EU laws which was a copyright law was that were a good problem that would be it was also very important to like but then there was not always an German could be to like they were like mandatory one of any other government and a US law but you would be a good because we are just have a copyright value of the big problem that there were the GPL we have to be a way that would be there is we would be closed so I was no way to that we have said is another part of the community in the technology that an legislation would need to act. No a lot of this is a big that there was an industry which is more obvious really meant to have to be a lot of the panel that it was great which seems to make the ones and it was in the only be the problem in the EU to be used but there of the question that really the GPL license actually two thing on the railway law that what are all had. So I forgot to do that's what are good question I'm just wondering why is that I can the right so I'm in 2022 all if we have three. There was a very important I'm going to be that we have they asked about it was a question but there's why was we talked about the policy after we wanted to look and we are some stickers of the panel okay but we have the community and we have lots of the only have all these but again so the question means that's like the energy on the issue is, we have been doing that they can always the next to be so they mentioned that you need to have any people to think it at least one is the last year there are not only some of those a good idea of the future of you know you know like that if you don't have a question we have had an interface for with the good question and what was there but also one is coming with the future and how to see the question was actually we have the beginning of the future and we can actually have a day, which is the we are planning to help people to do we have a year anymore in Europe and we get on the back to the train this is going to the right and I think and then the time talking about how I think I'm not about how I'm looking into open source software are trying to switch to think so we work and we want to have to get the discussion about how many people about what we have before we need we've just the communities as a community to do is going to do they have to do that is to be so much to you can look nice for the part of the point and what I'm not open source perspective and we have been working on the people who heard about the public society in terms of this space of a lot of economic in the open source community that we have done the organization and that when we're doing the product and we have to thank you for questions and thank you.
