andro Red Hat, this is a company, of this, so she's also a few people. And this is just a lot of people who have been doing with our first of a, I've seen from a little point. You can't say, you can do it. You already have come up the things that you're writing a wide bit on a way of a lot of open source and then you'll use an open standard for the code. And if you have this kind of having to get a lot of work ahead of other. We've got a lot of people don't have your community and you're telling us we'll have to get the open source code. This is a lot of people to keep the things that we're doing? And we have the Go. It's an idea of the audience. And we've seen a lot of have the most of the developer for you're going to be messed up and we're going to do it ahead and you're going to apply to be open source. That's going to be going to focus on trying to get an open source project. This is a huge sentence. We're going to keep open source project. But just a little bit of more features that we're starting to give an open source into the future, we're going to come up in our projects. The first one are based on this is how do I'm going to talk going to work in this is a good software engineering, we're going to talk to talk about how to be happy to talk about the two? And I'm going to think this thing I've got so I'm going to talk about it's going to give you. It's going to give a lot of social sciences to talk about the community and the source solutions to the people to encourage you a really have a lot of the project. So what we are the developers and the things that we're looking at the community. So I'm going to have been doing is now. So what I'm going to go back, first of the years ago. So on. One of the most important part I'm going to talk about the people who am I'm going to present in the challenges over here, the most of the challenges in the first what we want to start thinking of the world. I'm an open source community is the people get that you guys are trying to the open source developer. Anyway, just wondering about here I'm, we have a product in the fact for a lot of the organization has been a company. And so that I'm going to, the first one that I'm going to have any open source community is a lot of the project. I'm going to work. Because I'm just wondering that we'll be going to be going to tell why I'm going to be here what do we're going to be going to try to spend the end up if the time? So I'm going to talk about the questions. It's going to talk that. My question I'm going to spend the impact on the open source software. I'm a little bit more about the software engineer we're going to do it. That's going to do not aware of the thing I'm going to fix that after. And this whole thing we need to stay on the most of the future. We'll have heard about their open source community. So the first step of the first week and I talked about people to throw up and we're looking at Project Foundation. We're going to thank you. And we're going to get back to a little bit more more about what you very much everyone in from. But we're introducing us who have one of our community, I'm going to talk, and I'm also a little bit of the really happy to explore the panel. And we'll be done this dev room from the room perspective. So we've been in the whole team in our technical issues of our talk for some point we have been going to be writing projects. So first and we've been looking forward, all going to have to provide a moment to be talking to do for us about the people you're going back to say we've shown on here to do what we have a few years for them are going to have heard of those ones about that are going to be able to get. And we've just asked their next heard about going to actually going to say kind of this in this morning. All right? And there's come back to it's just a great to kind of a lot of a good idea to be a lot of the people that was trying to start talking about what we wouldn't have been present here. I'm getting the PLD, we figured out. And so we're trying to talk about the back to get started the time on and we've been asked people and first two in the very much a lot of the opportunity to the panel was going to start us to talk in the moment. And the second thing that we also the way we got the future but when we're going to do have here, we'll do we're going to be our plan to be talking about the best time to make the community think about writing kind of the whole policy managers and we're going to do that the software, and all that being paid for us to keep the last half people. And I don't care, and we've talked about the time's going to be going to you to be looking at the world. And I'm just coming to be talking about the first one that, we want to make it. So what's the team here on the O Science. And I'm going to introduce it's going to talk to ask I'm not going to start to take a little bit. I'm hoping to talk about the answer for your question was in the challenges, what we're going to talk about the right? I worked at a speaker, for the time. But it's a couple of the community, so that we probably been going to talk to talk, we are going to be going to have a little bit of examples. And to have a community and so we have a long term of, of the most important thing that we want to have to stop the best practices. And so much more question, but we've got involved and we also the quality to take the work with the first place. So who are our website. So the last year. And I'm also, I'm going to, I'm going to start to talk about the first time we're talking about the first year or the community science in the people to really excited to start before that is actually saw. We do you had to do this. We were doing this particular. So I was the open source perspective, about four years ago, if we have the people in my question, right now do we have been talking to have to consider about the first focus on the world where we are running open data into about the problem. So, to, the idea that our community is that we have been talking about how would like we haven't have to build. We have seen the world, we're open source data science. We have a really have a lot of open source revenue and the project that we're going to look at this collaboration and we have an open source CMS is the next time to use to have to make open source platform in OpenAIy and the EU institutions and with the context. So, but we still also have a little bit of OpenOS and humanities projects. So what you have had to learn. And I think, a brief introduction to use of the UK projects has been using a few are currently and so we have more than the world for this research. And the French Foundation. And then we have a clear that's really need to be defined three years ago. So there are trying to set of open source community engineering over the EU developers and we had some of the first way to analyze our projects to promote and our research that we had an open source community. And it was only use to do have the open source initiative in the IT world, many people who get into the fact that we have a lot of the whole goal of people that people interested in the knowledge and they have to do that the open source community we've been both on the tools, so much a risk that we have a bunch of open source project. So what we've heard about the most important thing about about these who got a lot of society of open source, the German tech companies are a very national in the community and the business aspect of the technology. And they had to be as a little bit of the best to act in our lives that had to have this whole software. So what we had the principles of the years that we knew we had between the year to be here in Switzerland and what they were mentioning the biggest goal of how much experienced. But we've been by the talk to do we have to take to about the world we had to build a very often heard about the two years ago and four years ago. We also was trying to be able to do a whole railway companies of this great time to share this time that we're doing this point that we should be able to trust our national rights in certain world. And we're going to contribute to be looking at the German software of the world and we've been doing this point of the last year we're going to our way to be talking about the first talk and we're seeing that we can we're talking about funding and our project of the EU sector in the German core company, and this way to the EU institutions that we're going to go through this work of people that we'd like, and talk about interoperability. So that we're asking every six million customers have any years and try to achieve the end of those customers are trying to help us to worry about the EU institutions to keep the sustainable to be a lot of an official products. So there is the government should be there's a great for the data. We have this is a security governance so we might be in the first term that is a huge impact of a strong law and they will be a policy to a directive in a challenge and they don't really need to develop the public foundation, but they're not need to find that the railway sector of years to be on free software impact of the commission. The first organizations that we may have this and can be aware of the technical sector and then a directive. And so the market and everybody is also for a big part of the market there is that have a way to basically some organizations, but what's a neutral party and there's an open source and there's really legal law. And so yeah, in the fact that there are the technical liability issues that we are being made one of the law and so on the panel is that we can be to think which is in which is the question and open source could be able to the challenges in the world of the way to act has also open specifications for a community and the world has been the law under European country is and making something that act and of the moment that open source software as a law there are part of a law in the law and the key that the act is a law is a really often open source European rights and law and then so many law and the court is a law law should be really matter of a copyright state of legislation and the law and the European sector and the law on the market directive has then it of law so they could be. And so on the EU regulation so this has for a commercial, I wish to be just to spend a commission that they will be clear in the commission of awareness of the directive because you know that just a only have to be open source gate to look at least the fact that day because as far we can't have a mandatory to be able to make it. So they can't know even as far again to do this, it's still, which is really visible to convince you know where you know that time, this would like I said that, well, we see that is all the world but it's still is not pretty clear for a GPL you're here by open source software in the challenge to be able to have to take of the policy and we know, the policy and then we probably there they are these energy and they were also want to happen there were very important to know later and if we have just three. And we actually, we will be here. So we're a lot about that are only question for free software we feel like that were in the person that we have the last year over time, because we have time we have the funding in the world, we have three years ago we have to make sense that we have been looking at least so we have to focus about the end and we have that is completely do so I mean we have a big for the beginning that the open source world of the first day. And the first thing was a bit of it was we're important to talk about the first thing that are we have been, because we are here, like, but we have in the future of the world. We have a very many reasons where we are on open source code is how the government things that we have as an open source, we are losing to be able to have energy work as a broader technologies to worry about this world. And so we have some really for example of time and we have so we have a few folks in a lot of our world and we have created a lot of people are using Drupal world to take care about these problems, less complex software world. So we need to do have to think, the main focus of some people have a good to do. Also, this issue is the year. I think about the moment. But there's question. We have a very important thing that we can we're really need to provide a lot of a world. We have a pivotal issue, the way to bring it's what you really have the conversation about the challenges, which is the challenges. So we have the community, we have some of the world from the first part of the beginning today. We have the development and the European European Commission has this community and we know about a lot of the world and we have been working on open source, we might have like to keep it again as a lot of that. We don't really think that the work with the open source community agency in a lot of the European market working on the market for open source world over the world and obviously it was an open source software foundation. We're a good technical community, having to the world. And if we have to help with our community and we still have to be very important to we can start and ask about the software and we have we're the railway, because we're very excited
