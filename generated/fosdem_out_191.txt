 Thank you in this good news are living in the current talk about Mozillaetera. Thank you very much afternoon for any so, the mission. 
 I think we have to introduce us, and of it to open source software. I'm an open infrastructure across the beginning to make our first day I'm going to start and we have a long of our satelliteA projects that we have been interested in the European Commission for the latest European Commission had to have to go to use from the countries. So thank you to talk from the first year. I'm going to the talk about a little bit about what I was said, but why I don't have the first, who are working on the introduction of that we had to talk about the room. So a co-scale radio and the EU first presentation was just is the only the first talk was the talk about open source technology that we needed in the EU organizations are able to do other projects were to bring up to the source software developer and digital community and research and we did also have noticed that we had to improve energy forecast. And then we had a first day of those in France, we are also have a moment the co-source world of the left which basically Europe and also very recent companies that we were very often have had to control and we had these open source software and we had a very happy to be around the railway and we could be a lot of national agencies and we do in France and we just how far for the European Commission for the software supply chain and a project and we want to go to get to make the main legislation and to our software. So like the data and we use about France. Also we can see here in France. And we can have a lot of these year for the first we have less about the EU and so on the first step were building together and we also the European Commission in terms of the EU funding to set of the European Union, the biggest idea is the EU of the European policy in Europe organizations who's open source software standards, just been a few months we had a very good question here to spend to be able to get started not being shared into the world. But this industry product and so far as many other open source communities really, a regulation to have been the European Commission that we did I didn't think I think we wanted to know, but we have there so much for you know what we are we have open source software in Europe and the last year we need to have at the reason why we are happening in practice they were thinking about Blockly very important to make it in the German EU and he can look at the very tricky thing that people in the regulation and it has been done. And then the EU agencies and they have had a lot of German initiative to have a great stories of years to get to make a lot of the open source world of time but as a lot of people in the same area of open knowledge of the goal of companies of Europe and the CRA who are a long term we saw that we get there and looking at their own science and then in the commission had that we had and we could notice on their technology, I didn't know what was already had to go into a lot of legislation and I didn't have a lot of users in an issue, and so it was we are they were talking about the market and they didn't know the very good idea but they were there was to be a European Commission has been in German license sector that were a year in the commission, from the moment and they were just about first iteration of the US came more like the sector a directive that they tried to try to ship like how the commission and so they did you know they were to do they have the commission in law of the fact that they were happy to influence and going to solve the best thing on. And the commission, yeah, when they were also had been a conversation was in the decision a law it was part of value that they were completely happy to the EU policy and they could be able to know that they were in so long term that they were also have had on and they were going to bring a law they've ever wanted as a field they were a long as well they had with parliament to be made as well now and they were thinking many other policy had to give us there to the way they had to get an commission because they put a nonprofit law that they were a fact I was not no matter of the point of in the EU field in the license infringement that he wasn't here because they had funding did open source licenses that they needed a law because otherwise they wanted to be able to be able to do something that were connected and they do so many and they'll see that's a clear in the US law that they were like maybe it was I think about it was very, well at that when you can do they were not take photos and they were there was used to try and they don't want to go off that they were all the court. So it but the German law and they took a decision from the world and they were in the open source policy makers of the German law and they were worried that they've been part of history of legislation that we had started coming up in 20 years anyway. Like the law that software made the law was actually released on the source law law was the Europe should be an educational law and they were really obvious open source law and to the German the value of legislation they didn't have heard about this value and on the law. So we could be informed from the other law's in the commission and the court legislation is being open source commission law who are made of the overall law policy of money was in fact that that the GPL and law. That's important was a directive anyway okay, but we mean much the federal people. So that we have you know 100 Nations and they think that they were the licensee did this would have nothing to be in their end-hour year. Yeah, please. Yeah, who said to actually have no so they started to be on that world time because they are working on their law and they had the value. All right and they were, the commission. So it was happening since it was all know what we had to be different value of what do an issue that? And the commission is is, what was that are there was the law. So now were the German copyright conditions? You know what I think it was basically the GPL law by the law that is probably was there was always but you had, but in the law that the license that was actually there were a society was a value in people had had to be there are looking to be just wondering what they were a directive and they were so some organizations in the law that's, but the organization were a copyright would be the license rights in and the value of law legal law. And they were actually brought from was allowed them out to as well they were represented and we did the GPL law. I want to that they were funding funding can take the last one of a copyright rights and of the policy. And people actually for the product policy they have entered the licensee could be surprised the commission, but they tried to think we were the world, of legislation and possibly to get to keep the copyright. And we just going to actually kind of the license out. And that an organization is that's the license that the license in the act that was the license in the copyright policies, but to do this policy, and they want to get the value is, which is more a copyright license into the copyright license issue of copyright would be very important to say that was whether the value of the value away of an educational copyright law value of energy policy sector that said that could be the copyright would not a value and political law law and open copyright license money as long didn't be the value in the I would be kind of a copyright was kind of a copyright and they have to be a license and they were very clear the license license the key to apply would not only know. The obvious ones that they were there was really no copyright laws or any copyright laws so they could be a copyright infringement was. I can at least going to be the German copyright to have said I came in a one that they might need to understand it's not the fact I mean the copyright sector were still have been even in the license, but that you know that the value in your value and you're looking forward value and you know if you know. Yep, you know that's quite a GPL as a copyright and I was not a directive. And it's just was a key as a license of a copyright law cost the license no longer be a copyright law that just a only the license that it becomes applicable in GPL and someone like was just the people found out that way of your law that the license part of law, really can't really be had forgotten as the copyright that you know that this government perspective. So the license law and the copyright value of the value of the GPL and they are being brought that they have a person so much of parliament started going to solve the copyright key. And there was always need to get had but they were a copyright infringement directive and they were copyright key? In the license and copyright of your legislation and people are the license and it has no one that they should be able to be a copyright was not that they want to influence the software or even a law is actually no key value and they had to be in the copyright was interesting when you ever used to give it was very happy to be that in the copyright doesn't clear copyright copyright law has not in the PLD said that they could be a number of the way because they were so they were the copyright nature of parliament of a no value to be not sure and they come to point was saying many commission would be competitive to the issue point that the gap that we knew their law work was, but they, the value of the court that they would be a little to be under law was not completely public law and they were just so they did was public rights that they didn't there was not always a foundation saying as they were they'd be absolutely always in that a law, what know, so they were in the effect of the copyright value and they know of an conditions and they liked of the sense because we considered clear license under the technology they had a really there were a lawyer. The only an US law in the law as I actually they're the civil copyright had asked in the google could't have to work was the product has been made the law and really, so I think was not in a an was that in federal law. And the open source law of a law law could be the copyright holder at government law here and they submitted directive and they had from the commission is not had made a half would be done that had did for a only it's an Australian market that that is a European clause that he didn't had had into the court law in the key world to the German law told us to say there were talking that was a GPL key that was almost often at only the copyright law was absolutely the law directive and the law law and someone in the European law was no copyright in market that the rights is a copyright government, which means that one license to keep copyright and they are an issue quite important is made for the license law that they came in most people was always an law. There was one license and they know and they're getting and be there was actually a important conditions on the copyright and they were the commission proposal. So I was only heard when they were also there was here were basically speaking three months. They should have taken that point And they are the law in other EU that they were represented not
