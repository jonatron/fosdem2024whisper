 Thank you for our talk, I'm going to talk about how your attention. I am, what you think, how we are very happy to do you have to share your life as well as well. This is the rest of a lot of people in this, some people in a bit of work in the time. And I'm going to be going to talk about what we would say is going to keep the issues for all have done of the things available by showing you know what the people that want to think about doing is that you heard about how we have some impact in this time. And I'm going to work with this ecosystem, we've ever looking at. And I'm going to look to make a little bit of people, which I'm going to talk to show it a while, well, to say, let's go. So, I need to talk about the first talk about me about that I'm going to get this. This is an hour of an hour. You have a talk to the job to you about this? The first one is a little bit of the first thing that is the answer is the next thing I want to spend the things that you talked about, more, maybe some interesting thing I think before is I was using this small difference to do. It's going to do is that I was not like to spend the first time. Some of some of the things I was just want to show you to you the problem. You can do this, you should see more things. I'm going to do the question. And this? And actually just a lot of the question is, what we're looking for some to analyze the idea. So you are here, you want to pay for example, what the vector for the question. And as fast with the general impact is, it should I'm going to keep doing. So we're thinking about, so the, we have this presentation, we want to do at some right now. So, we have a demo. And it's going to come to do this. Do you for the first speaker, we have to have a bit more questions? So what I'm going to talk, we have a little bit. Okay, I'm going to talk about the next two minutes. However, now, if we have a half an interface, I love to have to talk about the, for performance. So, if you have a lot of the first one. So, the most of the future, we are we need to try of the language, and for us, we have the question I have part of open source in the end. And in my company, like a talk is called 3D compiler for example, but for the question is the software. And of a lot of how does it would be often. So, we are the work. So I'm going to have a lot of your question we have a lot of other projects that we have the community for this project. And we're going to do. We are talking about the important because we would like two things like to do I think is like to know, like to say we want to focus on the next two main goal of the vendors, but would like the right? So, there are an hour and we have three months to look like that we need to go to think. So instead of the third. So we have the whole process of thinking that we want to be in C++ code for the things we want. And we have drawn at the main point here is to talk about the challenges that we already have the moment to be aware, when we have the LLM is important thing, we want to make it. So, we need to learn in the LLM, we have a standard. So we want to identify our API, we need to choose the, we need to modify the future error API and we have to the LLM is a common here directly the product that we need to think we have the knowledge for our API. So we need to create, and then we also have a lot of the time. So we are like, we have your case, we have a lot of data for the middle of documents and we have our partners in we have a little bit of these questions. In how to share energy, but we have a few questions? I think about the user data in 2022, all the API and we have never have time for the last time. We also have some legal data sets the data end, we have been with the question. So we need to pay for us to keep interoperability and we also to ask us to have a problem with us. And of the EU. And this, like, when we have the end to do that we have a user usage. So, we can we have a first of course, and we want to take to create this. We are collecting data science and which is a bunch of innovation that we have we are also talk about that we also is going to be great if you. But we have a little bit, you have some users are here and you know, not on, but we need to look at the beginning of the question. We should be there are using the business security is the end of our software and as well. So the quality management are three different parts of the current world that the other future and the one would be one is important to be as a very early world to be made in Europe. But what people are I think it was here and we have done in a great person to get a general science and a lot of that you know that you know that. And this is what we use case, we have that in a way we need to implement already a way to work on a community and we have created in a community. So we also using the end-time, it's so I can't think there's the work on the end-it-friendly. So this is a, it's why the room-Fi is the people having a little bit of the room up to discuss with the room and how everyone. So you have the car with the room. The last year. In this is that has been doing in the client. The PLD to have the room. And I'm going to work in the room. And I hate the room to be a good. I'm going to have to be able to not sure, but it's the internet and especially in this would like so I'm not said, obviously we tried to get more. I think you know what we've built a good ideas. I was at all the talk about before. But the moment, that we have, we're trying to have to worry about the year before, but that we're trying to talk about it's a small data for starting to be a little bit. So, just a short. And what we have we always used, right now we are going to know that will get our data. And so okay, okay. And again, we need to share our data in the data. So we just as well, okay, the first thing we have this for the database. That's try to be the server so we've got the most important to have which is there. So the first thing that's a data is where we have a challenge to make those projects. We have a goal of data in some sort of our application that we've got our data in the data and then our data analysis in the cluster and that is the second data. So we cannot be able to put in the data ends up a data out of the data from this data so we can be able to work on the data into the infrastructure in this cluster here we're coming back to be a service, but we need to expose all these are very often going to create cluster a solution to, we have to generate our data to set one level, so this is going to be a query that we have a data to do this, right now to have this data set of the data up and the data that we also a field of data. While each other components are basically the data that are for this, to start the data provider. We can see the LLMs of our data and we can be our data sets, we've been doing, the data from time there really challenging to make some data. So what we can we have this kind of the data in our models will provide data and so that are working here and last three table, which is the data and this is actually but we have every data types of this is also what we have in the data to us, this in here with data. So we've to keep the result in the data. So this is all have the features that we've been using a very important data from these data is the DAG and the table there are also these types of a type of data detection, we have many challenges of data. We have an expert on the data kind of which is basically the data into which are the data in a lot of the data which are multiple data, the data. So if we are we're our AI systems are talking about business data and we are not going to do want to have some big value called the data, the data and the data, there's all open data has been into different types of the data model and the table of the data in the data we can be open data to all the data in those data centers and to a trainability is mostly about the graph in the data between data, where you have also get more impact that you don't have a collection and I can be the data, this data science about the data sets would be really do for us with types of the data to this. I don't need to be some data description of the data. So as well, you can be part of this is you can one that object to look at the data end. In addition to the number about the data data for example, but it's also is the data's basically the data quality in order to the data, but if you have the data, you want to, you're going to have to match on the data data, the table. We're very well. And we're going to be in the data from the data. So these are the data, I think that I will have to get two kinds of those models that you get to read into this table, but there's the data point of different results, the data. It's a lot of data, you can be called the list of patterns that when you have a data that you need to reduce in most common modeling, it will say, you want to have to have to get it you're not necessarily going to go to be able to do and you to see that. And that the right? So you have just one side. So the first thing that is this is that you have here, if you can match statement on the primary, you have never need to know what you want to store that the data, and you can see, which you can even get to be shared to what they'll be is. So that's that if you haven't just took this to be the data set of the data. Let's what come in the table, we've got on the whole database and the topology is the database. And in the data that you were in the database that's kind of the data is the data from the first one of the way to each one part of data is when the table. Usually what do you know that you need the second question, which is coming to get in the data. And on. The question is to the model where you're doing is, you know exactly what's all a table of the properties. Now this type that they're this, again. So this is the data and there's because you change is only the database you get the data to clean up the columns. And the database around the data on the data and then things. You may be the data set of the data. I started as far as the data that they take a lot of data to the dashboard that we're important to the way to set to map the data into the database, and so these resources that we're going to the first note and the data is the data. And if you're going to it's going to start our table, I would keep to talk about the data model of those are in these are now. We're going to focus. So, but in this is just a definition of all these are the data structures that we, we're going to make a data and this about the data or this data and we need to reuse the cloud in this for example of that the data with open science. So what we are we are going to know the second data in the impact of your data in the data and so that the data. We have which is a data description that we have a very common level AI and we get some data and we're going to learn it. So we're going to define data, they don't going to be able to ask it. So we are you today about this is this data is the business, and the data. So that you want to do we are very good point to do any data in this is that the data is a good to the data structures in this is like that we have a type of the way we have. And we have a data is like, which we have to create a data that's going to continue to interact with a list of the data. So that the prompt is how we also are going to provide for us. So the most important thing is the data is at the end. But we have other data through in terms of the first it's it's going to do as far as JSON model and the cluster, open-position and the case. How I've been using the description. And basically but it's where for example here, like in the data is where the data call. And it's that actually available what kind of the data is the data in the data. And that is just get into a data? This is really important on the data, especially how we're going to look at the data very clear for example, the data sets we're going to set here that we're going away from there, and there are no data and if you want, you're going through this or for example, or maybe it's important to do we're a lot of the most important for any of the challenge that we can be in the description of the question or how many are the data that the data is going to start in the data is happening in the data? So here in the way we're going to create a little bit of this is coming from this presentation. So I'm going to get,
