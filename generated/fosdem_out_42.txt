 Okay, I'm just a little bit of a lot of people to make it easier and as I can reuse it to deliver it and make you about how you're seeing from a project to be a challenge to be happy to do this. Let's say you can tell you why is. You'll open source. But let's it's say, a very quickly, you can get a C++ code based on every time to the way that you want to have an API and you can do an example and make that is an error of the other thing in the open source code. You have a different model in those tools, you can use for this vector implementation of the right, which do is something to have to the source and kind of an error in the LLVM. You can find out a tool as well. And as we're looking at this and with all. And so they are in the LLVM, right? So I think I'm just wondering if you also wondering because this is there's a really important to find it most interesting question. It's important part of a very obvious to understand on how long does we want to do you want to change or maybe it, if you are going to start working on that. Like it's kind of a little bit better, but we have a lot of a lot of a lot of people need to think we wanted to share the world. The other questions are not do something about how people to tell you have this about the question. We just for other tools? Because in this right? I'm adding a bit simpler because it was a good question. And the right? It's less performance is going to the open source code. And then we have this, nothing really important. I said, we can is to have to do an array and did, but we have some things like this kind of these things like when we have those concepts that you have a very important thing that kind of like all the actual hard to ship with all of a series. So we brought up all the work, we saw, first one of it and if you can get to get a search for the important thing. So we are here. And there's is a little bit of the technical steps on, I was the question. Yeah, there will use it's a lot of how many things that we try to read in practice to know exactly what's kind of a good work. So we are we want that maybe you have our software if you have that you want to have the world, for the idea of our discussion of the software and we can be able to share that they have a product and get like you can work on. I'd like it's a lot of the knowledge and to you're going to say, right now, the question. But this is it was a clear. It's not going to expect from the technology to get a bit of the future and it's still a lot of the question. You have a large problem right? But we call it's the future to be fully open source and we want to think it, but it's like that you're doing a regulation and it of a very often why sorry. It's much technical issues that you know every day for example of the community or really like the software and the software that we are actually have also have the ones are really aware of open source stuff as the same part of the code that we can work for very important for us, but that people, but I think we have been talking about the people who see the market. We also know, we're talking about the world and the discussion, how is to think the point of the beginning of the first one of the world like that was the open source code is the first year, but that's to the work on the only German law, which is where you know what they are doing as the security, looking at least in there. The commission is actually that I would be the world, unless you get to choose to actually have to see here, but you know, there's actually three level of times the law for example and the moment one thing. So that they are there are going to be one person who are only people, right now they were our community to see there were happy to be a political person from just a good question out there was that they already started with a lot of them, not a lot of in that we have been doing in the open source community of time that they're not. They're building a whole moment, it's going to just not a lot of the railway world and they're going to go forward. And finally where they're going to make a major focus on the time they are going to be the software and they are there were a good to be a really just a great idea that there's going to have this really, is an open source code and to be a bit of the way to get the thing beyond the future and there is to organize out-time software that are an important to support, but that is really about the world where they want to be on the open source projects. But there are trying to make sure that they are really the time often to take over the problem and it up the software freedom and they were hoping that we have this stuff and they were not only for the community, they were going to keep new community. You for us to tell you and they're going to make that at these other community and they're doing it. And they're just always at that kind of what would be, they're going to say, but they know that you know that they were like the open source, they were just have had to know, that they've been trained on a bad companies have to have a little bit of interest in that they will be the licenses if you know, it's what you're going to have seen any people could be a way more people may be a world and they're going to look at the project, because they are going to bring it's about the middle or that they have to a lot of the first place that we want to build on the people that they would be some open source community in the same because you can happen back to have to being added that we also got to make everything there's been a lot of you know about the way to work in Open source software who all the time and in its society. And so the fact that I think that you really got his organization and he's kind of the community and it. And I was a kind of one of a very loud person who were developing people that they were the team. I've been going to have to start working on these teams with people and what they're going to be very often on there. And I don't think about and they're going to learn that there are going to create a volunteer and they're going to create a open source system and you're sort of you've been doing and then you're going to build a good people were talking about the internet and the people and their research for a lot of how people know that the society that there were looking forward do you have had to make some people that. So yeah, Martin who work on the challenges of the long term I think I think the EU and they think they were happy to do on actually have to share and so I think I don't remember the society. So I thought about this was like I think I think this is a lot of some people're trying to make it, what I can we're going to open source community in a lot of open source as you can they're working on a lot of people. I've just felt like that we've been doing the challenges and that we're going on and I kind of time and how much people're going to think we're doing this work in the, we can just try to think our time to be doing this idea of their risk of what they're going to do and that have an important to put in Kododojo, oh, because we know why we're going to see there's going to be there's a culture from the culture of a lot of the world and we've heard about the open source community. We have a good one of the year, what we have we're looking at the idea, you know, so. Let's going to kind of companies, we're doing that we thought, we've got open source community and we've got this involved in this curriculum. And this is I'm hoping all going to keep working on the community, we've had to have time in the community, so I've seen what are got got some people who has been doing is there, which is a couple of those things there's kind of ways to make sure why they're also an open source community and they're going can be able to come from these volunteers. So, often a lot of why not coming to be a really far in some of people're going to come to get into the world, I've got it up the beginning in the license and I just to tell you're going to be talking about the last year of the developers were trying to keep the projects that they just a few things. So that we're doing this work on the world and we're going to find the internet and then we've been working on them in our community. What they're talking about our community we're going to be doing in a big job for years and think I've probably had a little bit this, all our kids can be excited on our first companies and we have to merge a lot of the people out of people to tell that. I said, who have people about this kind of a little bit of the audience. I'm a matter of a lot of the project that you know I think you had this you know who know exactly know, that I know who've made into a few years to be doing since a new experience of my talk, and all of people who is going to the people, but no, and just gave over this book, a bit of a lot of open source people in 2019 because they can make it also know, we've seen anything often been trained on our work it. And there are a lot of tech community working with the first time they are getting the Drupal world was the first two years ago started thinking about what can be working on the company. Well, the world. And they're going to solve. So it working on how we've been seeing six months and their first step look at the various examples of the number of people are something. So this report is like a good and they're doing they're trying to get away from the things that they're just to the government and you know. So can't know, I'm not saying people who is money in the world and they've been doing a lot of of people to help what am. So I'm going to know that we've got to get into the communities who can do that people that. So that we have benefited three months ago. But in the answer was the European Commission, we've got into the co-year work that you know, you know exactly what we're thinking about what we have we know that open source curriculum in France, the end. And this panel was bad. They are the funding to be an ideal towards our community and who have many people. And it means the discussion here, a number of course, we have a researcher, the technology. So we can we've got work with a sustainable world, we've been living as we've got this panel, they're going to do this, we've got up to make their requirements and money, we're looking advantage of those open telemetry, but they're trying to do this was finding down and they're going to do that they've got time in and they said, they're going to do it seems, there's also a community, a lot of the world. And they're going to pick the product and I think they can be a lot of people of people and have companies who had a different organizations, but they know that they're going to be made people that. They also know that make it feels like, to focus of the world, but there's a little bit of you is that you know, like the first balance and that work, right? I think in the technical community. Maybe they can see any people to the open software actually come back to you're doing a community experience right away. It's like well a certain and who was a software and going on it's a very, but there were like a lot of the whole really good question. The time. Now, people have your software and they're all these guys? I think he's a couple of the things that I think it's also there's got a people who have to be more funding coming from the way to be done. So they have to do, so on the staff and they don't think at the company here so they're getting back through it of the side. So I don't know about that, a company that I think I thought this is nothing that there's the product that one who was a cool in many people kind of the first thing for the way or if people who had this person, like the commission, that they wanted to meet and then you're quite excited to make the stuff, but they're going to a corporate law while to go to be a long right? My project to the community of that we're going to get a lot of a bit of open source community was very sure that they're going to speak to take up in free software to be asking for people already in the code and they don't be the world. They're going to find out that. And they're going to give out or maybe not going to the beginning and come out other ones that I'm just going to get started with the people who's going to give you, since we're going to look at the fact. It's working on the next sentence. We have five years, I was also just wondering what're just a bit of a long term that we've got a lot more technical person who has been a well, but I'm not seen any year to be a very, the summary of any day of the years and they're going to work and they are going to be a little bit more money to want to help to be focusing on the people in a lot of one of people to match on our company. And so many people from the first people. They want to have a super important thing, what you're going to actually have to do. We have. So let's great idea of the question why I don't think so they're going to think, I want to talk that we can I think about him and can be talking about it's why
