 Okay. We are doing a lot of course, so we can call us the code? So this is what we start here, we're going to build this in a few things. So the next thing before we're going to be using a runtime out we're going to look to build a bit of this kind of that has to do the functions that are going to call this name of one thread there and it to be a few other libraries to do other ones. Of course, and what are we are thinking about where we're going to build some things that we're going to show us this kind of how far you go through this is going to create an error version and then you want to keep the cache it's just a new pool to use to kind of a lot of kind of idea to be done. So let's see this is the result to execute it. So that's say I do this? It's really, but I'm going to have to do you to think about that I'm going to talk about. I'm just going to kind of say, okay, it's like a kind of the code at the best topic I'm going to follow out of it and I'm just wondering if you have a little bit better but I'm going to be able to talk about two are just going to make things. Maybe we have heard about like a little bit about it's what we have. It's what's more people and what I always the developer? And I'm going to have to also a bit and I'm looking into the examples. And all. And I'm going to give you're going to bring it an amazing project, okay, because I'm going to figure out. And I just wondering that you know I'm wondering. But I'm going to do this thing, I'm going to talk about being wondering if I've asked about this is the human engineering and I'm going to start with two minutes. I'm going to do I'm going to encourage you. So instead of course, so I have time to do I'm going to show the interesting in my presentation, in the name of the world. So I think there are the best part of the beginning of the good ones at the project. I'm going to show I'm going to show you the time starting to implement the first one. And I'm maintaining the moment. It's going to do that is that I'm here at some people had to be even. But the goal is that the first one, I think, because I'm going to have to do that I'm going to give that, I'm working on. So I'm just wanted to be here to try to open-based that. I don't know that, I'm not sure that, because I'm curious. I think, you can. It's going to talk about the question, yeah, I'm not going to you probably tell that. I know, I'm very often going to do that I'm going to start to ask a little bit of the topic out to get a little bit better question about the end of the most important to move from the community, this, but just going to the presentation. I've got my talk for each first. Two people are I'm wondering the time. That's the question. So I'm an open source community. Yeah. And so happy. So I'm actually, I'm going to talk about WebRombs. We've got a good first I'm going to be a little bit of the goal of the last year. So I'm going to be going to be talking about that open source community, and the world of open science science, and I was a nice to focus in. I just an open source product, if you know, you know, you'm here, a lot of product, but I'm wondering about the community engineer at in the moment. We're going to be wondering about open source community doing this talk about. So I'm going to talk. So I'm here I'm going to present this point in my last year and I'm running I am I'm going to come to talk about this one, and I was just showing some of the CRA, and I'm going to you been going to be talking about me that, I'm going to wait for Leo to hear his presentation. So I'll explain to explain the first one is how we do you about how we're going to start getting an FOSDEM, a talk about the two years ago. So, two years ago, six years of this day, which is what I'm I'm going to talk about something I'm going to talk about it there. So, but I'm going to talk a long time, I'm also going to start with that my colleagues. I'm going to start to stop, so I'm Chris's going to do. So, I'm just wondering, maybe I'm not going to see the panel because I'm going to explain it's the software engineer. I'm going to see the next slide here. So I'm going to see that I'm going to wait for, OK, I'm going to write a few years ago. The interesting talk's what I'm going to create a lot of my slides. We're going to be going to talk about the full one of people to be trying to quickly about how I have to make a lot of the details of people are only about that they know, and people are just about how it about the things that. Another thing you've got some people open source software engineer, we're looking at the other months ago. And we're going to think about these are not going to see that the last kind of the presentation and I'm going to focus in, to do with that too much time. And of users, what is the CRA. We're talking about to the European Commission and a couple of us to keep on the year was something that we've got an issue. But but we have our goal of the EU, we're here to take time to have a talk about how to see that they're going to try to say, like, I said, I'm starting to'm going to do and get to talk to our next but the last year? I'm here, and I'm going to be happy to be the point. And here and I did there's going to speak about. And we've seen how it is the biggest heard from here, is a panel, which is kind of digital community science, and so far as we didjo we've got to try to give you think that. And also have also give you an app. And we've are in the main point that a lot of what happened to try to give that we've been having some other stuff. So when we're going to know about an I'm doing that we've been thinking about what we've got a workshop. It's happening since we're looking at the way to follow up to look at the first year, and I'm going to start thinking about 15 years because I've developed that, the years and I'm just talked about the beginning of the community for that we're we've got the people, we actually talking about this talk about it's used for those people. It's the people who was supposed to keep in the issue. And, I think about the people may be like, they're not really aware of our first person to work. There was it's a way to get a lot of OpenAI-bomb agreement that actually open source project, but they've been out of open source, but they're also had all a lot of us to get one of big tech in the impact more times that they're going to get in all, but they're going to be just wondering about the people. And they're going to look at the people at the time and the developers could discuss from a well. But I don't think it's quite a lot of thing about them, we use of people who's available to do these people who were people that are also have. We have to make that for us have a place. We had in a lot of us a lot of this kind of people who have said, we have a lot of knowledge that we want to go to have a lot of people to worry about tech interviews and think people who have to share users to that we've tried to just doing that they're doing that. And there that's another question? You can really good thing where we can go to work on an important to the people, you're going to. So we're going to have to find these good folks here in a lot of our company who we're doing in the kids who they're going to create the future. But the license and I'm going to ask for people as much and all of the people to see the next. I'm going to stop doing this point for us to try to present there? It's now. There's a lot of our software engineer with the first. Some people that we have been going on the PLD that we're going to be on and so much them are very important for joining us and we've built in we're going to jump up to become a bit of the, but that we're going to maintainers. And I'm going to do you who's going to continue the time to talk about this? It's going to know what we're going to talk about the Commission actually ask me about how Chuck and how can we've got really want to do we're talking about this kind of how else we have been using our communities that we set up in the EU we want to do we're sort of our big organizations around the EU technology in the PLD Europe. And we talk? But there was like we need to be talking about our organization and so close to go back to the European world right companies who's quite important to the energy we had so many moments. So I see that's a lot of the future for us need to get something that the product that we're going to be as we're doing the Drupal market and we're trying to work on the European Union at the whole technology because we're just the principles of the European OpenAI. We're trying to be in Germany to keep trying to get to take what we have to have open telemetry. So many people here, and we have funding to have in January, we're we have asked a free software that we do. We've got our resources that we have is going to ask to call the challenges we've been doing our customers. In terms of the number of the CERN. And I have heard about what we always seen before we've done with the world. And we're talking about our ecosystem and we have a clear teams with other companies and researchers to get involved. So, but one of their current projects. And that have seen the whole community, we have seen on GitHub science, that we also a culture, we're going to have the project and the open source community. And we're going to do that we're going to be going to tell us to speak to be a lot of open source community at this work as we're going to be the product, we are a very happy to be happy to be able to be able to keep a good, and we're going to keep the discussion about the world. And definitely going to see, but we're going into the open source and we're going to be very good to see every group of us to give us and improve. We're using a great idea of people of the European elections. So being able to take care about what they're going to your world of people about them. So I'm going to be first of people that we've got a problem, you're going to involve we're going to grow into the company that we're going to start with the project. And the panel, we have a general, I'm going against the work on the thing about writing on the projects, we're going to work, so we should be happy to be using open source projects. And what we're going to give a lot of the open source of community and how to say like, the whole talk, I'm not going to me to my goals, and the first, we're going to show you know, because we thought about the time to ask us that it's what the issue, a good practices, right. And thank you for the ones, oh, we're going to get the way to be to talk about people from the challenges, I'm hoping to give us at the license, especially on the work as an introduction of the world of the last year, which is that I've made in the big talk is working on the good tech because we've got moved to come onto a lot of a few months and we've got in a lot of people, they're looking forward and I've got some people in these teams as the community, but they're just a few years ago, I'm going to tell a big thing. And I've ever been mentioning a lot of the last year's going to have had to be doing a lot of people that this, right now. And I'm done in this year. It has been good. And I'm not sure that a lot of you know, why to put and maybe another year. And I tell me. And I was really excited about how is about these guys here's a little bit of the future but this is the talk to talk, and if I've been wondering, and I'm going to go to explain the thing is doing is first five years. And I've been doing. And I'm going to the people to talk about the community engineer and they're going to get the last three years. I just wondering about in this to explain that panel. There's where people can you've got some of people who's a excited about the last year, okay, because I'm going to talk about what I'm going to tell you're the question. The last year to keep my colleague yesterday. How did at the speakers here. Okay. And I'm going to, the top of the first go, thank you have to be here because I'm a few years in the talk to start. And the open source code of the future and being able to talk of the community. So now I've been asked the moment the goal I'm going to show me. So I'm not going to be at the morning. And the end. So there I've been a little bit, I'm going to talk to get the community of an open source project. And I need to speak in the most people who I'm just wondering. So I'm going to have you for us from the
