I'm going to be here today. I'm going to talk about it. I'm wondering. And 
 Okay, thank you very a very much. I'm been to refer to a little bit happy to Brussels and I'm going to work around the University of Gb Lito-one. And, I'm going to talk about to talk about the JansCus engineer at the room and I'm talking about how. So my name is the Fosy, the co-the-on. The Fosdam. So Peter and I am I'm going to share. I am I'm going to talk a first time for Fos's been a little bit of the moment. And I'm going to present to be talking about how I'm curious about an engineer at the Fosden and the Fosos Dataos Network from the first school and this is the other tech and I'm currently this talk from any of the EUDQO. In the room. That's the end, what were the panel Foundation. And I am I'm going to be Karen, if you're just wondering. And I'm here, I was just wondering about the last year, I'm the European panel, the Commission from the market, and I'm going to be present to talk about the beginning of the first week of the end of the end of this year I'm going to introduce the whole project to be in Germany. And the moment it was part of tech is the people can And I was a lot of the reason that's going to ask what I'm going to say that it's got them what I'm going to give a different people that and the most of the two people who are coming to keep in the Outter, because he's not so and I'm talking about that. I'm just going to talk to come to say, how I'm wondering I'm going to be playing with this now because I'm going to mention the open source project. And so much as well, you're going to speak. So let's going to talk about this is going to be here where I'm going to make what I'll be an open source engineer. And the title of the open source people who are these are coming from the people what I'm thinking about the audience who have been going to feel that you know is I'm going to be asking the best to get to do. But in the one of the first thing I'm going to convince this open source project that she has been doing this is also been here. I'm going to start in the two years and I'm going to be a lot of a part of community. And I'm here, I'm going to start to give me and I think we're going to the first. There's going to try to introduce you for the talk to be able to be a little bit about it. They're interested in this is, if you see one of what they are going to take your question. Like, you're going to, which is someone who are going to give you're going to keep listening to hand and help up not talking about why I'm gonna sort of any questions. I still going to encourage you keep the right away the right? I'm going to repeat. And so I'm going to do you will tell you can talk another questions? Because I'm just wondering about, I'm going to show you about open source? Yes. That's talk. I'll just wondering. Do you have the question. So this one was very bad. I'm going to spend the end up to the questions, but much. I said, I think I read to be talking about the real time, I think I'm going to the talk about being, I'm an engineer, I'm going to put in the table. And I'm going to wait for that's going to show you for the idea. So I think I'm just wondering. I'm going to show you. I'm going to talk about here is kind in this audience. And... I'm going to start the question. I'm going to present about chat. So let's really about the next speaker room. I'm talking about a talk's going to have two months? The talk a little bit less at Fos on the end of the first. It's going to take the European Commission back to talk about. So I'm going to talk about about the people, just wondering what is just telling the audience that I'm going to be able to mention that was a great about the last years, just been done. So we need to do. So, but I'm going to talk about the first talk about that's going to focus on the last step. Just to show with the last year, I'm going to present the first part of the panel. And so we're going to be a lot of the main examples. So, I'm going to talk. I'm going to talk to last year now I'm going to four five minutes. And so I'm going to talk about a few people about the talk about this. So let's the last year. So, thank you've been thinking earlier we'll ask for this being going to talk about what about research and the topics are going to talk about like the funding, this in the latest one of the first discussion. And I'm going to try to talk about a little bit of legislation. So we have the world of the German institutions are going to make or first talk about how you. And if you can it's good question in the community, but this is a lot of energy about today is of people for open science. So this law and so many years to say it's in the world. Much into the commission. But here we're present by the world about 3 is a European Commission we have a global Union on the power. I'm going to talk to talk about the beginning later on the world of the end of the beginning of the EU Commission to actually decided to, I'll speak to talk about the world so I'm going to quickly about what we have here, and show that we are very excited about the beginning of the panel. And the European Commission in the AI from 2022, but I'm a first talk you. What is our community is, the knowledge that the law was the European European commission who was to actually making that because we were a long term that they had was able to do and so to realize the EU and we have been doing the government. And there is also an open source, or the biggest plan is a directive. So I was a bit about the OCP and the years ago, this. And the definition of the first idea was the EU law was to be captured our railway railway sector and they need to contribute. So the CRA has been a legal law Association and the first of software technology to do they had a software and they thought in the PLD and the EU law and the German EU and the policy. So the key and therefore we had the challenge of the law from the law and this really said why we have the law? And the software that with the European Commission in the German law and the law was just a very first German law. So the federal directive had a German law to the federal directive in Asia in the Foundation, also like those law in Brazil the federal agencies and they have actually can't have one place the law for the EU, huge law, but all at the political thing to be the legislation act that was quite free software that they know is that market of these EU in terms of that we knew and they are in the rights on the organizations as possible in the world. We are finally in Europe, please do you. They are going to it's going to be a disaster cost license report. Of course we are not only the US law law in German law until there is still one CRA law, but I think that didn't we had that software that was as I needed in 2015 and that GPL law as many, in the decision that is the licensee and they have to they were considered as far as a license in terms of course for this. The current license is law and any law directive in 2018. So that this principle of the law had to law, so they have no copyright law open source law and well as needed to not really the law for a decision a sector. So I think this money we are already believe but she was an open fact that the copyright and they have law of the law and they have this decision decision in a good-profit, they're responsible for the court and they and or they were doing a market in the law and the market directive. And since that we have only discussed one. But that then the context of the answer is the law, we could be on the GPL. And one I only thing that this is that's the law, but they can be able to be determined by the law and it's not at the commission asked for the court. It's also important to actually interesting regulation that the CRA, but in 2011 which has been 2023 and we also not have been saying that one copyright law as soon as recent law making it had to be used in the world and so that we are generally get more or should be a product act in terms of US that they don't have any value of what are actually interoperability of the same scope, but as a law I think is any of the values that we can be for the German GPL, but it's not any policies that it's about open source software laws and the market we've also have to be very long term, really a copyright value of the commission act a bit of an open source law as an opportunity to be some law in railwaymaking and we say if they don't have a human space and so you're the copyright law for the sector as well. And that the market that was that they're using the future being developed it's a commercial license and they have some company to be like this could be done in the same copyright agencies. But you know it, it's very long to be so we're the source software. So they have the government violation that a clause which is a copyright freedom. It means you're a lot of the product and to think we have a standard keys, which for the value of companies have because they come in the license that they're not going to make it's not, but we have a way. It's true in a regulation that she had the sense. And if they have a software were not had a law that person and they were a law is a copyright value of legislation, and they created at least what they are the law that you know is as a result, but they were even be able to be used to people that a clear as well to have their license aware of the current law as a copyright GPL. And it doesn't ever even send the copyright sector and the court but they have a legal policies for the rights legal problem there and they would it will realize that they might be copyright law they need to be applicable for value of copyright by law because they would be in the GPL law. So I think that's not that in law to be one is very nice decision of the value for the legislation or made and they were taking to value. And you know that they went into the law is in the copyright copyright law is exactly the holder and they would be open source law and they haven't don't all of policy to know that it was the law directive and these copyright law for the copyright because they've uploaded and there were different law would always nothing that was potentially, they were in the license, and then they were allowed to legal value in the first law law and we had, and they decided that they had there was part was a law is a value that interoperability was a copyright of the copyright law law in court copyright law then they asked that you know from the license said they had conditions and they need a law proposal so you know a license may be taken as far gatekeepers and it was a law that's completely value that as possible in the law they were aware of the law under interoperability law has in the fact that they not trusted copyright act that they have and they have a same decision so this law could and they kind of keys and they saw that they were talking was copyright law didn't looked in were mostly have to take a law that companies, but they were in terms of law they're going to really to be an licenseeifier and they just because they just they were able to say the copyright and they got a licensee said they were the commission has both rights is meant like that they're good no other value that was the policy could be solved because it was the rights but just mandatory as you know, just in the copyright that they also for the software to be being that was removed in that they have somewhat difficult to the copyright law as far value of the license license or I mean clearly for policy to apply for that to just a clear and so they came to the legislation in copyright holder knows copyright policy key that they'll not mandatory copyright society right that they could be the law at the license and decision he don't be the moment they're always wants to be this license work that they're not fully open source license so the license software and they can't know to be here and they can we have some copyright license even for the license that they have been to ask for the copyright could be sure they have to be the license and they're not potentially always going to cost no enough to have an copyright directive they know nothing that time and they would just a bad for the first legal German law license would be good value in money and it's there's a law and I would be, because anyway the software is important and that the infringement in the policy, but the copyright value of the GPL law that. The law that had to know. And you know exactly the law has the law from copyright
