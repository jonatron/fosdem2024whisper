 I can do this with the other speaker. I am wondering? Let me talk about the S-clones for the OSPI is a software and other things like built a couple of years to have work on the project that is where I am it a lot of things as well just come over and work well and I'm going to talk to talk about this and he has been as a bit different challenges from working well and I'm going to talk about in the next five months to about open source project and so we have a little bit of a lot of like the presentation I am here from one of one, let me go to my OpenJDK today, which is this year and we have a lot of people who are the two we also talked about the moment and we have been the last year ago, two years. And I'm kind of a year, also hoping to keep I'm just glad you know how to keep doing it that I'm going to continue thinking about my history of an open app on people in my open source project. I'm one that I'd like to share source and I'm not going to do. I'm putting on a company for we're going to come from a second couple of work has one of people. Because I'm going to be wondering about our company called Dataam. So I'm going to talk about the current one and I'm going to talk about what I have at the first five years ago before I'm going to focus on the first and that I'm just about in this talk to tell me from Adobe at the whole year. So I'm going to I'm going to focus into the last year. And I'm not just just wondering, I'm going to be wondering, but I'm going to talk about this question, but I'm doing a community as a couple of computer in the challenges. I'm just wondering about the first talk to talk is important to what I'm going to say I'm using this. So my last year's going to talk, I'm going to say you, I'm going to be talking about an open source panel from the University of a lot of the first time. And I'm going to try to speak about that I'm playing with an hour. I'm going to do that I've got this was asking me, as being a question. One of the one thing to do was in the OpenStreetMap of the end of us to see. So, but I've been talking about the last year ago and I'm very young people at the years ago. And that I've got started here to be an opportunity for the people and it was very crucial challenges for you in Paris. So I think about it was 100 years ago. And we had in this year ago. So here. I was an open source software that we were a year. And I guess, yeah. I was because you to do is like, I started this, but we had a company and then we did have to be here and I'm going to need to be able to take a little bit of a lot of a bit of fun, I don't think about the long level of people, you a little bit of a real time and you know what it is that are finding their own people have. So I'm sending to do you know in the software engineer at this is going to the first week. I also wondering and the first difference was great question to me, I'm getting the last year. So what I'm going to create a few years ago in the code of the world. And I'm going to go in space. And now I'm going to make a lot of the people who is a small issues who was going back to be using the world to start in 2020. So I'm just wondering what I'm I was going to have the first of that this is the reasons that was very, we have in case. And I hate about the moment and the first thing I'm going to talk about what my open source code was about how we had to do we have to break it. And this thing is because I decided to do I'm doing was an open up about open source and there was really important thing for me for the idea. So I thought it was the question. And I thought I said, you know in the question was someone was, what I'm going to explain about the open source code that I was that I was there because this year and I could I'm going to actually have to start to be done this work. And I'm going to work with time to be talking to be an open source code that happened to keep up there because I've collected in our project. And I wanted to work that was thinking about the product was one I've seen this was about the answer that I really kind of the question was enough and I'd like to move to try to that that in the things, I worked on what I'm here. And I can I'm an important. So I'm asking that we get, like to make a PRs in the people was if we have to share any time to be a few people than I'd like to create a decision and we are using some people out the idea in the very quickly, and the history three years ago. So I have heard from the thing. Because what the last year. Last version of the last year we have I'm saying that we've developed by the first week and the last year and the work is going to four years ago, and we had had. And then we, we had to look at the beginning of the time. It's not the day. It was pretty well, and in the year. We were the talk about the year, because we had a year ago, it worked on a lot of the last year, you know, we had to see what we've got like, we did the year. So the last year we got in the last year, the Faskier, we had seen in the last year. Well, we've happened. So, we can go through the last year at the best thing that is we didn't get the year. And over a big ones. I think that we're not going to be going to talk that. We are the time years, we're about a couple of a bit of people who did for the way, these things that there's kind of years. We've been around the effort in the whole time. We've had to see. That's actually was not around the people that everyone had to work that we're going to do. And this in the first year. And I was kind of like that's the reason is actually a little bit of a, the maintainable and we had been shipping the whole release was really helped us to give the major tech and we were a good to work around the first time, we've been doing the first year and we made the work and we're going to work, the six months and we got been working since we're and the world is kind of more often have been doing this, which is really comes, people for the first time. And these year were probably most importantly, you know, you know that there were in the years ago to build was a new community of the world in the community. Because when I did we have been working on the work since we're going to do this year because we've got the software and we had, we can just had a large software collaboration with it was from the software, we were like we went forward, I had a real time, they had that came involved on the community and that came back. And then we had would continue to get started about the good to not just an issue was just trying to come to develop a big nature of the time to that we've got to do it and having a problem that people got an audience to go into a work out what I'm going to be going to know that that people were going to find out to be a long enough person had a lot of a good point of a community. So it was, if there were trying to keep going to make it was a quick thing of years ago and they were the people in the right balance or they were actually didn't started to go towards the sort of the whole people and that is been and that we had a lot of maintainer and they weren't really used to be created to be applied that the world of a lot of been used because we had at the whole bunch of jobs in their community. So that was some of people are like people were people which we were having it was funding as a company and they're going to their community to be the first we are going to throw everything on our community and all the first time they were happy to be able to do they're actually still not going to keep getting a little bit to get a lot of a few people and I feel that I think it. And I was a community to remember, I was just wondering about our lives from the community we had a great and I would like to talk about open source projects that they asked that they are very important as they're all the open source community and they have a lot of research and they were like we thought it involved in the European Commission, but they were about the world and they've had to participate into and they're just in the people who brought at the most of open source community the code and who could have been working as well we had to improve the future of the person who were actually have kind of the open source product but they kind of a European developers were like the open source software of the world and so that we hadn't really just had in the market. They're actually had a long year and do and their things and they are like the company, were at a great software to make many people involved in the foundation, and so many research in the open source world, just don't really have very good discussion and I think it's because all open source project was that we got the software, but with the organizations that was, so they had to be a product that was a lot of a good person. But there was like and made in the company, but there's out if there was actually a more difficult talk on that they come up in Europe and they had a non-source area that their science projects and they were kind of a community together, and their communities and so they had is and they're going to say we were they were involved that could be quite a very quickly, they're like they were asking our company, to keep and they were a lot of contributing to people who just open source organizations involved out of people who was from that you who worked soon and they had like hoping to work on the last six years and they were done the thought because they got a software wasn't that you know person who was also a young people who was not have nothing is fine of the value to use that they're talking about the people in the day for us and they used to get the product and they were giving you probably it's a lot of course they're getting an open source world so they had that they want to be very successful and the ones to do. So it's a lot of people know what we have is that we can't have a more people that's made a lot of a lot of the money. And that you know, why they're always know, like everybody knows that with people get to get it a bit more impact that. So that that the question was the world, but they all the world were like they were we have like like they're like the people here, you know even worse and think about how to these things like this was you know people because that the time they are we were a lot of the license. We were we was not just a really, maybe we had any people have no money to get away the commission is they are like they found out and so you're going to solve that the best source law of other companies and they were not aware that we get to be making sure. When one we got a society for us and I think about the decision makers are just get away from the commission and we haven't need to the money to be able to be much time. And at a copyright law, this CRA is kind of an IT and open source law, in Europe was something that he was really don't the EU to be done by the rights out, you know it on being the CRA has been to be the US law and the European Commission because they were not all the parliament was a decision in Germany, you can, I could be enthusiastic, but they had the law society is going to get a decision market that was quite a volunteer against legislation and they have is actually quite important to be much energy or a policy, but they're going to spend the court directive. They're just had the world in that the end. They were going to be an fact that are always in the only one's a year, to do for that. And so I don't know a question that's a good open source law that was more likely to this is also, like to be on the CRA and I think there's in place and she's a great as well, what I'm asking people can be able to get happened at least these areas. I have the world to do that, but I think that, actually also going to have to get a time. I'm going to talk about to say that we're going to be just going to use and have a first no, which I remember it at least you know what they are going to be in in the community between the first place in your life. And I have actually done in mind where I have the topic and I think about the current work we have the last year was doing the case of when we had an American law that we had to do that we had at all of the world and we want to release funding over again kind of the time and they had to come back to achieve and then we had to people that point the act on our council and we have to know in the copyright was a great and we're going to stay there was using the policy by creating it and we got to do and we had a very successful law, well and we wrote before I was just talked about in open source software, but we could say that we're going to keep a huge win and therefore we're using our EU agencies that we're not need to ask a decision in the copyright holder was coming out there was that we did in 2019 where well. And I'm then I would like the first excited to make this is to try to integrate this is that could go back to that was also. So I actually a few minutes ago and I'm just wondering how
