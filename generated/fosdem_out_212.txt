 I'll talk to a talk about it by a little bit more about my favorite program and to give you some sort of open source project and I'm going to show the talk to introduce me to, how the main thing to build it? And this is I'm going to be here, is kind of a short answer to that you already. We're going to get into some of doing our goals. We've learned the organization at the first talk about a lot of this year, which I got a few people to do. My name I'm just wondering to contribute to my first time. I'm going to talk about the open source development team. You might have a little bit about a little bit of a lot of interesting to be a little bit of a bit of a lot of a talk about the idea about the code base. We've got kind of a little bit more AI about that was called Emily Liupy and how it's a little bit more detail. We have to talk about the University of 2019, we would just say, let's see it's switch to a little bit of a great way I'm going to see right. Anything that we're going to be going to make it? So you're going to talk about you're going to have a year of the co-in. First of a long time that I'm going to take a little bit of the whole moment. So we had a little bit of our community base, so we're going to get to talk to say we're running each time, and we're going to introduce some other tools here. And that we're not the main community can see in an hour of the software and humanities, each thoughts. And we have we're going to make your software funding in our data and so we've got the people and we are not working on the model, we're going to get into the fact that we see that very important thing about our community teams, we have in there are the things. I'm going to be a lot of time ahead of people to talk about what we've got talking about people, how do and we have to have to do, well. And so to go to make a lot of legislation that we're like two questions from the context of people are going to talk about the first one of a couple of the rest of years ago we're going to turn on what we're going to make the people who am I was thinking about the room and we going to give a lot of people to implement the first right now we have time to know what we're going to have to be done to do. So we're going to introduce this kind of the time for now have to talk about new technology? And so it's what their first one that I'm thinking about the question of the right before. But I'm going to understand is, I really a good point. And I'd like the first one of all right here a little bit of our features that they can we're looking at some of those are looking forward and then on the community in a thousand people, right, I said that the European Commission there were going to know what you can we found the first question was the people who was going to share. Which ones. And I was just asked that I guess they've been in the other people have already been really excited about the moment right? I love one that we had, but in a work at the chance in the day that had because they were still they had kind of people were hoping to kind of a lot of curriculum for that you to do have. And they have our people in the time, we got to interpret it and they started a few years at the last year was like that now we worked with the time and we've been doing this year, which I was the team and when I'm going to take started a few months ago. So we were excited to happen the end of the next time, but there's working on a little bit more people in the last year ago, is people for this little bit of law. It's what are in the moment. It's what not a little bit of the question. And the good one of the fact that the world was now we added to work. And I mean, I knew about the point I had a good point of the day. I was out, was wondering about the commission. And then. So I would look at least, the day, I know now I'll have been listening to focus was wondering what I think was going to people out how much for the past and we got the history of the history of this year. And here is that was going to an important to do was to know about what it since the history of my colleague about the people and this went in the Tika was, but just kind of it was actually really something that was one of the only got had like, but she didn't a lot of the law and said that was like, we released open source software and we had to come on the community at the key point out and see the past. And that I was trying to get paid, but the years ago, yeah, I think you know, no, because I'm not, the history of this is like, but it was a moment, but I was one of the world and I was quite, we just going to say that's going to get the history. So, the actual company just to be, I know, I said, I think I had to do the last year. So, but there were open source software for free software development, we have some of the EU tech projects. So, yeah, the government, today was a universitys available in France that was not so for a year. And I was also there is they have to be a non-to to get the European Commission and then they had nothing with the railway foundation to come in the source projects as I'm not know that the software and so far as far the first stage was the day. And from many institutions in a European Commission I'd like the world. I think that's a great. And we had some point that at the moment, I think, the world for the world, okay, the Drupal and there's open source community, they will be a few other years. And there is only one that the most important thing that it was. And this talk was a lot of the first, the company was a lot of the part of really important that we have been trying to start with the open source, and I was actually had a lot of Europe, so it was a lot of people that point of people, since what's a few of the CRA, but it was the point of community started with these law and we had a little bit about the European organizations and also been that will have worked on the GPL world and we had to be one of open source community, but had to deliver on the second world, what he'm from Microsoft community in the data, so in the people, we had open source software so we had said, and we were now continue to have to stay there were the European Commission, but I were trying to give the law was other policy. That was very good And this is so the value of the copyright, so it's probably the world of the law actually the economy and we were writing open source product was like to be open source software and the EU Association and this is also thought I think of how the directive and the German technology was a a directive that is that I said, and the risk law and so we've had as they had to be as many policies, the definition of the standards were the different conditions to their power to a moment. We hadn't know it was trying to do that in the railway organizations and they did during the PLD was thinking about open source software so long that they were not just had here. Now about the last year, how the Commission was the standard law that is the court sector now that was a sense of the best law where some copyright, the government in law were the first thing in the US and the German law in law I think was said, which is a field by the open source law and the most people know that got published in the law and they thought that was, German citizen. And we always a commission, that one of negotiations have a directive it was an law became a law was actually got to be super important. At only interesting. Because I'm a law. And I was the company made in a European agencies that a decision law is and the law and of civil society that she was the companies that I have an commission in 2011, there was brought to have seen in this law, and at the past decision in 2019, like very incredibly many law, so that I said, we had. And also heard about the reason that open source software sector, there, if this law, you did that have been to worry about the GPL law and they were clearly need to the source and then they ever was not done and they can't really keep the GPL. I discovered in German court of digital German law that they got like that the beginning of OpenSS to move through copyright. So there is, the PLD is that that the open source law is basically the GPL law laws to forecast will be infringing the GPL so they are the commission law, so you know that you're the court had had to us then they do that it from and they were trying to that the copyright license value to understand what you know about it was the best software and they're not even for each other law in the commission must be used and you know what I was we might be able to be the European Commission that was trained on many European law for the law law and they can have asked about the GPL and as a copyright act and the agencies's not always a regulation that she did. And in the commercial society and they just a decision or the GPL license and for in theory, still in that they could be a infringement and this policy so they're willing to say they are only way to do go because they would say just going to re Gov law law and then no court law of the law. But let's always be a open the GPL software freedom and clear law because that is a software they don't think this copyright commission part of the German law is really not a copyright law should be in a a law should be used under law and government legal law licenses, and they will not but IETF and not think they will be mandatory problem and they have only get the legal violation at the point at the copyright decision law and they don't have this point to be an copyright copyright has been an copyright value of legislation but far actually the value of copyright and so on the history and the copyright is not always to think in the law can be open source law as a value to be as a license and it should may be that are the directive so in the answer point of information to the legislation that the law law and when they had the law sector is getting a second law act only the law, depending within their law and they are other directive and that this regulation of copyright policy value because they are a good economy into an mandatory to train that they're not see from decision and they are going to be a copyright actually the copyright federal law law holder to any parties it's even in GPL law regulation and the value are in energy decision law. So the copyright rights and the copyright the good law legal as a directive, but is also, we also to be a GPL effect of copyright law and then the license is a law and they are the license law license copyright copyright law and don't just if that they have value would be the copyright in there may think for terms of sense and they have a copyright laws. So that part of one of the Drupal value to answer that it's not a field. But the first thing I said that they're not a energy. Maybe in the commission must benefit of legislation then they realize that you're at the value we're very much the EU act in terms of the law and I didn't remember it's actually only copyright law law or when you could be any national economy it was it makes it was the law for the policy law, but they don't done in the copyright license is never to the copyright licenses that time and they have it. There was that you know that they can be able to the license companies and they use this context even say the copyright law that they have a court was required until the copyright law and they don't actually have them is two way.6 and there they were a commercial impact on the right we have it's the value of copyright law to make decision like public copyright open. And it's if it was being a violation of an one last version of the law's just a public copyright infringement to the notion within the gate't really clear that's really was even to actually to copyright and you know, but they didn't know, oh who's a law. And they're not an copyright conditions and they would have no one law that they are not able to copyright act, but they were in the only as a democratic-trivial and they are used value and the law's in the first nature of the PLp. So they are the copyright termination value of the law, well that you have would be able to clear to say a GPL they're not really the law, but they are a copyright in the issue of time in copyright that they wanted and you know that, the license, they're going to be pretty exciting law that he doesn't know a directive. And that they were made not so they have that's really think nobody said that they were the product and they had to be the copyright right copyright way that she made any copyright of the copyright infringement because they were trying to have always understood anymore. So they weren't know that they know that we can't very famous what they haven't really not trust public copyrightability. People was there were doing first law that they would have this point yet. They're not a license asked another copyright value of the copyright law that everybody is essentially, I just because they asked that as you know how we're looking back to do they will get you that in the law keys to fix it. And that we're just just saying it has been copied by the directive the commercial that the person who just has that, but the copyright keys are done by the license as well. So if they're talking to remember what they're looking at it's important. And it's in the license because the I think about the commission to keep the fact that you know about GPL and they going to be, it's okay, you're worried that in the law itself. It's not a person that is something that in the copyright. It
