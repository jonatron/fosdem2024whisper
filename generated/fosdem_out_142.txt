 So, what was you said, let's get to the first, that's just one. It's say you have a tool that. We didn't add one that. I'll be trying to test and what I'm going to add a little bit of a few things I have here at the next talk. I'm going to show that you a little bit about all about to use. So I'm going to show a very nice talk to be wondering. So what I will talk about the use is going to be talking about that? The one is you're looking into there and things I'm kind of start and we're using the definition, create data. And here, we're built the cluster here that's what we're involved in API in the definition that we're trying to do is the API. And I'm pulling into a different application application and then what was, we're doing as language, I'm doing is kind of a web API to capture those metrics. So, we can see is one of the community. So this is basically been working for the project called CNC, and we have the community to help with a commercial goal. Then we have a main issue that would be interested in the whole goal for a problem that I'm hoping that our role of it has been to talk to be a lot of the right now. And I'm going to explain why. But it's what we've got the top of my product where I'm going to be at least I'm not going to be, but as the first time to work in the question. And I'm going to focus on the context of the main side I'm going to be doing our product that it in the project and I'm going to work, right now. And I'm going to talk about it's going to try to come to try to work. And I'm going to introduce my project in the idea is we have been all of is, we have a lot of the developer. We can see this area of a lot of the things. So the open source software engineer and we got a lot of this year. We have the open source code we are the software as low level, we've been working group in June, we've got a different. The last discussion we wanted to talk for example of the EU Act, I'm going on the things. I'm probably tried a company has been trying to show you to put in the EU license. So people to communicate with the EU, what you'll talk about the act on the CRA, we'll see, but there's of the commercial product, what is a new work that the German license. I thought is also a very inspiring challenge of an example of the European world. So, a whole thing that's basically the idea of CRA is that we've got a public community of us and what I said we're going to open source, because think about the EU institutions get the market of the software. So I've introduced this is good thing that I get organized in the CRA, especially in German government to this research. In the fact, this was a German commission or European law was very important to open source of open source world, that this is that, we're in France, which is open source, but a policy, but it's a public software, it's the EU that if we have open source world and the commission and there's the world and then being a product and third party has developed that are actually the industry development of the whole world for other so they are a member of open science policy who are going to politicians that's a good idea that the European legal law, but it is the first law, is the the legislation to be a EU. It has been the German license that the organizations also the EU and German value as actually, which society, but they are a law. And as I've been to speak to be the European Commission, okay, they're a bit smaller problem that. But they've been working in the world. And this product and in this panel, but we also there's the first one of the world. And they come along in this value of the commission is open and they need to make sure that companies. And there that there's the first way of the law law agencies would be an open source assessment law and act in a EU that basically decided that's also got in time to get a EU funding to ensure that the act, which is that you know that the field of the panel would be developed the way, but if we would be affected by the copyright law, we have legal law, how a copyright license would be the technology infringement. And if not to bring is the law. But the law was it would be the value to that point of a law, that we're actually develop in the law license to the law that they got legislation. And that came up and the lawists was a market rights and they go into the copyright and we had a law would be surprised for open law that is a public law law and in source law was particularly used from the EU countries by the law. Now, in the fact that the law law, in German law that the law has essentially that she has made under this federal keys. And so the law is the parliament has called open EU law and the product law of the law and he was more impact of the copyright, but they were always be open thought about law themselves and the licensee said, the source decision often so in a law for which is the law. I just very important thing to be aware of legislation and to get a public standards in the UK copyright cost of the GPL because the law was to the law rights, because otherwise the EU policy of this copyright was to interoperability funded as not necessarily means. And it was that in Norway this was also to copyright policy it has heard of law as long term that it was developed in initially, if we have a German copyright law, just to some sector, we had a copyright law that the copyright law, which is that I get by the law and they have heard from the sense They were probably said, and finally there was almost a policy who were one panel. They didn't always saying zero because I could be an event the commission is no, but it's only open source law as possible law, because they get a GPL software long term made of it was only does have felt to work to be a copyright and they should be the technology that's had but we still no as important as I thought that's a GPL. And we do the open source law and they didn't even see what they gave their signature was that they were a value that they could be aware about that they didn't because they were in as possible to take the space as far as a moment that was at like the copyright law that to make an educational certification towards an important of the copyright but they were in the license would mean I've been given this is the GPL in law that they care, but they decided to apply the legislation of a mandatory copyright transparency and they were a copyright money to that was the copyright. So we had to me to be great value of the copyright directive. And as it's the market law, so in the government would say that was a law that an act. There was happening the US to the copyright law will be the public law that I was copyright the directive for fact that the court because they said, they did is the law, they would have been wondering. And they had been even they were the act as the copyright agreement, and they didn't always just thought that so they are often think were you think that would be the secret or you had the person will license group don't really do, especially but they're not in their certification was, the way you know the way it was just interesting, they should be going out of thinking, but the no longer as we could go this and down and we want to make this for money. And we need would be no, we have been here. Just it was very, just a way to be the entire system could be taken at least one that we're not just saying that's the law. So we're going to hear it's not going to deliver decision-Fi. So the political people in your CRA, we're doing that we want to do it's happening because that. But if you do have time to keep the copyright is free market and they're going to look at the value to really, hey, you know, but they're going that they're going to make a copyright license in the only nothing to provide a longer the copyright license didn't just an law, but they get to be great. And what was it's the scope, the copyright and like a that I'm doing was the license and what you could we have to do. And so that's the question, on the user can be the value of the law and it's the copyright license that you can be a copyright rights of the law that this law company, but in the data is the future of the law. But I think it's a law. It's something that the copyright that allowed in the opposite to go to have to that value here and she will be a copyright holder's because there a key that has noticed that I had a bad law that a license and the law, it in the law that you know in the software was incredibly incredibly important thing. The GPL TPM is this was that people may a not always really a copyright and the law no policies, okay, in a good problem that the law was that they don't know that as you know about the value of the law in fact that in the copyright law, because they're the license has no way. We didn't know, the copyright was a copyright part of copyright who was stored as the copyright copyright, because the commission act had asked from this parliament who's what you know, it was not really just know that would be kind of a copyright effect that she had in the German copyright he been sent and she was exactly something was just defined and made the law that value of the keys to the value that, or if you know that point, you know what the value. But it, if the of the UK court proposal ever had that's the key, and you would be sure that you know as a problem that you can work can participate in the scope of the license value to be applied where the reason that is that we have to realize that you know that right and you're an event and they're going to look at some this, nothing that value of those the law, which is that most important policy and that you know the regulation will change and more clear value and to have been there were as a copyright should have been looking to be a long as a good license and do, and that for example that the court was important case that it was just is something that that already aware of the law. But we have no idea that it was the UK that you know that the law as the decision that I could be able to be in the license is. The copyright thought in a the law, the license is that it's made made a law law was to GPL license directive and in a law, this injunction for the copyright holder because has was a license would be told a German license, no copyright. And that the law was actually, and the legal value of a law license is they remember what it didn't really be the copyright would be the directive anymore when it doesn't just like to actually do that. There are the copyright is the current signature of the GPL, this is only one is the market that the licensee license value of the rights? But they said, this termination has not even a decision that I would be released in laws and they get got copyright. And I would be there's actually no means there's also the only no copyright law. And I know of the GPL when they get to keep copyright law they did you know, you know, what is there is that are also an court to be a, but that the value of the signature. So this law is a a GPL it's not really clear the license. And then in the copyright value of copyright value that there are the license value like they ever, they have two order and they use and they know, they just the code or they decided, and they did not know what you know that they don't have to remember that they were, but they had a copyright point, and for that they still. I have to use to have to know that. And the commission would always be a person about an issue in the law. And not always be just to be a copyright. Now they were there was clearly no longer value of a legal law in the two copyright law that came into legislation. However, so it was basically is not a GPL value of law had you still heard about it was trying to be a copyright and maybe two and that there is about the law has a law policy and they did and it are a hard to be a copyright infringement in copyright court holder. So you know that's all the license law would for said you have a second law that GPL, but if anything in the license value of the law. But he was, we're surprised by just adding a value of copyrightability sector, I was the copyright what the copyright law court and that nobody didn't going to be just to be getting to do is kind of clear. And only that very clear and the GPL when that a could go to summarize the copyright issues and the license said me would say that I think that I think it's not only but it was a commercial law. But it was used to do that the license, for that the copyright law, but since that you know the law work under the copyright act would be in their value of the value value of the time to it was the law directive as I'm not that the copyright holder to they were some license does would be the copyright and they had an court law and they was a market mean license that they didn't really matter of policy even have their copyright law and they said is not even always have created in on the decision and what is going to share in rights. And they don't work under the German law but they come it could happen that the law, that they were the copyright secret in the copyright and even on copyright copyright legislation means which was actually have in the law of tech law. And I said, it's not actually because they were not any money that I remember they read and they were an law market and it and they were potentially nothing used that but they started as well a the Swiss and they think they are a value of law that you know, maybe they have a copyright copyright the GPL law was enough directive and only license need to do a
