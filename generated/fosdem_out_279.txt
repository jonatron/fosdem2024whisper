 So let everyone again, it's say I was using this way. Okay, I'm not going to just say you simply enable anybody to create an event. And this just the... So, I'm going to create it back to try to see the server, but I'm happy to start people. I'll take a little bit of a part of the server. I'm just wondering. So, the recording over the server and I'm going to try to know what you how to get back to the server, what I'm just going to talk about how you can see. So I can do you open a client server and see the server side. And I'm going to briefly play out. I think that I'm going to talk about the client can see the server? That's the server side around and I've got a mail server and I've got to take this in that key conference. This is where we have some of the server, which is what to, which is it's going to be what you can do and things. They do. Any other? And so the server request are being an application that we've done on the server. You have a command line. You just specify the server will get the server in the server, and I'm going to say, but it's very well. We have time to pass and then you can you're going to. The server now you can see that you can have to say, you just see a server to send a request and the secret, but you can enable the server to authenticate to the server. You can just add, and the server has to the server, the server. And then gets your server. You can put in that user ID and set up. You can just take some container server or in a, I'm going to a server. And now. You can have an client would like an email to provide a server. If you can take a server with an client, you can open. If you can run that, if you've heard about the server. You can choose a user client. And you set up. It's here and you got a server operator to just store your server. And then have to download it, you have to an email back to end user. And it in that's about the server. And this API, I said, in a server. Let's the client. You also access to this case what I'm going to the web server. So, the server that's really built on the server on the server. And then, there's going to use user has all that we want to say. So this is a client goes back to a client to the login session server comes from the login data will clickor and all the server to the server. Okay, which is going to the server's going to deploy. And that slide. And in the server, if you can be in the server, you're going to start to give you from the server. You can say, how it's going to work on the server, we see that we need to the room. We need to run the slides. Also, we're going to have plans to have a server, which is created in the browser. And then we're going to do the client server server that I'm going to talk to end of the server to do, you're going to start and then we're going to run-ups here. We're going to create the server and what it's the server to take the server server and then it out, then we have this bot or whatever server will run. And we will give us and our server in our server. We've done our stream that we want to see that we have a server for our server. So you have to send the user server side, client. So, we try to the server. I will going to the client also put the server to keep debugging here. That's the server to install it too. The server server is that. The server is, we have a server and the back to help you have to deploy on. We have the server that's going to deploy our server and we have kind of configuration and then we want to a client server with us in the server server will just want to do it was doing client to want to using it to have to store. So you need to save. So I will show you to use my metrics in Go server, we also I'll start to create our website. That's time. We've done. So the server server and you can start that. We'll look into this is a server is important to use a request that what you have in this and you generate it's going to go into that you can run a server and that's going to discover. And then the server, and, it's actually gets home we have an for, we have a protocol we have to create a demo. So as I'm going to compile. I've never seen a client,, the server, that's going to send's going to what's going to create a client client server. That's going to be going to have to share the room to provide a server, which is going to the server. The server to do it. If you're having you want to call this server in a service user server manager. It's in the server. You'll give that's something for this in the web server that's just going to pick the server. You need to that cloud. You have a platform. You can get the server. You're going to install. You can see the server. You can really want access it on the server. You can use that. You can just showed you now. You can print it. You can start up in an encryption. So it's all the client's how you can you can see the server. You can see here. So, we have to get into what server. You can see the server. So you can see that the server that the application with this. You'll get into a server. Where might be able to it's the server to start up here. And all the server. It's not not what's not going to the server, just a session server has some server, but let's not stop email server. That's run an end server, it's just a client will present I'm going to match over here. So to talk was here. So now I'm presenting the server side of the server. So, if you said, you're going to start, you have a server on your server, you can see how do you, the server, building and so you need to have your server. And you have a server, you want this server and whatever it's running. And with the server? So it's in the server. So, I'm going to show the server. I'm going to go to need to your in this. So now. You can see what. So, the server is how your server. So you know, there's going to be the server up, the prompt, the server, the server, the server, this service is actually helps you should have a server. And then you would want to make a a server. You're going to, but on the server's going to, you can be using that from a server. You can also want to get this. You can start to configure anything. You can see the server. Thank you'll have to start up. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
