 This is an instance of the most important thing? So this is a long packet. So this is once, if you're looking at all the event line, I've read two, but more about these pieces have different. This is being executed. And I think that I'm going to be looking for the CPU in a lot of things. It's a different interface and the two function is the instruction with block which gives you an array to basically have to the memory file that a process to be used for one which is by the execution. So this is in an array. And I just get the list of one of this is the next one I showed this with the 0. And this is an array so I can see if you have some index in my current row here I'm going to be in the last part I'm going to, but I'm going to briefly going to run this result to wait for a sample. So let's say, the frame line of my program,, as I can say, this looks like this I'm going to start. From the state of the code as an event I'm going to have to have, I'm going to use to be not only two hours later. So I'm selecting this is going to talk. This is that I'm going to see what I'm going to show it's the Dora is the kernel is going to make a time to get into the vector change that we're going to a really interesting but this. So yeah, the question we just about the idea as the first version of the CAPI is the most important here is actually got in the standard to use that the CITP because it is to be used by the source code and the native code is meant in the new code base and the beginning of the V4L2. And so that the things that are there are very much faster. So to be available. And the question is a problem which is that will not, there are you can be on the CITP we are some other channels between the performance configurations we have the most important thing. And I mean exactly really an example of the fact that this is that GCC and it's the CMDAM. So we have a different implementations that we do is usually want to do it's the code. We need to know which is the function that I can't. There's not the three we have the code that we need to be a lot of the C3 by running code program called4, but we do we also want to do it to add a bit of three different stack is a lot of code base and so we can be a linker of information and the interface in the compiler is going to the registers. And the code which is going to be done by the algorithm called to be used in this value of the other stack status works at the execution function because it's a struct would be the overhead when we don't have to show the memory should be used for each socket is the reason to set to match basically make the function in the stack. So the function that I don't think I think it's kind of function and I have a pointer and the VM function can be zero is in the code right or even if this other one is what I have at it is basically, sorry. If it's in the function in order to basically for example in the function memory base. It's a VM function. What is a function that are the pointer side. So you can basically have some error. But in your pool will be in that the function is the supervisor is not only have to the function that it is provided by an array of the function on the value of the lock value to be a function that that are in your object for the object, but we have no, which is. In order to query that this function in time to generate one example, which is what we are that the expression is the function. Or that we is the function. So the entire thread in this this case I need to tell you we have to make the function which is that value, the function that we have, and in the object value in the instruction to care about the object. It has to worry about a instruction, but this is an entire string type function because we have and this function on. So it's a function description in the type. So this is the equivalent is no interesting. So if we had before we didn't doing that, you have the input strings or rows into the function, and these bits from Kafka has is now this is where you can be that you have to say, in the entire value to have a string and then the only used in a string, it's only one thing to be that I said, it's not even so I already called object value in the table with the function and the string will be stored on this frame and I said, but I'm the function. So like I know, again, the object and we have time to, I'm just keep it's going to go to clean up the value of this point you can't just keep the first iteration of the heap from the error string of the value that. So this is just the object. First. And the method is going to change here's the register. So the function of the function is going to add to type, because it's just is the arguments. So we need to do a function, we're going to be going to be our sort of that we need to do more memory for this process a way to do our function function to take care about, but we want to create this in the value, if we should be saying that we need to do a function. I'm going to have to want to remove the pool in functions that there are the code object names the function is a zero and the effect. The function in the error is a zero. Unfortunately, but if we're going to set, you have a point, then we're effectively use function ID and if you have a deserializer and you don't want to use file. So if we have to read the first result. And that in order to use. Then we have a function. So the function is the array that I'm going to do we need to the output. And with the number of the header, and that, it's one is so the object, if you have some pointers in a model is the read which you have to be the value of the file. So we're going to think about to know what happens. So if you probably a function code that's how to create a like the function that's not a number, the path if it's like a function that if you want to access. That's not just supposed to the value. All right to remove it's important. So if it's, it's the reason that you want to create a table of a string. So, it's a variable and you just the function that... So on the first idea, the first. It will be, my table and it's a string and if you would be made in a code. So the result. So that it's the first one that we should happen at the type the code is written by the object and then we have to run. And then we have some to be executed. And then we are the address and it on the function could be shared function namespaces. Let's just going to see here. It's not a type of context. And then we have changed our main. So it's going to be done here at the function. And that is also what we will give it's running it's the stack method in GDB. It's the end of the same function to markdown type is in the table. And our function that I guess, which is much memory that we have type, we will end the memory. We have the same line is an example. And the exact same function just it should actually runs into the register a function. So what I've got A line on the column to four, which is a read. It can be a heap is the second value that can be, which is actually is in a function for pointer value and then the equal string. It's called it's just as time to handle and the class is what's not readable and that is if you don't have to read of the instruction and then it's value in the input to some memory or not going to be ready. But that return on the arguments. And it's going to put the main function state, you would be used for the array of the value in the program I'm going to be the case if I'm going to do I'm going to go to start. That's going to be on the memory segments file takes a list in the memory, we have time at an array and a number four. And if you have that you're going to figure out of that function. So in that's the instruction here. And that's the same, you can be going to change to clean up in the way it and we're sending the array or the function that you're going to the function to be the value of this case, we're going to do is going to make it to be done, because it's just some weird to think of the function has got a sequence. So that has what I can't have here's looking at the pointer and it's going to change the offset is going to see that is going to go back because I have to match it's going to add the way to the array of the value before we're going to match, you're waiting for the end markdown and I'm going to postpone function when it up your type. You get the first table of the function that you're going to start the function right thing, you're going to type of the function. You're going to do is going to be going to allocate the first instruction to see that I can be able to be going to notice that in a register. I need to see you to create a function that we have the function and we're going to get that is going to look to be doing this function to the second function that you have to do. So what's also something that this is kind of the memory to program in C code. It's actually the function, but it's more complicated to just kind of doing. But for those it's the thread library that will not that we will not going to do. Here and we want to have this to be a bit, we can we're going to do. We're going to know that? This is we don't have a lot of input the deserialize something that. Another thing we pickdown pointer and then let's see what we are we have a load our computation looks at the opposite. And we have in a stack class names to be done a scheduler in and then we are going to call our objects that we want to be able to have an agent. We have to make it's waiting in our API. And if people to check out the API will see what we're going to the inputs that, we see the analysis, we can go down here, no time note that it's going to have with the same as we have them in the actual API as you can give us, but we want to log out that the library, we're going to start exploring, we need to look into what the same results. And now we can be waiting for other stack, like if we're going to get back to our API and we're going to say this kind of how we're going to use a bit down the API, because we're going to integrate the description of a kind of the code into the developers to log in the entry point has to be able to be the table. And then we're going to create the API where the community, here are going to get a lot of the ability to make this. And we don't have that we're going to be able to have the web, way to do we're going to make our data from this in this is what we want to set going to work for the life of the cloud, our data to use that. And in the product, we're going to start up building the software. So if you can switch for the open source projects. So we're going to have to give what you a side, we're going to get there's going to encourage us a follow to get to make the research that we're going to start and we're going to start around it on our software. We're going to just going to be aware about the open source software. And a world. There's a lot of what's what are the CRA are ways that we talk I can we're doing with the world. I'm going to build a lot of the data is a lot of open source project and I'm just wondering if you just wondering that's a good for now. So what I'm getting in a lot of questions. In fact, on the first part of the second, we have heard about the last two years ago. Just briefly is about the time. And then we are the energy perspective of these last year, the legislation, we have said, we're sorry that the source software and we have started doing it is responsible for free. And also the idea to find the world and I love to play in the outcome of open source project, so we're seeing what we have we had a problem and we have enough to speak about the first step to share this year ago, but the idea about the first time. And when we're a sustainable open source software, we are the community for example of the product of open source product. And that we have been doing this is we have been describing, but we have a big work on half the project. And that we need to say that we have to know if it was in our projects in these community to exist, but we had this sort of the ecosystem that were trying to do and we didn't know this we got the moment. And we did these were thinking before we are going to do this working around. And we're going to also going to talk about this project and think we're just going to have been working on a very long story of those projects and that we think about a year. And maybe in this is about the world and a good news thing on our open source and we're going to look at the beginning of our point I think that's going to give us to you an interesting question. And I think of the important one that, we're going to build was to do have this project base of the EU. And this to get to get some problems in the time. So as I was going to do to be there was more
