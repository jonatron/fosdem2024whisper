 Okay. Okay, let's say this, and we'll show a little bit a bit more than a little bit of the beginning where we're getting to the future. So I'm talking about it to do some errors. So yeah, I'm going to start thinking about code program. I'm going to also going to do something like I'm going to have an instance of the code as a result to go to my program. So I'm a developer name is me to note. So let's take a new page. So, if I'm going to see how this is a real time I'm going to be going to see here in? How do you basically have the whole thing is going to change some of them? So, why I use the future, the library. This is the process side and that's going to you kind of thing to just a good thing. I'm going to have to support. I'm going to take a lot of like you an interesting because I'm going to do it, and we're going to talk about how to create our code going to focus to come up to see you that you know what is created, has to get over a good result to read into the details of this context for the main thing. So if the other stuff we're going to set of the next version of the front end we call it to start the next steps to get to handle the one of the future and we have to do it. We have to the problem. So this a future and the first one that we need to keep it. And for with the future. We have a lot of the world where I'm going to make that. Because it any of information. And so let's got a lot of those are going to see the things we have to find out to see how we'll see what's actually in this. And the information. I have a little bit of course, but just get here. I'm going to about that it's really important for the future. So I'm an app documentation as I'm doing that. I'm going to say I'm going to be working on this really happy to look at the most right now we'm a little bit of the talk. So I'm going to give me so I'm going to talk to do you to probably using some of the two years to be focusing on the next. So the question. You wanted to be able to start from the next speaker in the next year. So we were next project. So how we're talking about, what I will get the best people they have heard about the community in the Internet. So let's going to see, there is going to figure out the CERN is another member of the presentation to start to look at the DAGs of those two years. And that we've said here to be in the first person. And I'm doing this talk about working was the German law. And I was first time, I learned about the fact that the European Commission since well I was about the way to focus of the people, two years ago is in the years. And I guess I'm hoping to think here. And I'm going to talk more people have to keep doing so we have a good years. And the first one of the speakers from the first year. And so I'm wondering, I'm just going to say you have any questions. So that's an audience. And I'm going to my talk about the question I'm wondering I'm going to be a little bit of that the European Commission, the PLD had to get and he's going to talk. And he's going to have to give me. And I'm a very excited to welcome to contact a little bit of a tool and I'll talk about that. I'm going to the years ago. I'm going to spend a bit about my time in my talk. We're going to talk, I'm going to present me to give you today and I'm going to speak in the first year, but I'm going to be looking through all right? So I'm we're at Red Hat project going to present this presentation. But I'm going to introduce having to present last year and I'm going to talk about it who'm just, very interesting. Okay, thank you very much. So I'm going to tell me, we have last time for our next presentation. Yeah, it's going to talk about the community team with the future of the next year. So we have is the first talk about our people here. I'm trying to talk. Yes, I'd like the audience here? So I'm going to talk about today. I'm seeing how we have to talk about a few questions. I got time, I'm going to talk before, I'm talking when I'm also here. Well, I'm going to talk about, so I'm going to talk a bit, because I'm going to present, but I'm going to do, thank you happy to talk about 15 years. So the lead to talk about the project. So, I'm just wondering. Okay, I'm a bit on this, folks. Thank you need to do that's here, time in this is the first question. I'm I'm going to introduce us because there. So, if you. And I. I'm going to, who's five minutes, so I'm going to talk about our agenda to start the first speaker, we have here. So I'm doing here. A few minutes, I'm going to talk about open source engineer. I'm going to finish, we're going to talk. I'm going to show you the OpenBSD in the founder of you going to give you can see here a lightning talk to let me again one? I'm going to be curious about the last year, what I'm going to present in the CERN for the history of the journey in the US project. And I'm wondering, but I'm a little bit about the first time to make the last year, I'm going to understand is a very good one of all the ecosystem of the Commission. And I was really excited. And I was I remember around this year to do you know that? So now in that I was using the last year, but I was wondering about the first thing about me, this panel, how it was kind of having some of the core community was just have been the community and the women in France for the policy from the moment. And this is kind of challenges that we just took you're talking about the negotiations. We had a lot about that were wondering about half of mine. And very, he was a couple of the things that was. I need to really a bit right now I got the time. The lot of the last five big one was that was pretty excited here was very nice year. And that I was actually had that was I had that was just in a new council it was the past, okay was a lot of the total about the back to do was wondering, okay, because you had a very small company I think the key, particularly long time and I thought that was in the German court was with the money in order to people had been doing to do a lot too, and they came and they to see that they have been saying we had everything because they had a good technology, they had the software engineer at the EU and the time was not work on the one was surprised do not in parliament had a decade to be like well. We still 20 years ago. I was done yet. So we're talking about them and a bit more important and there's the fact that was a lot of law and I got the first question was the first five years ago. It was a very good point. The last year was also I was not released on the time and they talked about that got started really important question was in the second year. And the world was that we had happened at the point in the EU industry was just had this year when I was done with a good example of the second place that was a nonprofit law before they just a researcher as they're also had to just make the Swiss cost more of the scientific law. In Italy was just to a no person who was starting in its legislation. So in the value to be a decision was really was wondering. We ever reached the parliament didn't thought that was happening because the tech laws I was going to make so they wrote a good to be able to be open source and so much their community was that isn't this open source and they are good that we were quite afraid to do we have this because we started saying that sort of this software that's the software is when you're only have companies do that you're doing a lot of doing the value that they have as well up and they have been doing their license for the market that they're going to get also going to go and they're doing that they're standing at the rights in the regulation that direction of that you have would be aware of companies who have more and they're going to keep an policy that they're going to be, but you're helping people who want to solve the copyright holder, but they're going and i would be having to have someone who not going to have to ask you to keep it as I'm not doing for the people to make sure you a way. So that they're going to do a lot of free source companies in the commission that they're going to get into the commission and they're going now have to be in the law. They're going to we have to be an gate clause only work. So we're going from the license and in the law makers have asked to be used in a different license that we, because we had some data and they have a year as the only having to continue to take care. And they're all of the question. So we all of this was how far as a money are in a copyright fact that the market or copyright is the value of the court law, and the law-profit to the possibility to the copyright, in the work. And the legislation, in law, the methodology that they have been actually I didn't know that the EU rights. And they to be a law. And they would be paid free value of fact that we've been in the same thing in the law and they don't have had some copyright law would be asked what was this is to give out their public government, very important to open source law, which would be a GPL and so I would I mean that the law, but the CRA as they would be in the CRA had this is that the law, but they had in other foundation and do you said, right now act would be made to the copyright law and a regulation you could be a regulation we were to actually not as a copyright value that would be important that this copyright value. And it's, even a good question. And it's the copyright policy will first they will be made a copyright law and of the law because they saw the sense of the fact that's not an interesting for the GPL a license law and as any court world of the law they have like you can be defined as well. There is the copyright economy uses copyright and an market legislation of the fact that this law, I don't think it's incredibly important to value in a copyright holder. It's in open German law and I'm just to know why to they're always give to be interesting open source legal copyright directive. Because I love in terms of the first of open source initiative has asked to be the law now so I don't know that in the open world have heard that law, money from the law to be in the panel was, here even a decision in policy of the legislation and I was now we were the regulation in this directive. And that we had funding to say nothing else are doing a decision sector and we did we only like we did not like a commission said, we have a community that we want to read, a global law and so we tried to really don't want to clean at the last year and they have been just used such law was just took the court, we had to create a half and each democratic law by a law and the fact that all would be taken a clear to get the value of these law. When he wrote the day was out that I think there isn't some of a government it was the copyright rights to the only one point of the law decision act within the commission was more legislation to actually in fact so I was just to no public law could be an the law and I think the best copyright law and yes, it would be an impact of law or the law of legislation of any parliament there were made an law and the copyright is law actually going to understand as public copyright directive to be just don't really the act. And that was really, because you see that you're trying to be the commission of the copyright and that this value that meant to do at the copyright law-pas all in the most not the Commission had the PLs and this case the panel is happening and I think that we have the CRA will be the law in terms of legislation in the GPL that the question was in the law could be clear revenue and I would be not to the copyright law so far in one that's the court copyright copyright policy terms of this would be long- holder is that we did out of the copyright in the GPL law and we had is to do we saw that policy should cover the court fact that policy at the public law in copyright under one was two years and what we did we had to think the legal that we had just got but we had in this now on an copyright directive because it was really changed because we were trying to open value to have a law and we had a law law we have been at the law to make it was just the European commission and we had a copyright said so great court for this is in the copyright then it's an law that and are a law and the court in mind the law and I didn't know as you know anyone in the copyright, um said and then you have about a law and this German law is it's something to become a value of law was just I'm going to a copyright and the big value of the license and they can be able to to keep in the policy that copyright license happens and so you know they said all of the copyright law in the copyright think and said before they need to understand in this economic value of tech copyright and they are a value to be. And so people that I have also asked that of privacy in terms of the value that a value, that still the copyright copyright value of thought this and that they are another law who's an open policy that was certainly no
