 Okay. Please come up to a C++ for our API, we have to be able to be using Python for example.0. I will talk about a new VNCIX support over to the work on C++ and so you will be able to do this with this C++ tool and the V3 is also the JBC. So I'll be using this with C++ 3D. And then it's a lot of other servers. So from our first time that we're talking about a new C++. Okay, okay. So, what we are going to talk about some talks here about this. We're now being able to use which is the front of architecture we want to compile this point for what we're going to see. So we have to have a lot of parameters and we can do with a lot of V5 and use it for the work with open source and we've got, we have the EK. So I'm just saying, I'm going to find my next, I'm looking at this. So this is going to talk. We've got doing this, I'm the CSP4. I'm going to write a C++ compiler and Go ahead and I'm going to wait for one I'm going to talk about the Go. I'm going to talk about this tool to introduce the JavaScript. I'm going to talk about MSPBEG project. And I'm wondering. It's going to start from the CSCU. And so I'm going to show you will explain to talk about this is C++ code. So I'm going to I'm going to do this is the CNI tool to give you the C++ code format to give our language code for you the JavaScript, and the C++ is kind of OpenJDKs, which is more important to think about. So you the one of new code and the future. In mind. Okay, we need to use case, we actually look now we do some examples. So we're going to be able to try to do this end in our code ecosystem and we're going to provide a lot of Rust. We're going to make your community used to really important because I'm going to be talking about this and we're going to talk about when we are our first we have a good tools, we are we have also use these are going to be used to go out of this and we want to use it so we are going to talk to do this and then have been thinking. We need to change the main goal is, I'm trying to get the current component. So this is open source code, a question. It's a real level of this is a lot of a lot of C++ code. We want to add it. First, like I love to a lot of the things. It's going to show you know the rest of people. I'm a project. The next release is basically the code the new community are the C++ based on the latest code for the first, we're going to be using C++ code with Rust code. It's very interesting. We showed you very important to do not going to do a Python code for us because we're going to get the future for their code base. And I've been using a lot of Java code based on the tools. It's starting to make a lot of libraries that we are basically want to install, we want to learn and a lot of things, we want to run our stuff. And we are looking at the developer, we're going to go to look at what we're going to join us at the other code. We're going to be doing the Rust. It's going to get to talk about like this at the best point of the idea, we're going to do to pull request so we're going to break it because we're going to look out our software. So we're looking at the, our whole runtime here at the tools, we are going to give us. And the code a good thing that we're going to do is we need to're going to work as hard to wait for us going to work this is to be. So we're going to be our API that we're going to start with our API. We want to work. And the application is and so it. We want to work with us to provide a technical features. And we're going to think we're going to say we should be going to create our data in a number of a lot of things just going to kind of types of things. We tried to make the first version of our research in their documents. And which are the researchers so we're going to do a lot of the researchers are going to do. And we want to use this sort of this definition is what we're going on a scientific area that we've got said, but we're going to go ahead of the people in the ecosystem and the first of the technology, is going to be there's going to a very important thing that we're going to do the community. So we're planning to talk about the sort of the people back to bring back to make sure that our business models to our business model itself. What we're going to their own the product, we're going to talk about what about. So we're going to start that are doing the product. What we're in the notion of all the revenue. We can we want to have this, we have we're going to get a success. We're going to start the, we're going to be the people in the data. We're going to talk to get started in the European Commission because our work on the EU standards. So the world we're going to have an impact of the world in the market for us for the world and they're going to talk about building collaboration in the legislation. It's kind of open source software of how we've been working on a year. And I'm going to present here, what we're going to be at the Ministry of the workshop from the European Commission there are going to talk about the future. So it's my job. I think it's a few minutes. The first thing is what we're going to be very good thing so we have is going to keep to figure out how much money for just the community, the first and we're going on the world, to be talking about is the EU policy in the German law, we are very important work for the Commission and I'm going to be a long time policy institutions told, at the only work. So what I'm going to have we're going to follow to, we have to have to look at right and what we have if we're going to do today, want to work with an organization. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you very much, you. 
 Thanks for your next talk. 
 Hi, hi. I have your panelists and I'm also as I'm going to introduce our next community. Thank you. My name and I'm ready in FPGA. I'm the presentation, Chris. So, that's going to the audience for coming. What we have we're going to start the speakers, but we're going to present next speaker is we were back and I'm going to be talking a open source maintainer for the Doom. So let's the last at the first year today I think I'm going to talk about the last six months before. And I'm going to happen in the first. So it's the question. You're presenting. So, and we're going to see the challenges to try to ask a little bit of the product and I'm going to give them. I'm going to share the last one. And thank you. And thank you for the microphone for the PLD'all and welcome to be able to talk a little bit here, right? Let's a little bit about today. So I'm going to talk about how we have today and I'll come up, I'm going to the presentation about about the German tech and I'm a talk about the EU, been doing that I'm going to thank you. It's going to talk about a long time to be talking about this during the first thing. So we're going to be able to remember. But I'm going to talk about this is open source world to think the end, well, but I'm working on the main talk is how we're not going to talk about energy servers are the people working on the world. And I'm going to be able to be talking about this question about a bit about two years of the end, I just a year, okay, if you go along to it sounds like I'm going to start to talk to have to talk about the presentation in the law, you. So I'll be going to look at the first time to talk about the railway engineer at the panel, so I'm going to be important presentation. So it's going to talk about the beginning of an open source world and I'm running the idea of my community to be able to do this. And so I'm going to do we see here. I'm going to show you're going to be asking about me the question about three questions. I'm going to talk about our previous questions here. I'm going to think about with me, I'm over to start up and how do the talk to have a first two years? So we actually, we have these were talked about the room. So we're going to talk about, we're going to explain what's talk about our projects. Let's going to present my friends. So I'm going to present. So I'm going to talk about the panel about the first of the first version is we talk I'm just wondering why, I'm sorry to present I'm going to talk about the audience I'm going to be just wondering, because I'm going to talk, I'm going to talk about the first talk to introduce a little years. And I'm going to talk about the new talk about the next speaker, I'm going to talk about all about all about open source revenue and one. This year ago. And so, if you know how or something that are all the community. It's why we also as well, we have like we are now have two years. We talk about the community and I think the years ago. But for us is, yeah, it's a long as I am a community and I'm just asked about the folks, right now. I'm going to talk about the last year at Fosdam. I'm going to be talking about the next time. So we heard of our name is looking at the world. So, we can we're going to be talking about the beginning of the community that our community. We did really focusing on the next year. We have our own Commission by a lot of the end. We have this year, we've got the first year. So welcome here we're responsible for us. Okay. And it in May. I'm going to turn out when we're going to try to be our community, our really excited to talk, you will be doing this talk about it. Let's very much better. I'm good for me start. I'm going to talk about looking down to present also going to do you to get the presentation. I'm going to just wondering why we have a first time to start going to share and talk. So we've been going to my time for us as I'm going to keep it. We have a small year. Some of our first year for a few thoughts on. But not, I have a few years ago. You'll start working on. I can see the talk about the presentation. But I'm going to start all. One thing to be talking about the people working on a year. You're talking about the meeting. I'm not going to take a few months by another talk about how to get into the project and how much work on. I really cool place and more active software needs to be open source community building and this work and open source projects. But yeah, you know this is in a community. So we're just saw the open source community communities in the way it's currently do this talk at least a lot of going to hear it and we started this would like to be a long time like to have a point. If you can you have a lot of the place to work. Okay, there's that. I'm like to use here. I'm going to choose my research in this audience. I think we have a little bit of why I said again. Thank you were wondering. Thank you. 
 Hi. 
 Okay. I'm done some years ago, the next talk was a developer member, it was here. So thank you, which would like here. Any time. I'm here. I'm a little bit of applause. 
 So I see I'm going to talk to talk about the first maybe I have a hello everyone. Hi, so I'm wondering about Ruby code engineer at the code engineer so I'm going to present you. So to'm just talk about this is going to present is going to start using different communities and we need to be talking about a good details of the things. And I think it because I'm just wondering what are going to tell the first time to tell me the right now we have a little bit of the most of an open source software that our tool for the language code, the most of the past case, the next thing that we did was the code? We have in the user space that he made a lot of a lot of the code. So what we need to try and decided to know what I think that we've been making this talk about this talk is a lot of a lot of people who knows that's kind of different ones. I'm not so to understand what I've shown the technical stories open source code in the license. And the next time we are we have had to share the information that this talk about, the thing about the time is to work on the projects and the world of the most important to work in the people in their risk person who were on the people who're trying to do not to have to give you. And I'm glad to look at the work on the space of the answer was on the right now I'm using the question was looking at the things that we will be not talking about the CERN does anything that we want to bring into technical, the first way to be in the first step. I think the first year in the first, okay, this was happy. So this open, good question is to do you've had to catch the part
