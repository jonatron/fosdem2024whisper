 My name is I'm not going to talk about the open source software engineer in the idea of the community. And I'm going to be talking about open source projects. And I'm going to introduce the Open Science project called OpenDesk. I'm also wondering about Open RailK years of Open Source at our open source project, which is a lot in the European Commission in Europe. And I've been using It's a researcher at the time at the European Commission in the team, which is the Commission and a full Commission in the open open source software. And I'm already had the end time in the UK funding to be the Open Source, who will be, to work on the product that. And I'm going to be paid for some last year. I'm wondering, so I'm going to make it to be a very successful industry of the open source world. I'm a small big outcome of the court in the court and many years to do this be, it's first step from the end of those the first point. But I'm not not sure that his co-to is the EU initiative, I'm going to be a positive point. I'm going to be to follow the year I got a long year. I've got a few years before I'm a bit a large tech project to have this opportunity to say, right hand on the EU world. And to work on the companies, are not an open source world of a lot of open source project. So I'm the OpenGI. I've been working last year, but I'm going to give a little bit of my presentation of a lot of open source software in 2021. And I am I'm in the other platforms like last year ago, I'm wondering, open source projects from a lot of people about the two years ago, the world. And I am I'm curious about where I going to discuss in the European Commission with this year, she. Because I'm going to share and I'm trying to be co-founder of the world of the work in an hour and I'm going to be excited about the main point. I'm just wondering, so first over the world, the moment, I'm going to be saying, but it feels like I'm not going to be concerned about the open source world. I'm glad to get the CripPad. I'm sure that I'm really wondering about the people who's not sure. I'm starting at the CEO of the world. I'm going to present in here. I'm going to be going on the beginning of things in my slides. And I'm going to support projects or just wondering why they were not doing that the future now. And I was wondering about today. I'm going to improve the product, the topic in this is there was doing the first three years ago, but we made this talk. I was about what I was the talk about how you came to take an open source law in a new open source and the culture with people who were talking about that I think it and we did I think it. And that I'm going to speak to ask a few years ago I need to introduce us, but I'm a little bit and I'm not sure. All right? Yeah, I'm going to wondering, I'm just wondering the first one was wondering. So, so you, the question that we have the CripPad. I'm going to mention that I think I don't see. I was wondering. I think, I would be wondering, is a big to work for the only about the world. But, but I have been seeing in between the world. So, we have plans for those ten years ago, six years ago. So I said, on the next talk was just to the community. But I also the years ago, I have to show, I'm going to be, I'm going to talk with the community to ask you, how you an organization, or something that we want to talk about thinking about each main group of people and also have to know, but I'm going to build some of our data. And I'm going to take care about this. So, right? Because I mean, from the real time, we are we want to encourage you. First, I have one of our agenda. OK, we have been doing it. We have colleagues of the first. And so I'm going to speak a very well, for example, a bit of this presentation, it's all the first a bit more. And this is something that the best solution would like this is a very important to show us, for a very important to do. So I'm going to speak about me a lot of the future of open source, well, in the general things are the most important part of your community part is not a world. And we can't see. So, if we will present, we want to talk about open source software for example, for example, why this is something that there are an AI and I'm going to talk about the product. And I'm going to talk about your open source companies are just a new software and I'm going to start with the world. I'm going to be just wondering. I'm going to skip this talk about whether it. What the next? You may have to do we want to talk to tell me, but from the issue then we have to be a lot of the open standards, I'm going to speak, which is built on the company. And I'm working on the EU directive, I am already saw that. I'm wondering you about the world that was thinking about the number of the world because I think like very happy is the talk about that are we don't know that. So they have some of the first that we have the product that we have have a lot of the world. And so there's of women who is a strong product, we are people are also tried to share in the community and are doing the whole, but of the commission and the, think about the first, he has been able to fill this very an open source communities and the beginning, which we've come from that I'm going to me on it. And you're a very quickly to go to be if they're going to be in the European world. So the other idea of this kind of course that's the same outcome of thing that we think that we are familiar with scientific projects to have to be the EU to have been doing to say again in the license about the best world. And we have been talking about a really, a value used for the open source, data management or a digital Commission that you have is that is a very much from the beginning of the EU science definition of our legal and the EU and OIDs of the EU world, we have done with a national license and so much time. So the goal is an AI can we're going to bring from the definition of Germany, we've had to what we're going to talk about the organizations to come to be a given to happen on the years of the last year, and we are going to impact assessment and we're going to be going to be a very important challenge. So from the first time, you're thinking about the CRA. Any other impact of these kind of government liability between the rights in the world and the PLD at the EU public national sector then that from the place, we have a national sector to open source software and they have been also say to have a long to provide electricity licenses and also free to be really important. And this year ago, we saw this also need to take towards the EU which is on the commission as open source sector and this conference and you've been, and to use in that are also about what is actually are going to be very important to start to be done. So the world of the best world is that we've been talking about open source world. And to why these organizations can we use software centers and we've been talking about this is using the moment of a new sector. And we've been asked the only the main panel. So we're going to ensure if you see the first step was quite interesting part of the first thing was to take a very well, the market, because we have been discussing or four companies are moving to be able to hand over our world that they have a lot of open source software of people in that are public sector. They're going to have been in the world. So there are not always heard about one of an audience and they are also so we have a year, this to be open source software and they are not and they are making the work. We're going to get to make sure that open source software, their community's the important to do this work. But we are we have a little bit of people in the challenges, oh, we have a human movement, but also you need to have to get the foundation. So this really interesting here in touch that was a lot of the license and the community. And I think the community we've got around this and decided to look at the organization. It was so this last year. It was just a lot of the world. You may be an open source community and we sort of organizations about having a lot of the EU. You need to think it's so long time. But I don't know about a good practices, I started to think about the main thing is going to do is a PR and the parliament are the community and the copyright, the world have been involved in the world companies, but they're not have never just a very likely the only the things that they're not work, the second aspect of the second person they're going to be on this a lot of the best decision because it's the communities and the first law. And I think the next thing, but actually is that we know. And last question I think I think for the panel was you know what I think the thought about the way this is that before. So these who are those were thinking about the open source world and open source software, often in law we were responsible for the developers. And I am I think he was talking to go to he did I think they are thinking about the European Commission. And this point to dojo is, I'm going to work on being an open source project alliance in the community and they're actually had to talk a chance to talk going to me. But that when much as well, it's going to talk about the world of the CRA that point and the first open source and the context of the regulation, just the moment in legislation is going on the court and the market and the court would be in the world, should be a bit. And I think about open source community more good. And then I think the first, but we are the years ago and we are done, we're going to see in the main ones already had to keep in the way to talk about it in the case as well, because to have to be in the software, we're going to come. And because we have, we have a lot of the European CRA, we remember the world because we're going on the EU law, we have a huge way, we're going to look at the decision about it's in these sector, but we're going to look at least, we have to talk to be here when we can we need to turn up to be there. And we want to give you were all these ones. We're going to share the things we're going to do it. And we're going to work that we're going to talk in the rights, you know, three months and the opposite of these other countries that we're talking about them in the German law, which is open source law because we're only have we are following that they're going to be a situation. And that's very important to look at least since the question and the last year. Or that the story of the moment, we are being trying to do on the organizations and we need to start the law. And so we're a the law, we have in France in the end of the market that we aim to provide a challenge of the EU and the case, we start and then just end of all these institutions, right software has been helping us the world was at the directive. And that we have for all the European Commission, we're going to say, why we need to help us to give you to point we want to get in the most likely that okay, our first one of the law about how do they're going to do we're having that. And last year, it? So we have an impact of the EU institutions are the foundation. The second thing called NGI society, we're like as a lot of the negotiations who are going to be the EU law, but they are the last year, we're going to be looking for a bit of global law. So the US law, the law, which is the EU and this law. And we are it's the commission and as a foundation, and the legislation. And this principle, we can be able to have a European level. And there is the world of the world is in the world so that we have a European end of France, we have the good research industry. Like, our German law science, I think it is a different product that the overall movement was an only the electricity, the energy supply chain in German law by the country of the company that also at the business perspective that was the EU policy, if you can then like a good thing in a legal product and the regulation of course, you're, you are very different policy and also the world, as often in a collaboration world, we're going to have a certain law agencies from the council in practice that we've been able to be a copyright assessment of you. And you need to do the end. So the value of the American law of the key, it's a standard law value of a citizen energy digital law to not the law, but you know, they have a private world of his law that this value of energy energy law in the renewable law legislation, they're responsible for GPL law, or they are they're an closed source law and copyright law had a law of legislation. I know that we have been there we're like one law, but we have the years ago, how they have to take, and then they will be able to follow the politics, well something that I think this for the fact that was just for the fact that the IT funding in the world, because the EU and so this case that we saw in France. And most important to not the PLD has you have to have done the PLD support in
