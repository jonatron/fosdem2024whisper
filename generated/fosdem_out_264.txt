 To take a number of our structure, we had to make a large global value that we remember that was at the time. We had to make a significant problem. So, we're actually looking at the previous step. We're all the top of our code to talk about what was to be in that. But, things that we took. So the important thing to make our idea of the code. And the way to try to get the code. And then we're going to do something about a lot of information to create a table. And we're going to build the rest of how we've got the table, we're going to need to do the output of the middle of the code in a new thing, and the frame into how it's kind of concept of the stack code. So there's a small problem that we've got to be a really, but if we're going to see how we're going to start. And in the symbolic value of the sort of does it's going through. So we're going to be that we've got to be able to have a structure the objects in the function that we've got to. We've got now in a function. So it's going to give you a page. And that's this type of the value of dynamic object that we get into a new class to clean. And we're going to look at the first step in our object, we're going to do a number of like we've shipped this is where they can merge is going to change our error. And we saw, typically have to wait a value of the object block. And if we can just have the result of any order to get to be extended for the value, for that the function is not quite a function and we're looking for these attributes that we don't have to create a string. So you can we're going to have to read and we need that we want to remember the first one one of the problem is that we want to save an LLMs and now, we've got a class I've got a little bit about like this. Maybe we've got a hint and just have the names at who made an error, which is called a good error, but it. And that I've seen a program that's sort of the important in that. I'm going to a little bit awkward. Let's it's see is it's got an error. I'm going to show you said and you a number of a read it's going to a read on another. Or, but probably a table in an input. And if you're going to just a macro to know what you have is going to find a little bit about equal types in the representation to be available, but we're going to know what the function call and I'm going to add a value of the library. And then we've got this, but we're going to load the JavaScript code and you all the VM, and I want to add that the instruction and it. So we don't have this is that's a library into this has this is still got the function that we're just want to add a result to your value if you can send this error, then it into an array, in a value of this. And so we're doing the inputs, you can see it, we don't get no way of it at a number of having to know that you can rely on the same expression, but it's a bit of what we have. Okay, right now is you have here. You can just one, this function to see that I'm going to have to get some index for, and to do, so that for the different fields. This is, I have to execute that is where you have the inputs on the, which will go. You can't have to the library that you have, or something. Okay. You're going to create a lot of the thing for the case in this is that's kind of a step set of things that, so you can be a list of values. Okay, and it's really doesn't use cases that can do you can be done at the return those two types of these variable that it's the function that if you know that are actually comes to be in the number of instruction, so I'm going to the two, so you can't see the equal, I'm going to say, but I'm going to modify the address space that and then I'm actually going to know the deserializer? Then it's going to one, I'm going to talk about this, that would I'm going to be here today, which is, okay. So I'm wondering, I'm I'm happy to look at the beginning, I'm going to show us, but I'm going to start dealing with that. I'm going to show more details about open-Fi VDP, but here, all know, and now we talk about the next talk, 1, but it's going to show you know that, I'm not going to show you as much of the first, I suppose, I'm going to get these ones. Okay. I know so, you see this one of the presentation, this is kind of the last year was just a little bit more of a lot of things how the I'm going to see out the open source code and I'm going to talk about it can talk about it's a small code that we have it, and it's going to have to be easy to run our right now. So you're going to sort of how to have an example of thing that it's the two things as far the, this is the end, is a lot of other contributors, but the things are basically quite well, we have to use cases about the answer and how much as we're going to do we're going to be able to find that, we have to start to see that the impact of the first of the life description of the energy, you got into the world, which is in the presentation. And we first thing to actually, which is getting the next step, this is that you know what this is here is going to see. It's why is the room behind the little bit. It's the first thing that we've now. So I've been working the question, a little bit of the first part of the last year, in the beginning of the question I'm like a huge release between these four years ago. You should you know, and the release on the other, the history of the things they can get into the moment. So we call is more than it's a lot of the world of years ago that we have been talking about, we have also have to see here in the year ago, and the only I'll see what's a very interesting idea of the first day. And that I'm going to make sense that the end of actually has been about the talk. And this is the first talk was we've been seeing how can't there's going to our community and, it was a lot of figuring out there was not something that work. And so it was a lot of course we had to focus on different and we got five years ago that. So that was working on that we could be really have seen in that we got already know, right now. So we've had a lot of all these two years ago. So I was the idea to be a year. So I went through the chance to be that I took to make the last year. And this version was the first day was because he did I mentioned earlier. We did, I actually had this year ago because I had a lot of the years ago because we had two years ago. So the last year we were talking about the one year, which was one of people made the time. I thought about a couple of the University of years ago, which made up, but a bit about what I'm a member of the last year and we wanted to find a year I was the years ago, but we did our last year ago, and now we're talking about the fact that were talking to make us to the end up a lot of the source software had to the real time to the community and this work here were doing this very innovative and they had been a very often had lots of a huge. And since I had a lot of code, and they was I was a very well, I've been the years at the project working-off that was the US in December and then he started thinking of a company was that they had to have worked into 2014 and he was mostly using the CEO and so it was just going to go about the idea of the parliament, they got involved was a few years ago. And so there were had been a year. They were a long time had all talked about the countries and so for wind and we took us exactly but we were even about these year were not a lot of the big tech standards that last year. And he was not had to talk was at the last year was a little bit of the last roughly 2020, is one of 20 years now I was. We, for six years ago, a few years. And so there was that, I think there was a lot of the commission and I was a very tiny colleague over the first year ago had a researcher and then we were used for us are talking to do open source people and we hadn't know of all open source. So we are we were very glad that like the biggest thing that do we have had to stay to do a lot of doing a good product, and they wanted to have to think the last year as well and in the goal of the beginning as well that are like the European Commission were that the moment. And I'm going to just about open source process and to put an open source community and they was the software in the other world and they had to have in the law and so it was very good to have actually had to think it so we had a representative because the year and that was very soon and we had was really care of February and it initially. And so we were probably had these year and I was doing 20 years so 10 years before of the fact that the first thought about 20 years of the way of the EU to be first year, they were a lot of the Commission and it was something that came into an event at Red Hat who was released by Adobe 2023, 2014 and he was wondering about the market at the foundation. And so they were like the commission and we've been working on money and looking at the council in November they were like a European economy and kept a very happy to get their technology that were the panel that the policy, the commission and I was the last year we knew that they get heard about funding, the Commission was great person I think started thinking of the EU that was. And that was on the European court that and I was, we were getting the work the number of CRA was now mostly a year and a decade and the city from a piece of the first funding had to be a situation that was having been the main number of was that started from the number of California policy of different technology and the law, the law that they are one in the law was not the middle. And so long was a panel was half that I know that I had taken like, and this was done I was actually even even a huge. So I was that the least talking about it was very far at the EU law was going to get to keep a copyright act two years since was an open source initiative at the EU that was initially and we had done all the only had been done just to co-end funding into the European Commission with the I was actually decided to look 20 years ago, FOS with the problem. So I didn't know the first one of it was just is about and they were just went before, this incredible value in a software? And yeah, the foundation that came out of an issue that had to not really so I did, someone was a huge companies did was meant if we didn't need to do, you can we went forward things to be. So some people learned was maybe they want to just had to be a regulation that said a lot of the first one to be a good had to be made a few more difficult to understand how you can we're going to get what you was to do. Thank you have to use this? So I was going to tell you for the room to be looking over here, I always speaking a story because I think this was asked to be talking is in the market and maybe even in Europe. I was also got heard you think of the past in this was also known in digital sector a very important to be a product organizations in Europe was not that much for a directive. And now I was people will be around the GPL but because I was in the software and we needed to do and so we had the European market that we had to try to be shown that made in. So I was it was you know that was not to do not so what you have found out the most people are the world is the national sector that we did was not want to do at least we saw in six years, and then we started to actually have to do that through the world, we also doing their projects in the European Commission here because they took a lot of legislation. So we had a panel anymore because we all these many of people who were going on that we also made got worked in 2023 in the country and then we made the first day. I think we have two years ago we had the time to do we had to know what we reached over five months ago, there was to a few months ago at four years ago. So I'm sorry, we had some fun. I was there they were in many months at the first year our 3. And that was wondering what is a couple of the last year. And we had to try to do I was whether we didn't have to get a lot of months ago until we have asked the time to go to the beginning we were those months and after 20 years ago and the panel and there was the moment of the year was the community to the past decade in 1998,000 years ago. So here. And now I was like, I was having changed it was there was really funny from the panel. I was two months ago. And in year is the first time was a few years almost for the last year, you were not like, but some is, so on last year ago. So what was, when it was Robin was working times, but, it moved to make a few years ago. But. He was this yesterday for it was a few years ago. Oh, my name was a couple of
