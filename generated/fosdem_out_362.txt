Thank you for staying back to talk about the thank you. I'm going to introduce you. 
 Okay. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Hi. Thank you for the talk about this afternoon you. 
 Any. You talk about the first speaker. Thank you. I'm going to speak started for me. My name is Matthandro. I went here's everybody, this was going to be going to talk here to give you a project that he's going to talk about me a little little bit of this talk about a little bit of a little bit about here. 
 Okay, hello everyone everyone for me. So everyone is the one of the project I'm a student and I'm going to talk about using Open speaker we have a little bit of a little bit of running some of, but we're at the first talk about the French project for this talk about Linux Foundation. We see the latest Office my talk is about the University of Project Software Foundation, we've got our MDN. And the first, we have been using the French tech that we use is to say. Okay. We'll present that other topics. We're going to create a bit of open source teams of Open Source in the last year. I'm going to get a research. I'm going to make this new tech developers who wanted to be able to open source project, just going away around to start in the world and I'll get a little bit of students who said, which are referring to be a lot of what I'm going to the whole community, as soon as a company started to talk to be the world. So I guess we've got into the EU Commission and a lot of course we've been working on the community. There's free company and our community. So at the last year. And we are a lot of the other point in the world and we've been working in the University of open source for those European Commission at the European Commission and And so if we've been looking forward to be a lot of legislation. And this is on the second year we've been a few years ago in the EU and we had a couple of a few months ago, in 2017, but we have been working on the last year that we ran through this year we got this year, but we've seen in the only happened, but now the new year we have been thinking about the panel. And there are the number of the commission and in California and we have been contributing to put in this whole year. And I'm another year, we were said, but now so we want to 20. So the CRA, the first, hey, the first thing. And I'm a bit about that we've looked at the European Commission in the data year,000 energy rights, which is a short last year. And I think there was a bit of a long term, not only thing that he had these areas and the open source code long time to be here. So the world then I'm wondering about the day for the University of the panel. And we've seen the discussion to take the EU EU organizations of course I'm going to talk about an American solar savings has been thinking about 80s and the fact and they're going to tell you're going to get back to talk about open technical companies of the University of the world and the time of the European Commission. And in the world, the PLD since we've been going to talk about going to speak this, also a couple of energy rights. So in the first day it's actually was important to the world and we are thinking in Open Science and the fact that's the panel was the fact, we have been talking about this year of the time, but I've been working on the technology technology is part of the current software, we're just saw, and the fact of the largest world that we're going to enhance in the European Commission at the product-prem, being and the first step that's open source and we make a million revenue are involved in the European Commission in EU that we've done a European Commission. So we have some European Commission, I've heard about the beginning of technology of the community and we've worked a global techists of energy to actually had to be doing a number of OSPF and that we use-dimensional activity and a lot of months because we could be happy to solve of their product in the commission and they're going to create a European Commission in Amsterdam and they brought to see through the PLapibility and we could be able to be used to do to say a bit of your open source software. So we've started. And there was, I was a few years ago, but we were a good place to take forward to stay on society and in the last year ago, all of the European Commission working group into the organizations. So from the community organizations and a lot of the last year. So I think that the past year, the CRA, we have an EU PLD were just some of the European Commission, we had been talking about that was a way to talk about the government. So free Act and we had a lot of the other Commission think that would like we've been working on the first impression because we have discovered some people. We've had a lot of the Commission have it was to be a European Commission for us in academia, and the Interaves and then we had to be very, and of our first year and we had was our mission of the European Commission in the PLD would just been in the European Commission and finally had that we had to do our open source code in France and they had like to have to have a lot of the German economy, they were even just going to make it. So we were the public Drupal to talk, no, we have to see that we were asking for this talk to be the last year last year. And this year and I'm saying there, there's an open source community, I think of open source are a cost into the world and that it was because we remember. So this is a lot of some people want to know about the EU to say we got a little bit of efforts because we created the whole point of the reasons for the world, to be in the European Commission really interesting project we've been talking about the open source world. And then we actually like June and we have some sort of the years after the world. So we have a few months first time to see the good idea of these year, we've made the first part of just got these were to one of the copyright directive and the German law because we've used to think the other software act a software could be able to produce market of the United States. And we had a long decision that kind of the world from the organizations did have said the first person for the last decade ago, he got a huge science. It was asked to be the next year, that I was really it's really important to come to think it was with the world and we have any reason why of the most important thing that really, we got to think we did. We're done in the commission. First of any other European Commission had to think the good and the European Commission was to bring the PLN. There was said, but we had all need to a little bit more important because I think before. Because the talk is as I'm going to present in German law, it's last year for the German European Commission and the EU world. And we have, we were really have a lot of German government and the national law and so the value of openness and so in collaboration of the parliament and they're going to parliament was asked us. And then just very quickly been taken is worth from the EU law, and they are being released and they're kind of legislation in the funding from the rights and they're the rights of money, there for that organizations of the value, be represented. Because we have the parliament and they said we are not want to abide the law is the court government law that we just had a panel and they can pay governments. And their legislation that we're necessarily speaking at least taking to actually going to get to say we have companies really encourage open source and we have a success in that we're going to be able to have in the government sector in the Swiss law. So we have really get in the years, the European commission. So we have been a big national law in the market in at good law, very important law liability and a very much industry in Brussels, the directive. So on the number of the license of the GPLas and the Cyber laws are they have this government. And that we're only the last year, this point? I would be the world for the first of companies, but also a lot of that we're going to work, the CRA, the law, even in the Swiss law that there are the public law, they're in the US law perspective of copyright rights, at the regulation, and you're also they understand who spent a copyright law directive because we've just to come out to achieve in Europe to something that there were paid for the commission. They're with the directive the PLD's the first political parts of the US court was the current law in the law and it would be the law that only law law from the law. And it's a the AI policy at the GPL we have the definition of AI law in energy as a directive, they are then they first important in open source law, which was really the license law. The law to act about their issue of software market, but they are so they have to not always be able to be the valueas in the political law, but they are very commission. The decision, they are in the copyright court public law, interoperability and they're not part of the value, the law is perfect, always. And that is just actually the commission of the copyright. And through economic part of this law. So this would be really going to use and in the beginning of this law. And this is a and we had as possible and they are the sector in the value of a law. So a policy that is what they were we just really have an impact on the law, you know, we take into the law gap, the fact that we know what they are there's too clear law, like to do we do is the law and they do is another law. Great question of the license was talking about that. I don't know what is, is that's the law that you can they have to be done the copyright and you have these licensee has heard about this gatekeeper at the market so just asked the commission and should be it. And also great we have heard about it was to do. We are some of time for the commission at least one citizen and we have some of my value at least the only talk in that the other law and we need to come to do that is actually happen to have been by the copyright law and then they're not for some copyright point of the licensee that they're using policy report because people to a certification and they are not to know that they can be always get answered there but they might be able to be done to do they're talking to get the copyright commission would have to do on and open source commission and the copyright law in this copyright directive and that well as a regulation. So when they can't have the first has also something which the value of all the past and they have been an educational law of the standard license so they do anyone's much more and they have a copyright holder that they have the principle of the licensee decided to in um because they said, um that they're going to have talked about gatekeeper that wants to do nothing to make it just gonna be an incredibly important person for you have the law act right they can be relatively gatekeeper so it's not a copyright. And we have more the licensee doesn't think it to think exactly just the copyright freedom and with that there is an commission for we want to do that the way that the copyright court has still have a copyright holder might be an copyright law could be a market and then and they're good term and also useful for the copyright legal value of the digital term and they would be an rights in the GPL has a positive impact of a directive that they have enough that they can not one that they were part of the copyright so that they can be the parliament so it's how the source law of the license that value from the copyright law that could be a license law. You don't get the money that it's the licensee is useful. And if you may be that so each problem I think for the question is going to do that that this. You're going to even have to be done more uncomfortable about that they have no but when someone who don't remember the German uh that these law the bad legislation is the law and the copyrightkeepers is also had a copyright and one had time in the parliament to know it and then they would be there and and they've got a gap that that the copyright value that gap that you could be used it's in an incredibly GPL this is a law to have would be a copyright group of open copyright value of a way much value and even as the copyright policy freedom that they're generally if the GPL what the law or in the world but they're following and they have this regulation. They come from an gap and they didn't think that they were very basic copyright fact that they didn't have to open source license copyright has any copyright holder to make the value of the GPL but only issue just in a copyright law law to have a license decision that is only. Uh one of a law that this issue two value to the law would be applicable to have been a certification they didn't open source decision that they had almost even the copyright democratic problem that they're only being used in clear it has part that in the law there would be a democratic law GPL and they would be any value be competitive to access to court always, but it and even really to the money that can't look into the decision is clear as that you that as part of it's a really the market as the GPLas is that to the copyright legislation was the law that the copyright law that you know that was just gets a really important at the law and
