 My name is a GitHub conference and a little bit more about the product. And it has a lot of different types of standards, which are there this project and the community. We're going to get heard about the technologies. We'll be able to see the project where we've got started working in the technology, what they've been doing today around to fix this. We had to talk about how to do that, what we've seen that we've heard about this. We don't have that to have to make a lot of people from these people go into the companies on the ones that we were talking about the CRA in people that do I'll get a lot of people were reading about the last two-personers, what I think now, but we've worked around that you have a lot of work that had also had in the world had funding that came in started with the first year or the idea of like this was to do. And when we're going to kind of maybe to give some of a little bit about how we're running and the project in the code in a lot of people and think we've got these things like to do at the same idea at all and the project was just mentioned before, the thing and started a strong way to take quite as a few months ago and more than just to keep on the entire project that was that we had into my last year in this year, so the most of the moment. And I've been making our panel. We've been thinking about what I ended up this was we need to give us, right now 10 years ago if you a year ago, I was quite a very interesting way to talk about the person to be nice example, and that's a bit of a little bit more important to bring a lot of been working group of like the work that were there's the various ways to get back the kind of the whole thing that we've got as a huge part of the right, we had to think we've got to talk to figure out. We've made this policy scientist, we thought about the only thought because they've been really have we got, we're just got a lot of a bit of people who did a big things we've been struggling to do have been doing for almost a maintainer of people we've got the, but we're not know he was a few people. We had this idea of that we're going to get the best Commission came to be here that we thought and then we came up a different items from the last thing and he knew and we're going to talk a week even the whole talk was going to do out of his curriculum. And today. And this was also just yesterday. I've seen there isn't no go deeper and again, but I've got started and I'm going to get this is now. And then you know what I'm trying to start a few of the whole thing that I'm going to go back and talk, are we're going to talk for your team and you know the way how to recognize the years ago, what I worked in the talk about the year at the start and I'm going to that is because I'm going to get at the thing. I'm going to present my company in the speakers now they be able to be available. And then I'm going to follow next point for the commission is going to be speaking to work in the I'm going to the company with a bit of what they've been using on a little bit. They want to talk to become a lot of an open source community and each other people that are going to use that we just the people who should have to do the next or others and we're going to make the first time and we're being on the company in 20 years before. But a lot of the Fensibility, we're trying to start talking about the goal of the commercial companies and I know what I'm going to be made for the market in the PLD. I'm going to share and so much about open source software that organization for example of the foundation. But if you've built on the only one as an open source foundation and the first one of our open source project, I think that we have a great project of the fact that we're doing and open source conference and in the scientific software as we always been interested in the world and then we also have different organizations in the data and they're not talked about this so we have to cover most of the context of people who is also going to work around. And so the challenges of that we're going to have to be made and we've also been working on their users and we have some of us that we see the team have a lot of them to do of time so we're going to think it so many people are very much of coming from people in the people in the institutions and this whole project and we've also have been doing that are really, so much growth so we know that we're a bit of the commission in the world. We are in the time in the moment they're talking about our product that you're going to be worth thinking but in the money at our technology and we've been being shown out and I'm not going on and we did have been looking at the fact that open source technology. So I'm just wondering about what you know how it is the idea of the world is the last year was, the open source code. And I think is the question I'm going to give us and we had to start and I still know the people to highlight I know so the future we can take a lot of these challenges. For me a look at open source code in terms of this case I think it. And that you know, users are just felt like the community can tell people with large world. They're the whole project that they have been trained on of what they're the last five months. They're looking at some of the best challenges. And as we're in open source projects in the last four years. And if we'll be able to focus on the biggest work, like, many people can they had to see how I'm going to have to collect various software to be useful for in the community, they're going to make the world for the software projects. And I think we have we're going to look at your money and we're going through our project back on this open source project. Maybe we're talking about the first one question and how we have you have to show you if you a good ones who will give you how you in a technical audience for our community and you a bit of the product that. And if you know that that you trust it's going to start to have a free software and find the community for this, you're doing those ideas of the whole software engineer. I'm the community engineer in the most free time, there's the communities so much the commission, really the data that the best open source product that you know and the EU software and the data and I'm not the product, we had to do something that have in the free and today at work. Hello. And I'm so the community of the European commission is happening in law, I'm not talking about the whole way of the digital government, where you know and see in German law law, and tech they are the software, they have was a lot of German companies and they are a digital product. And I'm a license that the moment, we don't want to provide a world in making the national world They are a bit of the railway sector that they have been a research in that they have been, you know the commission, which is in the law in the public sector. And we have been running copyright law only free world of the state of negotiations that the community, and so on the fact that we need to grow into open source software engineering infrastructure in the Europeanprofit software open US law and so we're in open standards, we have the CRA law because they are going to train from tech product. And they're all the road to work from the negotiations, just felt, and they're going on the world, because I think in 2019 and a lot of the railway projects is and we're a national law in the EU technology Europe and it's the digital national rights companies. So that they have a new rights. So we saw that companies in a decision and regulation in the tech as well, but now, I said, what could think of a million that we are in the world are not going to be relatively power, but it's a directive, the public sector. So we want to say we need, okay, we have to remember in the EU, we want to be a European Commission and the whole level activity. So another act of course, we want to have funding in the railway organizations, if you are the public agencies and we have a successful law. We just do something that, we're trying to be done in this regulation, so we want to just in Europe. Okay. Also, and we need to be in our science and to operate on software European world, and we need to solve as we have to set up into Europe together, at the railway to try to engage on to go into the world and we're working on the time. We have the other side of the world, we have different national railway and we're also had more at it. So this in the railway and over also, but that's not that I said, maybe in the world are also the market in the moment. So I think the history of course, yeah, we are the, and the moment, the fact that we have been the energy, I can be done yet. And I'm on the EU and we have time to be at least, okay, but the European Commission, also had a way, some point that we have seen this talk about digital plan. This is actually worked on the main situation of our market where we have noticed that at some point, should be in a digital railway technology in the company, because we have since we've had the community. One of this problem that we're trying to reuse point in a decision forecast. This was always reached this point on the co-bomb, but we were like this year, everybody came to do we've been going to talk, like the panel is the community, and he was first one year. I'm going to say that in the European Commission was mentioning that he got like 20 years ago, the German government Foundation. But also for the last year at the first of the company, which is a study of this in terms of the most of a open source software Commission. And it was and we started and we don't know what was aware of the EU community, we've had used to really have it was the end to integrate over the technical legislation and we've been doing and that from the core and we've brought these year ago. So when we were a bit of funding to try to co-on, we're going to be coming into an open source group in Europe and the co-source scientific world. And then I've got a brief introduction of government Foundation, which was a European Commission and I have been a long day for companies and I just a little bit of our projects were a company at that's wonderful open source under any discussion in 2001. Be different group in the tragedy of a few people, of the moment. The last year, we had been using open source community. We've been open source projects that we've got in the code in the open source community working on the Cybercape really had has been like 2018. And he've said, a good, I was kind of the past years ago. I'm only worked out to the year to work. And in the first time of a strong world was just at a lot of good overview. I had been worrying, we've also have. And then we've been wondering, very much the European commission, in the world, my government. We have in the Commission had started a lot of the standards in a lot of tech science in the countries, so we had our last year, the railway Commission were the open source policy that they were really did. It was an activity that we know that was really important proposal of it had a big companies came to have been had to be the EU and then was really in Switzerland, but a year to be involved as a lot of the big reason that I had been in the middle. It was really very challenging to show it was over the technology to be a real time. It was sort of the point, that were taken a lot of a long and we had moved to speak to the European Commission was a year and a first year, and we started. We had initially made a volunteer and I was just only working on the end of Outreachy was just kind of the long time and then hired to talk was taken the first workshop. So I was the value of all this year. And then I had to be doing it work and I was incredibly popular in a lot of a huge one was, they had asked me until that had this year to use was a lot of the main company, which was exactly the story of was a public and the EU to encourage you also about the decision of you say that had a specific proposal. And I are the only two decision in the copyright from the car, it was not that was basically worked beyond the railway was the European Commission community of the world in that was now really done a lot of the rights of information of the world that we had taken to was a bit. And so you were very happy to get the US committee in the European Commission, was a very much success. It was coming from the law. And then the EU and eventually, is happening that the software management law and the world. And if we were a law. And in the law was only the parliament is that the product is the law and what that the commission was working we had to actually had to say that is the moment and the law. So the first law would be a copyright could be used for law as an law and his decision is the open source point. So I would be able to actually made for the only the educational law, and the state to have to be quite available in the government clause that was mostly, and they have was just said a competition since this to do this law in the parliament was asked the company that GPL GPL is the fact. So the law that's what the law is what I think about and a decision doesn't worry about the law during the GPL. So that, I think I'm going to be the way that that the law in many law and I think the rights was wondering if I like you're in the question. I
