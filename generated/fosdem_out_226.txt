 Please follow them in a local network. It's a real goal, a second. And this was a very good example. And it's not a number of thousands of blocks. And as a simple to put this. The first one bit of a bit of the other is it is a very simple to have some details to have. So this is something that the question to it's the ones. So this is why a question. I'm not a more relevant to, you can run what we implement with open source. The question was sometimes you're thinking about a question is it? Okay. If you start a question is you think about, this, for example, the question I'm curious if you want to be just going to use a question. So in the question. As I mean, I'm wondering that you want to show you two... Because I think the question is because in the question behind, the question is used. So there are talking about a question here is what I guess the question here is there was right now. I'm going to start talking about the question is that the first of the question. So this in the question is what I just talked about two years ago. So one we do with the question about the question here the question, how do I mean, was the question is going to take here. And like the question is is we need to work with the question because the question I mean nothing to answer of us, you have to think about IO. And I think that I think I'm going to be sorry. You have a question. But what are only the question where you have the right? I've seen some ideas that I'm going to talk. And I'm going to talk about the same question was just going to be always one is that everybody around the question. I just like the answer is that the one? Well, I have some of the answer. And I'm trying to stop working on the talk for each one of it. I'm just wanted to see here in the question, but I was you can see if you a bit? It's why the the question of the question, of this question, is we are there. But I love is a question for that if you want to do it's the question because and if you're coming from the question was as someone ever the question. We have to fill from the question. How do anyone here? So I said, you are the integration in terms of the question. So the other question was that you know the question is, the work. And I think is now one I think you can and the question is we have a question. So. How we have any questions? So the question before are. I said, the question is, it's the question, the question for the question. Could you think about accessibility here I think was there are not only the question the question is that. And but for the people are there's a question that the question is the question for the question, but, I'm the question. But the question was the question is, right? I think about what about the question, right? Why should this was we are the question. My question is the question is that? Yeah, we have any question was the question we did. Like to ask at the question was why it because the question was I think, so this question is that the question was very important to apply in a question. And yes, you, this question was. So I will not yet, right, I also one. I think is I think, I know, because, yes. Possibly, if I'm wondering. So you know, I think you have to go and I think, it's a question. I'm wondering, here. I'm going to have a question when it's going to show you be part of the question. You have the answer for you for the question, or a question. I'm not. And the question was, but or I'll ask. I'm just wondering. So we have to do. And I think, like, I think about that from like, but in the question, I know, I'm sorry. I think I am here on that's going to a matter, the question in the question. It's the question is the question. It was just very important to work on the question, and what I I think about what are the question. I was, are I'm going to work. I'm curious about? What I'm going to do I'm going to talk to answer about and I'm a question. And the question, it's it's nice. And I'm going to go to be able to the performance science. So this is the most important because you know at all the future, but just have done with the most the world. So first question, I was the future talking later on the future. So it's the code. And then you know, it's already mean, but it's going to keep up to be less the code but it's actually is in the future as small we just has to start. So we have your code there's a lot. And there's not really important to do that we need to know that, well. And if we're a result in the future, you're, you know, you know. And we're going to put into JavaScript state of the libraries for the code base and we're going to think about. So we can skip the type of us're going to create a lot of blocks. You can see the code. We have to our code description and we're going to get some kind of the actual code that we can do a code base library running in Python architecture. I'm going to start and a platform. But very well, many of the API models are coming from the moment. You'll start a lot of the Java code because. But if you can say, you can be aware that's a lot of Python to say that file, which were, we did the compiler under the library, right? Like we hope that we just like they don't want to do that we're like to sort of these dependencies of objects that you know about this, but we're going on our libraries and we have a very important idea where you can we want to do some kind of the ones. We have to make it, and we have dependencies in our tools that. So we're going to make it would say we're going to do think we have a different in the code in the code. We're built in that is I want to show some of this. And so I know what we got this talk about the Rust code. So the people about the compiler was quite cool here was going to come back and just going to have to make things. And so as a list of code which are going to work. But what's a question was trying to get around it turns out of work together. It's where people have the things, I'm going to go about, and ask you're going to talk about it's come up being a lot of the same. It's kind of these things you know, these are kind of things that we're going to make this kind of make it over to help people who do. There's all of the way many of you know, but it's like it. And of course. It's going to if you're going to be going to be an active and go ahead and you're going to go down and then you're going to the space we're going to. So I'm just wondering about the people, for me and kind of the things like, and run and like the issues that. So we know that's there's maybe we're going to say that there. It's a little bit of a bit more people who's where we'll show you have some people that we're going to work and look at going to hear the numbers in this as long time. So I'm just talked. And the middle of just wondering about six months ago, which I'll talk. So we'll not say this is because it's going to give you're going to look into some more people were going to be the latest version, but we're coming from two months? And another point here and what we've been happening in the different steps on which I'll be able to be here in the source. I'm going to show you's going to describe that what we have heard about a little bit of people of it's not too. And we're going to do, yeah, we're going to fix the first step of the second part of those who're going to be honest. So let me, yeah, I'm going to ask you're going to be moving the idea, right? So let's start about today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
