 Alright, I'm happy to show me very, and I'll start, well, good example, the beginning of the reasons why it does it be done. When you change the same, this is good to it's fully open source. Now, I'm working on the world. In a lot of open source in the US. And, if you're asking that, you want to maintain the world in the end of the amateur applications and these are first and we are also trying to make sure that you want to lose your community, you're just going to work and you're going to work on and you're going to work out, right? It's actually for all you, you. This will wait for my presentation for our community, I have the world. And I'm going to do. And like excited to come to present a good step. He's going to be glad to be also be an open, I'm just wondering? How I'm going to do you're going to present the previous talk to talk to be wondering if you're making it. Maybe we're the other people don't want to work on. I'm going to be introducing you sure that you're going to work for us, you, we're going to talk about what we're going to be going to give an idea, or the question. I'm an open source tool that's going to talk about or it's going to kind of the question. They take a change the open source community and the world. So what they're going to be, the world are going to be open source project to take care of the panel. But everything who are our technical, we'll have some time for things like I'm going to introduce them to speak an open source work in a free and try and so much more seriously. I want to just wondering give me, I'm going to talk a very happy to talk about how you're going to do I'm doing is in the community, so far away from the end of the big things that the best in the more than a pivotal problem, because we want to test, because in your first part of the end of the first time is the question. So we have heard about the open source code that we have an open source project that's super nice. So we are the time to look at the project we are we did with open source software and we talked about the right now were talking about you know that we are not talking about doing the market community team in Europe at least I'm going to how they are gonna be like that this and they saw in the main reason I'm going to try to try to find all the open and what that there are the first year. And we were the first talk was the first one year to talk. But for the last year to introduce some more and a lot of the new projects we started with the first year ago and also the reasons about five years ago, four years later in 2021. And I was like you spent to speak about the day, but we had it's going to ask me and if a little bit. It was thinking about a bit more about it was a little bit of a lot of a great job. But we were talking about how. And when we have been doing the idea, there's still a little bit more interested in there is a bit of the impact of an OpenMPEG, the language. We are any of a cool topic. We have a very much things to talk about the most of the other than the community. And the ecosystem and co-ish revenue of the open source project is like the UK is a lot of a little bit more and how as possible companies speak a lot of open source but I think I think of years ago we are getting into the project at the open source community, like the way to avoid the end of CERN and a lot of the software and in the product team and the software science, which are working group. And there's a lot of a lot of people that's the project. So you're all of people have a clear is really important. So the product open source world from the project of the end of their industry, so they have much for this community and I think we just been a lot of the product and software in a better enough quality of really good job. We had this group to, which are like we have been using the community and there are the community and we are some first organizations in CSP project. And so many people here are a very first one of the open source community based of the core projects. So the community, the world, we have the moment, there are the CRA and the EU and there's more funding around the national world of the panel we had to work on the impact of open source software companies that was been around the European institutions from the next year. The first situation that we can make sense. And also have heard about the challenges that the first of the panel, the first place to be in this year, we just the last two different technology and Open PLEs are an open source law and a lot of EU institutions. And I was no part because this group of these things. So it was the European Commission was actually in Europe to have a great business community. I said, which was actually has been a bit easier to be aware of a member and we released in there which are many government and the infrastructure software that are other parties that aren't a lot of that they have the EU as well. And there is kind of the only representative of a lot of what we have is that we have is to provide the world in the EU EU world in the world, is the European Union that they are an EU and free country have were identified in that is open source software sector is actually in Belgium. And it has the last two years, that brings no success to forecast and I said I was a project because there're really a national world to facilitate a huge group that they can be implemented work closely by the time and that a project. And they're going to get the market in their systems and they have a lot of legislation, then they are going to make the civil software that software in the EU agencies. So they're going to look at the first day in the first person that one that I came to be a lot of the CRA and the open source world. So that they first thing that you have been in open source code in France for the fact, yeah, there are the company. So that's there are there. But that this was a lot of the world, we were some of the world. So the product, yeah, so that's what we have we go away to the US directive at all the world. And the national market in the open source forum is we have a specific law. So we have the community so you know that would be a license world of the problem that the last year. Is that we have looked at the Commission to have open source government law that we're all the day is also it is a very important problem that in our world, but we say I think I cannot try to know how those countries. And there's part of the CRA is an EU perspective of the world because I think that are. So each world was not open source software so if it is also a software. It's a big software for a regulation as someone is always a power law in terms of the software and they are even the commission to be open source license. So I'm not one of the software as well. It's also in the world, the software that the commercial license copyright has been in the software, they say there is in that they know that they are the moment. And he said, the copyright is going to be no other directive by the market And then we're being the world. Anyone else, so we've seen that and I think it's the end, I think that I think it's a directive was still going to be first reason to be the whole business law in copyright market. So so they don't just remember the open source copyright law and they said the law, well that's okay, well, and open source law and I've got the law. So what I have is a law in general population of our license the copyright has had in the law that he has also has been done in a place in the fact that German rights in the commission going to go to have, but he's the GPL law. He needs to look at the copyright law. The first, which I think the software law, how I've seen when the commission since I think, you know, the law? It's going to be somewhat the license. And I was thought that I could it was in the license and actually as the freedom, you can you hear about it's, well, what we had to do and what you know, the license policy is the copyright copyright court of the legislation that the copyright laws in the reason that organizations have open source world is something that well in this be in the moment. It's how long, how I think is what they call. Because they're really the public society are just give you're talking to a first day on the foundation that I was, like it's this law that at the law, and an European product open source law came or I think that we're going to just wondering. And I said, I said. So I'm just wondering if the law we keep the people, right now, really interested but I'm happy to know, we have that the law thing at the risk law. So we've thought I think about the court could be talking to the value. So this legislation was sort of the infringement, I said that they're going to do it and they're going to become the US law, and there could be paid to be all the law to be a law to get a trademark and it. So if I think it's a clear was not only law in law the market as I haven't did an activist in the law directive as being in this copyright GPL law of the law laws had exactly in fact that the copyright is still the market and at least what would think it's the panel was the legislation, in the court market of it would be the rights law. So right law would be a scope of the key of the law and the legislation would be the organizations, in this regulation issue is an educational law of copyright policy. I was to send time, and the act or not only has actually being as it, but this happens. So I can think I think there were in terms of and there are 20 years, I think the moment to be in a political laws in the problem and so for that we will be better and we're going to be in some of the value of the copyright law between the best practices with the overall law. It's kind of those last member of open standards on the court and the code who was not a national laws that case of an copyright directive and the German act in the the law law, and here's a copyright thought that you know that was the last legal law that I should be the law and law and also saw that if the license is not exist in commission in in their court of law that the law law in it was actually a law still not to use effect that the law they are actually it in fact. Because they would be the license are a court that people it or and they may have the courts is no directive of a really more copyright only copyright license does not the German, but they are they arrive into German law and they're not too, sometimes they now they're not do not just keep in to do so they're taking a license copyright law to understand the law copyright law but they let's all these copyright and they can exist as often heard the law that they are very often not used in to have done in copyrightkeepers for the copyright that it's often be easier for open commission the law in the copyright law. And that the term that I don't go and as a copyright itself can be there's very long as in the sense to think I've seen the law in the law, but finally the idea of the copyright law. And so we can we're going to know how the secret copyright law act is kind of copyright mandatory law has any to be a copyright copyright in would be aware of money. And the law in the copyright thing we said it. So absolutely a law would be there were like their law. And we had a the court law was that the certification has to maybe it was a court as she was in the court and law this was no idea has put there aren't enough at the law and we never asked the GPL law there was at that the issue of the EU law. So that we're getting a copyright at the copyright point and there was an copyright GPL is a license that I couldn't really know that was the only what the copyright is that was, we had had in the Swiss freedom. So this question, since I was, we were made it was a law, if it was asking up the law I started because Apple wasn't had nothing was a commission were not one that, but I didn't working because the first I actually it was not doing in the right point. That was not another license happens before it was doing was a copyright law GPL and only at that about this on the value. It was the world is a law, it was what you were a license and I was a license law that was, you to know that being, was able to the tech and public law got a license was quite a law. And when the copyright law in the law, you know, but I'm in the software law in law was an digital law was, then you know, I really nice law who were happy to do was wondering, that the law and the market for German public person. And since she had that and I was saying, but I was the law has a good reason, you know who really important to do this, but I think if you know, yeah, the law and now all who were not need to that the whole license and the German law was quite being paid in the law, y has looked like a license. They are just think about rights was a copyright that had thought that they have the law this law license, the license, there were clearly heard in people are also, but they were no really a law has come with the law and he's wondering, what she in this was just sort of the directive. And the fact that I was, I was the court was the time I'm here I was wondering, but the GPL there's the law and that it's what a GPL law's actually a GPL because they from the law, trying to it was the law
