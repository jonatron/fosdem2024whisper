 So it's for our own application images, you can just say, you can do with HPC and see the way you have their application. So I have a video is a very important, but if we have an ID. So I'm here. You can select a data which is where it's a way to do this into API like a Docker application. Okay, we have a whole name of your API for the framework that is like a good tool that was doing new application with Kubernetes into our API called it and then be able to use it to add to a Kubernetes. You can edit all the users. So you have a Kubernetes and provide a Kubernetes and each other thing that was using JavaScript, OpenShift is that is a server to a service in the workflow that we have to do other storage manager that can kind of a cluster. You can be also have a Kuberes, and you can generate our cluster for services you can run in a data. You can run the Kubernetes cluster in Kubernetes You can specify, you can have any cluster, of the main pods with a Python which is called Kubernetes is called AI. And if you are reading a Kubernetes, you want to create a Kubernetes cluster to use a pod, and it's a database level and create all your cluster. You can actually create a way for example, and the operator that you can be an application to be the servers, and in that are all of the data. You can call or Kubernetes and put your cluster and then also what about all of the database and all the nodes are the models. We want to deploy that you change. You have all these first thing about your cluster using Kubernetes server, of these is basically your API, your cluster, your APIs, but your cluster will not the APIs for your API because the data cluster are the result I want to share things right. And if you can are also interact with the data and in the data is a data out. I hope that's one, a project and I'm going to data over here and so we have so here for us to be able to be like this deployment and then we have this architecture, we use case of course it on our own network to have a network requirements and how you will be complex systems. So that we are the data for us are not the network and the data are actually a network. We have a workflow on the cluster. We have this is a new is a challenge of a prompt. So we want to all we have these are going to enable the data that we have here on our users for our infrastructure for questions. So we are very specific data is we have to keep coming to use in the data and for these local service and the process. And when we also as well. And the data side with data, we have a different transport service infrastructure. And we have one of these clusters for us. And this service, at the same to apply to use to this case, that we have a very easily as we are not always available, but I am in our service and if you can be done for our network, still use a very important to use case if you have a very important to write your data on your application and these instances because we have to set data to the data to a data that. And if you can ask ourselves in your data, you can be able to integrate what you can provide using an example, how to use this needs to use IP configuration and change. And because we have questions we have any data in a problem. We have been done in or we need to have a future that basically we're really use our service to implement and it a DNS. The only what we have to support service to implement the network and at the cloud service to work on which might be done a service ecosystem within the public service, and some IP in the application is just handles services. And we have in June and so we have multiple network. So we're in OpenSSP to provide a service and we would be afraid to have some cloud API that enables and we need to choose a cluster to be capable and servers to have to authenticate with also about the services, but we don't have the cloud and to access to do already have some kind of our application data. That's very important to that are having to reuse as we have to process, we need to do that is just say at least a packet. So this point of the address the first part of the other tools is open API we've not on to use core. In the design users, we have VIP or digital services to start with AI. And with a Cripcing, the moment, and then it's open for us are going to get this specific, but then the data in the server and I think it. So it's not that is a different servers. I think for the local API is the product of the standard, basically the agent and then the, I actually what's all of features in general. So our users are the same in terms. So the product, as our project hashed to be done. And this is also the things, nothing that, the product model is more important to the data that they have to the whole definition of the process, you can be in practice for open public and the end, okay, so you can be as a lot of course out of things that when we can see is not aware of open source and no requirements. Another thing that is it's a good so, if you have to find a word for this thing that the way, so you want to create your problem to give you can see how much more energy, how it can we can we need to make this. So for how this energy is going to influence the open source as possible. So this is we set up, the last slide we have a lot of the reason for energy, the energy, just a software, a national software supplying and the only thing that we were a whole project. Now, is also a bit of the community, we also as a risk that we have not build party companies and this research, as funding is going to go very important solution for people are coming for that we have to have to people for us to be in and looking into this in a non-term capacity, but in the European Commission, and we also the world in the moment I said, and in the European Commission. And the years ago, but basically, well, if you know, again, you know, you know, we only one of the European Commission, for the Commission, no, but it's the foundation, we can just know, but I'm going to ask that think, the French companies are they will help you know, like, we've worked on the world and we have the door, we're going to encourage the world as well, it's going to get to be a second. But to emphasize who in the culture, really many of us today, which people. Oh, like, so we're trying to get started to share this talk about the future and the work for the world and has been looking for the goal of the companies who have the open source community. And I think the product projects, we have is great question, and so like to be an idea, they might be kind of this. But there are also a the community and we know when the question was to do you, the day, people were thinking, your community, for's a couple of time, I'm going to keep looking at the time. I was using the last week was not going to come on. So I don't think of efforts of the time in open source projects. And I'm just, so that's a lot of doing that I think that I was working, there pretty good things in the developers like, I was very often the last year ago, that that were not been added for young people who are using free software. And I think, it's a lot of the last day at the first one of the end was going to have some thought, I was very good. And there was using the moment and they had to work with many government and they were other people that you don't know it. But the only one was the rest of the thing I was is I was just wondering what I found as a book and I started working on the foundation, and the data from the legislation. And very, we're going to be looking at least to move progress and then the end, we have to the last year at we have the world and more people to the point to release. And they had a good news that for us are doing it was absolutely annoying to the years to be in the time. And so good thing I was a little bit of the co-shirt, well. And I did I said my presentation like I'm sorry in the panel, I was the idea of the first year for me I was at all of the day. So how is I was not the time. And I was showing up to a little bit of people were wondering for the time. I was about. I got the last year, the day. I kept working year, you know, we had to make the past month by the question is the second feature people told us were going to actually now this was because it was that was the years and that I had before I wanted to create been going to release. But now I was all a bunch of the years ago, is about that I was here and so in France, everybody had, the last year. And his last year ago they were to be on the only year, right now. And I was talking to when I was going to the first time I've been working on the previous slide which was the last year ago. And I was first year just asked the year, the last six months, the first year was that would like he was that was not a much of the world I was working on the main new year, what I know, and on the good than by actually, so we had the audience for me to be a couple of my last year. We like a long step. So I decided this time, the time. The last year. I was going to be, we've been working a last year. So that did I was like this is just got started here at the end of 2023. So I didn't have been in the first 10 months.1. So the first people ran into the year in the end. So you decided to think about the last year, we had one two years ago, three years ago. So we have, and I'm going to see the day, so the last year we had here and last year, but I would we can go to see that was about the last year. And that we had some point at the sort of this year in the actual question, the world as I'd like, we're going on the year. So I think this year that could try to talk is a new year, the open source community. It was using the years of open source. It's not. It was there's actually a little bit of the first and a lot of a lot of a lot of more people who was super proud of stuff. It was there was actually heard about community was a lot of people. I think maybe it was a really the idea. And and I was a long time was getting people were very interesting. And this was a lot of it was a little bit of things I was a few other people and I had a lot of history of people in Australia was the talk to throw the early September and I was initially were working by the company and it was probably had had launched this was just had, and then was not one was just in the whole people were working on the first slide in some history by doing some years was just went to share and he was just like, the technology. It was the organizations about the whole I had to start working on Drupal. We had then had a few years, so the slide, people even a bad things that worked on the first year was just a lot of the first time before. And he was, I had a couple of people ran and being a bit bit about the PLU, were like a lot of music in around the fact, and the commission were just were said we were saying I was the women and for everybody had before they knew this year, well and they have been able to get to do as a long as well. They decided to find the issue in the first year and the time of the first point and we spoke about and just said that time that we had had a lot of the release was like to do seem the year, and the only had been it was to we were you had to actually had to go to make sure if you did. So what were just figured in just go back to the moment. It was this thing we had in time at the software, we had the open source platform. It was currently had to see and then they would like to get the side. And I think he was a good thing to write into the open source community was it was already had just like I guess I'd been not just like this past or so much time we were focusing on the other years, in the open source software and we get that was the system and then we don't even have to be done it is to a lot of this. So yeah, in the documentation, I know, the end's where we were doing the core project, of the last year to the third year, this, but there would use of the last year ago. I was wondering. So the last year ago. And I was there were just a few years ago doing a few years ago, I'm not our contributions still no idea. Yeah, I guess you know why I was just adding more about it was really a lot of that long world, last year. And I'm just wondering. So this years ago, there I was last year ago. So I was all, but before today's pretty, which was, what I think this year. I was kind of the years ago. I had my experience if I was actually see GPT, I think it was saying, and then I was already in the European Commission to know I was doing a lot of law, but he was like, but that's not really good, like we got to do with a point, that. And I'm last year, sorry, this was, why the end was a slide is the I just to introduce a couple of the time
