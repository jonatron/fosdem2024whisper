 I'm going to talk about this online. It's how to give a little bit of it to deliver a website. I'm going to talk about open source and then we're going to start to the first part of this thing in our community, like you can see is that we've got the community. So the first one of those other projects that we've got, so we've got our first one of the open source community that's happening with the EU and we can do. Maybe you might have a great question that, our area I think is that we're going to talk about how you do we're going to use. I think this things should set of open source as a lot of years ago, we're going to be interesting that this was kind of an hour to think we're going to have some of a bit of what it is we're going to be a look like? So we care about it's a community, we'll tell you what is that we've got the people ever took back to get to the right and there's some positive if you're going to have a challenge of going to work together, maybe you're going to figure out, there's going to be in the person who can be a community and the things that are here and engage out there's going to go away. And to continue to go wrong. If you're going to this is in this was interested in the product, you have any time we're going to look an open source to have to be used to give up a look at a bit more of part that we've used for people who have to get to be a PR that we can have five years of these people who we need to get out of people that we've been talking about the people who've seen a lot of thing who have some people who are doing in there and is no people that is the product administration. We're going to do that might want to have to have the company. We need to be willing to be competitive to see in general, but we've got to put the world to our product that we're going to have been using and we're looking at the end of the decision and think about the whole that is that you get the scope of the product from in the best of the directive there are the community engineer and we are many more of the companies who are not going to work in that we're going to do some point that they're in the world. We have to talk what we're going to be thinking about which are like our work on the AI is what they're going to understand is going to be great. This might be really important to work that in the other revenue. So there. You're all of their users to help of the term in these teams in the open source world. Some projects are the open source community are all happening like things without just these people who are people were making people and they're just been seeing in the people, that they can really have the community and they know what they go back to open source projects. Maybe know, they're asking like a talk to be struggling to their talk about some and maybe the culture of these companies to the community developers, they're doing a lot of open source community. When people are the project, yeah, what they have are a little bit more or for sure that have a long you have to look at that they've been looking for people who is an initiative in your community and they're done in open source models. So it's a little bit of skills that I'm going to start at the people that you know, I think it's kind of the university. I'm a couple of a few volunteers. My first, oh, but I've been talking about the last year and I'm here it's why we're just wondering about half a member of the reasons that I'm going to my work on the community and then my co-off of a few years ago and trying to involve the open source community because the Drupal ecosystem is you know, so out of that you're about the time and open source project is called copyright sector and I'm just wondering. I was about time for the first time liability that we'll be going to get open-only, but we've been doing that you know I think I'm a time to do that so I think the year. I said that the last year ago, we've got this talk were just from the company who have been talking about where this really is going to the co-owned law that I did and excited that the first year. It's going to solve that said, we had very much as I'm a little bit of open source project and I said the question was sort of what we had three years ago before. But I'm a year to have been working also a warm at them in 2019, for a year or a huge place and he said the commission and he said, from the law in the past we have been talking about 20 years before, which was a weekend. And I was a lot of all of countries, four years ago we had to say, so much more countries like the ones in the work. So instead of the regulation and as of the commission was working on them there was a few years ago. I think about the CRA was not the work, because they had done by the only person who is relatively recent days. So we took people also mentioned that took the commission has been wondering is happening the EU and the EU so they had a much discussion about a long time so in the world because they had to keep a European Commission in September had a copyright and this year now had this community was actually had a very successful point and they were also the European Commission in it was a law and a software was published for the world was particularly in the Swiss Commission was the EUGI world of the European Commission and was started. It was trained in Europe. So if these States in the EU institutions was a tech and that was the German law, was just the US as it was a research with free law. And in Germany for the European Commission to politicians to discuss was a copyright law of the fact that I had to in Europe and there was first year in France by an rights of time which made a lot of law about commission and an open source legal law can free European Commission for making the European court is not like maybe, who are something more likely to policy and the court of having to be integrated funding at the commission and they know that they received to respond given companies and that they are afraid of the EU Association and the US person. So so much more impact. It's two policy, three years ago. So to make open source energy. It's just used at the issue to be a number and most in every German law that's only that they were really been saying that I said that no directive. But that requires the second law law was the Osource law for example of the court law law. And that I understand as long. I think you know again to solve it's open source law and does that there are under the open the day and you have a law and it was only public law about the industry is so on German law that you are still have initially. So a problem in a decision in the GPL law policy that the history was the value, that they were the last German law, but they'll give us were recognized in market. So we should be there were in this other court law, the European public and they would be not be able to only a clear copyright and yeah that even if they would are the license had to keep your copyright in a right they are in the law had heard the cost. The law law in the copyright law court law we will then there was not the fact that regulation and they are a law and another copyright, could still the copyright German license law that they can would mean it may never be. So the the only thing is working to be aware of the law for that it's just uses copyright copyright in the licensee has been said there, so I think about a European copyright regulation that you know that have this copyright or a money that open source licenses and not as a law, the license into a legal court. So I think that's the opposite, the European law, and they're not only under GPL and they'm going forward. And if they come I didn't know, and then there was made the license but I think I think this law of I know that was the most way that I was an law, of the freedom of the copyright industry is what they made in the field should know, is it's important law in a bit in a, but I think in the law and is that this law would be the term at the commission. So I think that was going to the moment the law we're at the energy, the copyright law was coming into there was just some GPL law. They are so there were no longer as the law, I thought in the law, we're going to think it's going to be the only one of the impact by the law license assessment and in the copyright license came into the idea is that we're going to dojo to cost to deliverability and they're going to follow over we want to be looking is again. That was looking at the world. So there and we are wondering from this is the first open source law to find a license to spend data. And the end. So the commission to it's what we've had to go that we had to get to say that the government that in the future and we had to be the world in the politicians will keep the legislation. I've got a value of course our law, to have it became a value of the overall funding in the panel holder in an American law we've got the value of law and the product of the copyright law that we've been in European Commission that doesn't have been taking care of time to the copyright that we've had a copyright law that they just would be speaking of like a directive and the copyright's just so we have to give us a copyright would be able to work there a parliament, if we can't have to have the law that we don't really want to do that a policy driven business policy in between government copyright industry to have their parliament and also that we can't seem to be able to always the commission, at that somebody who didn't know that to have been to contribute into this person to making the copyright keys into the law and the licensee infringement that they're going to the whole policy was asked the law and the country. So that was not going to just that we found into law's what was going on the question, that, I actually the law and so that was the fact that was a German law who had a copyright holder going to end of the law that the copyright law to have a law in and someone who were also wouldn't have as a GPL law is not as well, like a second I had a very hard to do the copyright and only way enough the copyright would like the copyright policies could happen to it's right that the market to be but they had a copyright value that I ran into a value to trust that's the law license for any reason. And when you've got the law of the license thought this law. It's an court one open rights mean it to license regulation, I said and the European German copyright sector requires the copyright law, and companies that you know but also not an activist act in a third license, and they're a license and open and they're they have a that you know there're even may be, they understand law was the law GPL law termination person to to another as the sector as European law which they had a law so they couldn't care actually don't just want to solve the law that was actually has almost the copyright would be available in copyright law, but they had that it was much as long good way to think they will not as well. So the question is not the copyright issue is what they know, in law doesn't have is on the law in copyright enforcement to law. All you think that value and it could be very obvious, I think that if you know that their law has decided by law point of a time, is not something that they can have also have to be so that the fact that in that you know they have 20 and they've had a copyright keykeepers to you know about GPL wouldn't think we have heard about copyright act as a copyright which doesn't have been asked for this value of GPL that and because the copyright sector of the copyright actually requires the copyright law was great copyright in the moment because in legislation, the directive in this was clearly a law has been in the GPL person that the copyright could be the law into the law that that the commission was we're the law. And people who got a copyright regulation is initially these copyright industry is that the law and it has no economic law. I think that we've got nothing to license as long it I didn't know in terms of the right, but at this work because they're just think that for the copyright policy did. They said this decision would be to be a copyright to be well still there's a rights law and the copyright one industry could be thought we can the license. That also just because they should be an individual court directive in the law do two license rights under license's only a law of that licensee has that copyright says that we would be very important that and the copyright and a copyright law and in the commission has a the copyright then. What makes copyright of the copyright of GPL policy and i remember I need to have made it a liability and the law law about license is the law has absolutely so the license license that was a mandatory copyright infringement value this could be at and basically had that I is the public law. It's the copyright and when there they need to to the license should be. But there's they were absolutely, but they said had to copyright in German law. And this was, you would be paidly so I could put the copyright and is a law but they would mean that's not only what were that they did that is really happening in the private person that you think of a time because they just have open license that could be a copyright and if they still on the court then they didn't do for the copyright, they could be used, come through that they'd be able to understand but they want to be any copyright effect and they were not often a law that the it was a license and said that we've had to put the last one and interoperable nature of the directive and you just a value and what they were doing and they have changed and they've already have no copyright and they're re-violence of they don't ever, but they've been found in Europe to
