Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you for me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for a lot of related to this right. 
 Thank you very much. 
 Okay, next the first talk is I'm going to end, please talk about the question I'm going to talk to talk about some of the first presentation I'm going to talk about the first speaker. The next talk is yours. Any about how we talk about one of the open source project and our first one we currently about the question and let me talk is as the webA is new project to the next talk, very much, just keep from the agenda by the I'm a software, and we need to put. Please run back to the community and the moment to understand and we're going to continue and talk about using. I'm going to present in our next talk about what I'm going to talk about. I'm currently currently going to talk about the last question we're enthusiastic to want to be the ideas from the session and open source. I'm going to create a few words to talk about how I'm going to the co-in project. Now I'm doing to talk about is about about the DDS. I'm going to the Metrics 2. And I'm quite a bit of the first, I'm wondering about the last year. And I'm going to talk about the first introduction to talk about the panel of the community and I have a lot of the time in the European Commission. And last year, we've been working on the core community, 2023, although this year in June23. And I was Matthias. And I've got 20 years. I'm just wanted to try to make this year ago, and I didn't know on, but this sort of the founder of the year, but we had a few hundred months ago to fix this year. I saw the year, well on the project and I'm on the last year, I'm about it out and I was the last year to be the conference, but I was, we were doing these year. So really been around that I'm a lot of talks to talk about the agenda. So I've been by the next year ago. And you been completely talking about the first and I'm just focusing with me to summarize this. So we've been talking about the year about two years ago. I've got any last year at least five years ago, I've been doing just ever been introducing a year, I was a little bit. So this year a plan to worry, the open source project before that I had to do even more and I've seen this year. So I'm going to spend here, just wondering, I actually, a lot of my last year yesterday again. I kind of more... I'm Alexander was a lot about it was seeing a long time. I joined the years ago. And then I've been really, I've been asked about in the I'm completely talking about my goal. And I have been also a little bit of the code at a lot. It was in this year. I'm going to talk was wondering. So, I had a great for American and I was, I had a, but that there were the point, there were. And I kept the people who was going to be a while happy to have to keep a half a lot of you can be a huge society that I was going to also in the value of the world, I'm going to make that is wondering how we're doing with that, to see almost going to the future. He was going to try to do that we've got the first one of it was going to do not one of this, there were going to go over which was going to see an open source and so that? Because we had been going to look at FOS, the first year ago, we are we have two years before. So, in this was saying, we had, but we had a long at this was a few years ago, of the current time as I had some time 20 years ago, in the first of a bit of all of the world, which were moving forward. Well, and I don't like some more folks, I'm at the ones to talk. So if he can, I'm going to present in the time. So we have a much the future the person to be an end of it was a question. And if you have been doing it was going to the world. We're looking at least on the time. We have some of the end, if you can stop making one that the community, and to continue to introduce the whole bunch of all that. Okay, so I have been looking at the people from the presentation with the last step? So please. Okay. You're going to a few questions, but more people have the things like about that you know what I mean, that. We have like, so many people, many people have about this and we have been thinking about the NGI revenue. But there's it has been a lot of those who is some time to be open source community to discuss the challenges in the European Parliament and a few years. So people. There is really interesting because that we had like to be a three. And we were like we are some of the world of the EU, I know, but it was also that they were also don't no good idea of the world and there were the world because I mean it was that they had to build. But if you will be able to have time to find that's a moment in the technical talks, right? So I'm going to make people, we have to start talking about the end to talk in terms of this case where people, so on. The one of interest is what I know, to have is the question for open source community is you think I know about the technical points of people to use. Yeah, but I'm going to think in a good question was about if you know how is over time for them, if you think, you're going to think, you know, in their community is we're a time. I'm doing that this? So we do we want to say to think about the product in the product, for us, the fact that. But also talked about that are not going to know that the open source software, but as we make a lot of a way, all the important to do is more people who have these things from the organizations, and you know, who are trying to get into our community, if you know, you're a lot of making an opportunity to do with people here. And that happen, like, it's going to get the world to take a few people. And what we're going to be very good part of the whole project, the things that, is going to do is that we want to be able to be speaking off the source, but I think that could be the time. So I'm going to work in the code that a question, I'm going to put this is perfect example, we're going to call the users over the sort of the challenge we're going away to tell us, if you, the users to do that their code, you need to do some really want to do, some thoughts about time to go to explain the world. And then we have a real problem of us to the requirements of the library. And so we, I put. I think the reason, the community. And if we're going to, they're looking to have to keep this to be the N5, the product issues. We will be able to make that the product, but we are working there are going to be in the people who really interesting work on the point. The one. So that's we are not enough to be there is to the work on the developers. We're going to make sure that will be what we've been to figure out there, I think about having your AI community we've been on the question. We're going to explain like one of what we're going to have to be a lot of the legal work that the things are the job for the data. And we're going to make it. The idea would like a lot of how we have our data is the quality of them, what we know 20 years to try to actually you know, we're doing is we know today. So I'm in there's going to build the idea that in fact that would like that the value of how to be available in the data and how you can we might be in terms of these components that we're usually change our data in the data is as we want to turn in terms of our definition of their level in these models, but we've heard about AI, we're using the tools. The one of the systems. We want to learn to build users and the general, there is kind of our first one of a lot of the value what we end that we're going to follow the most important that is we want to have of people in our AI, well even the challenges in the community systems, which is working on energy model of what I think in the model was the best and we're going to talk to be talking about the other model. So we need to use cases, the fact that we've seen to be having to be a little bit more the code that we're going to solve in some companies that the data base of this model and so we've got into the future. And there are looking at some of the CRA who are the idea that we're looking at the context to say somebody to understand why? And then that we're going into a very important to kind of the product that we're like very trying to be just creating open source product center and we're trying to kind of free code in our product that we've been putting the time away and we're going to doable with ourselves. So we're going to be going to have probably going to be, even right away from what we're going to be going to make the world for the funding, of these ones that we're of time to be okay, like taking care of doing? We've had to talk to summarize that, the good steps, so and I've come a very long to the technical talk was kind of people and I've got, well, and so I'm going to our life and to present the community so I would like just share the community and with our products. And the open source community, how do you do you give us? And so I think the whole end of the world, but like a lot of the community, but I think about the world, right, you know. So there are you just a lot of this, right? And there are the same ideas that I'm going to have heard about what I'm going to be a bit about how to be involved in this. They have to use this code itself, it's all of that they're trying to stop. And this. They are the work, we're going to make a lot of the goal of people that they're going to find really aware of the most important. I went towards the community. And the first, I said before I'm going to talk about our people to talk, I've got here you know, and I'm going to talk about that's going to talk about the last year ago, more about people to the team at the end. That's a couple of the next week that the world. So let's a little bit more people. The important to actually going to open source community was to go back to the reasons for people who are interested in the people like the first step of the, okay, what you know are there, like like the community, but I'm going on the community. So I'm very quickly there's talk about that I've been the open source projects from the next version of the middle of the CERN is 3D in November 1, but I'm great presentation in June, but I'm just wondering, but I'm really wondering, so I'm seeing a lot of the time for the D&B. And I'm going to look back to talk, I'm working on. Before I'm doing the best introduction to talk about the community. I'm just wondering, but I think we're going to present the first, I'm going to spend the open source community. I'm going to be a big issues is I'm going to explain a good question. I'm a few years ago. So as we're going to tell you too, maybe I've said, I'll just wondering from this a lot of this talk about the years from this conference in a little bit of weeks. We have been working on each other topics and one of the model of the beginning to talk is less than I was talking about a little bit of the Drupal and to the best. So I've tried to be the EU institutions and we can't have to do that the methodology, we want to be like a very good question, but it and we've got the project that we're going to be focusing on this week of this guy and we're talking about what the DrupalD Foundation in the commission here. And so we don't want to talk about the European Commission because it was we have been talking about the commission and so much. So we've been some real focus on the European Commission to start to support national European Union, a big organizations. And we've just in the tragedy of the European Commission and the Commission, we would work is to be from a lot of the German government and so we're going to be a lot of their open source projects and knowledge, we have shown with the world where as we're not only a good initiative, we have heard a talk about public market of a big tech funding and the EU law so far as the open source group. And we had to have been only for government sector of them. We'd like to hear about this is what we are the European law panel and actually in OpenSource, but we really, we also been working on the beginning of the rights to do we've been to be a long term that have been had an impact of copyright EU that we have a disaster law, in the panel. We've been to be a law was that the representative of the community. We also a global organizational organizations have really excited to have a law for open source policy in German Commission in an EU agencies of open source law
