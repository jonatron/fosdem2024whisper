 Hello. Hello, Aless
 So, sorry, hello. And I'm Daniel Mark Antper and I'm a little bit about a way. We'll talk about that. And I'm just one of those who knows how you want to do with a lot of reasons for many years. We have to talk about getting an open source project. So next year. It's very easy to use more of organizations and like doing to be familiar in the new Open Science and communities and a lot of people making work. And using AI at the US, which is very easy to do. So, I'm writing AI,, I'm at this. Amcibility. The first one is the project is also a very important thing called A couple of questions, mainly in the Open Desk. There was a different community for a little bit more, which works, but there's the challenges. But I'm not sure that I'm now. And I'll find a little bit about them talk to one of like earlier about how the first one of the EU, all in the European Commission in the community was kind of innovation. And I'm a high level of research than I'm going to have a good idea that I'm seeing all know that one to be talking to a little bit of those people of the goal is, there. I'm passionate about open source projects with the University of the world that is I'm just wondering. I'm going to explain to talk about Open Science from the CISA world. And of the foundation that the Foundation. And I think that's pretty proud of community science. I'm curious of open source project, we have a lot of software research and European Commission in Europe research and there's going to AI. And I'm going to speak about the European Commission, we're focusing on the open source community, also a big and so many years ago in practice in June this part of the University of the countries, they have been aware of the world, which is the product and there's data world of Surrey and I'm just. And I'm going to say like open source component in the open source community. And we are the community and to become a lot of the audience because I'm going to talk about the children too often in the middle of funding, I would be talking about to us to talk about the second speaker is something I'm going to have to have to give the panelD but I'm going to talk about the stories of my little bit of challenges and I think about the only project of the Internationalos Initiative and how do and we have the open source project perspective. I'm going to speak about the open source product, and the product is for the world-the-in Europe and I'm going to be showing that he's going to talk and more of the third for me here and I'm a first part of it over for OpenBSD at you very community. And the first thing that I'm wondering, so it's one of you can be a company. It's like a problem. And I'm hoping that for a second-bombs is the first evening on the challenges of the fact that we're working on the German foundation. And there is the amateur community, the first day projects in the project and I'm not in fact. And they are very big product, okay, but I'm not taking this is the product of what is only started to be like an open source software engineer. And the only one of the technology is a software, I'm very important thing, I know, the world I'm important question, I'm speaking of the most of the people here. I think about the first time and as we have three years ago in EU world. And that the fact that was, what you know that there was kind of the government and the most important thing I hope that the German software was the law. So I think about the law, I think about the last decade ago, and a moment is a second law. I think, I don't know that they're only, but there. Well, I was one thing, the only talk I'm going to I think why I think if you know about the CRA and the question was wondering about the law and I think we could be in open source law. But you have had to be there. I wanted to look at least the one. And sometimes in the fact that was to be in the organizations, in the market out of this point of the act on the reason. I know that that was not an open source law, it was the US law that was a directive and if we had been working on the cost to solve out because it was another product of the EU and I think of the open source law and the law, you're they have made these public key. And so I'm sure that they're the open public law was only law was just worried about a problem because you know that the market in the only the last year, I think it was that the copyright in the commission and the world. He had about law was doing a decision that back end, and what was a copyright in the general court was in law, but two laws is supposed to think that was in the license that I was a very known the copyright law in the license. They were a copyright law in it was a sense of national risk-called law until we had time but to work on law. And I'm maybe there so I don't think the first three I think, actually need to know the commission to say that was using legislation, but they start if I saw that this copyright law. So the directive that it's good regulation has been a law, they were only law to be open source and they were quite a law. And that they said the past the law value and even. I can't think he had a day in his copyright holder always saw before think it was just to know what they worked on their copyright court and like was in the law that the GPL and they were a long as well know exactly only one of the license law. And I became very first sentence was bad law. I'm not going to make not a copyright law law rights of the reason until he's the law in the copyright law, that don't matter. And that about the methodology happened in a law, she was just had a law, which is the future of one value in addition to get something that were very clever idea of law. And it was the law. I don't really know the problem for law, the law. And I think that I initially to you know about law on the value that they would like many law would be a copyright licenses with license software of a definition of US directive has been given to be able to just two law that legislation. And if they were the parliament don't know about it in the fact, like you know that means that at the copyright law was got to tell people made off in the copyright law law and that it was not enough in terms of law of it was actually the law in the law technology where the license rights from law would be aware of copyright policy. He made what directive and she was being a certification and the copyright law could actually was just the law, a law to be a copyright software. It was an holder was something that I had going to be and that he said, but it was the fact that was the copyright and I was in legislation to be open the law. And in the German law, I ended up the money and the court was it has to the US law in the code in a copyright was the principle of the law. The PLB act has to energy rights to know it is that was only law in the CRA is just it was the moment. And I said that the fact that I was the fact that law was just thought it was that the copyright, a half before before basically copyright law. No but the value of this would be that would be a law. It was a directive, but people don't just be something that the court is more of a directive and they had to get the commission. I was only see of the law and they were the holder were just mentioned that is the legislation in fact that were said that not in legislation may not GPL law. You know all the power is and i've been able to the open tech, but of that it should solve this CRA. The law is important point were the law did open law and I said who did a law in being done in the law to be almost no energy law that she has made. So then they had to understand the law policy policy law and just found a copyright rights and we were obliged to act as a copyright decision's a problem. But we had a value that was the fact is in law doesn't always be the GPL, for the a world first law. I have, they said what they're looking at least 20 years since they have a European Commission and I was considered a legislation of law. And that wasn't have an GPL law to be a law for their act in companies that law did going for the law. And the bad directive in the law of this work being, there was, the copyright does only that. And then in Drupal funding that mean the copyright law clause would apply that you know exactly a law. And I need that people, the license court doesn't really have to take a only matter of legislation that maybe or a decision to be the public license we spent to matter to get a political law she said clearly of law. And so I'm afraid of these German law that there's exactly that the PLD itself would be a member law. And I think how the product was a huge value of legislation of being, you might be able to have to make consequences that an copyright and nobody that's going into the copyright value of law. So I think they're the she had a GPL two decision because they asked from the CRA, and I said, right it. But on the funding that role of course they actually need to do so many people from the rights to help anybody who actually doing the impact of open source supply chain that they want to do and their public law and this legislation and there's not be a value that the fact that they're going forward and so far as clear what they would do of what one of thinking and they have they're just take care about the law and they're not just asking for just about legislation. And if you do I'm going to happen here as well, but to be surprised because of course as long term, we have a way to work, so much to do we want the other things that we do is going to be a very short problem. And if you know that's going to make sure that much as energy field of energy and you're going to be involved as high-Fi and have to have to understand because you're an important to have to be the question to think it's the energy and we are just talked about a story about our legislation to go to the question. And that we need to a lot of the moment. So the second one of that I'm going to keep the decision and I'm going to be wondering about. I'm shown before, we're trying to continue with these are starting down at some of these hand over time. So what is an end. So one, we're going to do I think about the first one thing about the second in 2021, the ones. And who have been thinking about the world they have a bit of the impact only part of how much energy estimation that you're going to me on energy in the law or energy. And so much everybody are going to be like I'm going to come, but I'm looking at all the end up I'm going to come out, I'm going to go to be a last year. So before we're going to talk about the power and say, you might come in the first 10, your energy we will. We have the time. I'm curious about the first question was sort of the commission and also the energy rights in the energy in France. We have also have the commission and an energy the EU administration. There are just some first time for the European Commission. And finally a very close to reuse more power and in this is always an rights and in the knowledge in the market, which is important thing to develop the European Commission and it would be not cost of the decision and to decision that the moment, but still there are there's a different funding on rights. How we have hired by that they will be a European Commission in the copyright economy had to do you know only have been brought an government in the CRA and they are seeing the world. It's also a copyright capacity and they're just aware of open standards are trying to ensure that the current government from years ago and I think and the EU EU administration and we're not part of about the model in a copyright revenue, but that we have had to make the world, okay, there was in German Drupal. It was also a few years ago. The last year, the current market only important. We need to formulate energy and this for us, the last 12 years ago that we've seen the second is true way to be from the impact for the world. We need to do in the only thing that if you need to start to speak about about the commission of the only in the first thing about the way between Kodly, is set of going to the power, of legislation from we have any energy science and the world. So the software is not only part of the main issue that I'm just said, they're also know it's the world and the majority of people that we have been quite useful for example, but software and for us, everything a lot of those are changing and all the technology. And really the German institutions are now they are that were also in the EU technology when they need to make sure that they have been coming from the first time and we're done a way. And you know that the CRA in this is open source world. And the best would be a big to be a good to do. And about organizations, there are very interesting point where you think that you're just for example, but there's about the second option in the scope of the commission makers's a foundation and if you know that we're not doing the world. So there's a lot of companies is a few years ago, the world of the question was only that we got into the energy policy part of the fact that the world part of the legislation and the digital sector of the impact of the EU organizations were also the first law and we had to get the energy science project, and standards to the policies from the world of the law and often. And we have been sure that was to have
