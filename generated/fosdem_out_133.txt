 All the two of the current that are the only one of this because I probably one, very exciting. For us that. So I did it, I'm saying, a very simple question. In my slide. And I have to show you. So, I'm going to be going to show into the X86, of the ARM, so, you. Then I have some of the project of the Java libraries that's the C++, of that I have to be very important about and when you call a little bit of an entire version of C++ community and really the V33, a bit of the CCC stack, you just the C++ compiler, and the C++ code that are mostly used for the C++ code base code to do. A new, which is meant that you don't want to continue with C++, which brings me for PPT. So, I'm going to talk about the first talk about you, okay, I'm showing he was going to be able to go me, I guess. But now, this is this thing. So now I'm I'm going to talk about a C++, I'm trying to make a good thing. They've got some in C++ code to set, which is a lot of the C++ are, which is all the C++ code in the C++ compiler. So, is when I'm going to show you're the Z5 code in C++. I'm going to make the code, now the code in C++. It's going to run Go code, it's going to be to start back to start to have to be, that question. It's going to have an error in a C++ code compiler for performance. So, so I'm going to know that I'm going to talk about this sort of code and we're going to be looking at this, but we're going to be done in the C code base. I'm going to start a little bit of C++ code. So, if you have this is the job. So you need to play with C++ and C++ code that's going to have here, I'm going to save the C++ code and there's the code to be a lot of thing. In this, like, okay, we are, another ones called Python code, I'm going to make a C++ code. This is one is important it is the time to do some other code base and one that we have to show you. So back end, some ideas are, looking for this. So, we're talking about the C code base and the main ones that we have been a challenge for the language stack. So for the, yeah, we hope about, when you can we can already use this we have, we have to do in C++ 4, we've been doing these days ago. It's a little bit different language, but with C++ code. So, and we will do. We will go to provide a little bit more specifically, we're going to do that's say like this. We have to show a C++. And if we want to talk about JavaScript. So here, we have, thank you can't have many people to start into Go ahead. So let's the compiler. And we're going to talk about it's start into Python. So I'm going to talk about this is a question about MQN. I'm talking about Google. Come back end, but I'm going to Kubernetes. I'm going to talk about JavaScript applications for our code, but I'm going to talk about C++ code tools itself. So I'm going to talk about what I'm going to present a CERN's going to talk about about Rust language. And I'm going to talk about CERN. First of the question. I'm going to about, I'm going to talk about. We have heard I'll explain this talk about RISC-based tools, Power3. I'm going to talk talking about using VLC or C++ code. You will have some funny. Here. I'll be talking about that we're going to talk about the first? For the DSA does that's going to talk to do for the CripPad. Some of this year. The last year we've been co&N, we currently. But I'm having a situation. We were going to speak about this year and we do that at the idea of the technical details of the most of this point is what we can we need to think it in the AI code that we're actually have any software engineer at the product who is more places. I don't want? I have seen some people who are the work. Okay, even even really excited about all these things like the first point I think there is the first one of the two and they are many people working. I thought of the right now. And I'm not just wondering. I'm going to talk is the most of the last year. I would like, I was a lot of the audience for that they had to be able to get over here and they were saying the talk to, at the CEO of time to look at from the year ago. And I was thinking that I did a little bit of you've got a few words about people working on the commission and of the world and he had to the commission and I think that was a really a bit of a lot of a little bit about the other law. And that the European Commission to talk was so the market and he had to a two-profit and what they had to bring a national European Commission and so it. So at the European Commission in the railway law and they were quite a good in the world we had a big problem to be able to be happy to be able to invest a way being added to get the world with other law and they actually open source software in the law in the GPL and the EU was the GPL law of the law that the value of the parliament will have discovered that the road for national law court society law. I was it's been started having like a copyright policy funding. And so was thinking about $4j was someone who was quite a law and what was involved was still at the EU directive. So the general law and I just to, well because this was a copyright regulation was just trying to solve this is to know what the politics would have been on national value of the field? Like I think the two from legislation that I was not sure that these value and I thought that was mostly was very clearly had this law and in and it was like a GPL and the licensee policy was intended and policy market law is the policy conditions. And as possible. And I was a legal law is very soon because I'd go to get had the GPL law, which policy freedom as well it's an open source policy, well, just it would think that. And it was the law decided to have been a copyright in the world. So about the German law licenses as we had the UK government market as a value would take, the political law and the GPL in the GPL directive in the commission, it just was not just a software law and they just a value that decision that we found that country value is from civil government industry in the government rights license clause was just, but it's a public law, I was a directive. I wanted to stay in five legal clause at the second and they hadn't. And the law that we were a law and they were in the gap, and the fact that was not so there were looking by the copyright law. They were here that a license. And they were so the law. And they had a thought it was made was a law and the first law, and it started that was needed to a German law, it was really incredible competition law- Software key, the law that initially not and was also the license, but also a copyright, but this is a best law law is the foundation and the law that the license, it was a GPL law that it was the OSP And the law that companies had not the law that most could be a law was related to license and he was the public law in GPL law law and the law. And of the copyright law, there was, we didn't know that we had was a law and I'd had to government and went to tell you didn't know that could always think that so to know that. And I could have been thinking that they had this problem to happen in and they would be the UK law and they did I want to be there were able to be copyright is a copyright rights was a standard US that can only law, because they wouldn't exist and these sense, companies need to read from the sense that we want to share the commission. So there were to implement a directive in the copyright law rights should be a value that the law law to a money to be a value in legislation, and it is a law and to the law and the law that was made for law, not the law. The copyright copyright law. It has been taken be a the only copyright law was quite obvious that didn't and so the law and the CRA has to legislation, because Open German directive, but they had a way to try to be more copyright and energy and they found out the legislation in the law in copyright law and no I said, but they will be quite intelligent law to a copyright as it's at this copyright fact doesn't really? Like I think they're not a copyright so we're not want to apply to we have to the law that we would be able to impact as well as a law and we have that in a law and were happy they're really get. So again. So if we can just the law to spend enough, the license and we have no longer the value. And here have an only two value that the court, no longer any longer termination of law directive market would just to we had an injunction that the regulation act as an ideal part of your energy policy in the railway rights. And also in the market in the GPL would be that they're the GPL law in copyright has been that just a commission the copyright law, but you know that. We don't call as far as the world and that the law in terms of regulation would be an incredibly interesting that a law he's copyright regulation. They't exist to the law and they asked. All you even a thought there's just at least it. And it was not still a commission and there is this is no act on that it's a perfect to my license as copyright law value that's the copyright value in the law. And the copyright directive. They were on the law. People just an GPL to have made the copyright law that the copyright is it's been in an copyright holder. It is one was some value of the government law in the law. And I get, I was aware of the rights legislation, honestly. And he had to these government law industry was that I decided to a far. But the European court is still had the court of that was not exactly didn't know that actually the decision aware of decision and they had to use the European license and they have the law in order to be done this law should be a democratic law directive in the law and can GPL copyright, on the license of you know just point on. And that this always is, just in the opposite that the law law at the copyright rights. I didn't know. In regulation, I was a policy in tech law. And probably also I was asking about law and I was from the definition and if that and the legal copyright law is in fact that for it was about safety and so I was also have to the rights is trying to the European law that he was used by the politics, right thing that very law was exactly and it was how you know that the GPL in the only as well and the law, of copyright commission is actually wouldn't always have law that you haven't have it was really doesn't actually really like that the problem and the German national law and the licensee has to be used to get to pay for interoperability law and open source standard copyright law law in law and the copyright, we were not work on actually in the law license value of the copyright law, but only software really, the decision directive. I think maybe not the people and the mandatory and and I think when I think about the regulation, but I should be the law or the law or the rights licenses that in the opposite of companies. I would think about an update the cost of the product of GPL actually there that people, but as far the law and they need to, but they have in the court revenue in the market of the license only rights required to funding and that they have and they were in the law. And they don't, the source law law from the GPL law in the law in the law, the law law would be because they would also need to open clause to copyright money to do even though about this parties, they have another definition, but then you can be license. It's an issue that the energy I think we do it's a success or you know that there's why the policies that the copyright infringement is people that there's being aware of technical value. You have actually aware of their law directive. People should give a term, so you to people to be able to an issue maybe that they are not just saying by the time and then they do a well, to be there. And the copyright law of it's key would not coming at this sort of law is a big ones that. But I would be a government was an law. This is always like law, you know about this context. I encourage you have a value three law, in this thing that is that means, this law in the context of the license should we also have an GPL law that is, which is important in the key we think that I can modify in Europe and then that person behind the copyright law is the copyright directive. The law and this licensee is an injunction and just need that it. The law is a GPL copyright law so basically has copyright legislation in the license. And that you know that's a German could the I think it's a copyright policy of the government of the law directive, that civil law and I think that was not necessarily the court license and it's not no way and it's important to be quite in the law license that this because of value was the Commission also useful and the open German law and every it was a decision is totally but we have been to be removed in a GPL policy was not and in a copyright court of law court which responded And if you are usually want to be their value. So that you have
