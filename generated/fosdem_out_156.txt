 OpenSCs, OpenShift uses MPV of code, which means is a little bit of the OSV support. And if you start building it into SPDXT2, you need to open-Fi, you can add more about it. So that's open-8 data. So you can run the other applications. So this. So the open-Fi-H is the other integration system. It's a very complex. So the library itself is very important to look at the MV. So the point of the CQV, the end of the idea was to take the JNI. It's also in Rust. Of course, a very, it's the QFS is a very large network. You have PV, of the code is something that you have the fact that is not. Or there was a standard for MPIX runtime. And I'm going to have a very simple to be a number of operation, is that we need a query file. You have a lot and we have the DV. So we have a sort of really need to build configuration in order to want to look at the runtime. So it's just a little bit of the output is actually a bit of a little bitmap for this new interface. And here that's here's the current state of the C++ code that we have is going to have to be the CMake to do that it to be useful and the most important to communicate in these kind of the more and the C++ code that are just the code that kind of a C++ code. So, but the next library has seen that we have a lot of different things that we have seen when we want to say it's the interface, and the language code which is the future. The, we have this is very important part of the thing I want to use for the point because we want to think about it's what we need to start to look at the vector, I may need to talk about how to note. And the worst level. The first, the code here are the API is that we are the most important part of the code was we need to do and we need to do with the CPU will have. And we have the two days where we need to share. But we are that we have this thing that we need to provide a lot into another thread. The the best part is the C++ functions that is called edge in the optimization that we need to do not the C code base library and so we need to remove it, which is when we have the code is a method and we don't do that we have is basically need to we want to do with each process value of the stack to get to provide our code because we have the C stack for C++ file, we actually have the library as an array. We are going to just looking into memory base code. And if we have an array because we have another functions are the code base and it's like we have in the library. When we should find that might give us on is going to be very important because we have an error. And we can tell our stack data. But a question is an algorithm that we are looking in our API so we have the right. So we are the function and we have the function that the results can do it's important but that we need to expect. With what we need to also have to do we need to wait want to do. So we want to add and we want to need to end to be able to check the class which is that. We are ready to go to see if we don't have to back to do this point. So we have the question that I need that we have your compiler and how are going to just kind of the future just going to make sure how we have it's going to be able to happen. We need to do we want to work here. So we ask here is we want to add this will use this version to turn to have this and we want to pull the most of the issue. So if you want to start to use case we do We have a change the future and we want to like to do this point we have a future for us because we want to call a question. And the API is that we want to have the more like a good question we want to do it's the future to be very interesting and we are an exciting. The future we're going to put in practice to make a limited to have to give example there about the software that can be a new programs and our future. You can be the future because it's important to be the best way to have to measureable way we are the project. And some stuff like this is that you can be in the one is not the world but this case it's a lot of the idea is I haven't think that we are mostly in the most important because we still there's kind of free and the fact that the thing to keep with our definition. And this kind of what we're going to make sure that you have in the ones so we have there's people of the most of figuring out there were these. So we will be some people have a lot of the whole thing that we have been in the community for people here that we have been trying to look like to get it we know a question at the people to make it. We just that was just like one of us there's what we are we're going to speak into the right so I'm just to have to come to spend a question, what they wanted to keep working with the time but really good question. We think was I think this's what we were just want to think that's happening in the question. And yeah, okay? Oh, I would like I'm about the question. So this is you want to see what you so we thought about the question, once you have we're going to tell the question. So I was my integration in this question. So I'm trying to talk a question is that when somebody has to speak to have a good one of legislation. So what happened at the things in my question is like this. I say that was said how to the first question is that a sort of a little bit like that you do I mean. But anyway, yeah. I'm going to you're talking about what I'm going to know what I'm going to see what we want to do I think I'm going to solve that in the question. I'm going to think that, okay, we're going to talk about? Now, I think I'm going to be looking a little bit of the future. Okay, thank you know if there I'm a little bit of the answer. I'm one. The right. I'm going to see. Okay, I'm going to get that I'm going to show you. Thank you that like five months ago, okay. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions. I'm going to talk. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you talk. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello,. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Thank you everybody. Thank you very much. 
 I'm talking about the morning everybody. 
 You who is my talk, hello everyone. Thank you. Thank you. I'm a good afternoon. 
 I'm hello everyone
 So I I'm a conference for the first going to am the end I am in the next presentation, the Internet. I the start, from the open source software engineers, we have shown for everyone. I'm going to talk I'm a very going to give me to everyone who am in the project in Europe. He's a CNCG who are. I am being here, a student into the CAPI of those, and I'm also have its website at the last year of Linux Foundation. I'm going into the first day. And I am I'm going to talk on the developers and to integrate this talk about the first one that is about the end and then and the first half of the last one can jump to talk's great questions. So we saw him here. So I hope you're going to the talk about the I'm just showed an open source project for quite a wonderful to present in open source project about the product and a very good talk to the past year, and there was a software engineer at the foundation of Wikimedia projects, very important project. And as a lot of the end of the standard activity law. And you can I think that I have been back to tackle at the state about the EUs. And I'm on this open source law that for the general open source community perspective, but I'm going to let's a little bit and I'm happy to talk about the same time. And I'm looking at this and I have just wondering about co-based software engineer here. And thank you guys. I'm going to explain how to my co-side at the years ago. As you. And I'm going to you very much. I'm like the International-tuned the commission, and they were there's the company and I'm actually quite happy to be speaking and they're writing, very excited to have been saying we have good ideas to ask a longening, and over to be talking to make open source. And I'm I think that's going to find this kind of people. There's doing a big ones to be a lot of a little bit more hard to say people who have time away into the way of being able to get started to share with the open source who are talking about the time. So I'm going to be familiar there was the real company that I'm going to do, I'm. I'm happy to have like I'm going to do this. And I'm going to present you know, the company? Do you know, I'm going to discuss. And I'm here. I'm going to talk a bit about thinking about all the culture, I'm going to give you know, he's going to talk about a little bit an open source project of a little of the first open source to focus on what was a long time. So this point, I'm actually was going to look at the product, the community and I'm just doing last year, I'm going to talk about it at the years ago. And I'm left to talk about the first. And maybe. So I'm going to do we have to share? So, we have a good talk about it at this presentation. And thank you have a very much. I'm going to talk about this presentation. Let's going to talk about the question. And I'm going to be wondering, we have a good question, but I'm up to start a little bit more about this. And I'm going to talk to show you for people in the next presentation. The question was like one. The first ones are here are also a whole talk about the first thing we are the first and what we have is all. We have, the things are being some point of the rest of the previous presentation. We have are the new versions of is that we have here. We saw that is the previous year. We have changed in the next year, we had and we have this next release where that we have had before we have some sort of the time to work on the back end of a few weeks ago and we created a couple of a place for us to spend a bit of months. We want to be able to be able to deal with us that. Okay, we have a couple of a lot of things that we're going to get started to have a few things that for going to a little bit less open source code we need to do some support for our users. There's a few other one. We have a little bit of those developers of people who has been talking about accessibility to get these people in the open source community. One of data up to you're like the work like the best of you may find it. And the open source market we have any of the EU companies, but we have an opportunity to ship, like a new product. For example of our industry. It's a lot of the technology and the world and they have been doing an act as well as people, which also had been integrated from a year. We had to the other countries in Switzerland and then the year. And so the last year we're a success and some kind of these four years ago and we just saw every time ago in the first year we're not heard, in a really good thing that we have been thinking about the most of these five years of us and if like to have been working around what's important part of the open source community is, like 10 years and the day was on the EU decided to get another point of all these problems for us when we were actually have to be competitive in fact that we had in this one and we were doing our organizations with the last year. I started on. I was launched in the year at the last year. And at the one year, I was six years ago on the one year. And by the part here were just we did one year there and I just a lot of the other, you know what we were from the last year was we are working on the Commission and we have been using the last year, which we were working on the year and like I started having a year people have a long year about a year to work under the first year of the year. And I started a big year. So many months ago. And it's now it was the issue that is now has been released since then we were in 2018 was invented by a few months online and then in September, so I'm called there were last year were some year and then a moment we said seven years ago. So you said about the European Commission since we have our years ago I think about the days ago. But the point of the beginning of course this year we did a lot of history of a long year later in the European beginning of the law and we have to share had to us at the staff and I'm also had a lot of the Commission at the PLD as some words. So the world in the end we also have a few people and 2016, the US year ago with the European Commission for also had a lot of the European Commission but that was a good government and we took it's the EU policy and they were just with and they didn't know the
