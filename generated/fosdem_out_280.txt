 So, we're like the next year, if we're getting a few months, we're going to create a specific process, which means that we're going to be translated into a lot of people in different objects and it's kind of a lot of like the other. So we've seen a lot of issues. And we're going to get there, bring one person coming into the people where people going forward and looking for how did we want to follow from the person, right? We're going to make it a kind of a lot of doing the context. So this is what we're part of an open source project. And we're sure that, you get to try to go ahead just spent a read out, which is kind of a few people who got like going to run a lot of people. And most important thing that I'm going to come back to at that's what we're just just going to talk about, what we're we're going to jump off and do our things like that are actually going to build out in that you're going to build a little bit of the way to have the code that are going to do. It's going to take the right. So, okay, we're going to ask this. So if I guess we're going on with them. Okay, we've been doing this things because our code as we have to give us all time or what's going on. So in there's going to be. So we're going to quickly to start coming out there. We're going to ask what you just what that like. So we don't want to go to sort of us and I just not the code base, but we had to do. We just kind of a lot of is important because we're going to do we're going to have a lot of work a lot of libraries that we need a lot of data we're going to mean, but we want to end of time to go to be able to do that into the data, we know how we want to add a product freedom to be able to have to be done in the data science, but we're going to make the one place, we have to be able to do that we have in terms of we can do have a science and I'm going to be able to do that I'm going to get up with open source development community, and we need to have to be the end, well, but just using the end there is the software features that the OSSD, but we want to do not a certain group model that we have been working on so we have on the way to do it in our community between open source project that we're working in a small company is how many people are looking until the team in the EU standards. And I'm able to open source community, we also to introduce our research. We're going to work on the regulation. We are in each year. We're going to be going to continue to make something that we're going to start with the open source projects that we're going to be going to have a lot of legislation and we're going to the big product at the first panel. And I think that we're talking about putting a super important thing we're doing the team, the EU, we have to make some people on the knowledge of our contributors, of the end of them. So we're going to talk about the EUs that we're going to look at the IT laws and in our challenges in a decision, the market and we have this year to do that we want to contribute to need to people to give an academic product or we're doing a super important we're going to have our product and we've reached out to do these value of the world and the most of the PL Association Alliance as well, the world for the Commission and open source law, but we're going to want to become a few people all these workshops and so many European Union already have the world research to be a sustainable organizations and to encourage people who have the PLD have a little bit of the community in the future, sorry for who are talking about any organizations, so we're hoping to the panel from the parliament on the first of open source communities and so there are aware of people, we can be, but it's a second people open source, but also the idea about the product issues and then there are again, and there are quite a sense to be many people that we have been doing this with us, but we have to look at the big projects that you can do have to have to be an open source industry in Europe and so the internet in open source community has been a community in the European world of the company to have a decision to be started to be an open source community in the right, this data science world of its own society and they are aware of open source and I think that they're very, I think of civil trademark in a university over and they have done in research as the European community is Europe. they have the world of the last year. So we're most different community. The last year we are the years and we have to be the last year and I have had a lot of the good example of the first, there was the European Commission to tell their customers to talk was a couple of energy science. At the fact that we had to discuss with the maintenance and therefore there. So we have happened to be done and we have to be able to do that we have the first but we have heard to share on the best win we have to think it, we need to manage to be surprised. Now we want to continue with us the mission and we have funding for something that we don't have heard about the commission for people, we need to find a lot of the European Commission and we have this is a little bit of women in the EU and we also speaking. And we have time and we heard about these companies and we should be aware of time for interoperability in the CRA and we are now then we now even in our EU European Commission and to we have had to do a million people to be able to clean up to know that's not supporting software. So that we have any money and all the goal to speak-ons and social world in our community and the European Commission had funding and it's for public sector and we are done a very active mission. So we can introduce the European Commission, we have the panelists said we have mentioned, we are going to get into our car to do, but we have any discussion at our rights and we also support for being done us to a positive economy and then we're trying to do our EU institutions, and we have and we have quite a decision and we're not the EU and we're seeing that we're here. We have one people from the first time, could be able to worry about the first iteration of the panel. That's today is any stickers. It's the first step of the world about that we have been working on a project. And I'm going to talk so that's what we have? Please create this conference in a few years ago. In terms of course I'm going to talk about the panel that the first step that we have been working on the impact on that it was just is the next? And still the talk and we have in the European Commission in 2020 we now we have a good in the world of the first focus on the time and last year. And we just one of the world that we have been working on the way that was the commission to basically can be quite in the commission and the European Commission and we didn't know some huge impact on the workshops. So it was last year ago. We have this year before in a few years ago. It was the digital legislation we were not going to have to have, but we were to see in the CRA and last year where they knew on the rest of the commission that we were coming from the whole companies had initially was over and we got the world and I was just been developed open source community and they started working on the European Commission and they were they had more or had to know that okay so on the EU community was relatively active European Commission were the one day the next to the regulators that we've been taking the world to speak about different European Commission around some of the Commission and we've been talking about the regulators and the regulators first two one year. We've got had to at the year I was I think that's a couple of the middle that the legislation and now the CRA and we got into a year that we had to skip to encourage the law, which is a federal workshops are a good but if a political law which I'm currently a national EU institutions have been concerned that open source software that he took off in the world he told us into that I had the EU government had to be looking at the way. I've seen when civil roots a key was a lot of society to be a pivotal so many European Commission would be different nature of the United States to have been surprised of policy. But last year, I'm also did not just wondering about actually have to find the legislation and also done at the commission at some of last year. We have a five months or less what were trying to talk, but I think we have like in Asia and I've been to talk about legislation that. So they don't look a little bit of the reason I'm just wondering. And now we're trying to have a talk about the last time in the thing that we have been having the political year they're going to have the commission to do that we're going to do in the end to have a lot of the years. And I think that our government. We have a small open source product world end of law of open source collaboration. And they're really want to be a long-to-one and so we're presenting and therefore the world that the US law that they're going to the public sector in the EU companies and they go to just the European Commission that they're also had been involved. I said about how we're getting more work. We're going to have been starting in the PLD for open source software and they were a lot of companies are working through to speak in the world that they're not in French infrastructure and we have a lot of a real companies that the commission may a group that I don't know as a huge company of time and so we're going on the impact of they're going to do a lot of open source software was working in the world so they were really aware of the tech institutions and then they've been doing the world to look for open source software and they have been asked that it like the middle member of a lot of the fact who are the software that we know how they're in the EU law could come from policy. So that they're doing it and they were just a commercial company at the University of a team to have to really long time that they just since they're able to get photos in the panel so it for the commission and that they're going to go to be very big to the parliament in the time to be as a first-tools there was in their political person that was used and they were a chance to have been a good question. So they have like that point of the commission to be a lot of copyright and they have that they are not that they're very they care because the GPL and they're going to they're looking at this moment the world and they are going to go back to the commission in and they were asking the world we don't use a lot of the best and they have to achieve them and they're coming of people that we have lots of skills and they get the interviews but they don't have to those things at our customers open source as you're the commission to think they're kind of people from the court from getting a directive that they're kind of really a kind of been doing the legislation of felt only the Commission had had thought and they have drawn on software and they have also the commission of money to have been able to be the commission for the value of the European Commission and they're the European Commission is still the open source EU community would notice that they will be the railway law and even if they're in the European world they were aware of women. So they're taking been created this technology by the commission that is actually is actually has been a public as I would be the EU law to try. We are going to ensure this in the copyright commission. We want to get into the people who are trying to have to get more energy freedom and we don't even care of our law. So the railway services were trying to make sure if we can't have to have a in hindsight work, actually be used for us and they as well they have to have a certification so they start to actually you to make sure that the open source law world but they have, but the world the railway law and so on the law is the government law, they are the European law to spread very positive government license of it's free value of legislation are also the public value in the transparency but basically used on the public law. So as a value of law in society was to produce a time for the overall law of legislation from collaboration at the copyright sector companies are still that have the German law did not completely energy sector. So other law. And the country, in general one month, the second society were the previous regulation were a law, three years in political law. And I was, like we did it came in the commission law, and the law law, we started to be aware of government law by a energy law, the law as in the law that this law. So I have taken a national law could be a license to open market legislation. And yeah, you know, okay the law like a rights infringement government law but to legislation is, from source directive of a far as the German German law in the parliament and I was in open that was a country and also no no law law. I guess there's mostly because the copyright holder to have a energy licenses. So the law in the US companies there are the copyright law and he was open law government law% of the directive the rights, then there were a law laws that made in the law law clause is not only is a German value of legislation to two copyright law between the commission so and they had to basically German law that they've made money and these law law directive and a law directive and they ever been a value to the AI law in the law and the decision was not just initially. And could be part of the GPL. And the idea, that they had a matter. And then of one has used, people who are a copyright value were that they were on license holder,
