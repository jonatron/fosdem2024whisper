 My name is Alessio the founder of the first talk about it. But in the first point is I'm not sure. We'll show you how I'm just wondering about like the beginning of our open source in the community. We'll come in the last year. I'm also going to talk about the room. I'm going to talk about the last year, I'm going to be going to clean up to focus a little bit about a number of discussions. I'm looking at the beginning ago. What was our talk about people who haven't had to do we're using all these stories to try to keep a bit about those worlds and how you see who work, they work with funding work and make my project. And I think we've been getting wondering? I'm going to talk about how many people to I'm like maybe to see it's not the first that the community and the work and working on how we're a job that we'll help you about our community and open source community. And we have a project. So there's a first thing that I learned by using the project called the open source. I started working group at the first of the market and the first that the first one of the first one of the EU that I had to make folks, and I'm at the open source projects to tell you for people and I'm about the world. And I'm wondering I'm the first I mean in the motivation, I'm going to discuss about this time and we're interested. And I'm going to happen to focus in the EU that I'm going to show you know what I'll remember and thank you to talk about some the beginning we have some of the open source community and I'm still want to be related to discuss about the first year. The first time is a pleasure to the commission in the world and what we're also have been doing on the license into the projects that you get the world. So that we have we have the open source in the foundation and these things here because they already are also have like they have to do this to do been using and they have been learning and they just because they're going to be super end. I think that we're building ways to have now and they're going to spend in a very glad to speak to be sure if they're going to what they're going to pay again just about the commission so you like the policy and we're going to do of a good time and that is to do you probably know this is happening now probably going to make this what the person. And so time you may're going to make this by a way and what they're going to think they're going to do we're not want to be as well. I know all about like a part of the question the planet and we want to highlight before. So people are only talk about what we have we're building on the open source project to be in a way to be able to kind of the project we had to be that we were looking forward a week to look for those companies who is that is really a lot of software had. It was saying I think we've got two of people here too many people from the ones that we had a lot of people that we had their product that we've got to think what they're going to do we've been doing and like having been providing our public and do in there's a little bit of community has been the past and the parliament trying to like was that person, and the company that they just had a lot of the first weekend that money in the reason that were as a very quickly to know the point of the market and then we also for people who had a long term is in this year ago and they would be funding for a really need to find out there right and there was also that we have been in there were no people were who were a bit different time just to put a long market since the act in the best practices that we were writing on the European year of course we got that even a European Commission and we've got the German UK. And in the parliament was an open source was an open source project that work to keep in the political society. So I wanted to get to have a way that's going to be able to be aware and be a license act beyond the first of the law and open source way that was for open source for us in that there was just just something that the world now was a regulation that's like the time and the commission that had had to go through the term and so we had this was probably and as far had six years later I had a good problem that was actually started to do were there had uh was always a bit, but that this is a bit of a good decision. So that needs a free and it was very large government from the world in the only of a nice thing that was how to know that when they just saw to run and they had a decision was to work the public law but and that one year but a regulation and they think is quite a reasonable. And we did I think I was a lot of and they were a lot of these open source community that they're actually do and also found out of thinking about the same. Why was the commission going and getting into the EU they wouldn't just don't only companies and they have this so the beginning were a German law that was just the idea of the laws that they were also no gatekeeper there were only one GPL law and they have had to be a long term in an open source law and something that happens to have this is in the first and almost going to be moved out of the EU and so for the copyright license and that they were the German government is a market that I don't know which was that it and the EU has been the first three federal value of the law in the German license law was a license was used but that they had last one in the organizations are like the lawas. And that was free and the holder and they don't asked I thought that was actually were doing care about the CRA was something if they are the copyright as a law is not to the parliament but we had to speak full time and you saw a value in addition to the market of the German uh the software and the law and it was the German law actually a money into a copyright and then money was just was basically said no it's like copyright and so they had to apply to the court law and that they should be to the licenseekeepers already very clear in German law and that which means that they didn't know that would be a law but only is somewhat more space mandatory for free an hour for decision in this question and I would be a decision that we think you know about legislation and is about and only to that legislation to be used in a free to cost for the democratic decision to act and uh court was able to be. So I was the CRA so I've seen last year last question was I was just answered at the commission would from EU and that I was not said I didn't know this was to have been just wondering 20 years before is about the CRA in the public rights said I've heard of the commission could only. So I would be a long term of our society of the political law for example and I think it's another law law so this was a closed license of law they can be law, if you're talking about the German court law. And yeah, she was something directive the point was it's no mandatory law but I didn't think that not as the law in law directive and the rights was the government law. I was not an infringement law, the law law. And before the part is a law. The open GPL law in the law law would be copyright holder could what they don't want to be doing that I think I mean legal thing that maybe I think is an commission or just to give I didn't kind of law law and to copyright because they were two copyright nature that and a law would be part of time. The copyright law would be a copyright value of the license and any commission market for the copyright holder were a only going to respect to be done as important is, but they would be a copyright decision directive and this court. They don't be an only like even in each decision policy only is it's from the copyright world of power didn't, actually a cost of funding to the sector, right? That's what I didn't know why not very important, do, you know, well, you know what would you know about the question, should think is a government, the third world was I think about the copyright enforcement is that the copyright enforcement and they just to the law would be clear and any problem, shall it was saying that law was actually available funded by copyright law, after the copyright law in fact only. And the law in copyright GPLas, is one of an national law law, one as well not being GPL law, and law policy and if they were at the law, you had said, they need to and they have no people, but I said that they didn't had some way to be able to do have the copyright court law and they would be able to legal law that they could be able to be copyright law software law or right law to be aware of copyright person of copyright and they had free law for the copyright clause and the copyright was that they were just as far so there was even the value and they had nothing is in license and when they did they had to be not have in risk. And if they didn't worry to be a policy to have a copyright holder. So in the directive and I think that I do and there were there was a law ever said, uh, the licensee is what a idea was that no copyright or it was just's the directive about about the copyright law and that the law for that has been in the copyright value of civil law so they were designed that they have been to rely on the court infringement. We have it, so you know, and they were open source conditions and so they have to try to be able to say the IT and then they was really want to solve it was just had to have to actually then they need any public certification in that they know that the copyright, who said that is the company that we had to know and that could't have an issue is not ask a way of that. And then they developed for sure there were something that they would then they're just think they would be able to their copyright directive, and policy key was in place to know that a person who was meant to actually I said the way of license, so they don't want to do that they didn't read was okay because they're just know that you think the license law of the law they have a gap that it's just a very good, but the law, for the law, but some the mandatory infringement would be the legal value of the way, they don't have an open software, which is a copyright association of the license and I think that was kind of law in practice sector and so you know and they have no idea to recognize that they have to open source rights to be happy to be clear to have the license mandatory enough and to in the law that's a license and where you know to work on the product, uh, right is more specifically due to be used to public sector sector and as well when you know here with public copyright copyright holder does not going to the commission this law and the market that's the OTLL and should not about law and the foundation we think they use the copyright for the copyright but they have three person can share and in US agencies and they are not even have some rights law so they will be a GPL law and they are not for a copyright rights law and they have a copyright world so I'm a infringement or even two association that they are not the CRA? I think that many CRA have the terms of German commission or in the regulation in law in Europe that that doesn't actually, you know nothing to have made in the reason for a security in the world and they are not, and of time, because I think is just like a free license perspective. So in terms of the IT-tas is a second law, the law as I think you know what people have in the law for example of knowledge, because they all, like it's typically work in the uh policies that they are right law. I think of the act like what we have learned on the market that the money to the law license of the license that we have could be open source the standard law has heard of law and they're doing was that they do, which you basically they had to choose a directive to the past, and they're not only one policy and they get a value of the last year now and they really made under this at the regulation. I also a public IT and so you know a decision value of making GPL was the copyright law and so different law remains regulation and they were paid the German funding as long they had had a copyright holder, especially policy, despite the law where they are now they were actually clear that was a copyright issues, and just a license was, but that decision, you know, I said, they stop actually got back to remember the value for the copyright law or the license. One that he was not went to see. But these laws, we used in law, the law law, because the holder, this value and a copyright law and they didn't think, it's the copyright economy was a license have to the rights license value of the value to that that they've got a copyright value was a sense at global GPL GPL is in license of law law, but he's not only be not clear value of what the business and in that the market when I think it to and a copyright liability is free law was the license, but it has just the law is copyright law would be the law and should be actually be there is a way to be copyright copyright sector and in court clause that they could shouldn't always be taken into a copyright law the copyright she was whether we've been able to get. And and they can have to think it, they only law in the commission in a value of a closed regulation was the copyright license decision officers and the law. So that he was when the only, of the value had that I think that the court has had an GPL thought the copyright laws that it was very often that were still get to be linked to more and I've been there is a value of a copyright would be at least I've been the license for the law and I've had to you know a copyright law will be paid for energy part of the money else over the value. And when the law. They would expect in practice, they were on it was probably
