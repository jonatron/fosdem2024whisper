 And this is the C, who is in OpenTelemetry.org, there's a whole question. And there is, which is a little bit complicated. But that, it's a great. And it's the GPT, because, you can see what I'm around it for example, you can see the C++, again, which is going to choose the other idea. So yeah, I'm going to say in theory first, I'm writing C++ code, which is called C code. So I'm going to bring this in Python CD, I want to have to build the Python to go back to the C++ and you in, C++ code for the DDS. So, is a Ruby is going to show a C++ C++ code base. It's a C++ code in C++ code into C8 which is really a XLC and C++ code is a small problem in this is wrong. You can specify the C++ code and write code. You can be using Rust code. You can execute C runtime, in C code, you can, and use Python code, it's a code, in Python. You can, and I'm going to talk about WebAssembly and you this Python code. So, I'm using Rust C code. You can do the AI and JavaScript. It's where this thing is kind of what is a bit of, the C Spiceog. That's kind of the developer language, which one, we are the different code, C++ and Xnetes and C++ code. So, really important is what Rust code was the Python. The standard code is is for the JavaScript code is it's not important to C++, GCC. So, is the next. It's actually I'm actually going to look at the GCC code. I work for GCC code runtime and Rust. And, this is a Rust, if my, you're going to do. You have to start you need to show you know, we've been using C++ code. So, C++, we have the C++ code and like, we're writing code using Java code code to note, so it's now, if we also gives us to see all, for it's available. And this is, the RCAD is built in the program. It's the Ruby does is not work around, which is it does. So, we are like Type X code. And we have a function with Python code, we have a Ruby code that we have a Rust. It's Python code, JavaScript. We have code code base, I think, which is most common format called the code does for GCC. But it was a Python, there. Okay. And so I've got a Rust code called Rust. In this case, there. So, LVM has the last, we can have a C, if you can go ahead, you've said, we have an M++. But there's the RubyV code called Ruby compiler, we spent some changes a Python, the program that we have a C code to Rust library called C code out of code, we have a call a C code on, right now. So we have C++ C++ code to you know about a Rust. And, it's the GCC code for GCC code base compiler. But, the ZC compiler. Well, I mean the fact that's really, yeah. And this C code, maybe, and it should be defined source code base. But we have function is actually. It's not used for Dart code that we have also have a way that there's really want to be done only like C compiler. In this. Yeah, but you have the code base. All right? No, yes. It's actually, there. I'm just an base. Yeah, we don't have to support in time for example, we are people and stuff. And if the C++ code base is this was kind of C++ code base. So, if you're this is like, you put this. But I'm not not just going to think about it's say we're going to use. But the right? Like the GCC is the code itself, it's at least, you probably not work for this. I mean, you just, for this, is it's fine. What it's the function, the functions have is the C++ code, for C code in Rust code description. But when you know, you know, we need to support, we have this stuff, like the previous code base. You're going to run up a lot of GCC code that, we don't work when what we're going to use cases. We'm doing. Well, just a lot of the dependencies, for two languages. And if you need to install Ruby functions that. And it's what's the performance, it's get into the Ruby library and the code? It's not going to be built, it's the function. It's going to be about going to parse and we can be going to be going to be going to be going to be able to implement our state of code base memory, it in a four. The C++ code is what would for what we call the function with code, but this is you're going to use it, in Java compiler, and we need to start. And we need to use JavaScript code base API, we need to test cases, we need to see what we use cases when we have to figure out for that. And if we are we have a function, we're going to need to be able to say, we should be looking for the class to handle and we know, so much but the function out of our syntax-to-of-based dependencies. It's how a function we can, we need to get into the code can be able to match. And it's going to do that it, but we have better. In fact that's a number of a whole thing that we can't have a language. And if we have a case of fields, you can actually put it's we go. We can do some people in the current library. And we want to do we just a lot of the input like we can look at the version one called the first one we have to say about this cluster and the function for a program that is a lot of the request in the output of things we're going to create a regular code to work to be looking into learning thing. It's kind of the prompt out of how we've got a little bit of see. We have the most of that we've developed our code that we want to build again to see the build them specifically for example of this thing, for that we know what we ask the API of the best way we try it a lot of how we want to build. And so we have our only call this thing that we have to do we don't work with the AI and the library as a really want to get into the most, if we also want to have to implement. We want to use, then we want to build an important thing to do we have this, we're trying to add an array library generation as a lot of this or post-upy has a lot of way to use a lot of workflows, but that are also a lot of ways to throw this API right? So it's going to get some of a lot of the end. But then we want to tell us to clean up to use in some cases. So it's kind of this really the source and this is not one that I'm going it's going to start again that's going to talk's going to talk to go on. But for this is a very, but it's the most people so that then a weird. And so on the community. So a project was fairly old. So one of course, we've just want to work like a very quick question. And it's just the community that this is the ones we have been interested in this, most people to happen. Yeah, if there was there's the question. I want to think we have any year, and the, we are some time. And we still aware of the beginning of them that it's mainly being used as community and I feel like, we built on it's real and so we shipped in the people to say we're going to ask the first day, I'm just going to say there's the last year. So we can we have to take care about on the EU and we're about the beginning of the world of the fact that we're going into these users that they're looking at the parliament at us have also looking for people who was originally had to have been a product for last year ago for a long time and just wondering because we had to do the success on. So we have a lot of the car-wise was going to be trying to be doing the world so we had this to know that was actually the last year. So it was kind of an open source project but now had to work on the research on that we have been using open source project and I was just said that we want to see here. So now I've been open source and as I'm not just wondering on the end machine engineer at the developers who was thinking about the organization that we faced with people who was doing that was kind of the tech community and a lot of like three of the process involvement around here and the open source project and so the decision in the world was like the community and open source software is the way to come through the world in the number that we were just wondering, like the US communities and there were a bit of thousands of OpenJDK on open source software we had the last year on social community and they had that we didn't come over time and they had a lot of projects coming from the product. So that I was only have to be able to be in the work in 2019 have a really important release was to be a year and so far and we were just have to have had to make the technology we've got a little bit of people who was mentioning something 20 years. And it me after they were really well. I had to build with the people was also have in EU, so you know like so he was that point in terms of the time and so you know that a research was looking into the moment. And when you were the other things saying one. And the first one of the world was the challenges as well then I've got to find the main place that was not always talked about what were about the whole ones. And we're looking at the source stuff that I was interesting is going to the people, but it was really like here. So, let me, well I want to share the talk. Can you. So let's start us say, okay, okay, I said, I was wondering, I'm taking a story. And I'm going to introduce a little out the Fos for the only going to contribute to get new tech conference, I'm just wondering if I'm presenting the time to me. And before I was wondering that I was wondering, okay, thanks to a little bit of the introduction, I ended up. So I was wondering, because it was because I was done this was working today, we also the first months ago, we got the history about the first year ago we had to present we were in 2022. And they are Matthias was as a really, the educational tech company was the product to just did to get to be known in the CRA in a lot of the latest public world. The first time was in the first year, but I was a bit more of the last year, and the work now we ended that could actually make this decade ago because you were working on it was always quite something better than Chris, I'm going to what he was now. So we have was going to work, everyone who was doing, why did I'm thinking about the fact, but I said, okay, a little bit of a good, the one of the most important thing was to show that you why he was,. And was mentioning this was just gone in the way, it before. So we had the next question was it was just a specific. So this was something I was I was the talk, one I ended up to, I seen here, especially in the key for open source and I was a lot of the digital community a very, but I was the European Commission. And I was as well, because I was that was a company and he was told us, so I was a person since it was the CRA from the first time, and she was the government was a little went from the left and it was going to basically up the part of the people were doing a regulation of the organization were, these workshops are actually has used before already had a little bit easier to interpret in this as a long as regards to be just have heard of money and there in the first thing that we have so we have reached a democratic that was in the first two, really like a company was I ran a moment. And was released earlier, so I had to do actually I know, and a lot of them were having been, this year, and it was done and so I was really had from them and I was there were going to see that was a lot of the years ago with the time. And I knew how it was a company. So we had to report was this happened to solve this back into the GPL was actually the first moment but they're just going to give you know, but they had actually know, then they weren't had a little bit of the value over time I was a big have had to come off, but I would like, not really want to know what the last year. I was doing this was thinking was and was even know that we saw. And now really important to start thinking of a little bit's kind of a good thing to find the only part of the idea that is that I said, to highlight that the talk at the Drupal from the value of the last year's a I'm not here. And the commission that I've had had a co-time organization were working on. And so I would like getting the city started doing and the European Commission had the technology and the first had at its open source society and a little bit of the Commission in the parliament, which was in the European policy was a law, but I think of this was the Commission and I said, but I was a so this was kind of part of where the EU that is that was really good in 2011 and I don't think it was to look into the IT legislative value for the whole court and
