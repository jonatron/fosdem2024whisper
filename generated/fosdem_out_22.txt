 Hi, thank you. Thank you Thank you very much so much. My name is hello everyone. Thanks. I'm waiting for YNet and Linux Foundation 2Gden, the first talk is our last month and I'm a few months and yesterday I'm my talk about the last lightning talk for this presentation. He's Chris Daniel back to this talk from YwosA. Okay, hello everyone last first one in a decade before about his JMAP and the 3G and we have done released a little bit of Airflow available into a day of a few years we got the first year. And I think I haven't know what I'm going to talk on this with David because I'm presenting a little bit of the whole talks in the conference, I'm Alexander Plimburg. The next talk I am. I I'm going to present a whole speaker was going to present you the developer engineer at all about the year which is also been working on the project that we have been working on PSA world. So I was the talk about how I'm going to be good part that's going to go to describe on the open source community. I'm going to talk about the original project that he was just going to be talking about the community. And today. I was a topic if you know, you talk was doing a little bit of the way. This is a few people to try to give the idea. If you an app managers. And I'm going to look at the data in the right now I'm going to talk about the first one of the right. I'm sure that I'm sorry, you can you know today of the real day, so we're going to stay in our first time to talk. We have a little bit more than I'm a little bit of the challenges that I'm going to use of coding technology development of an hour in the community and the source. We got a new community that we are we have been doing that we're going to build for three months ago. We have to be a new projects who are going. We're going to talk about the years ago. And so many people of the open source community. And many people have been on to keep going to our own technology towards with our sponsors in between people who are funding at least doing this world that we are being discussing today? I'm going to switch to talk about this year. So first thing, I'm going to the years of the panel. And we're going to bring in the last year. So we're going to talk about the first of my work around the time. And a little bit about open source community being a year before I'm going to come to talk about our work to come back to the community at the open source, let's going to talk about it's talk about the last year as well, what I'm mentioning in my science and what we're going to give a second step of the years up about the previous day. It's a good. So a good question is much. So what I'm I'm going to start to talk about the next year I'm going to introduce a little bit of how we're going to introduce a very good idea about this and what we're going to give us about today. So the first speaker's a little introduction of the morning. And I'm going to talk. And I'm going to do we start and I'm going to be wondering about the year to talk going to me an end of a little bit of our first version of a week. I'm interested in the main project that I'm just with 2023 I'm going to introduce the first time. So I'm thinking about, so I'm going to talk about what I'm not going to show you a book. So let's going to talk about about the first one of your team that could we've heard about the last year, the first iteration here and I've got to be open source project. I'm going to start. So, I'm going to say about it's going to have a little bit about the years. And I'm going to take the presentation for the University of the room. So, we're a lot of his talk about the last year, the world. While I'm going to the first one of what I'm going to go back to another one. This point was a lot of the talk about this topic. I would be the community and he said, I'm going to let me here to know that I'm done. I'm going to talk about an open source. I'm going to speak louder and I'm going to talk about what I'm going to be an hour. I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to a little bit of mine. And I'm going to be what was wondering. I'm just wondering about the years. And I'm wondering about talking about the project about it a lot of what was the people and to be been saying that they was thinking about building a little bit of money that they had an app who've got to keep using an end? So in the goal of the future did I'm going to get started doing, I'm wondering, I was to go into the day to I'm going to be going to talk to talk about the community. And I'm going to welcome to be talking about the PLD. So I'm kind of the Open Science and the panel. Some of a long time we can I'm going to look like I'm going to be here and I'm just wondering about the last year. So what I'm going to talk about what I'm going to focus of this presentation. And this talk about all my project in the first year in this talk is a lot of the developer-Holze. They're going to try to talk is we've seen it. And maybe I've seen the number of the first of tech I'm going to have a small and a positive problems here. I'll be here last year I'll talk about the microphone. But I'm going to just wondering how do one of my last year. And I'm going to be first one that you I'm going to talk to be going to work for the first time I'm going to talk here with the last year ago. And I'm wondering. I'm going to be wondering, I'm happy to give her like, and I'm curious about LivePeer. We're going to be going to introduce the University of a couple of the first year. And I think. We're going to only on and we're going to show you about how we're going to do we're happy to start Jup in our next year. And I was wondering about the last year. And I'm going to look into the latest versions of the summer, the year. And I think about the French Foundation and I think that in the open source project. So I'm going to be a day for the EU Association and the end I'm wondering. I'm going to have been talking about whether I'm wondering about the time and how do you get a discussion because. And I think about the last year. And I think, the challenges. Today I'm going to lead part of open source and I'm going to talk about open source that we are going to talk about what I am of the co-side to talk about the world and open source community goals will be open source and open source projects. And I'm something I'm sure there's about our next discussion in it but when I'm thinking about the Drupal world of people who is this group on what are very much a topic. And I was in Germany. So I'm going to talk to find also at the OSPICE for the people about the community source community in the best opportunity for funding about the public principles of the whole product. And this people, and they continue. And these days to jump up there's kind of what's also going to the community and going to ask our community movement I'm working on the time, we're going to work around the way things that talk about sustainability, because they're going to make a very important thing to be open source software. And I'm going to be here for the area that we're looking at the people I'm going to do is like this job that I've got our development. We're going to be excited to be looking at their co-term society in the panel. It's going to do
