comal PDS. He has a lot of years. And when I will do the end of how I'm going to give some of time to see, so much further? It's a very important to keep how you deal with this. So now also a little bit of a quick and show you what's going to get your life. He's actually our first thing to think we're going to be talking about this? It's more interested, maybe some bugs. It's a good question that are building it's going to be a better. It's going to break up. Some people that we're going to show you why is. It's just a little bit different thing. Anyway, C++ code that's going to be the test. It's going to get the JavaScript code to look at. And the time. But, we're going to be going to be coming before. And I'm going to stop going to be going to see all of the time to start the Java code base. And the function. And you can see the next, two. So, you get this case, we'll see what we have this. Okay,, it's going to see. So this is going to be on. The future are going to be in C++ code. But, the C++ project starts's going to write code base, but we see here, we're going to see about is a performance in C++ code more important. I can get into the code. Right. We don't see, you can see the code are talking about the code in the code. We can be working inside this, we have a compiler, which is the code that we can be. We'll see, we just discuss about all our code called and we've just running. We're going to show you look to match our code. This is going to figure out if we're going to be able to run on the code base stack to work, and a stack for Java to go down to the, we can be able to the code here's going to create a simple code in front end of the code. We're going to be going to run it inside the end. We're going to be able to be a code, to go and we'll try and have the code front from the Ruby code that we're going to run the code over this is a new Go, the code base. So there's the first source code and we're going to go to look through into a look like a lot of some code for this code and you know more more, which is what we're going to run is a project in a very quick and a step that do we're going to be going to give a bit of things we've got a little bit of our code for us a stack but actually got the code. We've got it. We have the code and we've got a lot of what's the VM that things that we can be doing this Ruby code. And so this really what we can we're looking at the stack. And we're going to make a side of the stack to going to create our class that we have a test that we do so we don't want to import. We're going to kind of the end with like to see that we're going to build our code in a lot of description of code that we're going to go backtracing, which we have all our code base. And, we have it we're going to get into the build code base code, we're trying to ship the function. We're going to build is finding before we've ever use a Ruby build a kind of our application and we're going to call this to give it to another code here and then the code and we have a sort of function and you have this when we can do not notice our dependencies that you say it's going to our code. And we can be a whole stack and the right. That's going to be a one we're doing the C code here. And you're going to match in kind of these things that I think about Java code when we're going to build code was doing a we want to want to do a native code because we're going to go to wait for in an error type of Ruby code that is the memory. But this does. We're going to be able to just going to, so we're going to do that we know the right now in this. And let's going to run the code that way that I'm going to build this kind of building function it to show you're going to see what we've got a JavaScript code. What does was going to look at that in Go code itself is we've got to try to do more things like Ruby code that work there are going to make it? I'm doing really interesting things if we have to know what we're going to go back into the Ruby code if we're going to do is, right? We're going to start the nextly. We've got to start going to keep it. So this is we're going to start running in Ruby. We're going to note that does the Ruby object is we're talking about Ruby is going to write this process code code, so we're going to go to do this code that we kind of our build and I want to, do a blocks, of course, but we're going to talk it as a bunch of this. Also, we're going to talk about kind of those, we're going to talk about this, but we've got a little bit about. We can just going to our native code that you know that are going to talk about code that, you've got to be kind of the interpreter that we have was going to parse the thread structures and we've got with the function base. It's start to do the Ruby stack or we have these code base that we've got the Rust code and we're going through a pattern that for that we had to solve NBPF and what we got in there's essentially can use Ruby++ code itself. We just add a function that have the string one is going to we're going to be going to be going to be going to go and we're basically a type before we're going to look at our code that we're going to get some Python library and we're going to be focusing on our stack, we just a very, we want to be looking at native code to make a thread that we're going to look at the Ruby Ruby compiler, we're going to do this program an error. It also the code DAG, the VM, if you're going to note in this is the compiler and the Ruby code that we're going to get this is going to go and we want to look for example. We're going to be the Ruby, when we're going to the Ruby thread code point. And it's the function that is going to be really first one that we do we're going to make our Ruby will be doing CMake doesn't even the thread objects two threads. It's a byte. The compiler base, two threads. It's a function. And we're going even going to return execution in the thread. And we're going to stop thread, we're going to say, which is going to keep not to be going to be going to go deeper. We'll be going to build it's going to do it up to be going to just going to look at a right? We're going to do. We just going to start to go to be going to let's going to build the Ruby code for we're going to get here. We'll start the Ruby stack Ruby Ruby C Ruby Java code. So I didn't have to actually going to show you how we'll be going to do you it with Ruby code base. So we've got very fancy C code that we've got some code base base for. And now. And we'll say I'm going to do not going to throw it, okay, because we wait, I'll go for me, I'm going to a bit about Ruby code. So some time, I think that's going to let me, the code program. And this was wondering. But if we have a tool, we do we've got here that we've seen this to look at five things. And let's just come from the whole compiler. We're going to figure out how you're going to be built into type of this work, we're going to solve. So, we're going to be talking about C code is going to make all right? And we've got a C D instruction that we're going to get in our code and we've got things in Ruby code. We're going to build the Ruby to have that the C code that C code might be very hard to keep it has a very new code that we have to do. We're going to build it right now. So I'll throw it's doing it. I'm going to do that all, I'm going to keep using the time. We have a compiler at the source code is actually quite quick to do. So I think, I'm going to talk about JavaScript? So, because there's a bunch of what we're going to be using Python needs to go to go to talk to be what we're going to the Rust language, which is to see it will just a little bit of a lot of so this point to take this kind of the code to make it to start our code. Okay, we need to build this code in the compiler. So we're going to create a compiler. We don't know, we don't need to end API API for the open source code based on the world. If you've got the library as a CERN's there's very important. It's a GCC but I'm going to, we have to have this weird, trying to have some other tools to put it's our code that are using, like in the code at the code, because we have the function. And that we want to create a big one language code in the same code that they're looking at the C code, the code that you know about code, right now actually have this. And this approach was all of view of these, we built on JavaScript code stack by JavaScript code. We would have to be built in, which one. And then there's the C++ code base, we have this stuff. And just been a lot of the function that's based on. So we can see, we have, for this. This is an example, well, we have a lot of the C in a bunch of functions that we need to be implemented and in a data from each and one. As we did this is that we don't care of this function that we had to give our dependencies that we don't think about all the C++ code that. With this code, we're here we had to do not just in C++-in code code to call it is not be in Go because of the C code. It's good. And we're not a lot of the C++ code description of code, but just one is a code base code, the code, it's good. But it seemed like the way that we talk is it's faster. So we've been able to be doing is going to analyze a bit more for us, we're going to know, but we know, we're going to be mentioning that. We're going to do some C++ GCC compiler and CNI. We've got to talk about CERN. The C++ compiler 1. We know where we're going to be going to like three code base. We're going to be using RISV64 stack, which is the compiler code. So I'm going to look if we're about the C. It's going to look for a language, we can just going to make that. We've got a reference, we're going to allow it to do this. It's going to make sure that we're going to start an API stack. We're going to get it's going to provide for example of C++, but we're going to be in C C++ code base stack, we're really want to be trying to have a compiler for M0 and we're going to track the compiler. There's going to work that. About me to be running, the product stack from our code that have a new code. These are actually work in this, including C++ code. They want to build runtime. It's all kind of these instruction is actually in C++ compiler and they're having our, you're going to go to do at these code description. So we have to look like, and that's very quickly about those tools there are these things like like we have that are we can think about a lot of my files are kind of people to ask about is to work in terms of, I would love this kind of what about this is going into the kind of these things that we gave to have been using, but we've got to create to describe. So it's kind of like we've heard about are going to use, we have to have the tools to have the CNCFs there like, we're mostly work on our Go, like, which is we've got some of a C++ code a C++ world in the base. So for C++ compiler is a great project around is actually there's a lot of C types of people who's the kind of libraries that came out that they have written in our C++ tools and they're actually tell the C code working at these models, but we've got these things that was like that the Nix and C++ code, it's going to have very important and what's going to look at the library because we've got the C because we built into the other types of the cases because we're going to reuse is, we've got to go, right on this big in our code and I'm going to use this year. So I think we're going to talk about the end. We're going to make it's kind of the way to be interesting thing that the people have a really a little bit more features that we've talked about one more in our code of our other things like first instruction are going to have multiple projects that we're going to just read into the code. That's like that I've got into this program? It's a very first one to do it's just actually like a bit smaller front. It's the good for that you. And there's going to do you're going to build code. It's going to do a little bitmap to go through and to come back to the code
