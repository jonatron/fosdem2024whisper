 He was wondering. He was here in the panel. I'm going to see my first talk to be a few years was a few people and I'm going to have a really excited about. This is Thunderbird, really a lot of the work, and had work on these teams. And I'm a bit about myself, I'm not working, but I'm glad that it's up to show you a bit of what is from like you doing with a few links in one member of these those are the issue. I'm going to cover the title of the little bit more active in the years ago, right? And I'm going to be the end of the first of the world is going to be told the world. So I'm going to be going to start. And I was going to present in the talk about this time to talk about how I'm just wondering me? And I'm going to be going for some thoughts on my employer to be wondering. And, I am I just wondering in my colleague just going to make you know to keep the tech? But let's try to learn this talk about how do we've got the amazing topic. And I told me, how he was writing this is the last year I've worked in the last year, this project, what we would I'm, I'm adding that I'm just wondering. So we have a little bit about the project was doing with a lot of just a couple of a lot of years I know it so far in the last year because I've been working on those years ago. And the company were seeing the company here that I will be honest with the parliament will present. And so many years. The last year was the first time was not about Andrew and I've been working with a community. I thought. Okay, I had an hour bit of the years ago. So this year I'm wondering in the last year, I was a little bit about that I went to become the first year of the beginning of the project ever was 20 years. We've got released the ecosystem, and I think that was quite nice to the community. So I've been using 20 months, one of each year so I was the various years was just two years ago, three years ago at us in the moment. And I've heard then I was just done the community, was the years ago, did, but when I was the world than the last year. So I would, and certainly remember me now I wrote up in the co-to of the first time to read over the internet and since year ago, I was like, but we have just to talk, which back to get the room here and I was doing that yesterday since this day to the beginning yesterday. I was like, and I started to show you would like I had, that were really wondering, we need to make it on and I was made and we had to get five years working year ago of the years ago, so going to look of the year. The whole was responsible for anything about the first time we should also launched this is there so on the back. So it was a few years ago, at the end of course the time that is we've had a little bit too many years ago. So they were here we had a new project scientist. And they had in 2011, we had a bit of the point in the presentation. And we had any year right now to keep 10 years ago, so we have had to see a lot of our work for the question was the beginning of in the panel that was we have been found the situation for us were we had every year and we've got there was going to have to think that was no, which had, which was the commission, but it was now is the ones that we got been doing a few months or in the Commission and now and she got started announced for the technology for the European Commission in the whole work 20 years in June 1. And what were originally had even the European Commission and the EU laws. And was, we had also kind of the CRA and then get engaged in the Commission were moving the EU law, was just been a lot of the parliament came off the digital technology in the IT law at the industry at a directive. And then open source railway government law, they did is really decided to be quite a methodology. Also one person that I was the law and on the EU to ask the commission and co-profit. So of the EU law, a public law was also because he was a well, we were just wondering that's to say on the EU that there was very similar to us how they faced has been in their federal Commission and they had as far a free law and they could seem to realize, that an EU for the court. And then. And as well, it was a law that's going to have heard about open source law and was having a German sector being used for the legislation. I'm going into the government they have had said, of the commission who were already had the EU government government field then the EU society would be that's the government and the EU law. And is just was the national institutions didn't the EU liability of the majority of legislation that a knowledge of money as government as the regulation were recognized of the open source software and there were an end of legislation and European railway open assessment directive in the funding, but just had a legislation was always a free law that were really the law to do always competitive to policy and to you were, but they thought that think that are out of the government and in the EU regulation that. But then we're also need to worry about European Commission and open law going to think that you have many political directive, but still have from digital rights commission here and we have. And in Europe and even quite asked me, we had great community more interesting sector from the court world had to this aspect of the world. And it's the company we have because it should be very positive factories and then we have to get to be on the policy. So we are still have a long time it was there are very clear and they can't that we don't get that they're sure that we need to know on our impact of the law and like far money and it was going to be the EU world. So when they're just go to be working on the PLin society was a commercial impact for us the law like to the German court in it was a term. This is a European Commission had to people here since the parliament might be the UK law of the law. So this we have so in 2020. And was done the public sector is it was also a law and it was just not like GPL and we were very clear in the law the court law. And the only that he was about law in 2021 and they were a law was quite the government from the GPL because they were used to still it was interesting organizations like I found that it was about the society in the law law, and they said, but they were thinking of the license law. And I didn't want to be a law person that was no law actually by open source political party laws that it was not certainly a non- copyright conditions and asked in an open source in the point. And in a law directive was being a scientific copyright company that it was one of the copyright value of the licenses in the copyright under public law. And then it was really a copyright rights, but that they were using the rights law thing I think government directive it would read of a competition and legal copyright laws. And in a rights was also said that, and I said that they were concerned at all of the way to see what has been asked by the directive have the law that I read and the government? The GPL is the source law what they come that was still didn't actually they were a government law law or in the copyright law's also that the CRA. And but they then on a law and they have to make money and they were able to measure was wrong things as a important they had the law problem that they were the copyright at the copyright and they was they are aware of the copyright license to start in copyright had the law of the law. They thought the value of the law and this was the copyright infringement and they've got a GPL that thought it was just the GPL law of legislation that the trademark that the key went and even far went and in and I had was actually was a copyright law. Another problem that I was to actually part that they was kind of copyright because the license and it was that was given to no no one that that we were a copyright and so they were so the copyright law was just had said that she was used. I had happened that I was a copyright was talking in two could made in value-shirt here was thinking of a law, one well from commission to the license or GPL only person and in the policy law that was released was a really the law. They had at three copyright he didn't have started because they were saying one time were asking another law that they did the law in the law and they started coming really kept speaking that they had said about like value and they were going to the value that she had more complicated law was in the copyright violation. So they shouldn't actually get to do some regulation was the policy field that I didn't really do so they were they were really went into the first value of the law in this person and they would be used to the license to solve that their law was the copyright value. But this law was been paid was not for the fact that was a really, so of the public law's a copyright is that the license was really the could not also had in the license. So I just another copyright. Have has was the value. People were trained a copyright copyright was no idea of the copyright license problem more copyright laws. We had every law. I don't get people would require value of a law that a copyright directive and they need to actually asked the standard law law point it sounds an issue that the law and that we could be an law we didn't have a value in there were a copyright value. And we had that and they were the copyright infringement when they did we had to have kind of a law it was saying it didn't been saying that before they were really remember the important and they were finding our value value that of the software got the effect was in terms of this person that was going to politicians was never asked, but there had to have a sense of a copyright law but we have a value of being a company who is a law and they were a license on the important that they were always wanted to be very bad person ever been really something was a case in copyright, but they also in the human there were made for the same decision, but they were the commission to be an licensee that they just found this license of copyright value for the copyright, first value was because they were able to it was the copyright value because they had a law to could be just a license so they were a even the copyright could often the copyright law, it was actually said it's a law, and would try until the good law, but I had the GPL would be so that since they really I was a more value in the license and I was also actually not an indication of now the law, so you had the value a regulation and it was not even that it was the license and even then the license policy for public, so they could be used on it's the license law. And I think that last was very good term the GPL the GPLard and he would be able to be like this really interesting law to be a law, but in the GPL would be important to do this. If the copyright and an GPL and the license is part of doing copyright law in the license legislation violation is the EU wasn't an copyright directive that you had, is quite a copyright policy could be aware that an law. But it's public copyright as an law license might be an RFCed is very huge copyright, a key, were made that actually in Europe should be used under value to ask license license of revenue that there that needs to understand we would be a decision would be a sense to do not one of a different court law because you know at at the directive and it could be. So I think over time, I think this certification, great, maybe like in the outcome was totally exactly as I think that you know that were not like and that i have got an issue which policy decided right it's what we saw to do in 2019. So she has heard of this year or I think back to be a bit more but you know, these really if they should be done been given care of where they also very important. I can have to think it's at this. And I mean it's people have the technology to measure that it. But that there are, I also, thank you know about the question I'm a long as you on, I'm not happy to work even for the energy in the beginning of the CRA, I'm last year, the panel, but it's about the first one thing that is that I wasn't very happy to deliver the internet and I'm going to stop to talk from the people because that at the first I'm a very much the moment. I should work around the only before I was happening there was doing five years ago, an only one was like I thought in the past there's probably the law and that and I'm just mentioned it's a technology. So I was here we have seven more or the EU development of a good question was not targeted to the world, but that we had was the law as we had the world, uh, I was really know that was in the market to do not trying to get the beginning. I think about the future and we think that we have been doing in the world so many work on a good and the world. So I think the law that are the parliament in the law law. And I think it was the fact. And as a law was very similar to have the court law, to that was the world. And I would be very happy to open source CRA about the best software for the European standard law and the open source law, they were like law, right now in license has been available for EU law, but there was really a value of civil law that we know it in case that and they are the citizen law in the railway agencies were funding. I was a federal law and they were not thought all of the world and they was often had a regulation and the world in a certain German license value of a very important really useful to collaborate and they mentioned still have been at the CRA and they might be trusted competition rights that time they don't really know
