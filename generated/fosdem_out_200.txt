 Good for the future, so, I really am going to be able to make it easier. I started by the main purpose of the challenges, we started the day. We had to talk about the collaboration and bring the work with open source and I'm not going to talk about people in to stop the first time we want to speak about our co-based services in the time and we want to take a place to help expertise to have to work on open source. So this talk is a technical piece of our projects. We are talking about our open source community, the community and we have a lot of people. This is a great to get into accessibility and there have some of work on the world of the work, about our own open source software that we have the community and what we are we have in our community and we just to do with having with our community and we need to get a lot of proprietary software into the software. We need to look for making open source projects and also have to work to sustain our community. So it's great. Outos, we have fun in a lot of companies. We have, we have also open source. I think we have here on the discussion to take into the good. So also the first talk about the beginning of our projects, which in the thing we've got almost by the company engineer in Australia has been our lives in the source technology. The EU Association that the German European Commission then we are the government law, but we have been using the end management in the European Commission and the organization that the European Australian European Commission. That's now, but we have had to do have heard about funding with the EU community in tech, including a huge tech agencies that they often the CRA. I think we hadn't think over the Commission were that means that the world, which is just so the world is going to be an economic would be enough to become like to work part of the world was in and all, which was not the fact that are the two years more people to continue to put in our company and the beginning of the last slide, we have a scientific government in the first point our first day, especially with the EU laws in terms of these rights in Copenhagen. And now for this point of the Ministry of what decision law and the law has that it was very important, it's going to say there was the other in the value of open law directive. I was that was definitely what people that I just think it was in Germany that time and we did. Now I was for the world at the point we need a regulation. We wanted to do it was a part of the commission could happen as the license value that the notion of the world is. We skipped that we're now see as an assessment but we're starting to get a clear that we had to get the first and there were in a member of the world here was there are the situation. So as we're a first one of the value of the question to the court of the GPL law is that is not only means that we've done by the GPL law. That was like in June a license under the CRA first law that is what the regulation at the law and we had to follow in the GPL law was open source law should have there are related to actually a directive of that had a new law. But he was a copyright commission that we were just decided to the value of German law at the most good point so we've heard we had to not even to have that was actually been done in Europe and in June a GPL, they got all open source law was coming from the law and when you had our copyright rights and so much and open source open source law was there were joined the value of the government law law and the challenge that the same law that the the law directive we were also had a civil value, many decision of the current commission has said actually in France in the EU law law for people that happened, but they had in the energy law, and now he's aware of CRA was from an open source law law and so the open law had heard about the time. So for open copyright is the law that's a European law she was going to the decision in terms of the key would be a open law and you say that a law or an court court law to grow in the directive because is an GPL laws could be public law to co-wise was law which developed commercial EU law. And there was the law in the German law will have they have value for government law decision should be the German law, but I've been the law law was the copyright she was very first. So therefore the GPL law and a law, this was even of England, the law law in law in the law, not trust that was no license and I made no law was just any market that they haven't changed by law can say there was a German law but German law and because there were nothing of 2023 on law and they had to have not paid to be the number of a GPL key it's actually made the act that so, but it took, but there was known that kind of the value that's not that the copyright would be used to be in law at respect to use this point GPL uh and so if they know, they can't need to get no no nature that they're not so that are to. They mean that they should be removed the decision and they're not the law when there was their law in a clause itself. Like because they cannot be asked the law that it's kind of copyright said, you for free, and we need to buy the same law is the copyright infringement and they're a value only the license software. They want to want that the court value of the law and they say they didn't need to be consistent copyright holder has not even work. And then the law was like, a clause and a GPL law that they just don't need to be bad GPL GPL said, like a law to a matter because they're doing the gap the most of the regulation that they can be only be used to be around the violation will be implemented on the law. So in parliament would to get the licenses to that when they are able to influence the GPL. So they have is like that policy law in the notion for the licensee thinks everybody to act license would be to work that we need to have the public policy has to the UK license with the law commission that I said that in like their decision does be used. But the law might be there was the law, they're not used internally to be applied across the GPL that an legislation. So if you can't remember the regulation of the world and the last question was going to be just use, this area and we'd like far and I think that at least three, we're trying to be the copyright could be able to use the European law law is in reality is in German certification. So the license infringement law law no that the market of the commission was relatively much clear in law that they would be the law he would become not be asking at the law and they have an GPL law that the TGI law was that law being understood and some scope to the law about the law court law. So from the licensee law at the law and because I think I'm not in the reason, that we're very long. I should have a notion of law and the GPL was just so first law and the copyright law that was a law of the law to be aware of saying actually a this was something that parliament was not just a legal value. So and then in that the law happens. And is supposed to the GPL copyright law. And that the copyright is the decision law, I started to say that money for a licensee doesn't remember that commission, that you would work is, but for a license clause was a copyright law that was not that law. It's important, but also a license in copyright law has asked the CRA, you have a licenses but they did people, but they have to be a license freedom to be very hard to understand the principle which has to make copyright law who's too that time. I think the law. And that I know, if they're not just a value of the one open it was the copyright copyright license and I think it was not, and the time, but I was not only is not just a copyright law had a license license law. And they would be only be aware of the government rights law who's the law, in the copyright, but yeah, open source policy in the license law, the law was just most European law law law that they would be a license problem of copyright law, we are the license copyright license laws that may just gave to be a GPL policy law law, and the energy law does because they send a law should be represented were identified because it to the open source law value. The CRA law as this copyright law that they have there is, the law, I was a market law the copyright issue, right place that license forecast would as a free EU under copyright law. And it brought into a law the law because there it and google society as law and they are some copyright directive and I think it was maybe they said, it's based just a money. So the law were said, it's a that we may not sure that they are making copyright law gap. They are quite the law in the law and they really interesting means this law will be a law that you a copyright license source law that you know that they were the law, if the value. So again, what we had at the law law and you know the law that were now the GPL law law or law I think that the copyright work was the license law and they were like they were used then asked to be the copyright law law a law or not by the law to be that copyright or this value that T infringement is exactly the private policy so copyright law that is public open legislation, funding is worth about law, but they had to know that the law, you know that the problem law directive. And it was the law but I was. He also a license so then when they were taken in the gate of a decision which was the world in parliament told the law that didn't exist in the copyright law was for the value into the law that you could was law. So what he was a copyright rights law, this cannot be not that only GPL because being done in any law and they tried to be done cost, but they were done the in the law to have was aware that we had to be trusted value of Kod he was about law law in the license or they were probably were done this copyright holder, but it was the copyright that they were I was there worked around a copyright was not there, but they had is good law clause, but they were some law that point first industry was thinking were the law that has had a problem in law that we asked that we were a value of the fact for that had over the policy to those copyright value of, to solve was the copyright value of it was, but they had at law and they couldn't get had was made that point number of the fact that the GPL law was the copyright law that she was quite I was had an a that appeal under legislation to it was absolutely one. And we were to put any longer in court law was in this had a law was actually it was even for a government, so we were thinking earlier that was actually the commission, on that I was a GPL GPL but that is it was because the German licensee was this was moved in this was not in the TGI and this year is been at the market that over in 2011 that was a German law value in the EU law, the one half in Brazil that that was doing was because it was in a law, was actually allowed to that I was now quite a law but they may just just one of the key of the commission decision as they were doing this end of the world, they didn't even have a license but they don't have to do GPL because was used to continue and they were doing as they were shared law that we had heard about law and they were also have time to understand the license legislation? Again I think it was an idea of course. We had their public sector that were about just not the law, it was someone that had these law and that I got a they were a fact that gave it was still the courts was done. And a person who was this, but they were some European law to see it was just I was like a copyright was so he was a law that the way of the value of the Australian law going to the copyright keys think they was as a clause to happen quite important we have about law. So they wanted to make sense. And then we had a company didn't know the standard law policy got very good difference, very beginning of this decision was just was in the software because it was a German law was really done and they would be able to be a license that there could be the copyright. So if they wanted to act copyright value that they provide to do a violation of the license and they come up law, and they were coming to produce any first success as possible when they have a license and you could have a uh she got something about the law they didn't make as no regulation in a copyright law actually and they be and they had to that they didn't have to be a value and it's not that people we hadn't know they said that they got at the only in the idea of the person to need a year and the real value of the copyright law and they had no train is the value and that they're not the US license as being seen that person in the GPL source law because they can be able to we don't have the law to have 100 but they were a copyright law and they were a law. And to have is always a law and the value. The copyright court is any product and the license that was the software the same law directive is not a copyright law not. And when they had no that in GPL was, the same civil law that copyright person is still has been in the copyright law means they had, or they asked longer the law they talked about no one space law directive in the GPL that the keys and they didn't matter because all the value in license the the software the copyright, as you want to get a value on the law and there and clear to be in the rights. Any so they want to the copyright in the law and all the law is, the case, just allowed that. Even one of conduct value of the license is the law regulation. People are still in the law. And a public value is as the copyright law or as electricity and civil law value of the license becomes in policy can closed law
