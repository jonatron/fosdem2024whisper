 Manuel introduce the lightning Code today I'm going to present this first a social perspective of Go project. So that's a short way. I'm going to go to my work and make it work, especially on how do you happen? So here? It is just going to contribute to us to our own program. And I'm just wondering, doing this session. So we had the, we had the whole project work on doing this. So I'm going to show the first talk. So, my talk I'm going to share our open source. So I'm going to talk about the last talk is my project. Well, I'm going to keep my first talk about today we're going to give feedback for a little bit about how I'm using the community and you today. So, I'm going to focus on the things. Let you back to give you a week, I'm all going to show you in the day of this web in the community, a community. I just going to be in the future, I'm a few questions. I'll introduce the project. So, hello everyone come and to our work in the whole page with the way to go to the whole picture of Code and speak, and I'm just going to start a little bit. And I'm going to present it, I'm going to create a little bit later, not going to introduce the speaker. And then I'm the one. And I'm going to have you for a little bit about it is, I'm going to start. What I'm going to be doing the talk to talk about the last talk. So we will going to be having to talk about us a big talk about when that we have had ideas about the world. So, you're going to go to talk about the two servers. And if I'm going to do I'm going to talk about Code, but I'm going to talk about today, I'm going to talk about the community. And I'm some of years. I'm going to do a little bit about the European Commission in 2023, which is to talk to be here and I'm going to give you. I'm in this talk about the last talk about and talking about the last thing will I am I'm the CEO of this year ago. And I'm going to start my talk about the great? So I'm going to explore the first. I'm going to be here, so we're going to keep thinking about that there here. And I'm wondering, I'm looking at it, that. Okay, we're going to talk about the journey. So I'm going to talk about about this year. So, I'm going to introduce us about the rest of this year ago, I'm going to take me, I think this talk about the next I'm going to find in a few months ago. And I'm going to talk about the end, we talk, when I'm going to talk about the last year, I am looking at the screen and I. But I, for all, we're going to do it's going to start a bit harder to talk about the technical details of the goal of power and I'm going to show you to be introducing the technical, about how I'm going to introduce us to help me about what I'm a little bit of that we start from our hand up and there. I'm going to do we're going to talk about why this at good. So thank I'm going to be happy to speak to come back to OpenJTO of the first time. And we hear what I am. The discussion about some of the question was going to be a very interested in some questions, as I'm going to talk about the talk of this talk about this is a round. So basically I'm going to be a little bit. I'm going to see a bit about the various questions, but I'm thinking about an introduction to finish my last year. My name of his talk about the first talk for the original slides for 20 years ago, and I was, and I'm going to talk about the talk about it we wanted to try to put a bit of project of a day we had some of the last year is some people on the slide about five years ago. I wanted to get the main part of the main idea of the community developer was quite some of the last year and what I'm using the introduction on the original time. Okay on the focus from the team of the Netherlands. These are from the best year to make it and the educational community to start collaboration to the last year we have the year in the DMA and there are the core projects that were those workshops in the internet and standards in the tech agencies as you may have three years. And this is still has been in the first a group will be clear in the EU engineers that we were some first year. So the past year was really important to be the world and the beginning of the public world here was interesting thing you doing was. So we were that the first year before I knew about the year and we had a talk about one of the moment and why are being had been made at the technology. So there are a couple of what we have was the EU institutions were the world was a time. And that has happened to talk about this sort of two countries and so and what we have had had now funded before we had the first decade to understand a year ago so I told you like the second month because we can focus about the other thing, the year we know that were also has been talking to be a good news on the world. So many years ago but I was a lot of the next year but I was a lot of months ago that we had a whole team was a lot of people were to go back to the workshops and I currently a couple of people that. I was very much of features because they were really far and they were not everybody to think as the panel and it was a little bit more often I had that we had both in our people haven't know I said a lot of people all of a few months because people were the first time they not just learned as far years ago we had a few years ago. And I'm going to do a year at the workshops on this year. At the first time. So there had to have had the time to pay people who were doing this was the day and we were able to hear that were the year I haven't made a few people thought that happened as a bad code in the moment because when we were they had a thought we were removed some of people was getting kind of us in the work in was able to be a half there were doing funding to think this and the presentation that was the decision and I think that the people was saying I had said, we had been able to do work that were just had to be a lot of the idea of people were actually had as before and said and happy between good news and they have had had done in the things that was quite clear to do. And then got a few years before we had a good person who, but I was trying to happen. And because for the we had had started the I was very just found we got asked we were using really thinking about us to get there was on and he had to he didn't so there were writing code and he didn't had to get the key to live and he had, so I needed to the end that so we were really had to use it has been just got something like a UK and he's going to keep the fact that was just came up and we were just learned two people to add that we've always have a really a sort of a bit on the TPM before before had a thing that was just had the parliament before were just started doing it was I had to stop the copyright when this new companies who would have to say we were people in the group and we had tried to get that we had to have the kind of the big in the same time I had a long time. So I took something that was like it was also was the license in the license all their keys out of the of the TPM and it was the value. So yeah, the TPM had, I was the way we had people that. He was really been really wondering. And first two came out that I was very surprised that was just had made I was actually, but I was in the history of a bit of the best person were going to update had a TPM we had an issue that was the had a company that had some way to get a key was only kind of the keys were a public keys in the policy to have was in the key was that was an exception and the res holder made a key was that possible but they were something called was being used.6 and were a public keys only so in the signature of the way we were to know, but that they had a moment the TPM right and they were the TPM, but they knew that they did this was this TPM, they were started working at of the key, well was just wasn't a TPM. And that we had a TPM and he would do TPM was just have got to the TPM because it would even know of the only one of the keys were very important to be called the key key ring and so the TPM were the TPM and was not actually, so that was not just given that there was they did in the TPM that was that was quite a security to the kernel was the key keys were even the key, but they didn't have actually need to some keys were very clearly were the TPM values in key clock and they were just allow us to have to basically written in the TPM to be part of the TPM, in TPM of the keyPM, we were basically had to be written out the TPM so and the event key line of the keys were just using root key keys and just a message history was in the TPM to actually having this at the keys of TPM could be even get it. And then he was developed into the TPM will just doesn't want to the TPM has worked as I don't have a way I didn't have a key of the TPM was going to a given TPM on TPM was an the TPM went into that actually the keys in the TPMPM system were doing keys were because you could not doing the keyPM the TPM soPM is connected were also included some of people were trying to thePM and the TPM were deprecated were a TPM uses wasn't that would be able to just because you could be as the keys, right key that it has it would see effectively kind of a PCR keys was just could be one key and then for TPM keys are using that are used to manage to do that in in the TPM and use has all the keys. But I said a TPM works basically that a TPM changed by encryptionPM to the key key point of the kernel so many uh keys only is that they were added key but signed in the TPM works and from TPM key keys were really important and TPM is to do inPM. So it was the TPM before we wanted to do the TPMPM was using TPM called TPM before were the kernelPM and it was the key keys and then were a TPM and so he actually was usually it was just a key to this was a key keys. It was just kind of an PCRPM of the key but really a TPM that a key was allowed a TPM key keys were mostly in actually a TPM because I do you can come back into it's a TPM which was still just a TPM and had a while the kernel TPMPM that they were doing that actually just allowed to boot it as new key, they were doing it really, the TPM for the TPM stuff that we were just had this kind of thePM would be maintained to work on to get from's all the key authority and back to the keys to the key to the keys. So that's what the key sets from the TPM was TPM is being trusted TPM and a TPM keys in TPM that was given it was T kernelPM in TPM would the keys needed to TPM and was just to TPM toPM had to sort of TPM space were of concept that were a keys has no key key keyPM stuff that were actually had keys were done had and was that were not really done completely just actually trying to kind of the information and what's really could actually is required to have. But the TPM of got had to the TPM was just means that we had to put in from TPMs used in OpenPM key was actually started working anPM was sort of the key and we were used to actually were using if the TPM. And it was just provided by the a TPM got a keyPM was got that at in a key keyPM PCR is a system all of TPM. So TPM went back were for the the key space itself were added to the TPM were to the TPM for the TPMPMPM of what TPM of the TPM system has no of the TPM was I didn't been copied work been extended keys was also the TPM and were originally got over the keyPM just so it's the key format and were also useful to the TPMPM TPM encryption so in was connected to keys that were actually was the TPM in the kernel keys of the TPM had to the TPM uh could just signed a TPM license key keys that it was TPM policyPMPM in the TPM, you would I could really know and the TPM point that were originally were that they were no disk TPM was back and they were a TPM was getting this TPM keys are not because they had happened in keys and they didn't had a TPM key with and they haven't work all were TPM, so you still got another keys were just had the keys were created a TPM that at had in the TPMPM keys TPM were that was actually had well were then was in and were effectively workingPM so TPMPM kernelPM and had that TPM process has got TPM TPM DPM wasn't the TPM is a TPM have just that we could be at the keyPM is basically has only TPM was the TPM is no keyPM key was known that was used in actually to get all of that this key keys so boot before TPM TPM 2 keyPM key since the TPM couldn't and was launched keys to being basically using UPM and actually and I wouldn't get
