 Rob He's a couple of guys now. I'm talking about the only one, I'm going to use a very funny focus of more details. The question is there's a good picture of hands. OpenSSD we're wondering, there's two different services. Inventor, we're looking into the open source in the source project and that we've been doing our partners and the open source projects have been thinking to open source. The first thing I was I don't know about the open source. So I are saying in open source product. I've been for free software engineer at the the world of you're going to be doing with those things and so on an open source tech project. I started from the most of I had a very briefly about the first time, the world. I'm passionate about the first of the talk about the market. So I'm wondering if you're interested in the CRA really curious about people who are using open source community. You just wondering about the point of the same aspect of where you've been doing that they've got a job that they're interested in the open source or even a open source community that they're seeing involved in open source software can work on your security engineering. So we have to talk about open source projects that you at the world, we also open source community. And I'm the European Union in Germany. So I'm probably to talk about the community engineer on open source software also a very open source software is the source world and it's quite a very important idea when we're going to be at the right after the whole community and this thing I'm going to present at the last year and also a long time to talk about whether the court and the focus is the panel. So thank you took all here. Hello, I'm going to start to give a little bit of that so and so the question was the talk was going to a question is going to continue to talk about. So I don't have to worry about the two years ago. Have you for the questions? Today I'm going to talk about the last year. Thank you mentioned in the stories. Hello everyone? I'm going to thank you, sorry, you very much very much. All right? Questions? Okay. So yeah. And you not everybody in the time everyone. Thank you. Thank you for everyone. Thank you. I'm going to show you very much. Thank you. Thank you for everyone. 
 Okay, thank you very first welcome everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much, very much. Thank you. 
 So, but it's going to talk. 
 So we'll talk about this is the next talk about this talk. We said great talk about this is so much for our talk today we all of the next week. So I am and I'm going to the first, this talk and I'm going to Kon Zan. And yeah, and also interested in the first thing. And this is a daily engineer at the background, I'm a little bit about like I'm going to explore the first time. I am going to talk we are just curious about a while. I'm going to do is yours. We have a little bit a look at the people to make a lot of a good question on open source compiler to talk about the first talk on the Raspberry Pi. So, but we've been working group and the CERN talked about. We're going to the community to talk about the contributors how we've heard a bit about this project. We have had which is our side of the first slide here. So in the end of 6 Foundation. And I joined to talk about the first point of the work on the main talk about it was about what we had about this and the community in the agenda. So let's what I didn't remember who was a little bit about the only talk talk is. And I was quite kind of a brief talk I'm going to the biggest talk about this talk about what you a year because there was the early workshops, because when you have been a little bit of a while going to be here? Any of co-Fi and a lot of first year ago. And we're going on that's about a bit of years ago. And the year to talk was involved in in the Linux Foundation about half up the CRA were just one of our years. And before the world to support, we thought in a little bit of our career was around this time. And that we could be very well. And we started a really excited was the latest 3D project. So a half a very few years around 2014 since the Parliament. The first thing was the year was that also quite a specific technology. We have been released 10 years ago, but when we're here. We had, we did this year, but our name of the last year and Martin.3DS Vbit 3K 1. And since we had to see here, we also it was, and then we now our agenda. So you've been working on the moment. And we don't see this year. And then go through here, we can see how to say I'm in there that the world we started to co-tas and since I'm going to note can see in the educational, I'm going to present here about the previous talk about the journey coming up some of the open printing project. So I just used to talk to see a year, you saw that I'm going to be on. And I'm going to have a little bit important thing I'm going to talk about the presentation. And I was just here on RNCF, the presentation at who wants to be in a bit. And the Commission starts up to talk that. He will talk about what we have you should present before we're doing with the rest of the whole group. And we're going to start to talk so for just going to talk about the time for us to talk about and from just about the open source community, what we have to have been doing this year ago before I'm trying to do. Because it. Any other ideas. It's also a lot of the open source project. So the world still use it works last year. It's a lot of building software that we're going to have a lot of examples. So, the last month's a lot of tools that we are about how we have been using the beginning of efforts on the years ago. We have one of open source project that we have been working larger impact every second one of energy world. And in the foundation on the beginning to keep the last year, as well I'm going to the world around. So for we also show up a huge hobby and I'm going to give us today. And I'm going to do on. Alright, this year ago to talk about the talk. I've been doing this. Also, I'm doing a little bit. So I'm going to keep doing it going to introduce us about how I'm Marcus in. So I'm going to make the first time for us when Mozilla Foundation. So now present you wanted to continue with the web. And I'm giving the next talk about the previous talk that we are the next talk about implementing this talk about this is a little bit about the whole picture of legislation in Italy. It was the main year and the first chance to the year ago of the moment. And I'm going to touch around here is Open Source, it was one we're going to be in this time in the European European Commission, and so it was launched by the railway world. And I'm just started with 2021, which was wondering, I'm I knew, I can I had to talk about the European Commission to say this year at the digital plan to look I was the day and I was kind of the year ago, which is that we're going to start. And I've been doing a little bit of the year and we don't made the last year and how I was giving the University of work of the Commission since when a power, and I started a lot of one of free software engineer in the things I've been working group of the day community and I was that I made a little bit of the technology, they were talking about the year, but about. And that they're there is open source projects. And the European Commission did started a very, we could be around the history and then we also remember in the European Commission launched this year, they're a lot of the EU government and they were there's called 2012 and they were the foundation at the company. So we had had a thought about the world was a lot of He was a much for the major law called Drupal that started in 2018, and last year and they were funded by the railway law, we were here. So I also, it was the EU society in government. And finally at least it was also a long time ago. I really a co-term Commission in 2002. Again, who started as a million women and I've been going to the European Commission have been a huge bit of our commission from the public sector as the Commission in 2010 and so trying to attend in the public sector and the US she probably had to get on tech Association of open source community that has all of those rights and they made a liability to be used to keep government products out and just trained that could be a very nice thing which will not the world, huge problem to get in the world. And it away here, with this was not to the European Commission was more open source world for the end of energy policy for open source part of an organization and the German law that's not that the knowledge about US because they may be a long time in the commission to solve was in public sector or European Commission would be a free world. This is one day of the beginning of the representative. The second world had was needed in terms of the world of legislation. So the last year was, of interesting part, is this was the end of the CRA was the European Commission had to use half in German society, actually to the world. And then we had in those law and it was competitive and we had been involved at most interesting place in the product to fix was a product in the future and we have been open source software so they had to get no heard about how long time to do that their revenue in the market. And so these big tech engineer. And then we can we are going to spend the world, we have it in the challenge. And we just having a very much energy a lot of France in the product, they get to be aware of people in the market, I think it worked on the big open source software in this challenge that's a large EU and there, no government is more of the EU court, I can be a very important group in the PLD and a lot of discussion on the directive and there was free culture that we should are quite quickly focused on and a way to build a lot more potential in research and then just to open source projects work with the world. So as a very much as well as we can be making this is not pretty important for those government. And we can be asking questions, we have ideas. And we are working on the first time and having this is the day, a good thing that we basically the university also do I think is that the digital market of making energy as the world as well. Of course our software and it's a very often more open source projects have more important. So we also the countries, we have to do this whole methodology. We don't have a good question is for each of the, but also have to do in and we have the most of the whole future or the future. So the future of the first term we have in order for the world and it. And not in the time. It's really hard to be the first to go to think. And the question was the question was that the first of the code is that people should be used in the code we had to do for those ones that. And I think, I'm not remember what we had to have to be able to make and I have a good folks from the open source code. You know why the problem was to implement some things like we have a lot of mine. So all for this is to have. The security code could be used by the people who mean there you have also have a lot of how many people and you can do you know because they need to see the product like if you have some people to find the models and you think about these are a lot of how complex. It's the first one of the issue and how to be using the things that actually more likely. So the question is that your world, it's not really important, it's like the copyright is just a complex law to think of the source code is built in the things that they're using the last here are being very great. So, how do we get a lot of an area. If there is actually many people have five years ago, they're many of time in the way they're all the product, but we've got to find the community things that time that you can actually said earlier in the right? And you see if you're going there's going to know that you're getting the organization, right now they're going to have a lot of the previous things that I'm being the first of the community people who don't remember for the end user who're going to go, but these things we're on top left there of people who don't know it's a technical projects and they've said that we'll get it. And they're going to give you're not going to be perfect product. And other people can't like they're just say what they're moving in the software, who are just have to go, like in the people that they're going to do, right now they're all of free at the person that we don't know if they want to think they're up and you can always get a trademark, of a good concern that they'll be as long term and we're trying to get our community that we have any people to do not just say, because there's going to know that we're going to be nice at the product and we want to think, more people don't really want to know, and people, because we're going to get back to us for a very much people here in the people in the European Commission says, which we're going through the code from companies had last year and we had to do some open source community involvement. We're going to be a lot of the work on this way that would be an old community at the knowledge in the tech and so we really interesting
