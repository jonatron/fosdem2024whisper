 Data researchers a great way to start with a whole lot of stuff. And I have about the kind of like a lot of things that and I was wondering in the end-dem-Fi as far. So that's what I didn't give the one is to use that. I don't have to the day and I can show a lot of people is also doing to make something of things around and as well. And I was wondering about people here was I've got a lot of get somebody else. And as a little bit different two to the details about this is what is a lot of it a good job that we've always were doing. So I was thinking about how it was just wondering when you're trying to see like a lot of things to do it for the past and that you're thinking and I'm going to try and get a lot of people have to show you the question of folks who've got to do it at that right so much the question about is first thing that so I'm going to show you the talk about how I was talking about putting this and why we have to kind of got to have and how to turn it and then a lot of technical information and we can actually do we can set up the time we could do it and at going to share it's going to get this but there's a lot of a quick picture of other platforms and the most of the people are a lot of software that you can have heard about us and the source code to develop ecosystem a lot of the communities that we dojo and how the work on these and we do you can do we have time right session of our community they can make sense and as well yeah first care about a lot of these but we have to know when we have been involved with that are these issues and we want us open source projects around and we have a little bit about that I'm able to think is more important to do we need a lot of a bit of people we want to think about accessibility because we have this we have the people in the question for you know this like we also don't say that we want to ask you have we got a summary of like the I have to work and how you know things to keep and one thing that helps you can do we can just like I know about new community and so you know where we have more people I want to spend to support and we know how we want to use a lot of a lot of community issues. And so we want to look better at the question we focus on the things that we have to have a day and we have a few, and we're not been doing open source code issues for us on the time. We are going to stay in our community and we are going to have another aspect that are planning us in terms of research so we are there's very important to do some kind of the Drupal that we don't have to build a lot of a lot of ways to take over to basically really a bit more common product and even better people that the future and they're not want to see what we care of people, how to be to do we just want to do you know. So we're going to think about the person for the end the community we have to follow of these policies, those who have the documentation that we have been using the commission on the public software. And the PLin have all the best problem that we've been based on the first tech world we've got in this area that we had been doing those laws that are building and how we also the software. And there's where we've been talking about our society we've been here, which I hadn't know exactly all the product, as well, the product foundation for people and it's going on and that we're very tight to make some organizations that we know about the product as far as well. But I said we've got all of you know what we've been seeing. And we're going to do they're looking at the challenges, we're going to mean, for you might be a nonprofit model in the main research. We're going to we're going to do. Let's going to talk about the years before there's try to be the presentation. And if you're going to make the panel. And when you're seeing like having a good people come up. And the first thing, just give to be a little bit of what's now we thought of what is basically we have been doing when someone which is that everybody's easy to say that was just get back to that. And it's just about all this thing is like hey, if you know the community, we're gonna have ideas about how we have to be able to have five together. And I think I'm trying to work with the only way to look at hand so we've got multiple developers, you know more people in the community source software community, like and we have a few people can. I think we've not for the people who has been talking about like to have looked at least as well, but I've kind of the time. I'm just to get a bit more questions, but the good to jump to be talking to everyone who is just talked about people in the question. I'm kind of the one very good and I'm talking about, but I'm getting paid for the question. I'm hoping that. I'm going to talk, folks who have any questions, a question for example. And I'm looking at my question. I'm not wondering. I'm your questions at this. How could we have one. I'm going to wait, do you, maybe one. And I'm going to be going to do the project. When it's yours to be a good place to discuss about the start things, I'm going on the majority of the real time for the question. We have one of the work on our question because we're going to do we're trying to do we're trying to do it to make any questions like in the folks and I'm going to use and excited about our requirements, with open source software. Some of the real time that the largest product that we're the world we should be able to get the whole way we have been working on NGI team and now. So our customers, first year. We're going to manage the world. We're having a lot of a lot of efforts, at what's definitely the process and I'm able to have been working with open source and we all these technologies to get the project and digital projects, in the OpenJDKOSDEM. And also in the tools and we have also have a time to have some years world of the product and we know that we don't need. So, we're talking about Open Source were going to think about research community and so many people are looking at the communities that, we've been on our organizations who have a world at the standard and the open source community and then the product. And we're going to look at the open source website. We need to have a big product space that we were doing the WordPress community to do. And the project, you know the community just making in that we have been running a company also have a long time, right day when we'll come in the end the world, we'll go to keep the first excited to support funding in the big one that we started into the project. We've got the latest version of what we have actually have to make it. We've got this our vision of our future as a lot of the first one of the world is doing the community? We're going to talk to have the lives of open source and we have been back to make a few years, so we have our software that we're talking to work in here in the digital community engineering technology and we have the challenge that was just about their science work on the digital sovereignty, and we had to bring new software, really do our community and very few years ago, is like, we have been doing data and the moment. We're very much in the most important thing that we've been doing with our community. And that we have got our first decade ago. We've had to worry about 10 years ago, and then I'll see here for the last year to look at that we're going to focus on the point that we come in the European Union from that we have a year's going back to be talking about the commission. We're going to find up at our projects in the companies know who are the world. At the European Union funded by 2020 and we had a years ago. We're not going to invest into our world for a lot of open source world and also learned from the day of people that we're going on the foundation. And the last year we'll keep a million times we get less recently. We're looking at the time. We have this year, we have to start when we have to be able to be here to know what we need to have to do. We're like all the end of that we're going to see all this. We're thinking about an opportunity to have a much. And our curriculum, we're going to have been really want to be working on the PLD. And the community to work on the US world. There's a lot of the EU Act. So we think about a community society science project of people. And also think a long time and we've got at some years, we already have a big members. And we're going to do you for us into the PLD because they talk to happen. And there's kind of those workshops, they are a few of have something a co-by-onejo. So, we're going to tell a social infrastructure of people about the whole project. We're going to hire a lot of this about funding, every week. And the world. The outcome that was going to be a new world. And for a very well, no, we're going to achieve the last year. And so we've got the first, we have our second have been using the left side of these are over there. As I was a little bit of the full level of contributors and we've seen today. So I'm going to show you're going to be talking about a long time, so I'm going to just wondering about all about the open source projects. And we're going to be talking to have a brief introduction to be a very tricky thing I've had to this, probably about the most important project, if you know, why is that you're doing work with the way of the rest of the folks in the community, we're going to go into the context. So we're going to discuss about, the software, we're going to make a lot of good product managers, the beginning of people are that we're going to know, how but in the world, they're going to have to do we have the product. I've got the communities and come to be there's going to read to do we're going to get in many people, so that. And so we're talking about the first as a lot of the world. It was just kind of the right? So we've seen what we've been trying to make sure I'm doing, all love to make our company coming in the open source project that people who want to continue up as a new community of the developers who also have to find the people. It's sort of people who said, like, because the things we've got was in the world, well, we've got a tool that we're seeing the project, because I heard about they're going to make a lot of the community that we've been doing an hour and they're living in the place in the community into the work to make the person about the Commission and they haven't I'm really looked into the whole projects know and the community. It's where people that you know where they're going to make the person who's kind of people don't got into what someone who have and you know. And this is about the people that you know, you saw in terms of a clear. And I'm going to kind of thing about the moment. And I think, really excited, I'm going to talk about the last year, so we are any of various people who are going to do you know the product that we're going to really said, we're going to look at all that they're working on the community, right, we can be going to do an open source project in the moment. And if they're trying to know, right? It's going to make all of people get into people that we're going to get to like, we like that they're going to keep and we want to going to have been looking to do a decision to start to have to be any people to become it like they're like a strong-to-time and it. So the question. So we get it's a lot of the open source community's important to automate them to be cool. It's just a lot of people, but the, it's always a lot of people. In the goal that's the same thing that this. They want to do that means there's not open source software that they're from the answer that they're even more of our community. And that we have gone into this project, you know that we have been doing just just wanted to have a lot of a lot of things. We've got in a lot of friends for that we're looking at the moment. We can start the person I don't worry about the last year ago, that we're planning between the things and so we're going to get to check out the people happy to be here. Some people who are talking about today, coming the talk to know that we're going to come back into us here. 
 And I am I'm just wondering about an introduction about the next lightning talk to Jupy in the panel. I'm going to Stefimplementer. I'm just wondering, but in Italy. And a little bit of people here today and the most of the talk is an ongoing energy and He has been doing good idea to talk. Also, I'm wondering. I'm going to talk to talk about all, I'm going to Daniel and what's going to talk about you, we're going to give you about how I'm going to talk about accessibility, what I'm going to be curious in the maintenance right now we're going to fill in open source projects in general and open source community and open source, so much of work. And I'm going to a lot of what I get into the projects, speaking of things in the community. My job is about the day. And I'm going
