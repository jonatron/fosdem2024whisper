 Thank you for the next talk about a little bit more about. So this means I think for that. This is the future in the whole thing that this is what I have is a question to do to talk about it but it. I have been doing a lot of the future. This is not a little bit of which is where you go back to this one. So this is up around the work which is the whole thing. It is basically how you need to go to give you a step and then just to see how you're going to be a while you're writing for it's like you're going to be interested in the result that right now you're using the user right, right? So I'm going to be going to talk about this next step. We're going to run it and the next step. I'm going to have this and then you might be kind of a look like an object and then you need to have this to explain the user code you how you're going to be able to get the stack request to be able to just a bit of a result that is having a bit more but it's going to look at the code and how we talked about that we're going to come to the result might not be the user of the memory and that we don't have the code base server and we decided to be going to do it's going to give us basically the right hand this and how we have the page in a lot of our kind of code we've heard that we're going to do we need to say it's going to go back to the configuration file. And after us, okay and we have to get and we're going to these sorts of the stack we need to remember it's what we're going to have to add to do and any other problems with us having some of a single address and you know. So I'm going to have to modify the user space in the code that we have to fill up to call the request. So I'm not going to the first one point of the next part of the point here and an API that I've got a quick demo because the way we're going to go to have a more often doing the future that we're going to go to look at our application to the prompt in the cluster because we work we're going to use the same API is going to build our service in the whole user is going to be able to be available in the API but there's the best to know what the source code should be a tooling user. We actually very quick note. But there are the API we know, but I'm currently working on the answer. It's in the API. And if we are the cloud and if any time, if we're doing this was not going to be possible to mean, we need to get the services. We want to do the thing we want to do have to build it for this, we need to try to have to build the way to have a client ready, which would be an agent and all the network to be integrated into your server and we are usually do the server now is already talking about it because I want to do it's not have to get to do it in the server that in the server for the server. But on this. It's a mail. And then the server to client is fine. So going to the server. And the server and you want to start this server encryption the server to get to connect to share the mail to the server and we are there that I just can follow the server or just need. So the server server server. So you can click on and it on the server, and then I want to have this server to enter your client. 
 So my questions, I'm going to talk about my server. Okay. So the server will be the server. Sorry, I'm just wanted to your server to share the email. Thank you. I'm going to introduce a session. I'm going to talk at the demo. Hi everyone. I'm going to Thank you. I'm going to give you for the server. Thank you talking about this room. So, so I'm going to present here, I am going to talk about accessibility. My name of the client side. I'm going to be happy to present you for moving to sort of time for the demo. So I'm going to show, I'm all we have a lightning talk about the battery. So I'm going to present it's going to work to talk to show you to run GitHub-end data to talk about the web server. So I'm going to speak to talk about the other applications to talk about people, how I'll going to thank you to try to help us and do you. Thank you. Hello everyone. Thank you already have over time to start to give you for us to today. Thank you everyone. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you everybody. 
 Okay. Thank you. Thank you for everyone. 
 Okay, thank you. I'm so thanks for all talk. So thank you. 
 So, thank you, thank you very much. Okay. So yours. Thank you that everybody. Thank you. I'm, thank you. First of being we welcome to talk at Fos. So thank you. My name is yours. Thank you very much, let me. 
 Hello everyone. My name we have a little bit of microservice for the slide of my kids. I'm talking about it. Hello everybody. Thank you very much, who are present you. 
 Thank you see we today. I'm going to talk about the agenda for those first open source engineer. I'm pretty much. My name is Open Science and I'm going to a little introduction about what I'm a little bit in the first one of all for the day, I'm a lightning talk about the organizers for the company from our talk we have So we have this panel. So thank you for our first talk, I'm being doing so much Hello everybody. 
 All right. I'm going to Daniel. And I'm just going to talk about the past three years, but I'm one of a little day at the first time. And I'm going to present a little bit about the left. Thank you in the moment to let's going to be going on the talk about to start? Any questions? What I'm going to talk is when I'm a talk about the first time. I'm going to is going to keep going to present to talk about one of Code which we're all talking about a month. We have a little bit about the talks. So, we're going into Open Source's a talk about the challenges of two years trying to help you're building new audience for a question. We're talking about the software engineer. We're here. We have to talk about the one of the EU Foundation. Some of the PLD engineer. And since Researchter is the commission are also, the CRA as well, I'm already, which are part of the Ministry of people. We have is, or the first time. So we have a great talk that we're going to engage with the European Commission. We have an European European Commission for open research group across electricity and a large tech open science. We are also have done by the Swiss Commission and electricity practices as possible in the world. And the world, we are very great talk about a lot of energy world in open source institutions that is actually be open to the impact of funding to be part of open source projects. And that we have then present in the digital project. So they are the right now we're trying to have to present we're going to do our first last year, we are now the open standards in the ones that we have about the researchers from and focusing on and so we are open source community. We are we are in the open source and the ecosystem policy are going to facilitate a different communities that we start working at the beginning of the Drupal and we're going to do. That's what he's important to provide the world, the CEO of the last year, the FOSI and we have been working with European Commission, I'm not going to be talking about to we're going to talk about open source as long time for his industry as we have been integrating the world and we've been thinking about any of the discussion about the, was from the world lead and we have a couple of their government planning group in the product. So when we spent a lot of the Commission in the tech and AI. So we are going to engage was just going to be part of our years until we need to work on a good and provide our world. So we're going to look at the best place is about the work and technical companies and the first thing that had to be a good to share our community in our society. The first year we are just made a bit of being mentioned before the last year we have the year. We have asked them together with it in a year in this month, so that the technical field of the commission who were really can also kind of our year to have the last year. And we have to break off from the freedom of people that we have asked what we're going to ask this to do and then they just gave us to get this. So we're going to talk about our goal here is how much over. I think this panel who's going to be the Drupal Initiative, so that we're going to talk about funding open source community that we'll be able to take around to all the work at the people who did have a lot of the foundation. And we don't have ideas, but we had a little bit about the people to overcome our work on. So we have some people to be really really a lot of users to come in the panel. And we need to do our government fund our first technology that we want to do a very important, we have the product, we want to share with the things on the government. So there, that we have a public sector and we would be able to make a lot of course to do. So we have any EuropeanSF, well, we're using open source, we are just a regulation and we don't have any CRA. We need to build the way to set of the parliament to our first of our problems out our licenses yet. What we know that we're probably took the rights? I don't follow up to be able to go further ado in some time a focus on. And so much more questions, we are we're going to show more questions, I'm very much in the value of the end of the other side but we're going to continue to show up in terms of this is the foundation. The main reason we have to merge it's the developers that a pathway to be the whole way to be often a longer and the world. So, if you know that's the commission. So you know, the room. And if you can see a very good thing to have a very important solution to work at the world, we're going to do is we're going to be thinking about the CRA, in a small world to be here. I want to get the world. And it's more great. First of the good question was it even in November so that I'm going to say that we're going to be tired. And the beginning of the CRA and I was that we can we had a while we said, you can see. And then we're going to have colleagues all the Netherlands. So we want to make sure. It was saying we have some questions. So we're going to do we just have like that we have time to be talking about energy. Of course, we're wondering, was working with this. So this, we have our society is Martin with the Foundation. It's from a researcher and Martin. We are trying to start coding sector. And if we have your radar. You get this one of the things that this like to look at the room. And you'd love a good to do. We have to explain what we're the energy and happy to think we're going to accept, we've had to make an open source community and funding to think that we need to be able to be great, and talking about the software. And they're going to have to come into the fact that we've worked and everybody. And the past and we're going to get. I said, we're going to talk about this is, with the number of the most of people have been talking about the year because we have included in terms of community in terms of course. We're going to be able to be on a small people to have time and we're going to do. We're going to get it's some of time and then we come to have our resources, we have that are good. The second speaker was, who has been done as a company. We're going to be telling Outreachy a lot of the most happy with it. We're doing the last year, I'm going to discuss about it. We're going to find our users. And we've got, we're going to share to be talking about work with all of requirements that we have forgotten to keep working on our communities. We're going to say, but we're going to have around the moment. We're going to be the world doing about the things. And it's not necessarily really good open source community. And we've ever trying to be able to be going to really, we want to share our community, we're happy to feel at the good. We're going to make sure that we're going to present a few people going to our community. We're going to welcome to be talking to be looking to join our product and getting the open source community. My first project is the community, we'll be just wondering, which is going to be in our discussion. And I'm going to get started talking about a little bit less energy? I'll see a few words of the community and talk we've now. One of what we're going to talk to keep running the world. We're going to talk about our years ago, we are writing a long time from the quality of the software. And we're going to bring us to us today, and we're going to come throughout our work on the company and we've had to come to come here and to worry about. We're the AI systems in a lot of the community. It's, not going to one in the science and what we have and community and if we talked about what's going to be talking about actually going to discuss
