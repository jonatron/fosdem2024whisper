 My name is RISCAC, by calling the top of the top of WAC. Even in Wazb2, I'm just wondering when you need one that, which is the RISC-bombs, I'm going to talk about all of the code-based C++ feature, which is effectively a simplified the C++. So we also added another big bunch of variants of pages. Before I'm going to do this. I'm going to talk about that. I'm going to end a feature base of Go, actually going to talk about a little bit to talk about code stack, and the Python code. So, I'm going to be talking about Rust, you to generate DIT and C++ code, but it's going to talk about a little bit about the code that I'm going to happen. So this is C state you're going to be going to see out how we're going to go there, we can see some little bit of you're the memory from one-site. So this is a Python software. So it's a few words, that I'm going to be going to be putting this analysis in a small project that you have a lot, right? What I'm going to do we want to see a few years ago, like that I will be going to look back. I'm going to it's going to have to be going to be sending to be Riki? First of the idea of the C++ code that, the end of it's going to do. And I don't know what I'm going to have, but we have it's about us going to be going to talk to have a lot of what we've been thinking about the description. And then here is going to do I'm going to give him. And I don't going to work in the project since it's going to be a presentation, and the job and it has a very important. And the first one of the most, we've got this one of the first seven months ago. I'm going? So what we've got to talk about the first step of the first one we get in the idea of the things on the compiler version of a good people, but we're going to tell us, let me about the new code, the code, what's say that we just the one here? It's talk. And because we're going to see that's going to go down. It's got this is the current state of the code and where I'm going to be in this is happening, I'm going to be open source code really happy to kind of the version of a little bit more one after the open source code for the first. And if you're going to bring it. And for those were doing that was going to start by the whole thing I was kind of a lot of the one of code, so they're going to work and then we've been doing, which I had to have this table, the number of the number of this is going to add. So you're going to tell you can be looking for the dependencies of object, there and so like the code. And then you kind of those models that you can be the code that we need that happen in Kubernetes, the source code model is the structure, what you can we want to work with the values like this kind of code, with the question, right? And for example, if you have some of like it's going to be in the compiler. It's kind of that's like, I have a Python and so it's not quite, it's very important. So, but it's going to have also important, the other types of one of the model, you can we want to talk to define a number of what we're going to be the library, right, and this way to do we will need to keep track the right? So what the right? Well, like now we're going to mean, okay, you can we've, go to come to go to go back in, because it's an application's a lot of the app level of stuff from the end of people, we've got a very excited about the application. Because, it's how to just like a table, it's probably going to do, we do we found because it's going to do we have different things that in the issues that we have been working with it, we need to look at this, so we're doing this point, the things are very useful. We're trying to think that we're getting more expensive here. And of my first thing that I was we're doing that is going to get into what we're doing that we have. We've been doing is, we have to say, but we'll have an application there. So you need to go to explain the web world. I said, I would like, yeah, I'm going to the open source code and I'm going to do. So I want to talk to go back to get the project and look a little bit less in the project on. So I'm going to go to come up here and share that there that. I mean, so easy to be a lot of the projects. Okay, I'm going to talk. I'm going to bring a bit of questions until the years and last year, I've been working on our community, so I just wanted to talk mostly start a positive stuff in the most at this year. So, I'll see. And I'm here for the day that. And I'm going to thank you, trying to talk. Thank you for everyone very much. I'm in the first of the love to me. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you very much.

 Thank you very much today. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. So next talk for the I have a second talk to give some last talk, so I'm using the first part of course. I'm a while. My name is the first year. Code. I'm really the next talk, and also a bit about the speaker? And today. I'm CDS. I'm a little bit about the VAP since we started to talk as, the next talk is that got talking about the very much. We like an end, but I'm a talk about the last one side. I'm getting the next year and I'm very happy to present a presentation about CERN using, which is going to the Oema. We have a live in the JVM one year. The first one is about FOSDEM by the ULB to present the last one of the first part of a new version of the web. We've been using Airflow is for the Goh, you're going to generate the WebSocket device. And I'm going to talk to be an hour of my career, so I'm just to be done with all the speakers. I am working on the next year, and I with the first time I'm just wondering about the web browser. We have a lot of being the WebGLP and we have an open source project and the details around the WebS. It's the end. The other part of the last year, I was a senior community, there were the name is the work here. Does it was a bit. The community of the CERN. My name was the University of the moment I also released only because they took the front-imuth and there were that we had a new feature. And the year we did I was told the web project of the things. I didn't know I didn't think that to get a couple of what happened the front end was to the community that I was in the first year really got to do. But the product in the foundation are the people trying to get a lot of the project was essentially I was created by 20 years ago, but we need to get started to the people. We had to have been open source projects and I can even this to be the last year. We're going to talk about where they had no way to be the ones in general and I'm talking about us as part of it were getting. It was that I have been in the project. I'm not a little bit and in there are the world since the last year was the project. The first slide is the last year ago. We have been working on the parliament was a three years ago and there's the Drupal project was a year, maybe the European Commission were a big companies who had seen to be on that. So I ended up to be in 2016's talk was just wondering and the lead to understand the last year and actually the long as good thing that you was a lot of legislation because it was wondering, had a lot of things were used in Europe and I was just heard a lot of months to be an hour last year. So from there were like I was really was actually saying a long time ago, right now I was all the University was very quickly to be at the parliament before they had and they had a software engineer. And I was the world like everybody was like I had that came to be thought. And so basically went into an open source law was like I was a good staff he would like a, like for the reasons. I ended this and they see the world of the Netherlands and that the CRA was a law. And so you went to tell you could be the first of the commission is actually, which were just one really a directive and so this was in there was the years and these many people who did was some people were two months to know we took that were on the CRA and that was quite part and the I was the beginning of a lot of the world who had the European Commission wasn't going to really surprised about the law and so far was thinking a European Parliament and then we have a lot of the commissionas here and why we were here on the parliament and for the commission we have moved through the beginning of the market directive which was the moment of the EU and the EU court and decided we don't know that is a lot of what happened to open source law didn't want to be really have to keep the copyright infringement and the court law and trying to be the fact that she was in this clause that he was not a paid to be changed. I was one to be able to be an amazingly heard of copyright policy was the same law in June 20 years after the open source law so just in France and she knows about the court I'm just wondering which has a that everybody standing into laws as possible. And I think some question, the commission is these laws in the sector. And the women who were mostly talked about a co-source law of the way so they were from and they've worked in the people and I think there are not one of the commission who were not people were only to volunteer directive. So with the copyright so we had but we have to think they were really think so right two weeks ago and I just even asked by the person for people are a member of open the directive and they were the copyrightability and they can do get the law, but they had to know what that they were doing else to open source policy for the value they're going to do we had often have been spending a value of the commission and they asked the most recent other companies are a value of the software and they got their copyright law. They ran back up the policy there were always out of the political and then the legislation I think you were a law and they were in there were just it was no law to understand something that was a value directive and they had to find because a law that the copyright and the copyright was still the courts is the key as the court she knew that this also been were quite interesting to always no no bad license value of any rights they know that they found something that person in like they're also used it was a way that it could be something and the parliament to get the copyright copyright had
