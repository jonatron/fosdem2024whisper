 My name of the PLM. You can run a new piece of an E-workers and it's quite challenging for a scientific thing that was to help you about accessibility in energy. We still provide a product to make the European EU has been paid for the commission and what they gave us a bit on-based projects to get committed to people to get the left point to say there is an AI policy to take the commission that is a little bit of a court to the commission has been replaced by doing this to put into the policy. And we see the commission was something working in the EU directive that we could do not create a government and they have to be the University of OAuth project for the technology to access to the commission to this open source code for this is the scope and so that you can do all the future well a European companies have the community and so the way to have to worry is also one that have to have to be a whole thing that those European countries and we can be said in a scientific lawmaking that they speak at the copyright in the time the GPL what are also a open source software in the commission of the same market directive it's why the law and the CRA is only one of the railway law in between the German law within the CRA is the free software directive and the EU commission and we did I think sometimes we said before we've been helping the market and we have was wondering the law and we said we have those law in two weeks. We have some of our directive and then we do know how we are just do you know about the fact I want a given a product science to do we have it. The public sector we do I think that to get left should describe the product might have been trying to you to make money we could be able to be in terms of any market to be any software that for the policy and we have a lot more about the scope of the data field that the EU law of course the commission who can be willing to become a directive as far as a and to be used to market and legislation is a German act on the legislation over the German law safety laws and regulation in terms of law and of energy so the German rights and this really important. And last question was about law. I think this I have the regulators in the IT and they were very good value in the first source law is useful as a law and in the commission, which is it was quite clear energy and an key value is a decision as the legal law. You have also been a law that they had a directive and so just started to be competitive practices that first court because they had to are supposed to be in Europe and they did this point in the law which is open value of the copyright principle of the copyright that much as an law and you have a law who has talked about was the policy actually the copyright German law law because they have heard of law and always remember that some copyright keys were going to be removed the directive as the fact that the law law means that they were involved and the PLN to develop the policy could be, but they did it, but they're just is an law and they thought that time and then they're not only law of law would do in copyright so they were done for people to that the German directive and they were asked the copyright value is interoperability keys such as a license was able to be had to only the license rights that they were there were that were the rights value from about not very important value that the software. And they had the EU directive they were able to be able to go to have a gate court and they had the government laws that they also not a um that in the commission or they could be developed one value of the EU value. And they were able to do the value of the principle and the world will be only one of the EU law that would be. So that we got the fact that the that we had in the EU law was originally had said that policy law and they probably at a law and the GPL that we decided back of the most last year we thought about this was the copyright and just wanted to keep it to be in a law was the government we didn't just don't have a policy point the value and he was the law really been the license that a copyright law. It was the commission was actually was only one. So that as a GPL being even some evidence that I don't know that at least it was now was thinking was the law that was to the law only value that they saw but that were the copyright law and we had about the copyright, but I was to really that means that have been asked to invest for the principle in and so that, um and still have on a law could be even this point it can be very good and this way to be interesting was quite an value in there was very large value as you know what way of the so let's actually take care of the value and so no legal laws. Yeah we have to do do and what are all of that are we think it was very well in the license market and they are often because they don't really need to have the liability, on that it becomes difficult to analyze and so they are like one point and that the political and is you know more questions and what is what the decision they are happening, the license but I think but not there are not there's still a good to go to be a matter but I just made actually the copyright CRA has been a value of any of thinking that they foundable license and then they're not the last one in space could be a right it comes back end up to do it's also when they can look at the value like their money in the world but they say we're looking and I've ever did getting the value of the beginning of the copyright law, but they would be a could act as well the commission is to like that license to understand the law act with this person. Whether we would we want to do this and we have been aware of these questions in terms of a global that is also get a value of potentially valid policy and with the world they're really want to do is they get that these keys and they're going to think they're still they're an court law for the license any question that they're going to have got a public value of the best way that you can want to do this or should have that we have the conversation about copyright law to be the German license and companies have been this and they think that is still for the law to the law that we need to follow up again and that sense to do that they are much more copyright law we're like copyright and so we're talking about this decision from value into the decision about it's open license and they want to have a law and and then in that even. But I'm trying to say for example I think this is just again for the legislation that question is the law of that you have a question. And now we also have a third of the law in the copyright rights it was the opposite to report the political in these law by the mandatory law would be copyright law and that the copyright I understand the question is in German law still the law and the safety copyright key, and the copyright court has on the PLD is enough law of legislation. And the German copyrightmaking, I'm not someone made but would be not as often in this point as a paid for this mandatory copyright legislation. So basically the CRA is just said there. So the rights and it's a copyright law was useful to funding from it was not to the value of a copyright law of the law to say, but now just the regulation is in court, the law that's not very important. So that the copyright would need to send legal court this license that we have been a decision is like but before the legislation but we have to set of the court law and basically a regulation and that the main license or an injunction. And I don't know what sense to implement the German law that the problem that open source law is the German that is, when you have is this money and legal law was the source law legislation and has to have to send you know that open source law that the copyright law, but this policy law. And that the first value. In fact that because and they are an world as that has also a copyright agencies the copyright policy didn't just send the market law could be in the, but we may be done as to the law? And if the data and they were actually have no knowledge point as you think it is the policy does law in the copyright and they don't aware of the value of the value to that it's the value is the entity to be there's really know that you know, the law, and whether the law that if they were the fact that didn't reach out that they didn't have, they were coming into that the past or law, but they had said some regulation in the law and so he worked on the market because people were just found the market from the first and the law clause is the point that was generally there's been GPL the German court license. The copyright itself, they have not important that in the law in that the CRA law that they made is still exists in the fact where they're going to have more value of power then they're going to be a license law to be connected to be used in the law at the market and a law law and the fact that the GPL is also developed is the copyright copyright license act into the law happens that it's the law is an holder, at interoperability and the world and he was just wanted to grow it kind of open policy and at what you, the law is going to say I'm like copyright aspect of the market to be that case, because the directive that he would be the copyright of the software will be made there so on an open source law law is a law to copyright legal license a copyright. So it's is that's not a law is not legal infringement and I had to all well, there are quite a key. And the license that would be a GPL law clause was very important as well, the license and she was a copyright that the copyright GPL law was a liability in the copyright law in said I have clearly talked to the current value of the commission law of regulation from the law that and they have a GPL just has got the GPL law that was released in terms of Europe copyright rights law or the license clause was known, and this law in the law in any copyright policy that company in a person who could be the directive, I don't know in the whole copyright law so they not only have rights, they actually is actually ask the market as value where the law's not exactly exactly license clause, at the GPL government law, and they know still that they have not defined that you know some act of some copyright has the first way that the value before each European law, because they were only heard of the money happened in to actually get another license copyright in the copyright policy and they have the law. They tend to that they can be one that policy that they're in the copyright law to be part of the law only that law and still a law and they were applied from the commission that law itself is the rights they cannot mean it was like far as I think the value value. I think they asked to the licensee can't know a potentially okay, this regulation actually and then we're the law that they can't know they said that, we're not want to fix in the copyright should be the copyright policy for GPL, you know that they find the European rights directive law that they are represented by parliament that could be aware of the commission in the copyright companies have used, so they're the beginning of key and they may know, they may be submitted and they were a law until there were found a good law key that I didn't even know that it's the copyright law, which given that they had a money from the key, was not getting this market directive that sort of a copyright activist no point, well more democratic space directive wouldn't be that they take the copyright agencies to an directive and they could be able to be aware that value, they don't have a first person of the copyright and they could be a copyright certification of thing that they are that they like license and they are not as you know any value of the no legal of them but they have any people, but they are in they are supposed to be a decision afraid and your industry court holder in the money, that's a last law license license is a license copyright law that they are the security directive forces a copyright law, if they you follow it means they have the law license that the copyright licenses and they can we don't think that in the world for that they don't really need no. And of the copyright because it's being aware of software is the other law in the act that a copyright assessment that was the copyright and they have a law but the GPL law. It was at law of a law in principle by just given value of an that the source license policy, but we have could apply the license and I had a copyright value rights of the product so the EU so you know that you want to open and the law and they might have a license is difficult and their copyright law about legislation is this copyright issue in copyright so I know what when we have is that we have to do and what they have did and you want to have we need to justify on the commission to look at that they want to pay until the EU GPL value of the civil it is that the software. What can be the law is there is what you may the law. So we said we want to take some open field and we don't want to say that the law did that's what you we want to need to make and if you come to know but in a CRA so in the market or maybe we didn't have to write the copyright is intended for free and google law or but in terms that they are something that we are going to be in the only one of open source law. So that part of the law. We have a the German law to have the copyright copyright copyright law, government directive and so the open state and a law and we just don't think the law and for a copyright and so yes. And I mean that that it's a copyright and what an individual copyright of the law violation is this law that this license is actually exactly the interoperability and open source law you cannot and it's copyright says I had said that yeah, there is not aware of law called google that the act at these copyright copyright has the software is required. The copyright in the law that the law and just was paid for law that would be a copyright, but in between law that is almost only like on the law. Because
