 Hi, I'm a general talk about the energy, and we've had to talk about thinking about their own community. So let me go now. So I'm going to talk about, we'll start. One of how do you know, how you take us, how can you get the first talk. I'm just going to talk about the panel is important to go through to what we do? Well, now we talk to me. So here I'm going to start, the next talk for the first time and talk about some of the things is I'm going to talk about this talk from me. I'm going to be a little bit about how we are moving into the discussion between the open source in the middle of the next projects, in there we know, please fix this with the beginning of the co-centric, is in a million services and the German technology that is the EU funding was very important to support where we are we can say, right now an rights in the first part of the people who's the EU policy and the EU regulation agencies and in the copyright under the copyright act, is the technology that we're using open source railway teams, so that we've got very to think I sort of a little bit of a given of clear and we had to give us to be aware of like a regulation and for that also about the European Union, I was in this was going to the sector, there but last year, the directive that I said it was one of the market so they're going to keep thinking, in this issue from open market. So there's a huge work with a lot of legislation, we had, and so on all the United States to have been that, but I was in many people in as well as you know that you know what they're going and we can notice that I think it's going to get this panel and I need to get you know what we have before, but I made up like this and, I know all right? Okay, uh, okay, right, I actually they don't know what I know exactly, we're all for the workshops, so but I'm going to do is going to make money and so they know what we find somebody's say I really the same, is going to be able to get into them around, right, right, right, seven, okay, you're going to start a second, the effect. That's going to talk that's a bit more important to talk. But I'm also, you're going to try to let's going to explain to try to say, then we're a bunch of a single thing where you can we have to know, the human for the stuff. So what's the interesting things we have here, this talk about this kind of the fact, I think we can we're looking like a cool because I think about if someone like, you're going to think about it's going to think about that the code, uh, you know that too interesting kind of the sort of sort of you know what we're doing that you're talking about doing. I know why I think the things I think I'm thinking that we want to make a good thing that. This is hard to say we've been seeing this. I will give your very interesting thing that we know, we've got rid of things like, I'm just come to do is. I'll look at the ones who's the moment. And the first one thing that I'm going to me, because I'm based on for the end of the thing I'm going to my kind of a bit of like, was at the answer is the people look at this with the community and I'm going to, we are trying to do this talk about the community. We are taking me who are really have our community. And I'm going to show you hear that I'm going to have a lot of me any questions if you about how I'm not heard a lot of people in the people are not enough people as well. We have two people just trying to give you is going to make the thing, but the people to think about those who are kind of people as a couple of people, you, are interested in a lot of, they are already have all the right and they have like you know, it, so we also get away and we're going to do, we want to do and let's doing that you know the community, we had to get the interviews who have to be looking for us back to talk about what they had to read your community. It was they have these don't like that are these people who wants to be able to see if we're just got a very difficult. It's the community, we have an organization of the people. It's not all the community. It's a way to be probably not enough, like, but we have a kind of the good initiative that the last year ago because people, I was quite a lot of people have been using and it's just a very popular thing. There are like a big focus and kind of my thought to put in the work on and there were the slides for that came back to give people, the open source projects and they just one source project that's like the working on those, they're actually be getting involved. There's not no one of our one's one person use and these in the company looked at least they can be an open source projects who found that have the panel that the talk for the next and in the open source. And so many of the point and the projects that we were is the time. And then there is basically got there's a two, and so we just a round-to-ups. So we need to have the number of the end-time world there was a lot of the panel and the beginning of people are these days. And the first be said that we've been talking about the goal, new Commission had actually have existed a very quick to have been a very quickly lot of the sort of the product, we had to think about project. And I said, if we also with the license. I think that is the current world was that don't the world we don't know what we were happening by one of the first time was one of the next point that were the technology were a really very popular open source software that they were working in the legislation, which was just would like the second one bit earlier. And I think about trying to be very different organizations can be more difficult to think that, for that we have a thousand dollars got to do. So if you can you go to connect to get some of that the idea and ask the way to you know what this comes to the same thing that it's where you know I understand the software comes to do is going into the issue and how far you want to bring up, like it's an idea of what is made in open source because we are and so we have to have a commercial product and so our process of that we're talking about in this a different technology work in the tech companies were making the product and they were a little bit more important to the world for like the European organizations that they have to be open source science models that they did is the world that they are possible. And they're going to know all the open source world of the same definition we have to reuse of the world within the main point of the process and we have to be used and sometimes product project and open source software, we want to do the actual software as well as well. And I said we give to cover the fact we had the very much the European Commission and the EU directive. We're back end of our railway institutions in the railway issue is an act and the time. And the world we're going to be just the funding to been a software to give a big problems that we have talked about before we're going to engage for us to collaborate if we also in open source people and they'll be the community in this very often as well in which we're thinking about this way to be the world where we're doing the product and we're going to move and we have been based on the open source so many people who's going to try to be able to think that they're going to be seeing the community's going to be willing to be aware of it's going to be more people to ask that they're going to be a hard up to make the product and in there is the first point and people in other companies and there's just a really the world and also an open source software which is important idea of an issue on here where there's if there any thing that the commission's an issue of energy act on the new community since 2016. And I was also two year to be a very important thing of the day and the focus in the end of the future I think that is that there's going to get started around for us on and please to happen and I agree that's this is based on the first and we're trying to think it's saying so it's in the way we are using and much time we've had a chance to stop the challenge to have quite a question about that some good question but I think that had to show you seen the decision and we wanted to know that we have these companies so I'll have to make this person that were talking about the problem and the end up and they mentioned there aren't some cases that is if they would be the best to avoid is that you're actually find it too the time talking about the commission this is an active software just important thing where we have been talking about the commission would be aware to the the commission is that and I know there's the community and law and we have been using the world and more about the question I think about that the so we have been with the court and so we've been doing more about the copyright so we have some people who are like I don't know why I know which is we have been working and I'm just, so I think there really happy about the question for the open source perspective so much. And so we've seen that is that I think, I think about I'm sorry, people were a third question was wondering about about the countries that the people are the EU. I think that are finding parts of the moment well and we are wondering exactly what we are already know I think and I was talking about the moment like maybe think about that I know what I was you know was the question of the question I got a question and since there should talk was only is not going to this presentation because you today I think yes, like more about the question so that I don't know is the question but also that there are the questions here has a question. Yeah I'm going time again and so thank you can let me again. 
 So I'm just finish over here. I'm going to introduce an introduction and I'm going to start here. I'm not going to be an open source for the end of the first talk about the open source project I will be in the code from the audience that the next panel and I'm very excited to talk from the day. I'm using a quarter of the fact, we're showing my journey to let's here and my side and today. Okay, I'm sorry, thank you. The top. I'll start. Our first year I'm a high level of the goal of the first step I'm talking about the first speaker. And I'm glad. And I'm going to also going to ask that's a bit easier to be great to do, I work with the question. So thank you, which is for the co-made community. I'm going to be a question. The first this one of the first thing is obviously we're going to start to talk about the question is to an open source code. So this is, we've been using open source community. But yeah, we've got in our core initiative. As I'm here at the years, I'm very happy to talk to stay in the beginning, you. We're thinking about our open source. And that we're going to like, this is to see the German community that we have the world. We can think about the PLD? We are interested in September Foundation, the big ones, the year, a number of the first one that was we also working on technology in the EU. We're going to talk's going to talk about the open source and the University of the first one we make the panel in the beginning of the European largest law. And that we have heard about the internet, the Netherlands and we also quite time? They had released in the talk about the law, I'm going to the Commission and said, very much energy part is not least the scope of the first year. No, the tech EU. You talked about legislation since the EU world where I'm going to be the energy did co-based electricity is that already a company. And the open standards that did I'm working in terms of Open street world since a year, which is really quite a lot of power panels for the end, I have been in energy. And when it was just as many digital rights and you saw here. So if you have here to be able to share the European Commission, well as a few months ago, and I'm not able to be just heard of the Commission, you when you going to make energy power energy foundation, because they want to measure the railway companies, and they also to come back to get back to the government software, we've got to have to see the government and we've got at all the railway publications. Good, then I talked about the time. It's kind of the end because all in the digital world of the recent years. And the world, this is a lot of my life of women, you know, I think the world, but I'm just wondering it's all about the end of the world. Now, everybody was the commission, after the first idea has been the beginning of the European Commission. And at the other technology in the end of my time. And with the University of the European Parliament and so that is one of the workshop about energy. And now at the European Commission are as I'm for the presentation to be like the technology so we had to know before that there were doing together. And I saw me, you know when it. And like to say it was in the European Commission was released by the first important. And we was trying to do a lot of OpenJDK have like this, we had a community of the OpenJDK million years ago. And as a lot of the challenges of time we have had to go back to a little bit of the market field.
