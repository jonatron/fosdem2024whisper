netes, which is different states, which is basically open data is more efficient. But if you have, you can look at the level to what the power, we have to make this tool, you get the data to the data more grid as a country. So this was, we need to go to, here, okay, we will talk about how many the grid, we don't remember the power. So now here is an example, we set the grid from the grid. And we're going to hit the grid, we got a bit more. So we are just focusing on our signal, the grid, we have last year. So, I will stop doing some then see our grid, we'll give us a time, an energy country, we'll notice is we did we're doing that are going to try to re-M track of the grid, we can do an energy calculation of a good thing to look at this. So we'll show. We're going to briefly to show you we talking about today. So this, I'm going to talk about this question. So, what's going to talk about the first idea we did is that, okay, thank we, welcome. My name is. Thank you for the new panel. I'm going to present here, a little bit of the first session, who is moving the left. My goal of me, I'll present a few minutes for the next speaker I'm going to present here. I'm just wondering about the panel. I'm an open up. And I'm good, I'm going to talk about in the panel in our first day this talk I'm an interesting thing because I'm going to do I'm going to introduce a little bit of a couple of open software engineer and I'm hoping to open science. I'm going to work on our home room for a couple of interesting talk to speak about a workshop. So I'm going to the European Commission for today I'm going to come to talk about this year. You're about the University of the first party engineer and just tried to you about. I'm going to open source commission. I had to try to be thinking about what I'm going to go to think before, open source in open source world of the key points, I've got my code that's what I'm already talked about this, who are always wondering, what we did you know it mean, hey, you're going to be like, I'm going to think, just talking about those who were going on its life about the product, but, probably want to keep there for open source project. There's a different institutions and I'm going to think this question. So I want to, but I find people who at the good issue of the point in the first. So what you know this is about people that this community is that we're not going to do. And of the European Union had some of most important is really matters on the community is there. And the last year, well, the really easy thing is, that's the idea. And so still good thing about the things for the commission of the politics and a long away of the notion and the policy is that they have had, but the German law have seen how I know, there were the commission, you know, but that they are the organization into the data and they're the world. And so they go to worry about us to the US that. So, I got to look at these, then we're just said that. And I'm going to be going to talk about this world. And in we just know the public rights as they had worked in the world by open source world and they're looking at these European law. And what they put into the world, which is all the AI, the CRA is a policy to have a very specific point of the GPL staff in there's part where they're just quite a public sector. So that the first thing is that was why we're going on the only good question started a government digital value of the commission and that there are where we can we have first talk from a more energy science, being the PLD companies can we'll be open source funding and to be aware of the educational rights from the company and the EU and open source fund and the commission has a moment to be in addition to support by a non-coded as a political key pair and we had that in the regulation that are it's what actually a lot of the CRA going to be a national Commission and we sort of of a good legislation that I think we could have been the CRA that we would be the moment, and we know that work the best country in open source software was kind of communities in German society. And they have these European Commission and so far as far the only in those standards and the law and then the negotiations and this is the commission, well. And the first thing to study, but we got as well in France to maintainos and we had. So, we would like please to go ahead of all our software to it's way to make sure we don't we have it a lot of the EU policy transparency directive. We do we need to try to tackle this to solve the government policy field of the problem we call it's like third parties. And then we can see actually modify our first point to our discussion here and the year we have the legislation and also we're doing our law and the public law and we are not have to worry is just asked for a bit of an issue and so we need to do that is not get into a lot of a lot of money through that we do it to be able to say a bit? So we want to do the copyright room came out of funding off in the world and we are we have this field for the world and we are very important to think that the world we would have to have a challenge for it as well and in EU funding just on the community and a big open source part of course we have to try to be not one question before before they have 20 years when we're not the commission, but of the effect to be done to stay in the federal society and we have these were doing the fact that we had to be funded to be a lot of course we also in the European Union association between the parliament who were still have had to do very fast and we had the EU laws and we were going to do so that right? We are going to end of those laws in Open public sector and we had two areas going to mean OpenDesk and the most important thing that we need to see there's what we had had a commission to get from the product and to a very important about the German tech parliament to do any years ago and we had a few years of us are not tested a lot of they had to be and so they were in the EU policy act on the EU tech in open source railway agencies were the EU rights to EU policy market industry can be made by in the current infrastructure involved in terms of software and they were in Germany as they were a lot of OpenSSs and they said actually have something in policy in the EU institutions and the EU government and they were the national agencies and then they could keep asked out of legislation and they just in market in a year who were very good time so the US uh law and I guess we've done together's not actually a good and they had the court was the whole market that really it was we know of the law that was so there's where they were not the last year from the PLD was being the law uh we needed to have very important to go to be there was not considered the government law but now the world of this law I've had to contribute but in market company in CRA that was the German European commission and a part and the German law and the law didn't clearly means to the US only way he was that we had is always because we have been on the European world and so they tried to have this place and then we were now haven't really had to be a member of a few words on the decision was that were a license that didn't ever been a decision right because it was great open science was copyright as well working in these law and we just an the result and that was able to have to report to be a rights and some law as you've been on the commission clause in terms of the European Commission just had the copyright laws and they have heard a law and they had got this was not had the big software law that they were the copyright forces the end and they have a lawyer and they had a reason that you know the copyright of that that would be the nature so they were the commission that she had found really a value of people, but this is very good enough in, we had asked the directive in the law of the copyright commission were was asked because you were in 2019 that the law decision had to be a challenge and they had happened in policy didn't only value and of dollars. And as a Drupal policy would be that didn't have to follow that in between people, but that. But they're taking a directive they were kind of the thought it was the law law directive and commission to do was the product was a copyright law. I said and they had asked that could have been really a commission. And so they had thought was like about it was an energy and they had the market of parliament to make a law was no copyright law and asked about it was it was not released they were good person was doing in was bad laws was there was a law. It was a, it was no no was the copyright and not that was bad liability act didn't as it was just a closed source law so, but that they're a license, they had no longer had also the uh to be said, because that's what they had like just asked the law has had to be a field had that was the person that were very interesting person in the law were used a policy centers were worried that was that was the CRA was just and it were built to turn in that was basically can't moved the copyright law to a license value and clearly we were potentially a copyright, of the conditions to one of the law they were published had as I said, so they were trying on you was done a law and a copyright law to have to be doing it was given was for open source law and was for open source but often the copyright because we were a copyright law that would't know that was actually came to the clause about copyright, more to have their GPL law and were a only released and their GPL law was that in is you wanted to be a no rights or these no law that they went out of the Germanilingual law, the idea there was that is that was this is the law that the standard is just value of a law. Probably a GPL person was because they were actually don't just be there was the law would be a a copyright value of law at copyright is quite of an impact directive to go very good story of the copyright law they were found in their copyright law and to rights to the open so GPL has law in rights law in the copyright law. But because it's the law, but the value of course, the German rights and they had nothing that could be made in a money out the law, is like that's the law, the last year and last year, that think the law laws is it would like the law, we first there's going to the mandatory law or they definitely a license economic law and they had to be a second value to be law and they still not yet. I think that the first no that you said they are quite care about right the law license has this copyright law or law to. but they have the violation of the GPL so they need to just so many law open source work they don't only had the law a point know what she was just said he was in the license could be working done so far the value and they were done in court and they're trying to do on the injunction becomes really thought they didn't made me to be like GPL law in a license law of law of the CRA. So I said, if we've only had to say, you've got this not the Neo and they're not said that still see the one or a effect of the law law and it that I thought they're not going to be thinking of the law has to accept the PLBPT and they're going to be, but they're the copyright is actually wondering, and they are good of his market of EU no certification and they were just a copyright because they were very clear of the value to go to change the decision, and they had the sector, right, and there but they had this, they had a law and it, they had an agent that only wanted to be an hour of law and they were the license copyright value value in open license copyright law might be made as a long, but it was essentially, the value that it of copyrightkeeper that if they want to license that in the policy holder's a open license and copyright said that they have a directive and they have a copyright license problem that so that, we don't have to handle what is so what they're required value. So one of the role is taken a legal rights of a clear that they would always say who can be a very important value at the license in this notion that so the copyright was done what the the point, and the license of digital field that everybody just was this is that we wanted to go into the law that we did you want to do some discussion saying as well, that I was an open source license by the software model in particular copyright policy would say, we're the decision the source and a value of what the decision would we could be an public competition law as a copyright value of this license would be huge policy is in the way that is it could be really an a space of the good thing that they're really the copyright, but you might be on the value of all of political person don't really need to make copyright and to apply the directive and they have done the GPL does something that sense of the problem. Like you know. You know, and they're really have a policy. I'm asking and they're just in that the good question was potentially that they know that they have to analyze? You know from the question. So they are building it. They're looking really an experience that they're, we have to do not being a license has to it as long person to be removed or in the copyright and they're going to the whole funding that they're trying to work. And the fact, you know, they're going to tell you know, right? Because we've ever want to think about said, I'm going to be going
