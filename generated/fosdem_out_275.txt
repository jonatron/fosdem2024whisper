 The first of this is the first of the next part of this talk in the summary of a little bit of code. I was making it more than the community. In a open source code is the community and the community and the code is the code in the end of the code will be better. That's a lot of technologies to have to make it accessible to the software making things. I didn't have in the challenges that they are like the code. I'm just wondering. And that we're speaking and what the main goal of the background works is, but we want to do. And yeah, that's why they've been in Europe. So how we take into all about about first. And I'm going to briefly about our idea that. I'm going to, why I'm going to talk about. So let's talk about just going to have to get that. It's just wondering, I'm going to go through that. We're just coming from this first presentation and keep going to talk I'm going to keep the work on the time. And I'm going to talk about about, but we're going to be going to talk about how new technology. And when you're going to make us come on the impact of the current is that we're going to keep talking to do we're going to be going to talk about the fact that we write, we're going to be going to do to download the code? We're going to be doing this time to reuse this presentation. We've shown you've got the first, because we have a long time of this might also know, we're going to keep going to start doing this things that had to be the stuff, we've just going to keep going to be going to start thinking about the technical, because we're going to come about the project. You can be able to know, you know, but you could do it, and I can be on the project that one of the challenges in this is not there, right hand in terms of legislation and, maybe this thing you know, you can I'm going to have a sort of interesting. But if you know this is going to get the fact that you know, there's going to do. I would have a project to come here. It's going to do you know what I'm going to be our idea, right? Like I'm going to go to be trying to go to start getting out, so far for my people, so much looking at the first one is there. I'm just wondering, let's another thing for the end-out, so the way, how this is we get here is happening, the last year, we've got here. That's going to find the people here that. Well, that this is what's how we're doing why? We're going to get, right now going to make a few years ago. We have a few questions. And people heard about, who have, like the developers's a lot of the second example of people. So that you can we've got seen what we're going to ask a lot of things that. So the history of the latest thing is the one thing I've to get from the most of the European Commission in the beginning of this, we have, we're going to have more than, which is to be, and we've been trying to read some people who are doing, right and decided to do it into a bit more important, it's a thing, and the way we want to figure out, but we can come to go to talk about it's going to the great for us. And we're going to put it's a good enough to be asking, you may be really, it, we're going to give us to how do that's going to give up to if you basically a new people and I'm going to add it's going to do the people to be just wondering that. And so this is also important for us a few years ago, just have to take a year, but it's data to tell you. And this. With your own data is very cool. Here's just a small tech science model. And this is as a model, the main to be written in the big impact. And then going to make and those, we keep up to go back to the history of those and make sense. And that it's a science or a digital science and now we have at a lot of time, like a lot of tech, we have a lot of different language, we're going to look at the data, we've been doing this. We have the world we looked at the people who have talked about, like, like, how many years. We want to do we've been saying, of this is we just a topic of what we've a lot to run out, very positive case that we have been making it. We had had only the things a lot of open source world. We have been talking about how we have been having to show our community from the first six years ago, like this, we need to do, we need to have a very helpful to get into people without speaking and in Blockly, they can't've been using that. So that we are a technical maintenance. So we're doing the fact that we are going to integrate the EU and like a lot of it and we also need to go ahead or the fact that we have a lot of funding and to be able to be the AI software group and we don't know which we are based on the case of our own challenges that the world. And so we can be open source code, so that are aware of a bit what we have is to deal with being part of a open source community. So we have a lot of a very interesting community to say, we're around open source group about the funding, they're trying to be doing on humans in the moment. So as a good to make a few of a lot of course we're also do it's the community. We're a pretty much more important idea of revenue are going to make the problem. But we do you may have a good benefit of innovation that we have a word that we have to think about the EU. And what we should be a technical teams are open this is what we want to share they have more. So we know our question. We're doing this talk about the notion that's going to our kind of what we are going to think that. And we need to take a nonprofit community where we're going to get in our software science data from certain sort of our project and the CRA. So a lot of been a lot of AI science and how you've done talking to share and how can we are running a high-source community that we get into the openness of it and how to give a focus and open source and we have a lot of the people who said, the community can open source community company of tech that we want to be talking about the AI. What we've been in the open source projects in terms of the end communities for the open source funding, you know, the whole world that's a big companies and we also like an open source, so this is what the EU and institutions can we came from the railway in years ago at the EU government rights in my rights we haven't have heard about what we were talking about the law, who is that the German law, in this to open source funding is going to the energy revenue of tech and now a first two European Commission under open source software directive for us that EU community was exactly the court economy here by companies, I think we had to guess the software. In Europe we've been brought a lot of open source law and the directive and they had launched them on national government society and the GPL. We had a law that you have found both public interoperability and open source community law and I had to be in our association in the PLD in the European commission. The group so that she came at the European Union, which were a government law and had that they are then not just a living in the United States. I asked that has a time in 2021, there that we could be a second area of funding in a European Commission who really known time and the third of the open years, so we said, but we had another federal and I think we didjo was very long time to give us with people to their data in open decision since I was the law and the copyright law and to have a good software law and they will be the PLI and they are doing a copyright law that the cost of this copyright and they felt could basically in the world in the law and policy that were really should affect any only one was not be a place and they were the law and they looked at the problem for the civil law. I mean they had a decision that was for the license law, this CRA was the time European Union and that I was only had had forgotten to always in my money from the AI right day and it was initially and they would be a trademark to engage and more law that was just heard that we'd have got the world on the law until a representative of in the law, and said, so therefore was open source law cost time in AI law and I said the software science group the context here was the law is, that European directive and the market directive and law that is no a law when you know, that the commission. Is there is actually so long law that of copyright legal law, before the GPL that made the policy. It was no only I started the copyright sector for what do they had made of a long made this case in open source law before that I think that the UK law and you know that but you know what it to give us, and what they didn't really think, but there are looking for free software and so that the way to do you know it's the technology. But in the licenses are the open license has a license, a really I think that's important part of the law and there is that's very standard that there's always a and they had to be like also a very easy to the value. So it's the other law, there's a company, that I find that was to you had before, that was that there were, that you know, I was a risk and they were a government license from the government and there's not a license companies had could be the other copyright law didn't always be copyright holder have to keep being as well, which is it was not the source public sector in the license. They thought that They had about value of the copyright and they were a copyright law, the copyright and and a directive because she had got checked the copyright, had no political directive and everybody had in a, they told because they thought the copyright economy at 10 good space of, they are just felt legal law, so they had said, they're very sector had those problems, they're still no way to be a legislation because they don't have that they know what they're a funding doesn't have the law and even exist and they're trying to be able to know that. But and they are this license was the knowledge we already had to have something that we have maybe just to have to be a good, well. And I thought of course, is it was very important that we built in the copyright law, of the value of the law. And I had been think the first one of the law was that the court was done at I was the laws still the the point was just put this big law, well as a problem, right in the only thing of the space. I think that. How does not this? I don't know, so the copyright technology was that the key, right? How are all this, it was originally only done. I think was, that I was also looked and then I had in the EU policy was that you know in the EU. I think I think our policy since the EU and the whole panel that we've had not done 100 years and I had that was so I was in open source AI law in 2018 and so I was in Brussels, open source software into Europe were getting the open source software. And they did we had to tell the last year that we didn't want to do that. And I was I was a number of the last year. And they were thinking of the long time I was that was actually a government people were really the CRA who had been probably had, so basically just was of 20 years ago, so in these are actually told the parliament were already been a huge money and they had a court and they're already said, we wanted to know, but they decided about the law that we come up. We have any time to have a day software so we had said that one was the big challenge on the law. And for this was because you know basically have some of the German government was also the German government only the German European law as not from the key and the open source is GPL and then there was just a law law and laws that policy just did a first way of the regulation as a great law when someone on the law and then they had to exist that it was really a law of market and these copyright and they should not least as the law and they had was because they said the market or it was started working on the GPL commission is there were asked for the license. And other law sector going to only three national agencies were some legislation that were like to the regulation and open hardware policy and they were absolutely care and they could be the sector. The past then they have a law person were a law in IT law law, but they found in US and they wanted to copyright principle. And the law liability then in 2022, and they said, those legislation liability, the beginning, and they actually don't quite interesting field forces they didn't think in the value period in the law, there's law, they had an IT society to have the TPM and the only had to do that. So as the public EU law was that was the law and that they knew a value of law license in key to law in this license is to law in European Commission in a the law. The law was that cost of interoperability. And this German directive had a law, but right copyright policy, since the copyright world of the law could be two law policy directive, but he would need to that we have a policy. We had in his copyright law, but it was there were aware of the holder is also had already and they were almost clear, which were any licensee holder said there was the value of the copyright law, the number of termination was copyright law is that they were so they had started to make this law. And they did
