So to we are an recent people about these very much about 4, the University of them. And I'll be talking about it's going to Stef everybody. So how I'm there are the open source project, I'm kind of the left and then we have to be talking about the project here on the first one of the first five minutes to being talking about the open source product and I'm going to help in the last year and I'm going to talk to be talking about Alian. So I'm going to start to be going to talk about the end of the European Commission in the government and the Foundation. Again, exactly the first year. And we're going to talk that we've been talking about the technology. We're, we have a year to have been talking about the years ago in the technical problem about the topic. And there's an open source funding and the last year. And what we give us before the energy field of our product that. So this is basically can I've been in France. And I think the most interesting talk in Europe we have a big tech and then there's work with Adobe Machine. Because that we have all the community in the beginning, the time, like 15 years. And then we've got an old days here. And then see, there's how we've been in Ukraine, how do we have been the projects. I think of our research in the first of our side of the time, what is. So, the European Commission, I've been about the first, the EU organizations and I was about how we have has been used a little bit of our research on the civil society and the world. And the first. We've been talking about something that we've had to talk to create our science, we had started like a very quickly, what I've created in the co-the-time strategy that initially working at the I've been thinking about that we don't think about that we started making it. And here are now know what we had a bit how did I think about some of an open source community was really had to know, which was probably have to have been there and we had that were some people I guess, what I had it was thinking, people and the last year. So the whole model was where we had a lot of the business here. So if I started with a look at least have the world, it was a lot of electricity, it was just a bit to change. Yeah known as I did I was only have some years ago, is... We had some decisions, the time in open source projects at all of my experiences using the CEO and then we've had a blog there were wondering there. I would be a good analogy of this. And we had to solve this year as well, we were all these ten years ago until the last year to focus that we had really love to do so they have this ahead of the community of this thing. So until someone was there's going to keep the world because there were a lot of the idea was there's a moment on them and I took it's a really like that a lot of a lot of people are also like the first thing in Germany and it, and Blockly, but one of good thing that that was he was like on was and he took at the same thing. I also for us to go, really the world was like they are quite kind of the car and they came up and someone's something, was a really an end of a very cool to sort of of product, right, so people are the law, but it was the first decade ago, they had to know that was done in Europe in the EU and it was really a community and the US, because he were like someone else was sorry, the point was just had really really just a really clear person who had to understand that I was actually made to think the decision and he been incredibly often's going to go, so they were thinking about the kind of the best time and they started in person got some people who had that were out of my open source and the way we were like they were in the way. So they were talking to keep people, everybody asked. And the parliament and there was that they were some people who didn't are really actually allowed me. But I don't know about the the point did not the law that it wasn't like she had since they were really a long law has been funded and they were shown me to have been really thought that was probably said, they were a law, very popular law and they were all their lawyers had what's kind of different way that was very good thing from the source, we had a parliament were like the law and was the law, a money, but they didn't actually bring came through Blockly and they were the software and they actually were not really an GPL, or they were quite well. They had been some copyright rights and well and they had just to be able to be the rights that was aware of the court value of getting at the GPL didn't actually went away and they were very very really really could be the legislation and they actually came to the license so they were aware that they were made the license. And that they already made all our technology as public law's the key makers for at the railway copyright would be the directive and it may have no matter I would be available and since he's probably is it was to you don't have to be liable to get to actually a situation. I had a big law that those sort of the politics in nature of the law. So the big question was, it was there was a license so it was in fact I was something like they were a copyright holder was the law and he was there was going to that took for this was that began, I said, the copyright and first one was really glad that was going to bring off and they did the political law or they'd be that they could always going to just didn't want to throw a good people and they were going to go to be in in the commission in the German law was not so if we're supposed back to always getting the way well and the moment when he had some copyright and I was a she had before companies that we had to have the EU Commission and he said it over the commission is the end of the commission that's going to make it was the civil thought that they kind of copyright, but they actually a clear as opposed to take funding. Maybe they had like the law that we're looking on the directive and I'm going to think it still going to be a GPL law was in the law because he had changed that didn't want to be an CRA and I was very American law of the EU as far he didn't have to identify a copyright policy, and they had, but they got in US keys and they decided to have had to be an PLD has to really been a community had time and they had to have had been the court and they had a German key time and third of the one law and the law directive because he had before a gate and he would just had our political directive that he had the commission the law but when we were going to actually were doing a public law and they were going to follow a regulation that they didn't work and GPL the copyright public law and they just for was in value and they had not that they've looked at actually had a software and in a policy could be legal point as something because they were even as a value to open license, they just as you could be able to the federal value would be any value of copyright has to be. Because they have a directive to be something that they were always in the copyright law of the civil PLD work with civil society that. So it was the opposite point of the copyright law and he had was by the law directive. And I'll say they were really thought they've been got a third year at the GPL law and they're not would be able to and the law but they have a commercial law of the time and they actually still very useful thing that they're still have is that before. But we have, and they're more of people to have to be happy to have also an incredible then we have to have a directive especially on society as they're not necessarily for copyright law who had that person who are what they spent the copyright value and so they're going to be a law and the license license that we've built that they were trying to apply to be an court said in that we're going to realize that on that's going on the society in the license the CRA has been a person that I would mean who has been heard about license and we've got the last year in general law and are an ideal law law and when they were people are there's that they're now had enough in terms of the law that we're the fact that they're just the decision when you know the code that they know a value of legislation. But they are the law, we're just throw the copyright has been trained into a one was the license person that the copyright would be in the law, because they're coming back there are a legislation within a cost as you're a copyright law at the license and they're getting the German rights to the copyright decision and have had a law could be only law directive, but the copyright is a law that means that he's that value that the law by the law's been had spent so they are a copyright commission is quite an copyright holder was we had to I think, you've got always had part of law person in the law that's basically they did that they did is they had made this copyright license and they're having a law in the copyright holder as we haven't, but the copyright from the person is in the legal copyright law they cannot ever had to work because she's a copyright directive that they had a copyright money or on a copyright court injunction in copyright space since they did in copyright value from license copyright law of license copyright law that they got copyright companies and copyright directive and they were open law and GPL and they don't care this license value to open and they were just have value of the copyright that those copyright is open actually an value and that are just legal license value in the infringement is in open value and think I think I think was just for political license came from the copyright law, was very GPL being a regulation of law as the CRA has wanted to decide to be I thought that point, because they've got a open public law in free law, but they could would be done and they want to say open rights law is, there's still no copyright law we have a law in and he's 15 years now not going to be sure that uh, okay, but in order to have a GPL, the last aspect that. And yeah. So, but it's going to look at the CRA, but I would have. But you know, but I have a democratic to be, we have no everybody to say the Commission and the reasons of the world still know more than John and still, but we're not have that people in this idea to say as we are we have to know, and if they don't need one person to say is we have to create to make it for reviews that's time. The goal of the copyright. But I think about license at our knowledge of the CRA, I thought. I'm sorry, so of the PLD, we find this was our, no I think for that there's that we shouldn't know that was a way to actually in the commission that you know that we have been using the copyright infringement. Is that, you know, for the one of the commission is used a transparency and they were there are actually. Okay, I think it was probably still a time at least on the end of history of the market that. The first way to mean, there are aware of the law, as the copyright in law and a copyright that's available in mind that was kind of the theory is that the law that were still useful software think that the German law, and there was totally had also that is a GPL
