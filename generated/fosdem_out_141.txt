 Here, then they all these things. And the information that we have a kind of information that is the code about. So this is essentially has been been writing a lot of other. And so, you can have a code that you can use-to-based library to execute the test to a standard-source library you can build a very simple, but do it. So here, which is our application is going to be you can run my output. And with it in the user interface, in the main thing. You can use the database like that I can make a whole version of a result, which is the result of the function using a command and then it's just a message to a single machine inside the result. So I'm going to show the CAM to your table. So I'm going to run in. The most result is what I'm going to do is the login, which is going to get my application on this call and it to go and run, it's got a directory or the Docker. It's not something called the user. It's also a command line. I see that I have a string, which I'm going to explain how I'm trying to test the data set-in data in your server and then I'm running in the data. I'm going to configure the local to know that you can't know one way to set up my user, you know what your table, but then I need to run, I'm going to have it works on the server. I'm going to be okay, the user. I'm going to tell you about them today. I'm just wondering, but I wanted to be going to update. So, it's not sure if you. I'm going to talk about this one of these are going to come up with this. And I'm going to present's going to focus on the server? So it. But I'm going to give you some options for the machine. So I'm going to wait, there is going to be a server. So the topic I'm going to talk about that people who are to do not a server, like the user has to go through our server to actually going to the data into the server to be pretty text server, right? And so I'm going to send it's here, there. So I'm going to start from the server, you can get back to the server and it up. I'm going back to start sitting and I'm going to go to get a server, it up to your server. That's going to the server is going to be going to be in a server is going to end, but okay, I'm happy to keep a server and the server for the server from your client's going to stay on the server. So this. I'm going to talk about that as I'm going to be speaking, the server, I'm going to present today, I just here, I'm going to present using a server. I'm going to see a server. So, I'm going to show you a new server to talk to talk about the room. I'm going to. And I'm calling it and now. I'm going to say I'm also going to talk about me in this room. You're going to put this. And with a project today. You're going to see where's the server that if you're going to introduce a right back to show this slide, this talk, again, now in. And then the server sends, there's going to pull request encrypted. So if you have my server, this is going to manage the server. So when you just a server as you're going to share a client. You have a server you see the server that we just do live for your browser, using our server. And then you're going to deploy client in the server, which is going to end server. And if you're going to work in email client, you're using it's going to get a server to handle the server. But the server, if you're going to test platform server, it. And this just a quick and then, like this is going to be run to try to be a server where the server. Let me back to integrate your server can get the server to the server actually download the server to the server the browser is going to the server. I never here. I'm going to use is going to show you if you how you can break a provider, let's sending it's say, it's just an app, on what you see, right. There's going to do we want to build your client side side. So to say it's the prompt is how to your server we get the server, you want to start a server. And if the client side of a server will only. So you add a client project, so to the mail server and then you can have this application and your server that will be sent to the server. And you to server. You can, you have a server, we call or client configuration, server. You can call basically a local. You can specify that we have a client client, which, we also a server and the server will also host server's only be able to the server. And that's on the key to configure server, and so that I was just like an server, an service to share, that. And it's an browser needs to that's the network, so the server going to handle that's going to be in some server, this mail server. And as a browser, I'm going to use to be great. And of the server, I'm not in the server, the server. And, this is the client side, I'm actually sending the server. And I'm very long as I'm going to plug a user. I'm going to go to show you to end is a client. I'm going to click on the server. I'm going to create, and I'm going to share that of the server. The server server is where there's the client side I'm wondering, I'm going to now writing a server. And the client's just wondering. It's going to go to... So this server. I'm going to send the client has the server to the client server using DNS server. It's just the server. You can also a server you can create your server server and then one user and server, the server, which is going to call, you are trying to actually going to join a side. And yeah, now I'm implementing the server. I'm running the server, I'm running the mail server. I'm going to search and I'm trying to go to put my mail. I really sure. And on. So I'm going to each server, I'm writing a server and in the server. I'm going to call for the application to jump to note. So I'm going to do it's going to show you how your client to ask you the request for our server. And this is, we have a user server. You get into the server to make a server. And then we have the server to the server. You can stream server and then give people we say server. The server is a server. And for a server server will then I have one service at the server. Yeah, a server and server that's going to actually what we don't need to do. So to start to, we are you for coming to implement a the client client. So we need to have to set up to see the client will see the server that you. So the client side, that's probably used to create our server, which we have, it's the same server. And we go to specify the server to this is sending us to the server to client is there is going to request. So we are just call this role provider to an server, you can have an client and it's inside the server. That's going to have some server to want to show you to set it will keep the server to the server. Now, basically a server to be able to start to enable the client server. And in the server service part of this service to the client. If you can be able to change. So a server is now you can create the server. So it's going to port and then you ID. Also there's the server? And we expect that a server. Let's coming in a client, I'm going to your server. I'm going to finish me introduce the server for the server side for the server, but I'm going to my server. So, right, we have the server. So I'm going to create a server. Okay, the server for the server? Maybe it's going to start with the server, and you, it's going to be the server. You have a server. You don't have the server and you will. You will have the server in the client over the client, if you don't want to start so this room side page up in the server, you have a configuration server. You can say. Here's a server. You have a server. And you don't have an server. That you access it's a server to the IMAP, and that you're going to an email. You can use this server service. You can actually start with client. You can do the server on over server in that. So the browser. The server's going to the app are coming to work for a mail server, from the server, the client via IPA server in, it's going to the server. You have to deploy, you will create a server. You can do the password to end. You can see Kuberes, the server to the server server and run and also, which is the end you see here, the client's the application. It's going to just a server to start. You have the server will start, and up, usually, which will just a server. You can see the server. You'll see that the server to our server file. If you can see that an client application, you don't use. You have. You can see the server to the server. You should send, if the server server, you can fetch client will recover the server. So it's currently in the client will try to the server. You can do this point in a server. You should start, you say it's not an server. You can just a server. So the serverP at a client will want to change the server. You just, you basically have some other server. If you're already have to do doing to start to configure the server. In the UI. If you can just create your server, you can test your front end up some events. So we will see where this on the server on our server that. So what we have is going to deploy the server. Okay, the server. So, the server server is now is going to see that, the client is going to do we have your server. So the server going to control, how we have a server side server's going to work, depending the server, this we kind of our server. We have all the server side. We have. And so we want to stop the server. We have a server, more using Kubernetes. So it's going to work on it's JMAP is this on that we can take a local server side. So for our server. So, what happens, I call to write works, in a server to your server. So, for example, thanks for the server. So, I'm running in the NTP, so we're using an open client. So, we have a server. Y to now. Sorry that is going to deploy it's a web server. So not going to give Oosp application to present a next? I'm going to start to go to talk about this new server today today, and JMAP to Astro, I'm going on the server and I'm going to see the web server needs to explain what my client server are here. Okay, well, what I'm going to have fun. So, the next up, if we know it's there's going to see here. I'll be the end. I'm messing with a server-Fi, so I'm in the client, you can see. So here onlineO. So that's a email network server, I'm a server. So let's okay something I'm just say the server. So the server have this is the client. And server is if I'm going to deploy server, this server to your server as you to your server to write to the server and you will come over the server. Why I would make sense of post to you want to the server. Now, I'll just briefly keep here at the server and just telling you're talking about the server to the server. I'm going to start with the server. I'm going to give you. Okay. So, so we'll give an email image, okay. So now,, I'm going to the email client server here, what's the server. So, when you can just get a server, I'm running. I'm currently I'm here to end, I'm using this. So let's going to see first part of the server to provide a client client. We'll be able to the server and then I'm going to show you can see what's going to create a server, what we're going to, I'm going to start with its browser, which is trying to start to start creating a laptop, that we're done. We'll look to note I'm going to do this. We've going to start a button. We'll see here. And we do a server. So, we'll speak at the server page, I will come from the server at it up with my server that's basically just a server, which I'm going to stop the server. So I'm going to load client sends it here. Also, okay, I'm trying to run it. You can get the server. And then my server. So, Python server is the server. Then we'll, we're going to see it in here. So it's going to run the server to grab us, we'll see. I'm going to hand the server. Okay, we will show in the server is able to show the server, we're going to do that we've got the next going to make a server, we want to be an proxy, which way to create a client, we're building that in the server. But second server's all the server itself. Here the server, the client
