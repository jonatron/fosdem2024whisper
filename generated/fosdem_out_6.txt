 Our 3. We have a few months. We have 4KN3, we have a lot of libraries and the way we do those with the requirements and the target and now from the EU we have a lower network service validation, which I'm going to talk about the power when we found that we're going to find out that. We're going to go back to our next question. And we're waiting to figure out there that we're going to have an introduction to be coming to the first part of the future because we're going to be able to have a little bit of the technologies to give a bit more a quick bit a bit more than 100. We're going to match on the discussion for the future. So we're not going to be able to get back to be able to analyze our code in our code. We have that we use, you're going to get to use it. And then we have a whole thing to see what we're going to start of going to talk to look at our future. First. Our goal is to build our next talk about and how we have a bit more people who are using our work in the infrastructure itself in the whole problem which are developing and the whole source in public stack. It was not the technology. And I've seen for the end users to think we will be speaking and the point. And this is so we're going to be a process. I think the good one of a lot of the first one is that we're going to do a lot of the answer. And we're going to see a long time I'm going to be going to talk about the documentation for our community. And we're going to be doing our people. And we have to make we saw a good practices for our business issues in the most of the best time to see here is to know what we're going to do. And what we're going to continue to keep trying to be here. We're going to call our projects to evolve? How would be introducing us. And I'm being a challenge to get into the CRA here. We're going to work up our knowledge to talk about how can you're going to try the talk about this. We're going to make out here we've been all that we're going to be able to go to get the last year to see in there's a lot of all of people who's going to come here and how I'm going to continue working on and if you're just wanted to start organizing this stuff in the slides and things. And so I actually we're writing come to be going to get come to an hour time We're going to add the people through once you to find it. I was currently in here. So you're going to focus on the slides. I'm going to ask for people to encourage her a speaker. And we're out to continue to have a few years to have a little bit more people on the whole week ago. So I'm going to ask money, you to be up to be looking into the music. So I'm going on the good talk was wondering. Thanks for the next talk and the next question that we're going to try to love to be able to ask our work. So, we have the speakers, I'm going to have any questions, because I'm going to talk, we had a little bit of the first slide. And there was wondering me to get it's a little bit of a five years ago in the music and I'm wondering, but I was wondering if you're going to me with the bottom-friendly. I'm going to talk trying to my day. So I wanted to speak about the last discussion with this is my friends that I've just the panel. I really what we have I'm to do in the chat. But I think this is I'm going to talk, I'm not sure I'm going to speak here because I'm not going to talk to talk a lot of what I'm going to live. I'm going to talk about about what this in a little few words. I'm going to talk about the logo, I'm going to present you're just wondering what he's going to listen to talk about the word there's going to me. So thank you going to keep here. So, thank you very much everybody. There's in our talk about as Christian. And so much. I'm going to live. So that we're going to talk about I'm going to start a little bit about the next slide about the University of the PLD and so much that's how many of the only one of the open source community of the OpenCL program is a bit of France. And this is a project which is also the moment and I'm going to talk about how many months before actually about the main thing I'm going to keep, the CripPad to discuss about what we're also saw. And I said, you are we have what does. And so you have some of the work for the left. And I'm going to find those years ago I'm going to like that point of you saw that you had a lot of what happens to do and how are of the last talk about the first got back to start the first one of the most of them and the next year at the talk, but I'm a lot of the only ones are really good to some of the end would, which was that we've heard of the agenda about the first but I was the first one that we have over the FOSDEM and the morning. And I'm going to the day, here. I'm going to talk about the last year ago. I'm going to start with the co-to-source law and also one of an open source project and we created for the panel. And I'm just wondering. So, and I was the community. I'm talking about the end-time funding that and the last talk was, this is a lot of the member of the PLD, which is kind of projects. I've seen about the educational tech people need to do. If you need to think we want to have some of co-PASS community science. And if you have it, time to see that has been made it's a software engineer. And so in this was actually the community to talk, I'm wondering that I'm interested in the moment. And I'm going to us with the product, the parliament did that is being just open source, because of the world, okay, but if you know, you could be a lot of the product and you use to have about the open source community and on the goal of open source communities. I know, I was one of the public compliance conference. I did I was to start to keep on the beginning of companies and I think about how do, the panel, how I think there was looking at the law and the challenges that I said, and what I think that at all the chance to it was I was that we're from a product. And I'm going to be there was wondering it was the goal of the problem and there were about the Drupal really often heard about the council of the government law software that they knew who had to become companies here and open source community. I was so many people was that market I'm not I can just wondering, people for people at the law and I was wondering about that time for the court and as we've checked by the CRA. And then just going to put in the world, but so that's a few years ago, we've been a lot of work here and that now I found on. Anybody can get a group to us down to have only learned that people in that companies. I've got a lot of the goal of people who have to be a lot of the CRA and the EU and so that they're at the world of people, but as far as they are free time. That's the world. I said, you know this is actually has been aware of the beginning of the story we can find it's going that we're going to throw out of last week since we had a first of the PLD world. We had asked by the problems that have a little bit of our community that we had to try to work we got this big tech work in this and many people who did have been into Kododojo. And then we're just already said that we're going to get some more out the best, we're moving with the world because IANA had been talking about us from a bit of what we've had a way to do they are telling me and they got like there that? Like maybe people is somebody's nothing that they have a good, the last year, doing this is essentially, like we're worried about this in this and open source community, we're at the work. We're not just the beginning that we're looking to involve us involved in this point and we're going to get to get to do this. And we are not really been moving forward to how they'll talk about it a great. And also people. So there's probably not been the world. And very interesting to keep the challenges, maybe I'm about how we're all the right? I think I'm just wondering about, and going to get started some people from the next year. And they're going to get involved in the way that as we would like ten years was being asked to write this to that make out of my team as it. I would love to think about the next step I didn't even show you had a little bit to know about the one, but I'm just had like a lot of the right? But I would like the community, I would like, I think he was like to be like, like, I would have to focus on the internet of mine, but I think what I also when we did I haven't think it and I think that I was like I picked up to meet up with their community, maybe we have to get back to one to the speakers on the last year, and I get like like to this is to that i thought we have to play, I was wondering, we've been doing this year to see now. So I mentioned earlier. But yeah, when we were the number of the year and we had something about five years ago at 10 years ago since this by the early days of the same year, but I don't know the day. So since I'm asking me from the time ago, I've been removed the most of them were about 20 years and I was doing at the time at the first year because I was the European Commission. So basically, you know, we were thinking about people. So, I'm going to talk about the year. We created in the world and we have, okay, but I started. And so I was using a kind of a project and the years now we looked at least I think do a lot of so we get there is a bunch of interesting time. So how the last year was very, we've just for a little bit of the first of team on the heart of the team, we had in the beginning of open source community is on the community. We had a work. So anyway. And the community, I got to do we've got a little bit about the last year and now. So we have a little bit of things. So there's what the microphone that we've been working on the community, we've had to have at the software project. So I think I'm not so there's it's a few months, they had to have had another company around last year. And of this year. It's a lot of the way. But, like, there's really heard about the first two projects that we've seen the project because that was also really got a very important thing about what I'm probably in there is really been very a lot of our tech companies in a lot of companies around some other ones that we were from really going to be more technical ideas and so they were thinking, what do we're looking like, and we are doing. We are at the whole tech funding in the company. So we know that we are using the future, we want to work at least in the future. So, the world, we're going to get started the developers who did we should have like to make it, because we were also're going to be the software as soon as a long as we're going to go forward. And we're going to go through the people to discuss about people. And of business technology and I think what I'd like, they're thinking about sustainability, right balance and like going to take a talk to run on the reason why person to talk? And it's, the idea for us to work that. And if there's going to what we actually said, is a little bit of the community, how we want to do we want to look at the big partner of the world. And we're going to see something we're going to set up time on a little bit of work, but we want to learn is happening for us who to be going to do that work together. You know what we now, we are going to discuss with the open source people at the project right we're living with building open source community and we've been working together to think about the fact that we're going to do. And I've got to be... I'm going to talk about the reason, but I'm I'm being done. So I have a very just going to say what I'm going to do we have the last year, the day. And that I'm not know there is some really, the people who is the world when you know there and what we have together to make. And I'm looking at the last year, in the most likely going to do is I'm just wondering, I'm not sure. So it's the end of the last five years ago, because I'm going to talk about because I'm going to talk. I'm going to talk about this is a little introduction to present on that I'm going to talk is back to be going to talk incredibly the time. So that I'm going to introduce me was going to talk if you today. So that we're going to think it's going to talk about this is important to be talking about doing a bit about the code that it. And I'm going to talk about the good organization here is much better than I'm talking about. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you for that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you
