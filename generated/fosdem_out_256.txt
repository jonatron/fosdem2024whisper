 So we use this is a single one that was all the language and basically lets you run a struct. So if you use it or delete the search for that is okay I know in some of this is what the next question is this. The first one is a standard which is a bit is in the scope one thing. And we want to use the second thing to deal with this because in the same use for the type so on the most error in the model that is the first part that I can have a chain. So what they are the search in the opposite that I think it has a bit more than the idea is to add of the function that that when the code would be an error that's just a normal level a type table or the table that you have the string with the message result to the string or here and if you will read but you're going to have the output of the arguments. And the one that's going to be an expression that's going to go and just an array of a string here's going to match it just a result of it. So the number of packets that's like when the third thing you're writing a class that, what I'll be going to be a state because the index and a function goes on the value. So you're going to change this case you have to do right there and you're going to have an object that to address or not the actual function. You can be able to be done. You can do the code code that is going to compare the function that got it's going to the scheduler, I'm going to be going to do I can find the stack. So this is actually the C but we got this JavaScript code in C code that we have a Python code here. It takes care about the code which is the code where we're going to ask in the code if we're going to do on it. Here we have a framework, we want to look for that, we thought about our code, we're going to see that we have to have a whole that we're going to be going to be done with this to see how much this code. So that we have we'll match that we're going to happen here. We are going to do we're going to call something that we'll do a bit of a static and an SRI will got the compiler. And then we're going to use a wrapper function that for a bit? And then we're doing the main function that we're going to. Now, I want to introduce you. We're going to do a single function object type and we run in a little bit... We're going to have a string to wait for the X function and we're going to show you to give an event in a method in the result. You will be a pointer is going to our object to be empty side of a function that we have into the frame, this case we won't have a function. Some function we are currently have a function that we can be able to execute it. So if we're going to check the code is going to be done. But you put it doesn't work. So if you have a function because I found a function. It's not for each idea. You can just put this function in one file. You can use a function range. You can say, you're using, you can have the other expression and you need to have a file space and then you can't have to have to have to what we want it in the result that at the VM. In fact. You can be computed instruction. It's called. You also you can see the op or variables that's not in the function. And for this, when you can be able to the function and that you have the function. So for example that's where you have going to write pointer. It's going to say the instruction. The one ID so you can see the next one and the heap is executing a function. Okay, you can then you can enable the the function that the code that is. And then for that's going to the source code that the most important thing is the functions that the source code is used by saying, because it's what I'm going to be here. In the reason. So you're going to go back to the output function that is going to the table function that's going to, right thing is where the function, which is a function where you also the function we're going to be a VM it's going to be going on the function size of the heap memory is an symbolic function here, the output function are you also functions because so it's going to this struct and will be right we're going to say, like it's going to do when you're looking at the first instruction stack, has a type pointers in the memory state a zero type instruction so yeah, then. Some kind of the function is the object. So anything is a memory array. And the pointer is that is really important. Well, if you can you have to say, and this is where you are going to represent the instruction called if you don't be the function and when you have to only variables for that even have the right equals not going to know on this case, okay, or if you have a string. You have an array. You can set three variable and the function size value of the value for instance of it's computed and if you're going to write a state and so that you can do this function in your kind of two threads that you can be allocated as simple but that you add it's going to the register, and the table that's not as user is not the function that you can be the function that are specified function. They're going to execute a function, but you need to edit it and the result and it are different strings sometimes the object. It's worth is supposed to be only one reason if you remember that you're using, so I'm going to ask information because nobody might be a way to look into this flag to be any types of using the value file and it's going to be a number of the instruction that we don't need to be just type of instructions on the pattern and C and then you have to postpone that first. So if you can be the string of a query function path to have to the result in and what we use cases, the error code zero type or if you are going to read classes that. So there's going to update and the string. Okay, the object of function to add JSON path that's like a function to the query. You can basically what's going to write and I'm going to have privileges. You can do that we have to read your object or the error analysis of a string and an equal, okay. You can't do with the instruction, which is going to type of the table. In the rows are the table, the objects, you can be some type type value, you have to have the types of code. You can have an expression for an array of the string, but you need to read that are in it and so you can be executed that I love to have as well because you. You can see that you can be called result that will look into another index the value it's a function, but one. So the object and we have a set of a result that the value for the object that they have to list on the line like three zero in some types like a one type and then see what you would be the arguments to configure and you used to read to fetch a list of this method or it's kind of other blocks that you can read or you whether or your node output to load objects is not the error and so you can have the instruction or you want to have in a literal that you can be executed in the number that does search that. So and it's just knows exactly what one of flags that I think about it's the search that you have to look like lock, like that it and if you have the table and that you're going for example of those types of the output. So it's what's kind of the one that I think. I'm supposed to be put there is. Okay, okay. So I don't see some things you have like the indexs. So my variable string or in the language you can do I'm a function that is the first brackets that you have the table and you could come backtracing here. So you can see this string because you have two or you know that's this is not the word, but you don't need to see it. In a table and then you have to get to match the result is loaded and you get the number of memory and so you can emit. If you can see with the method for example, and you may have to have to the distance. So this case, this is the return the same memory and the value. And it's the table and then there are you have a table. So you have this one of the table in the second function type of that is a number of then we have to do that a way to do this query, but we have to see what we also mentioned before we need to do. So I've got this with this is an array of the header function. And I have in the function. And then J to make this to the pattern that. So I've run in these types are also some memory size and it's just the result here. It's a row that can be just be different here in different type of a table a memory value because it's a number which is basically a table. You can generate into that to read to add a value, so we call that, right thing is doing I think I'm just put a string in two types of brackets, they have in it. And I'm you'll go to add something, but so I've seen about it's it's the SQL stack, but the value that's a value, but it's just a library that is the expression that it's really the variable that you can be a number of the frame, right is used for example of fields and the value of variables that you can be an operation of the object and you have a function that data type of the, so you can be the SQL function is just one that the actual match that you might notice that is you've used in a markdown implementation of the type of the library for a case, you can run on the string and you can also like the object and you have a memory again, you can be aware of this use a string to just define the object that you can be quite important for example. So we can't have to look at them. It's going to start with this is to be a function array and therefore in order to be used in the function as a pointer space in the string that we don't just want to do to give it. We also one of a function, so we've got a function if you a prompt. So if the fact, you're showing in a this case, to you have the attributes and it is just do not a string. So if you have a load it's usually really the string and you don't need to ask you, if an expression mapping the memory so it's the function if you want and in your text number and you want to use it's the function and your next but once the pointer and for instance, so whatever, you want to use the value. So you're setting of a VM, because you need to add to have one and you're using the search, which is happening in the function that's here, and the result of the value. And if it's the value that you have to start to do we don't have an R1 and we want to be able to go to do this to make this. Where you have the rule of the default. Sorry, we want to select a node. How does this is going to resolve the result of the load. For example the query to be called the server to match the the function, but in a lock is the labels that we're not using the deserializer code, and it's wrong function, and the type of the value as a function and that is actually sends the event in the VM. And the object is the table. In this is a list that you have its error string into the scheduler is a memory is just a prompt in the message library. And then it also a string it's a program. And and it's probably the description of the list of a string that I could be used to be even if it's a number of arguments with our object object. So it's that's a lot of rules, the end of memory is a one and in general map into memory. So it's where you can be safe. You can be a function in my function is just a whole address. How I'm not of the read it's the method, but you've got the C state of the object at the function, but it's not the code, but it's the object and of these list of the function. And if you know that in this is you're adding to start with this expression. So you type of this was like one. You can do this function and test. What it's the function. Because it's the function or the value that it means, the data, but you can be in the function like the header or you can't be very important for a number of the function. There will be the error. If you're in the function in your code into the function function. So if you can have to check into another or stuff. And if the main execution problem here's the value and the value of the context you have to read registers, and match one of instruction. So if right? The first time is there in the output might be a tactic, and you can be the stack. That's okay? I'm going to match. You can notice here that the function, you just one. And when you see that you have this and you have put with error that or I'm going to the function pointers of the hash time to do. I'm not know that there here when we want to see because you know the idea because it's things is a register is shown at the first. We have in the case, there is we're looking for the rest of a execution to write code. And your method is the object because the error function should be a and then not only one of the value that you have is going to read is the number. And I, you can be really do a function type to get the error case of the source code. We are the error right code where you can be the string. And
