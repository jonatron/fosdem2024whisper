 He's great to start with this, I'm just looking at the year of a bit of Al Runwia, which is actually a little bit of FSF, but this is a bit more interesting to make it down how we need and the original interface, just saw some open source is that we did a bunch of things to use this We are going to work more into building data and to be able to fix it and open source software and more in terms of data model which all the data and it's getting more software. I have a lot of data base and so you see in a piece of different data to explore what you who will cover that have been doing. So the most of all about this is what we have got been really is going on the last year. He's going to start a long term of all the last year ago so I'm not trying to get some point in the people who have been looking at the University of the railway Commission, we have been working on the European Commission. Today I was in the first year and I think I wasn't aware of the Netherlands, unfortunately, I'm not the first year, we've worked a, because I'm going to talk about in the actual open source that we've got a little briefly going to talk about the good journey, we're going to be, but this year, the source discussion we're going to be there are going to keep talking about having some people in a lot of the room that we are going to try to be speaking of licenses that we have to talk to be able to be sure about the people interested in the resources and we've been there. And then we have been talking to have a lot of business and we want to find people to be made us to reach out to engage into the first chance and see what they don't want to make a bit of a big ones that she has been talked about the right now. He's really a chance to talk. How it? I had the co-peer voice of the International OpenDesk for five years and I'm pretty far as far, okay. So I'm going to talk to be a bit more of legislation in the possibility to be a lot of a government interoperable issue of projects, we had to see that doesn't want to remember the funding to go to stay into the EU Parliament. Let's what they don't think this story was very quickly at the first way for the open source and in open street and there and so far we have already look at this year and this year so here and the funding and so far. And I think we had been talking about how they made in the product. It was a lot of our projects, I got all this year to get started to the work and then people who was in the open source community. The only had. I think, that was the CRA was just had on the day, we also about open source and open source code and we had about 20 years ago and the real time as you have been hearing a sustainable was just because we were open source code. So we was not even to look at the years ago, as of our open source is a long as well, I was quite quickly. And then we did a new challenge had to share it was open source project and trying to keep these amazing and so on the only the outcome. And then we know who had the last year I was working, and we first point of this year. In a wonderful thing to open source project was the first point of the, like a lot of the community and open source world, which may be open source community. But they did we still want to do those organizations now not know, but they get that they're going on that. But they're going to be using open source. So the people also we're going to be able to be in the end, as a problem, and at least I'm hoping that we're going to look at the source. It's the talk about the last thing. But the last year is that I'm going to be curious, maybe they're going to ask a European Commission. So in the community, we're talking about the world and we're talking about a lot of the main person in the work, we're going to look a bit about to have the time to do these open source projects on and how long hour to talk to identify kind of open source and we've been interested in the culture of the top of company. And we're going to, we've got to be trying to be a very important thing about a really aware of that we're going to talk about the last year. I've been like, ten years ago, so that's just, thank you. I'm not very much. Here, but I'm not sure that it's the idea of the presentation because we've been about co-to-to-V to work at the work on and they're seeing the product to talk for coming to be a little bit of the co-exy and about JSSSA that they're going to talk about the previous parts of our first of and then they're going into our open source communities that are often being done in any of the second year, but they've been looking from the way to the law. But a few standards are the world, the US institutions is released. It was one of open source world. And in the next year he is the open source community, it was just there is the beginning and a huge open source community of the whole world to give back to a lot of AI procurement and they don't spent into the current association of money and we've been doing their own skills in open source and helping open source laws. So we've been doing their CEO of those OpenJDK, we have so far a very well as well, but we have so we're doing a lot of open source and we have seen the world and we kind of other people that we could have a lot of been running in terms of have been have the community in an open source and we've been about the open source community. And so we've been the goal of the impact of open source was to organize the community, in here, there were just a lot of the community. So I'm curious and we've contributed to make a lot of people who can be able to get into the question of people to have some love open source projects at open source projects about the end source project for building software and maintainer of you know that you know about. So what he's where you know when I know how. And the world working and the EU and what I was made that we know in the community that we had to move, first aspect of a lot of the community and we were like I know the whole community is a lot of a little bit more in the end of open source community, or many people know it was that in people and we have more, we haven't know there is the beginning of EU funding in German company and that were like the European Commission and we want to take and they are hoping to start to take ideas and the work free to kind of work in open source projects who don't get an S4j who ever seen in Europe and so much away from Europe of the last year, which since 2016, so I've been because it's, if we've been done and he's an idea of women in the first and then I said, I've been seeing some people who was probably heard a lot so I was at the first year, and the moment and he's something because that he was happy. And I was invented as a new community, but at the Commission and the end of years, just like I had. So I thought it was the first thing to train was an introduction to be involved in the market and at the code. And there weren't think we're the first chance to to tell us to talk about the point before you the main problem. We're wondering you know what we're going to identify what we have is we have. It's an open source model between the first step as a discussion that is it's not as you can find this is in that you should see a huge in the future. And the past time I'm not so we have a little bit of this is this year. The question was a lot of what a lot of things that it was quite interesting and I mean when I think about, that we're talking about whether to me, it said that we just a good to start in one of examples that we can solve the last week to take into the team as the community about the whole structure of what happens and how it's happening there is done things that you're looking at the foundation of the left. And of the community was that we were probably the community and I was the right. So I had heard from the presentation, we are also have a lot of the tech, the focus out of the community and that's a bit of people and this is just the community and I think we're working on the right now but what we're going to do in our challenges like give people to you a lot of the end-violence of people in the kind of our ideas in the day. To focus on the most important thing that they're going to share and not going to think of the way to do. It's going to come into a company and we're going to be talking about the first step to ask the car to make sure that the way. And we're going to share the co-time, so do the world of course we do we're going to work in open source and the things when the community will always have a chance to be used in a little bit so that we're going to get this year to do. So there's a lot of these two people who might be able to be in our community and there's a bunch of this project which is a little bit of people have a lot of a little bit of the product and there that we're very interesting year and in the opportunity to have been using and it and they're building it and it going to do we want to tell you the effort, if. And they're getting the talk about the world and we're going to be a community and the next project was there, we're going to get started working on the market. And when I think there's going to join us about that that we saw before the world. We're going to put in the reasons what we have a chance to do we have heard about it up. We've been a whole idea of these sort of the open source person who were going to be some of the person in the audience who got. We have then went to use for people who are a good of these kinds of our customers who were trying to be able to go to have been built off for a great in the people and they had people to deploy our project and many people that are going to share people get their community and we're trying to be enthusiastic about the people who're going to have help out that they're going to benefit to have the people that we need to get started to the first of the experience of that's like we're curious about people in our people so they are going to start. And that they have to get the organizations of what we could have a person who got into your people. I'm doing that's going to be there. They just learned about the stories from the community, there. And they're people to take this experience. And they're wondering. And I'm going to, we're going to have a lot of five years of people who are going to keep all of people and they're thinking of people like they're going to be kind of people. They're not going to say that the people think these types of people I think there's kind of people who do want to think that, they're aware of a people kind of information about. And so on kind of legal person who can be the last up with like, that. And then they're doing the way more often doing and they're going to go into something that's going to a open source development person who all they were looking at everybody who are ever had a good work with this group. And people's just going to do that means they're going to be having this at any time for people and I'm going to be very important to start to ask a developer, right now in the way that is sort of like I'm going to do it would say, people were used in a little bit of a little bit different people who would encourage people to get that. What do they are at the source people in companies and they kind of people, we have a policy and they need to discuss about as I think it, but I'm a way we know what are very interesting to think that they're going into a thing that we can do is we're going to follow in a project. What are looking to be talking about that did. Yep, how we're going to say the community, how do we make this, I'm going to do we're doing the point of that we want to make us in Open Science is going to focus on the European Commission in the project. So okay, I'm going to talk about OpenDesk and about software engineering. And the agenda is I'm going to talk about the first talk. And so I want to come out of FOSDEM program of what they're going to have really need to talk to see and the one of the second talk, I'll discuss with the first of the ones to do? So the reasons why I'm also about 20 years ago, the time. So this is the European Commission and we get to talk about the first why. So we get back, we've got to be wondering. I was in, we're looking for our future and we have a year. We have a question. We will I'm just going to create which was wondering. We've been working on the whole discussion from a lot of the Internet. It's going to work we have time to do for us to find the first time. This is also the idea, really first we're going to work out of the last year ago. The company's the European Commission for a European Commission today we're going to be going to happen in the EU we're going to be the objective in June and if we're going to have been talking about three years ago when we've been going to be going to come in our lives, the maintenance of the commission. So open source railway and we're focusing on the time we're building like just the world. And we are going to focus on our open source project without talking about the end. And we're talking about it and we've been talking about
