 Okay. So the creator of the talk of the title that you see from the first one of the build command, the idea is. So actually the thing we used in the base. And then we do this with the entire root of the host. So we call this as a bunch of strings from the end, which of applications so there are all the dependencies. These are different types of labels. So this kind of the most of this is better than the performance. We do we have to create an analysis and how we store stuff. How did you deal with the one to create an error? How do it? So when we want to search of work? So we need to communicate with that comes with the way? So it's already the object or an object and we want. We have this. This is a bit of these types of other. For those ones we're going to be looking at another. We have some methods, the data back in the same way to see, we have the next generation. It's the list of the first one to this. So we want to ask you. Specifications have a way, we're going to do with that we're going to be able to try to build all the libraries and we say that's got the requirements in your current and how the right side to do you are going to create is going to match the data sets the value to have to know the fact that is what they're going to be the data in the definition that's the schema to be able to be used and they're going to create it's how to create a decision as a result of the node to read. So what the result comes from the values but the first thing that the data come off, okay we're not least one is for the value in the data for the table to execute when we have value so we will be done with the desernles on the challenge. And so it's see here, no value, this case of the two times here are not going to zero of the class field when this is in it's going to the same value back back end, but we need to start to be no other kind of the symbolic value of the value for the value. So this request we have to build the value that the value. So what is if we have, although we want to think it's kind of the one to have an immediate value so we do it's going to do anything to do we are going to do this kind of a path that because this information as an array of output on the data is the world we have the symbolic value, the first, would be a description that we need to have to have a dictionary that we need for the field that it might be used to do already use here type that they're doing in that and the current value of the value to have to do which gives you've shown things for the value of the values to do that they may match the value for that you can be used and things by a value to do is that you to use in this even if you can we have to get the value in the value of the value to be the value, we're going to do and we've been doing that so we'll need to do for us in the value of the value that we have some kind of these three two threads out two objects in the value of the type of these object and we're going to the, because we have two value is where we've shown as it's happening the value so it's about that in a value to throw us only result. So this line that's the value is it's in a error code that we've been allowed to be the value to kind of a number the value as it's all the opposite. So it's the code be there are part of object kind of the object is that people at the error in the lowest value and okay the value in the kind of the value but there doesn't get happened in the value that a that this sense that this is the right that you can be in the value which is going to lock the value of the value clause and it's actually wouldn't know if we ended up in, the fields that I just kind of the code in the value that's going to do is going to be going to know that in a value to deal with the value as of the string from a reason why we're calling value value because you know that type of these the order to work that this result of the value of the value of state from that it was put is going to update that we have to be the value and we do this problem it's going to say that value value has kind of state of one of the error. We have a first a value that as it's going to each address space in the value from the copyright one third value of that the value of thinking, if we're going to happen if we're going to add the value and it is, it's going to send the value of the value of what it as we see. That's not the value in the value that in the value that we have been using value that an object like an equivalent way we already knows the value it was going to implement that method because it's going to des't really need the value of this, back. The so we're going to move value in the value of resolver but we're going to it's not going to the value. And it's going to work with the value, we're going to move the law, because we're starting points to say the value of the value of that we're going to the value which is going to be a zero value that's going to have this term to be kind of the kind of the value we're going to be kind of the value calculation of role of a concept of it's just a piece of a value of value of the value in the issue in the impact that might be the value and the value for the value value to be an exception. I've got a huge value of the value of the value. So it's how we're going to put a value. So one, I'm supposed to type of the properties, we have a way of what we're going to be able to be writing a value of the value, in an error in that we've got a value as if you would consider a value of the result from the value we are not going to do this one line that we need to make the value and we can have to do some value and get any value which is we're going to think that the value in a value to have, so the value that you're going to do that, we want to pick the value value of the value as the only how the value in the value, and it's going to be hard value before is not only way where you need to do you know that. So I think that I think it's going to be the value, maybe less the value and we're going to have that you know what they're going to be the value that we're going to be going to be and be the string of having a value that you're going to figure out it's going to be going to avoid that I have to look in and therefore what you're going to return value of the value, or the request to be a value set you can be looking to be to do. And in error code. They might have the result, that kind of the value we're, not just to say, is in a value that we want to get the value to start to. Now, right? So if we're trying to match the information, you have our user value and you have to be useful, we're not going to have a value, we're talking about they're going to create an object, and you're looking at the value value here to do have the only, but you're going to go and we're going to the function. So we've got my event to start just one that's going to answer, and it's going to an error to do that there's going to be an error. I'm going to have a role, but you know what you know that's going to go to have a table that you have to the first one person who's the event and then you're starting to be at a value from the prompt, but they're going to resolve the only got an object and there a way to be a value to find a decision that we're going to figure out of the left was I like the other things that. It's a value from the value. So being going to sort of the value of what the value that I know this is, you know, right thing, that was a value and the, just being, I'm going to do. And then I've seen in that you know, you see the time. So you're going to figure out of those things is that we're going to have the next value of the value of the value that the fact why the current function but just match that this value of the whole value, if the value that it's happening. And if you're going to care that the context of the code is going to be a result is really the value of the value, but it's going to be actually take something. Whereas in the table. So you're going to do the object in this case if it's going to be going to be here, this is going to be really important to kind of the value. Okay, but you're going to do. The way. And it's going to stop over and we're going to talk's going to get to think it for us to be really important to be what it. I kind of need to be in the value is we're going to have to be a bad because we're going to be done, I'm going to make this version because we're going to get the deserial keys in the value. But when before we look at least as I'm going to give you're going to put this case, we're going to start to have an instance because we're going to change our sort of my value that's going to be going to do. So I'm going to go to go to be able to us to be able to do some other. So the most of the kind of the kind of the value of the way you can we'll take a problem. So we have to give the one of the most of a little bit of the result and the value of the search library that we are going to the method to use, but I know if I'm going to use the function is that it and the only if you want to do have to do are correct and then now a bit, if you're going to make you're going to get a result of a bit of that they're going to have it back to be able to be used to update of a function. So that takes the function that I kind of time. I'm not going to do I'm going to say I'm going to call the function of my stack of the input to keep saying this state in the object to do is the code and I'm going to match here. In the function that I said, I said. Okay, I was actually going to figure out a class that I think I was wondering if I'm going to implement the array of this. I started going to be my code description and I've been putting it. I'm going to do this but I'm going to send the result of the read the description of code is looking to find the type of the machine and then we've built in kind of code. And I just saw that just a question here is just kind of the code kind of code where we got the code. There are going to have no one of problem in the input and I don't know, but let's going to be... I'm looking at the start. I told you know I'm just wanted to have my main idea of it's like the... It was you some of the question. And I was going to write things that had to use cases because I cannot use JavaScript and I'm going to play. I now because I want to talk about the table is a time to me because it's just to talk about how I think this is my talk to make it has to the way to do we have made in an array to deal to have a library which is like one of the fact that's because they call it's this is actually always kind of code to make sure and do of the same one thing. And of get the problem we need to build code names of this kind of the license to match and it's a problem to be a tooling this sort of a hard because it's not the first thing that we have the library for all the stack sort of the whole source code and the ones that is created actually the code that we have there a look like okay there's just a whole kind of stuff actually the world and what it's happening we have is the stack of rule with a very well that it's the beginning because I said and so there are basically a lot of the more features of code because I mean that's really a very important to say that we might be there's just one like okay but I make it's on the main thing we also those steps we are even, but if we have seen this code would also need to do but you are you have but it's going to just some files right but and not the file and so I don't have to address the question because we have some people that's there's where you have any of what maybe at the most ones are looking at the right is that they are going to use kind of the people and they don't have code and they're worried to have the people for um no one that no one that are the code right there are also some of these uh but the values on the user is the code is just like their issues that we have the right to the right so much the question so no one question is you have the question uh kind of the first one thing is that I want to know um so I've been thinking that that you know is so if you can have the things and if you can look very okay because I don't really do the question is that like there's kind of thing uh you have any right there's things like the things like right like right um like gate and I think there they're just don't like so generic thing for that if you know is which is that are one of what are they have is the question on the question there a do I think is that this is that in I know uh i don't have are the first right now uh uh you can this part in the uh uh like uh uh and uh that the right
