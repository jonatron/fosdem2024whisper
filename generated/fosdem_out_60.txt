 Thank you very much. 
 So thank you very much. Thank you. My name is an everyone. I'm coming for us have to do a very much for that will be talking about 10. When we're coming from last one two two years, we've been wondering about the Fos? I'm going to talk about the last year I am using Kreachy the first 10th and the last year. So I am a little bit of two years before there's a short introduction about 20 years before. I'm going to be wondering about the year ago we've worked over a few minutes. And the last year. And ago, I've been that I had a couple of people in my career in June, and I had a bit of many other kids who are doing them in open source projects that we should share with the developers as well in the world we're going to know what we made in the community did. So I'm an introduction about the last year of the last year at being a discussion we are going to be interested in a minute, but we have been working on the story and we are going to talk I want to discuss about a lot of the first six months ago and also a little bit of the day. They are those European Commission. And you can do have to summarize the projects for instance of the different projects which is that is a huge impact of the ones. Let's open source that happens when I think on to the first time I think for the only ones to look at the code and the first of being I'm very very excited about digital public world and with it's a long time to be the European Commission. So this is the first thing that we were about open source community and the educational company's not only something that the open source with the first year I think that was a national Commission. And I am part of these are we started in the years and the world of half years. So the community of the world and we have been doing a bit of digital science science, and we're just doing and we are like a good funding to discuss the world and also the people who said is the time I don't care about. And so to think about the European Commission. So we would say we have the years ago, and the European Commission, we're a year, we have been using all know, but we have been getting started making the EU to the very quickly working with the EUs. So I'm showing here about the European Commission, I was a European Union of us about 1-to of the European European Commission, that we heard is in the European Commission in the public European Commission and we had, and the European Commission had internally through the Commission had a very good thing that I think we have of people that for the European Commission in the open core software. And we've moved to talk about OpenGI And in Europe standards for the railway community was really have we had to have been a lot of the last year. It had had these of the last year from the European projects in 2017 later on the European institutions are working years of open source in the world. And the EU scientists were started Europe Association and then at Germany we were in the beginning. It was the German Commission and they had a number of the open source world. And last year, at the CRA. And there was working years ago. And I thought it was a point of open source in 2011 were a open source law because we started to have the IT on the EU sector interoperry scientific commission was saying we have a third week in Europe and German government, there is open source in Germany and they actually discussed in German sector to the place and we're currently have a certain European global railway and the solar digital EU projects that he said by a business. And we'd also had to encourage the European Commission we did scientific railway and since 10 so I'm happy to engage from Europe and the foundation and to Germany. And the EU EU panel. So I could, for European Commission, particularly I think about the goal and I was our commission was to be in the German rights in US women. And a much of the German law because I currently the civil sovereignty and the court I was going to the European Commission in the fact from the GPL law. And no Drupal is a European Commission of open market, but the German EU initiative is a EU commission to have was a open science and being a national law as there was very open society and we're most of so this technology and the co-Bomb funding to do we have the day zone of the commission and the market over PL7, for the PLD, and in Wikimedia technology in 2018, which was developed a government and their software and the European Commission has brought the tragedy of legislation. And the EU sovereignty that open open Germany. So we have also have a social sector. And then in the factories that has to know the very good point of the past Foundation and they told we have, we have a European Union. We have moved to go into the time and we had to the Commission in the future to this year to do we had funding in the railway rights level and then that have a science science, which is difficult. We were a community with the EU as we also give to be possible to think over time to what is not a European Commission for this because our first area of the EU funding to be only as a bit. There were the commission that we would be a big methodology about the European Commission that open source company would be to maximize us to provide it. And the research in a different world and most of this is not legal aspect of the copyright market and the ones, and the US that we would be open science and a regulation in terms of a company, which was the first year. And I had really just thought that the challenges, a clear in the tragedy is required to be one million legislation, which is still in a lot of our law. And now the theory was the end we have a huge world of a lot of the world. And then to make it would be as well focusing world that the product in many companies would be able to be great part of the largest European Commission before we can be a decision about the world that they have had to be possible to do a panel actually to look like this. Some people were really to talk during the world. And it was not at the law. And that they wanted to be able to do this civil society and they had like to kind of the moment they had a huge idea about research and we had to create as we found out of what we have not heard about the world. And I've been having a lot of thinking about that's important one of years ago, we could give in the government in one year with open source. And we're going to think I'll be wondering how the other developers just to be getting a group that more money in the definition to emphasize that we're going to bring that would like they are not heard about and then in France and they have a lot of people on they're looking at free product and they've got down the first sentence that they're trying to be. They're now both of the world. But there are a big one we have a tech funding towards it's workshop in these principles and I've used to have all but you're super interesting ones for the EU and the other institutions and then here you're very fast the companies will be the things to share the EU law and we've been. We've benefited the EU economy of these companies that they've got struggled around that just got all the CRA will be very loud software at this technology. It was actually been their software who said, which is on a copyright and the US researchers who are still been part of the fact that is a lot of legislation and they've been in US in Europe and they're in the commission and think they have been doing so they've heard of people who've got a lot of open source legislation, who helped us and the first of a copyright thought that she's not going to introduce our society, and the first idea to be paid and I think of the actual law and let's generally as I'm gonna be very happy to talk to make a general. I'm sure that we're hoping that I'm not sure that people have been in there's the world, because I'm just talked about a lot of law has been the copyright, I'm trying to read-party open source person and so I'm in person and I'm going to choose and I'm the last year ago where those who I've been talking about an educational law who does I'm not hear of the court that they thought at the first one place that came in the law and when they would take a volunteer was an organization, but the commission did they want to be a person. And he was very worried to be here are like a young staff that we saw this is already and so. And I think there is the first I know. But yeah, they're in the commission here in the least we've got our European Commission and if they're back to take this idea that. It's very good thing I know as you know you're actually know what it's not always the product is, really just saying that they don't know what they can we can have to try to take the community and we're looking at least a moment and they're going to do that at there to find the commission. You know what people out. I think yet all the commission's trying to be going to understand. We're going on being looking into the issue for the reason we had a place. That was that they need enough, they're going to think a good people to get a majority of all the right that you know in the first just just felt about it's what's like there's happening there. They've had a good idea. They have no person, but it's a good to be in the way of the internet. They're quite a survey I think of people there in the idea but we're out that. They're all good for now have been had just you know that. They're not a community were looking forward to a small idea that they haven't were still know if there's a panel in the room that I think it was more than you think you know. They're a slide that they're looking at the right away where the beginning. Why don't had really need any of the time. We need to figure out of the panel was somebody thought you would like I think these problems. And what I was just had a question to create a bit better thing just wanted to contribute to know about the trademark, and they heard in the law we were just got a copyright. So let's what should have been in the parliament just wanted to do it. I want to have just wondering and with the fact that you'd be a huge law that's the law, one of funding for the question. And the fact I'm being asked me, yeah, I did they come away to my opinion here because they're not a copyright I don't know that, I'm not saying, but yes, it's going to start to be a more decision. But just in the fact that the right now that is getting a question. Maybe is for me, maybe just we're like. And we have a the first one of the issue on the question. Now that the directive, it's just just not really a bit of the best practice. We want to ask for the most people will be aware of the people who is, we have been not aware of some way to make sure that we need to be aware that that and that we have all in any questions there. We have been heard it's okay, but there's, I think that that's what we said, no more efficiently that we have seen the result. But this case, I think we said this is actually there's the idea that the thing you know the beginning, but there is also a software can actually that I think for a comment that we are there's a problem. I think you know, yeah, nothing that's not all right? Or it's meant that we have the question? And then there are the question, so in the question. For example, well, this was about the question was, but how we've been doing, it. But the reason I basically does it doesn't know what we have, more question I mean, but for the question was about that don't really, why we are actually don't know that, like we have to make sure. Yeah, but we're coming from the human readable for, like, or something. Where are there are, many people with these I'm looking at least. I can't think about these things that we have seen as do is still know, but there's another question. It's the question that's just one more in the question. And when we started around the time where we have been starting to get a lot of that need to say, but obviously is there's only two different things the security, the question. But in the question. And that the question is I can the question, and are still quite better to have to think about the question is the big question about the most more or three questions like like it, but the right? So it's important to the one, like the question, the different ones that we already like, because as a question was on the question. Yes. So if you know, the question was, if you have to repeat the question. Yeah, right? Hi. It's all the question there is which is, how do that we have have at least have seen it in terms of the answer. And they need that. We have a question to consider a question. Yes, is, are the question. So anyway, we might I think, I think it's the question is the question. It was quite important for the question, we already with a question. And I guess we have a question is the question. Yes, how we have the question, so we are there was thinking about the one question was like in these questions? Yeah, the question you're aware are the question? I said this is what we welcome. I think it, we take the features that answer. I'm not as I think is that the question. It was in fact I think we have a question. And yeah, so we can this question. So actually
