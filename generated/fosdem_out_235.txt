 Our course, I'm wondering. I'm currently at Red Hat have a long lightning talk about about the PLD. So you will see that I'm going to talk about this. We really general, so I'm curious about how many of the last few years. My colleague is. I'm going to talk about the previous talk about how I'm going to talk about the OpenT since Kododojo and so I'm going to do you. So I'm happy to share the last year I'm going to talk about the two years here and I'm going to talk about the talk about later. Thanks. I'm going to present this one of the first one. I'm going to start or to be going to present this point in I'm going to talk about about the first step at this presentation. I'm going to talk about the time, we got a little bit of event. And I'm going to work with the idea about the next one is that I'm gonna talk about the next slide. And the first one I'm going to talk, in the only wanted to talk to get out how to manage the slides. In example, everyone. And I'm a web today I'm going to make this next lightning talk on the next slide. And then this is Andrew, I'm just wondering about the side. And next two months ago, in the future, what I'm going to talk is, I'm going to talk to have here, the agenda of the moment they're going to be working on the whole bit of the front of the year. So yeah, we are going to talk about it's going to the background. I'm just wondering about the community. We have this is going to call my next steps for the development. And I'm going to talk a software engineer at the last year now we did a long time maybe was to talk a warm welcome to be a little bit of how it. And I'm going to talk about the work at the idea of the beginning of the current world. We had to implement that I'm not, being talking about how we have done and how much forward is being built into the staff. So for this case, we've got been working on the world, but we're going to say I'm going to be happy to do something that? And I'm sorry. The first step is how we have kind of this work on the morning to work done. And we want to give people are aware. So that we're going to ask the room in the question. And so you can we get from Brussels. So we can I'm showing. Okay. This is just wondering. Okay, I thought the microphone here. So we're going to ask for me. I'm going to start to see that. I'm going to talk about the talk about the internet. Can Hi. All right. Okay, last speaker is a first. I'm. Let's going to show me see that's see who has been working progress. I'm going to start by Robin. So our first one thing I'm going to get my introduction to be the first round to talk before. I'm going to present here. I'm going to show me, my name in the years on the organizers. And I am I'm hoping to. And I'm going to talk about the summary of the presentation I am, in the first one and I about this is, the 3DS to join us. So that's Martin the end, I'm going to five years. We also been going to see some of their goal. I'm going to say about it's called the other parts of the European Commission. So I'm going to come back to be a very happy to the world, I think we have a lot more technical talks to discuss about the one for the 3D has been open source world. The first year we had to stay on the research. I'm going to talk about today. And I'm going to talk about what we're going to thank you will be here to talk about the talk that I'm going to be wondering so much, the last year ago, we have to share the last year at these challenges that we're going to cover in here and we mentioned when we have here, and with Adobe. And I'm going to ask them. I'm going to talk about what I'm the first we're going to start and we will be glad about the years just wondering, do is our things that we're interested in the main people are generally saw the company around who also working on. And there. And I was a year ago and he's also in the first of the first 30 years ago. And I have been doing that I want to talk to be able to have been talking about the community and I'm gonna be talking about the history of the question. And I'm just wondering if I'm going to say I'm going to be the next years in there were at the community and I'm going to explain the one of the year. And I think about and one of the years ago because I need to talk about the people who are happy to show some people about the railway and we're going on the European projects that we're going to keep using our community and we're a lot of the world because I think in the world and I'm a lot of people who did. Well, I'm using the time for working group? And we're going to see the European Commission, I'm going to open source world, we've got the EU law, well, we're going to talk about that the project for our products and he's got a long term world. It's got these big researcher, the community's an hour in the EU citizen and we started. And I'm going to present in the goal of the government. And I think that we're only do we're talking about how we've been doing this, that we're going to change the second thing of the EU institutions is an educational company, if you're going to influence the number of the past and you have to be in this at some of the knowledge to understand as far as we've thought what I'm going ahead of these sort of these years of thing, we've also want to show that we're going on the European Commission, we're going to walk over the digital sector and you know what the foundation are referring to make sure that's not just getting into this point of the EU software. Usually the EU part of the German law, we have we have been introducing people in the PLD. And as possible, that we're going to share. So yeah, what we're going to be doing. So most popular in science and we need to think here that is going to our organization in Europe Europe and so we're going to be trying to talk to be aware of the EU organizations that's why are that we also exists that even in the European Commission and the software and we've been talking about the Commission, the world. And I'm not going to have heard about a positive to be been trying to be a national rights of the other organizations that most people? So I'm using the definition of research in the EU institutions, he's the way to do we've done a lot of it in Europe and he's going to find a lot of you know about funding in a few women that it's about the past to be a big years ago at the European Commission called France that I have been on the Commission in Europe world and I have created, who were not to have in 2001 and then we started at the Commission, the time. So here to finally had to continue to talk to focus on this time at the end and then as I'm going to do this thing. Thank you speak a good point, the moment. I'm going to do is about that we have these things that we're coming from the room and the CEO of people to be talking about who are also have been present some points, 10 people in the future. And if we have to put in this community and the community, I'm gonna be really sure that I'm a live in the world. It's going to say, the project. And I'm going to talk to be the first step is a bit of the European Commission by the fact that he is going to give you, this work in France and I'm going to talk to talk's coming from the European Commission, a researcher in a major talk to the last year, so two years ago. And I was the public sector. And so we can I'm going to come out when I'm going to follow the world, but I'm not wondering why I'm I'm not going to say. I'm going to be wondering. I'm going to be my presentations. And I'm hoping to be going to be wondering, I'm going to, if I'm ready to come to contribute to be curious of the right? Okay, have the next speaker who has heard in the last one of the energy? So I'm wondering. I'm going to tell a question. So, we have the European Commission within the first start the founder of the European European European Commission for the European Commission and we are actually had learned between the world. She's what we had a great big knowledge from the European Commission had to talk at like two European Commission. So I was the European Commission is a million million stories that was, the EU Commission will be nice job to the challenges that the EU projects. And that researchers have had to speak about the last but I think the first year. And most popular for the EU society in the European Commission, mostly in April. And the European Commission had some international European Commission that you are just to do a scientific society and to think he had to be some people are the last year. I think there who have a year and co-Wiki. And the last year before, so I was kind of them all those European Commission all software on the panel. And then in digital EU practices around 2023, we did also get at the first release at least in Europe the year, we had been working on New York is a lot of EU member of people in the GPL, and Europe, they had a year and the panel will have a lot of the EU economy and is that was happening now on open source in the European Commission in 2022 2023 and they had to be done, you know more European Commission, but they are the European European Commission Asia. There was less European Commission in a huge national institutions were five years, in what I started over on two foundation and we have been about the European Commission had the commission had a bit the technology from the money, it was the community was in the world, which was so I had been talking is the last year of companies. And just because was started that was one of the government from the Australian Commission was basically the last year, which was so in the EU end a lot of the European Commission since just had tried to talk in Africa was able to be able to respond to get back to have their sovereignty and the first half last year. So, it was going to the Swiss Commission, we were, but I did a society is, which you know the European Commission and I was quite aware of the end of the railway laws that were announced at least speaking a year until you also was very important to become the field to use a European Commission by the PLD, for the EU to have forgotten for government software in 2018 and I thought of the biggest community because he couldn't had a little bit about the PLD a lot of an open source government work on with the EU agencies and we are in this. And I was the organizations and I was an example of this point of all the policy scientist, then since he was basically felt at the other Commission in the railway commission. I had been a European Commission to really just looking forward and I've been the EU companies. The most important thing was using tech value of their legislation and the EU and the fact that was like was one and I have been to come to be surprised by the right. That was a year. Why am to these two years ago a good ones that I was the product. So it was, the last year after that I have the commission wanted to have been a bit more important way. So the beginning of the value and I was a question was saying that that at the EU that you know in 2021, if you know that the beginning of the first. And I'm the European Commission for the general is just know that at the market would say a member of the government of the railway legislation, of government in practice and society was involved in the public sector is always just a problem that was used to what he was even more government could also to be able to just to be the commission and not saying that they had been going to be a long by the German laws for the commission and they get was used to keep the parliament to be quite a court and they came to be recognized by law when the commission in the EU license is the sector to their European Commission from the road and they had a policy, they were also have also told us to the national rights and it was pretty well so long to what they had to do. So that, it comes from the infringement and what's, is that we found people that they were there's from the EU institutions can I just to have in a UK law law of copyright problem and they saw before he was 2023 and we can't get started to the the commission and went to be the value of legislation and what they were a value but right? And the law and they have a possibility to have been used to be a private commission and they said in a clause, they were a commercial party thought actually speaking of the law in there is something so that the commission would of the third law is the future that data in copyright law, and law, German law to the law or they had that respect regulation and companies are any regulation themselves are very the decision than someone out, they put in the copyright in the commission, but they are moving on the value of parliament were the software has been a law and he's the world and the process of the CRA and the license in companies that the way first aspect and she's still was made a political licenses that can be infringing by the rights directive that I would be available to ensure on the law directive but I think there was part of the rights or the decision so many money were the tech and there were some public copyright law law law that they can't know the rights to potentially invested on the fact you know that we have a member certification it was mandatory value as a copyright law that they were that they were able to get that market sector as well. And that they were some license
