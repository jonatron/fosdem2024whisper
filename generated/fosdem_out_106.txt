 OpenJDK, which is the TPM, which is the LN. It's of the OpenJDKs, which works, and Rust are in the moment, including all, and new kinds of things that. So the implementations of those are a project, which is your binary, and they have some sort of the fact that they have to just look for the source code. So you can see here is how you have a new version of a lot of your code. So this is a very interesting to expose it as the right thing that I can look at the point. So I need. We do I want to do with a lot of things. I think about it. We've got to do with this way to do it. So, I can add some kind of a community that. Then we can browse the native code. And then add a little bit of where I'm going to look back to the new code that's going to have one of the code. And if that I'm going to have a little bit of the code. And one that's going to tell me what we've got to play that we have on. So we've got an answer two cores and see something that at the difference what we wanted to introduce us is that I'm going to have a bit of our code. So we have a bit of the code for our page. It's going to see the JavaScript, the previous one thing of the program was important thing in the future. We want to know what we have is a lot more than just want to be really important to expose the most important thing. We need to deal with before, of the future. We're actually want to be used to give some dependencies, we've got the same versioning and we want to make new package to compile it the code to tell you going to use case it's not having to be able to build and in the library. We have to be a kind of a bunch of a version of code to work. And then we did that we care about Ruby code base, actually have a bunch of a really hard thing that is to do that we have the compiler libraries that were all these tools to know, and so it's what we're going to do is going on top right? So one issue we've got had to be able to do is even of the implementation in the right? It doesn't going to be kind of the code called array that we're going to do, but it works for us. We've got a pre-profit, we want to do that has to call our API to build up to be able to do this and do. So the library, for that we're going to have our library that would we want to do a bit more things want to do that we're going to have to load. We're going to solve that we want to happen the API that we're going to do just going to take it so we're going to do this. But I'm going to do a lot of our issue there's going to be going to show this going to be again that we're going to do code in the important. So we probably it's going to start we're going to say, we've got in this is again mentioned in the app and we've got to go out there. Go routine and give a few of what our work. So we're going to our project, we've got an application that we're going to keep going to share here and we're going to figure out of how we're going to start our own APIs on our team and we're going to work a project. But we're going to get, you need to build a community and we're going to do this new contributor to do that. The first step is going to be going to give that's an approach for our local agent. First of doing this great. So we've made our CI code is very hard to make sure that we have very important to have to create your data to know who are trying to do this information. So this, right? So that's useful is you're going to tell our experience in the definition of the best of the project from all about an API, this job, let me, what it's work. I'm going to say I'm going to start with a talk about it's going to do. But I'm going to show you'll start to hear me, but I'm going to do this program. And here is what I'm going to get to talk basically about how many people about me today, but you have been saying we... So, and sort of these kind of know what I'm going to show somebody from the LLMs. So I'm going to do we're going to show you about how we're going to do we want to generate a lot of a whole bunch of other people who wants to have to look at least I'm going to like I'm going to hear me. And I'm sorry, if I'm going to know what's going to do I'm going to talk to take the question. And I'm going to look at the first to be a little bit, I'm super excited, like. I'm going to make it. So I have in a bit of the next-the-to-end. Okay. I'm going to thank you who is going to see you. I'm going to let's a bit me give me go back to the last-to-fi. We'll talk to you guys. The first? So the first thing we will talk is the last part of this is a little bit of the first one of the standard in the talk before, the modern game was a bit well yesterday was the middle of the ground a bit. And the world was very first aspect of the most important is one that we had the new the front end system. It's what I had in my school back to do with the FOS and so we also from the first year before and also. And also shown in the moment. So the moment I'm just need to leave? I'm going to send it actually going to work because I'm going to be wondering, I'm going to show you may present here? I think it. Hello NextCloud. It's online and we did about going to just wondering. We also mentioned, let's quite a lot of the first talk, we gave me see the first two years ago, and I were going to 2. I don't have some video is the University of the voice field. So that's good. Then we had, we have this year while I added to go to see what we've worked on the last year at the battery, and then. So, I would like the presentation for the day. So I'm going to like I'd like I'm just put him next time. These three years ago and I'm going to talk about, I'm going to come up to the last year ago, so we were to continue to be going to get the slide next week we just wondering if we had to wait for our work on. We've just worked with the first one. What else we've seen the morning we get a couple of the introduction, we had a Raspberry Pi 1, right now for Kuzagog the year to a little bit more and that you of the University of the 7. Also, 7th and 3.7. Today, and 1. So I've got a very funny talk about 1.6 in this year. So I was a year before we thought we had an office. 20 years ago, a number of the last year.6. And so what were a year.8 in23, and as we've got earlier. But that's basically, I'm a bit of open source and I'm going to make the time to talk or three months later and he's of FFT. And after the first and very interesting idea is about making a little bit about how you today you think the first one that we've got a lot of a lot of a little bit of those for this case for the release process of the 3 and the project does the year ago, in Italy was basically there was in June at the last year and that that we had released Blockly, so, we had before, at the release dates. And I did that. And thanks to speak on my little bit of the year. So we had to talk about the first three things for the year. I had to get about us during the project, but we were in the year ago, especially on the last year ago how I had started it was just got a lot of time. I was a bit old years ago, so we've had a little bit of developers at the world and we've got the slide was saying we've been looking at a lot of the sort of time and then going to continue working with small year. We had the first release in 2022 and we were being released that. And we thought, we'll have a lot of a lot of things, our, which was having to continue to do. We've been talking about the six months. So I decided to talk about is also have been about how the first thing that we also 2023, but we saw it work and I think it took the release, we done a little bit more, not as the year. Then that and we went into the year ago just a lot of the things we have the time to be on and we're talking about some of the current release that we can put a lot of the 80s being the work on the release of these workshops and they were looking at the team we've got out in Europe at the world. And so we're going to do that's going to do our European Commission to turn out that. And then, oh, okay, I have to talk was going to talk about a hard at what I should be talked about our front release for those time. So if that's fine on. So we've been doing is we have been saying, they've made a moment. And we need to call that you need to do. And then you could definitely call the year and you can see that stuff where you can see the money like we've been talking about some people did you saw them. And then the next term that we're looking to do is that? We had heard about the commission and especially in the first one of the European Commission that the PLD had to be reached a bit about the parliament and European Commission and the EU and their court of our first year. And it was a pivotal party community. And I have really got the commission. And in this is very long term. I came in the AI methodology of a moment was announced the Parliament, but I was a long term is going to be an organization. And we had a lot of the product of leadership area towards the EU funding and they said like an open source product and the US engineers who were talking about the long term of our companies to have had also a lot of communities in June a co-maker and the last year. So I was also, but this year. And if they had a good point of people who was the university and when you know the world of open source companies and then we discovered the whole government of a very important. There's one I remember the first to have the world and a lot of the negotiations of people to think the European Commission in 2017 in the first day that they are there are and they say that were also do a huge business were like they're open source standards in 2021, they did we have been able to do to think about sovereignty and the company and you just had heard about the world and they're starting to make the copyright as a better. And they started in the challenges and they probably was in the fact that I'd allow them in this day, the data to take that they're going to be the software and they're interested in and they had been able to be very much as well for the way to be a professor for public law and they were not really a democratic open source movement is allowed to work that in the first of the license in fact just the first year I think one of the German law the CRA was the law and all the city is the fact that this law. So the EU regulation made by the regulation in our product, if they've been the American law, the railway law directive law, they're actually they're going on EU public government's more important to be a German law. And we're in Europe. So it's the law that's a copyright holder would be better to be for that some regulation. So there's my first problem. So there was to be a law and a infringement now in tech and there is the German law and open source field and since they're a copyright value here, generally aware of the law that someone with the parliament at the notion at EU law, and or law law and the car's the commission law in the licensee was because that has shown of law law to open market commission and they're using an government decision or so they could assume the EU key, and they have, they did they're re-time policy scientist, they know that we're going into decision that know about law that they're not as much a, if you could tell the term because I think of you have a directive because that this was just did, that we got a copyright and this is a law and I'm going to know that they're going to be thinking about the public law that but they would say kind of society that there was paid the copyright sector, so they were two law government and they don't not fully opinion in scope in the commission who haven't see that they're at the commission to the law, which should be also be. So they didn't look at the law, which was just told me to because they been the council, what they always got but their German licensee would work that they've been not really because they'd like a value of law didn't been trying to think they're interested in a value for the first point they're at respect to be able to have as far. They don't really need to share any capacity as well in the EU value of the value of it's the court that they're not going to realize but he's that they have it at what you're going to be making a decision and they just asking that market and then they're going to do who sort of I'm going to come to know what when you ask the product's going to walk into the first to be better but they're going to bring the railway commission to companies who kind of you're not just going to you know that, on the world for you tend to need to be paid for
