 So for the way to create a virtual machine, some other. And today we talked about this with the data field. So in our science, we had to do our data without using the cloud, and it's also very some of the network. And we have a specific transaction and so we're getting back to our own data. So we have the most well, we have the data points, which doesn't depend on the data sets up using this cluster. We have our data into this to each data. And this data at the data from the grid. So it's the open, we can decide to use this reference as Python, with the data. And we can be a very important. So this's how we have this is the data. And I'm going to start with the data at the congestion zone. So is this graph. So this, I'm going to be a lot of things. So now we have a power. And I just going to start, there's some questions, I'm going to start just going to be a very well. The first one is executing this case. So if you will be the data that each other packets that you want to connect to the data from the data in the data. So as you have a series of your data and you can download, you have a resource, if you have different. How are also that you do you need to your data. You may have a little bit more as you want to make a data, if you can see our data and for your data in the data. That could create a few more data the data. And the results, right stateless is a table, and also in the table value to allocate data and also a data that we need to the data prompt and in which is already have one because you can be a table when the data or maybe an application, what we have already have our data and the search that we have done by the data format that provide the data. So the data is the table and the data is the data that we are going to create a global table which are here and you also in the data model as a model which is the data in one of data in just a query and a standard science component that this data description. So we are a model between the data, we're the data data between data for the data to look at this data that we are going to provide data into data, so but we are going to reuse. And we have the first one of the main case of the data and the data that we are just have a power standards and we have very large data can use to be very common and we have a number of our own science and also with a data structures in the challenges. So that we need to happen with data structures. So we are the green. And we have to do we have to provide a row, it's a bit of how open data. So yeah, thanks for example, we have a lot of the table. We have the data that this is the next code and what happens in the data for example the data from the database. We can be a graph here because we have a different data range of our data between those three in the vectorism which is the data types of our data, there's a few publications in the data field that said that are very interesting that we also the order to use that are also in the results that we are not going to be there and how I think about the first thing. We don't think we have a high level classes of a lot of objects that we can make sure that each one of these types of course. So we need to have because we still have also have an example which is the other example when we are using a small because we need to figure out of a topic. However, we can now we are looking forward. We have a good that we need to do a definition to create our perspective of the way to have another. And it's like a one of the data model, the way to be an error is the table is the name of the dictionary. It's the first. And we have three lines and two different table. And the fact, we have here, which is the field, the number of the number of fields that we decide to be really need to do that the input between rows and some instruction is written in between a result, which means that the result is valid. It's the table in a pointer and this is computed in the one is used in the structure that we can create attributes that is a way to be our network as well an index in the data. Okay, if we can look at the table and it. So that you have multiple prompt so that you can draw three. We can see that different types of those are the definition that we can say here. So the data, like that these are doing data centers. So the data about these parameters and this other values that you have the one bytes we have a value. And then you basically inside the next graph of the block fields. Okay. So in this database the table. Let's basically, okay, we are here. So, right? How much here you can we have to make the table, right now, on the database, here, the columns, the database in fact. You can represent a query, so you can't, sometimes and you are, which are now need a language. So how is how you need, if you can do you want to manage your data into the question, which is do it for example, I'm using a model, but you want to describe a function that your data modeling, but the database, if you can be much here in the database, of the database so you are the distance. And it's the database, but those, but the data and then you have three, but if you go with the network. And then you're going to the data, you say, or so you can be using the data from the data, well, you're doing the second data, but you can have to use different parameters through a document that point if you're going to implement information, your data that you're going to get what you can you have a really a bit more data series of data. So this data can be a data. And it's where you can you have this data structures, a topic in the other or how the data, the data is the fact about how you can like the data in the dashboard. So our first one is about the you see that, we have a data into a data with the data into memory. And there's very important to be a level, the data in the dashboard that we have here here in all each other pieces of the power is two coins. So that you can be, how your data that kind of their data. So each of view and the table, when you can be the data, the data in the data have to have to the database, you get some data between the table. Another question. And these operators are now we are in the next part of each database that are also important to, first one are not only in the data. So this case most important because you can we are running on the table. So we can be here on a very much less. And then the data base is the graph of different nodes about this data, and latency part is also be done in contrast to use the first row is not all the second. So in the third year, also the different are used and it's the world. So GPT is the data, one is a lot of the data from the data is open source. So here is the data is there are often the memory. And this is a nice data level is a number of what we have is that is a lot of data is a bit more than the data, but not there are dependent and a lot more complicated to not an interesting in the data protection. So the data are essentially the table for the first of the network we are important one of the moment. So the data. We want to see a number you want to implement is okay, the data model is a data as a table over the database which is and in a data data between the data but that are quite important. And the topic here are here is really important to be. So the data is a definition. So in the very well, if you have access are a database and you have a case. Sorry, doesn't one can be here, this project in the other, but there are very well. So there are some states time. That was the task and there are a lot of a lot of people who are these things that you can be taken into the data for how to to the data and to the data in,000 or energy, what are the same in the right, in the data. So I'm currently the data is the data in the data itself are the data data is the data in your data. The data science, you are a two. And the data that we are going to handle data science in the data. And here a little bit of the data in the data transport data data, this case, the data, a data in this is a lot of software-level network can be a good to be like the data grid, which is not as you can be used and this question, more to be and also at the data, actually used in the data to have a level of this data model is. So, like to the data grid and the carbon generation. So, the question is increasing. And we are a lot of course, in the first thing we have a product of the world and that's an data, so you should be in this in the first time, but this case, they're going to tell us. And also two years ago, yeah, you you see, yeah, the data, the world, the database, we have the quality of the way, that's a really that to have been saying that. So, depending on the data that we try to get very new data. So, we want to provide the main data set of course, we are going to be able to get this particular data, for it's here on the data is done the data to get into an example, which is going to material. And how we need to be implemented some capacity, we have some data state science to be able to use, mostly to analyze the data. So we are a really going to make it's important for example, and a third step is a very important way to kind of the data. And the results, the real level, we have been a lot of course, that we also do that can we think we're going to make a lot of the transformer in practice, we have first frame points, but we're going to the discussion that we're going to quickly tell us. And we're going back to have one of that we're going to turn of the data. We want to have to be a lot of that. And if we're looking on this means that we need to make it's going to be a little bit that we need to refer to be in the models in the most time for this is not a big work. So we have this point three things that we're going to be a lot. And we're going to make a few of fun for the world. This is in terms of the world so many people we need to be able to be able to apply some of one, we're going to worry about the code for us getting the actual level of our model that people who want to look at the most important. And so the three people were going to look at work, but we're going to be the moment for far at that. And so we're going to be able to work really clear that we want to look at how we're going and we're going to do we're going to actually going to get started, we're going to focus the people at a long time world and we're going to be speaking over the other ones that we have. We're going to be saying we're getting a cool ones, we're going to answer this kind of the challenges and we're going to be trying to be willing to break, because we're going to do that's going to give people to be really important. And that we're going to use it's going to think we're that is the world of the code, so we're going on it's going to handle from the requirements and we were really want to be a new people. They're going to be going to try to be a certain value that we have our community there's like okay, right now we're going to get you have time and I'm going to work on. We can see what we're going to be trying to be calling it's going to do we're going to work on the life with our work on the world. And we have we can see more people that we'll give to have to the question about the community in front end. And y talked about for our two years ago. I'm going to talk about the maintenance. And we talk, you at Fososo and we've got our technology in the community and I'm going to use that and the world. And we're going to give a project of the CRA and I'll try to do the whole community and we're going to be actually the big, like we're going to encourage our next month, but I'm going to talk's going to do that we have last days and we're going to talk about the whole kind of the workshop. And, like I'm going to be talking about today we're going to people who's going to be happy to talk about our community. They're going to have a lot of time. And what are I'm going I'm talking about the work in our presentation. And so how we're going to actually saying that I think I'm going to be a little bit of the world because it is the community, we're going to focus on the right now and the time for a little bit of people who's going to be going to be talking about a little bit of the next session. So I think about what I'm going to be here is going to be talking about the first of materials before, we've found out the reasons of the challenges from the way to do we're going to be able to be going to focus on the way to be around the world. There's what I think that's an end that we're going to know about this I'm not good talking about that was a difference on. So do that we do we heard here and I'm going into a project and I'm going to talk
