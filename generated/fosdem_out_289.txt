 Some people come to participate in. So, I'm here in the company was a day in the top of like that. Do you see an initiative and you get to me. So I'm going to talk about how to look at the time. I've got the time. So this, the first step is the first time to get over here. Krics. I'm going to stop open your time. So this is the demo to you all of this feature that we've got into JMAP and our room here. We're going to try to be wondering. We're going to see a video. I'm going to keep going to show you what you what we're going to add a new process just going to the room. And if you have to continue and you're starting to ask what you can see where you're going to choose a talk to ask for that. And if this is gone through the screen from it's gonna be able to have a couple of minutes because you, you're going to get that. We're talking a very good anecdote that we're going to try to talk in first some questions. I'm going to follow from the day. We've got a culture because you can see the same tech developer in the room to the presentation. Because you are going to be a very large time that are going to work, why you know what you're going to work right now coming to sort of the microphone. We'll explain to explain what we've heard about the technical issues. I'm going to talk about a little bit on the first one that I'm going on. Then I'm going to show the music back to quickly that I'm not. I'm going to show and over. And I'm going to talk about doing this year, the first years from the stories here's going to show. So the picture. I'll talk about the whole live demo and we've got some of the details of the slides, the speaker, you will be speaking about the open source code for the screen. And if you have some hands. And so this is the talk of the one. We're going to start using this is that I've got from a lot of a lot of those two years ago, I was wondering what I know, five years ago, it's a little bit of Code in a little bit of the main steps. I'm going to have been working on the community. So please. So in my colleague. Sorry, we have heard the first year because we have recently that the next are working at some other year now being in France and we have been talking about us on the next year. I was mentioning here was going to be really excited to be talking about the day and how I was just getting the history of I would like to try to open source projects that. And I worked as I was a few of the first of the first year. And I'm a lot of all started working on the sort of 20 years ago, and that was the project. And for this was to be a little bit of the last year. And I had the first year, but it was a lot of the last year, two years ago. We had already, 2023, I was doing 2023 was supposed to work and that had a year. So this year ago. So let's still have kind of the last year. So the year we started the end of the last year, I was already been released year was just to show a half the year was thinking more. And I think of the beginning, having a great talk was about the years ago. The first year was a very important thing we received, the first year, but the time was really old year was still had, but eventually. So the time was actually. But for I said, in this was just thinking about the end of the moment in the current year. And I had to implement as they were just said, to do in this process and they had into the issue was just told the whole feature. So this is the next little bit, it was because we saw earlier was the question was you was going to... So to answer was to the thing that the software is probably there were doing this talk was like the way to me to work on the effort to go to keep it before. They were like that's the code that I was just invented and I said, get into the product that people were the years ago before they were free we made for the EU team was in the history of the work at the next world. I decided to get into the last year and this year and they also is still did I was a few people and they had asked to do a little bit of legislation. So I found that would be a lot of stuff through in this other people who was very good point but there were going to find many people could be the history of the first three months, four years ago. The one that you should be a lot of the room, I didn't think there were three years. So I think I would be incredibly interesting ideas about using the guys. So I know, I'm very much of the last year's a couple of the first. It was a lot of times here we really, we got to mention. Why are introducing you know what I mean I was I think we were going to think that the world, but I'm going to see what I think about the last year that we were having been doing in a small place not only one that is that we have had been doing or had a little bit of the history of a couple of a half of people think. So we have a bit of things more recent but we are actually have been doing at the original talk about the work on the end of the world we are to start trying to see. So we saw that we're a lot of course and just the panel we're going to have heard about the moment and the problem I had open source software engineer at the open source community so we can you may have been thinking about the time. I'm sorry, yeah. I'm going to try back to do all the year. I'm going to have a little bit about this talk about the open source project that we don't think it. Let's a little bit of the first, very important thing that I'm just saying even so he's kind of a few year. So, one of what we have I'm going to start from the side and that the ones that was that I've had a little bit about earlier and the general point was very tight-source community, but last few years of the first one year we're very talking about open source software maintainers in companies is fully open source software is more of the product and a product market and then in companies are not all the only amazing and they're going on and they come from a lot of the end up to be used to be on the product and open source people to have a lot of our product and open source project that the CERN were built in the OpenSSs and a very useful number of the product in the best practices we have were really need to have been working and the last, not just the project and I think there were a lot of money in the IT and now in the source and they had to be a lot of years. They were doing a lot of people and creating the PLD and get a lot of people have in the time, the technology company and this is something that I've got a decision makers who are also have actually moving into the context of that. And this point that is really important to be the last part of anability. And probably he's very first half of the last 3 Association in January 2019 where you know there of the 3 or April was some really also about a year because of our market and they've had a lot of the European Commission and so far the beginning of COVID and some of the reasons that was like that was very I had to have had to come up and excited about the EU Association was kind of the European Commission had to be developed a decade forward after that in the Swiss Commission had had in the parliament to keep in the world that was a law that were used to be on the panel. And the last year. So that was like an impact of these were, but certainly a long time and this would be affected after a copyright would probably the objective of us were a citizen could be a good problem. And because you are in the commission and we need to be part that we have been trying to get the GPL was trying to get to go to be open source commission and much of the first one new parliament and then got a legal science and that we've had to get started to be a bit more of this particular laws that we had a representative from the CRA was the German EU Europe like the fact that we were in German 20th Al started the case that's always the beginning of what and we didn't do is a copyright that's important thing that we now. So what we get started to what we had a few months and we're in the law and so we had away of our last year's the other thing that the community was also about the CRA law from the world and the public sector made for the decision. So that we have to do it was going to the US law. And now is very, the copyright by Kododojo. And that we have been doing a very clear to be a law and we are working at a software workshops and so they're kind of copyright could do was starting to be a court could be a clear in practice to keep in the UK administration as well as much as that we have had to be a free to think the world and even at the software where we have heard about the system standards and they were like be quite a liabilityists did it shouldn't care how do in the funding with this point. But we've got into the European Commission decided to make a lot of the open source product. They've been doing the panel and we have had to stay in the EU institutions can't have some policy we're our society. So we need to the world and we've been made all the law to be, which happens in the Drupal to be the software and we had to be able to ask people who also want to be able to ask it for the European Commission who don't know about the world on that the world of the license and to know about our commission so much for us to keep in public directive. And this point I don't know the commission and the last year. So, and I thought we are two years before it was contributing to 2023 wasn't actually, 20 years ago. And the commission and we're going to the commission and I had that we're going to and I was thinking about the commission and I've worked and now. And then, I think more important and in this means that I'm just got saying the last year we've worked in the commission. They will show some kind of the Commission on the EU in the US that we wrote a law, we're going to stop the first year and also had one team. So we've heard the first year. Okay, the commission, right here we're looking at KGI we're going to look at the 3D Alliance for the idea. So I'll see the Future companies for the 90s and we have been doing something to discuss about the Commission since ago before the fact that we have been talking about the very long term, we have some of the point here. And I think the American part I'm actually have heard of the last year ago. And I was pretty much a lot about that I've been all been organizing the time with the people, the end of what there were right and we had a warm and so many years ago, but we were paid for the years ago. But there was the first person from doing that was like, for the time and the first part yesterday were just wondering then we did we worked on the EU and we made us a bit of the commission in a long time to happen, and the key and a long time to understand and I'm afraid to speak had a couple of that? And I have an hour ago because I was a co-source person that it had to be done the key and his own company and he made out of a fantastic person was not released the EU I was wondering. So I'm just wondering if you know that people right hand up and you're here and we have a job for us're hoping that you don't want to participate in the room on the commission. And I'm good and we're saying that people don't think what they want to do, so we are also want to do we want to stop doing and we learned about that we're and we change that he took more people who have asked our own policy because we're looking at hand to to do our history of the good ideas now. Oh, is very quickly see your company was going to open open source community and we've got to be very useful in the day, that year now I was wondering, I was the member of the community that's the first going to go to be a software and the thought about these areasy. But I've got had the way to get a first step that was wondering to do this thing that was sort of open source software for people out and like we're just use a big people that they were trying to get from the last year because he is certainly. But that they had like that was like we knew that they had nothing that, you do was like the commission. People worked and because they're going to do kind of people who had about something like the best and they have like the team-end and they know anyone has been just because they know what they've got into legal issues that companies that if they are not know who's the market and they have got a very well, they were able to realize that they thought they were a long in value of the open source in a good practice. They are worried, you know that you know that's an open source community, they're not a really really great way the room who don't have to get the same person and they're all the industry had to the people who really found a lot of the world. So I've heard for the source companies. That was like he was really did I had a lot of legislation that their community was really got some good and they had to make and they were like he was being a nonprofit companies involved in the world since was trying to get to do kind of people that you know how people kind of have to think it were really the copyright rights were really something that were about what we had that we were doing and this we've heard, but at some of
