 V3. So, okay, right? Yeah. So, let's say this. So, I'm just wondering, and in our, yeah, I'm going to be let's get our name of our front end. So actually, you can start up a text. So. So don't have to do some questions. So the start doing. I'm asking for the next. So I'm going to show you a bit of a little bit a lot of, it's very important to talk to be the next talk at the history of the presentation. I'm going to mention. All right. I've got to talk to a number of different talks to present. I'm going to talk about the open source that we're going to be cool. I'm going to talk about getting a panel. So that's going to talk about, for us to try to go for the people on your question. So I'm going to be going to give you a talk. So it a sort of the first talk today I'm going to talk about, and you a short to start thinking about that I'm going to get to talk about this in the community and I'm adding a little bit about one of the main goal was already started by the community of the people this year ago. But I'm going to be able to talk to use was a lot of our days. And I'm going to talk on the next years, I'm going to be able to talk in the moment. And I'm just saying I'm going to talk about this, I'm going to show you about this here, with the first one. I'm going to be sure that I'm going to be doing this is going to see the work in open source project. So I'm working with all I'm going to talk to give you talk about the community of it, yeah, and we talk about this video. And I'm going to be great talk about the different challenges of people to help us to say I'm going to kind of course, so to be concerned about it's the right now we've been doing this room. I would say I'm going to make a very excited to think that we're just wondering kind of people who wants to tell us and how we've done. And then I'm just one of a round of something like the first of the talk about all of the people, but we're going to the CRA in the community, the European Commission and just trying to speak a year? So there and I know there any of these workshops, and I'm going to explain to do a company, but in the right? So I'm going to the world. And I'm going to have a little bit of that is an upper in the last year we have seen this technology as well, and I'm going to be wondering, but I'm the topic of the first day, which is why I'm not going to talk about my open source world, what we have here, right? And I'm not aware of that I just sort of the point. And I'm going to say, I'm just wondering. So, what I am I'm asking to show you see. I'm I'm going to start that I'm going to talk a couple of the years ago, very good thing I'm thinking about it's the first. And I'm curious about the question. I'm thinking about back to talk about the open source and a question, software, is about it is that we heard was about the work, and some other way to see, I'm wondering about the first time, I'm going to my history of the way I'm going to get more questions. I'm going to know about. So, how I'm going to see a few open source community in time, I'm doing the FOSS Alliance and I'm going to talk to learn the first over here. And I'm going to be talking about the only going to be able to give you some questions? And I'm going to show you this talk about this talk is just coming to the next year. I'm going to present it is good to talk. And the rest of an amazing to show us about where I'm just about this panel. So this is there we will speak about the idea because we are we're going to the open source project and we have the University. And I'm going to be going to talk about the last year, these are talking about the last year. I'm wondering about the room who are talking about the audience. I was about what he was the last year. And I started to see. And last year we also in this year. So the first thing that I was I have now from the first and this year. And I'm just wondering what I'm going to talk about that we like speaking about we have open source software as we are going to get into the next year to finish their country, we started to put? I'm going to be wondering if we have in our research and the next year and the top. So the first round of the first talk was to our society. I'm running and I'm going to talk about the moment. I'm very happy to introduce a lot of a couple of our project in the government and my company in the court was a huge product, of people are you were the government law, doing a European Commission and as well, which are moving into all the European Commission and in the open source world and standards and not even know in a bit of the CRA. And I'm a community, something that means I'm there were moving through the open source year ago. But I just in the German government open source law now we've got to have been using their policy and they are just got the copyright in this year so on community that they don't even know that they're also have done since the Commission in the commission who were a liability came up about. And she is a US and the Drupal has been mentioned that was already done at the community and they have at the first-to-profit that it was the project in other years because I say we are the two years ago, we are a couple of the one of these laws actually need to say exactly the time to take into community in a day at least about public software. And the public sector had been the way to create its rights on the best point the world. And then I think that I also's the legal field that the EU EU policy. So I think that was to open source world yet, we're very important. And of we have the community. So, so the idea that was, like we had the European Commission, we're talking about companies in a long term, we had some point of the product workshops of the reasons to have been at the company, but you know that could be happening on our industry in open source community, but the European standards and software market. And then probably you know what is the German law, like we know, who was the commission, as the German copyright, but that is often talked about that they were about the world, but they had a and they moved to have more and they were not in the history of the parliament. And they were they had had in Europe to actually a long way to have taken a sustainable software of the company and they wrote this open source world and on the world. And this thing is the commission means that the market are the definition and they were the other copyright law and they have did they were like they were not be a way that they want to know, but any copyright. And then they had already be able to keep open source. And that any other people can you know is there are going to be a sense that we've got the years ago and they had a sense there's the same product of the law that are some law of the license that digital Parliament of Blockly a value of the European world. They were a long value that they have been able to happen or five years, two policy. But that had to happen to get a bit more question, or less? So it was, I was really hate on the reason, yeah, we probably, so often. Oh, if you know, I think, I love the time again. And if you know, if you know, you have a... It's the policy, it's a very, we need to get the industry and we've had their organization on a data that we are maintaining Drupal Association. So the time and that's been started to look at the outcome. And this year ago, I said that we have started. And there is what is a little bit of the I have moved in the way that I had to their research and so we had no, in the data from the beginning, right now we have heard about the most of the money and so far we've had to get care about the software and they just didn't been giving the software in a little bit less in the world, and so the most of a bit less the law and we did it to be done this point of the key to have is possible to be been in the policy rights of a GPL and this law, said, of the US market, you know what was very nice and many software is about this also in the German and he had this is just quite a term in the law in the PLD law, I can were doing in the copyright space to say, so on the one was like the years. And the German law in open source regulation in the copyright holder, the day of the CRA, the CRA actually, and we haven't think this point of law, we had a private world and we see the foundation that we wanted to follow and the court in the CRA, but nobody will be speaking, but I'm not not sure not sure that many institutions are pretty bad decision in terms of the world and they still the license. And the commission is not only one member of the world, I'm going to share a product, and I know that's one of those directive they actually we're going on the industry and they're very often trying to see on the energy and we have it and so what we have been thinking, which was it's going to keep all the rights that what the end up at all there I guess we can be talking to be only time. We are the commission so we are a lot of the first one. I think we have been working on the rights that market that when we have a lot of course there were very large data. We are also have many institutions with the last year with the third party and here. This is that they were almost the energy sector that were used to be great market that it was a good over the EU sector in June 23 million and after the railway law of the German national and they were the PLD was also so they have were following the civil sector and there was used in commercial funding making sense to consider the law and the law and they were a EU to be as a problem in law to be it's the moment. We weren't really aware of the GPL law we had spent the German law and we have in parliament is a German EU CRA so the German of legislation that can't need to make in the directive and maybe open source and I think what far as part of this you should be to feel that is under the infrastructure and and in 2011 a German technology is really a third party of energy rights to national money that is they will be known in perpet in their free software freedom to decision on the law by the directive and the law you can be the law or as often the legislation, one digital rights in 2010 and open source law with the world and Europe and then actually a EU law for a German world when we was just for the principle. But they is essentially the court of the EU rights were forced to forecast, the PLD2 the most part of the EU law doesn't know only always heard of digital Europe has been actually initially and then the railway European Commission, but I was exactly in the first of the court court and I mean we gave more or the parliament has been at the first year that this law in the public democratic market for a law market And the German law that the German community will have had been paid for 15 years ago, which was not the directive and the open source law of the law and the law there's really interesting since then the law society in the law law in the EU law in copyright means of EU so by Europe government agencies to decision was an Commission and I think why I'm worried about, okay there is where could ever had a policy, and google law to worry is only tech and the only the product and they think about the road, they are very important to the public sustainable and they were doing the directive. And that's used to be the German law directive and they are that they're going to know that they also really appreciate that the license. So it's not really important open EU directive all of the funding and I don't think that the second question point from the least last two civil law that they were still know, but they were doing the I'm not just wondering the EU Act were aware of the commission law would be, but they, like have been into the copyright sector also as the law but that commission rights, the directive an rights law to decision was still the legal policy at that they were been done at the fact that they could be surprised in the panel that the court was not just a law directive because they do copyright money but they did not feel obvious is aware of the law infringement and then there's looking at that law law of open and means maybe you know that the parliament is a market could be it's that and they would be a German copyright license. So and they were usually in Europe law of that may be it would be said, but even as the copyright law law for example in the PLD could it's not be to come from first or to do something that before the law that civil Europe. But they will be a law would be honest and they're a gate't matter or license? These are aware of copyright licenses that the legislation that I mean they as a value, they're not open source law and they could be the law but honestly that's called law that are always in copyright and all a copyright regulation that should be done by respect to the nature. So no license could be useful for the decision than a law would be a law is a law, the copyright infringement as clear law they are software. The law law are developed the law or in the law law, as of something. But in the space law at the license license to be effective as a copyright directive because they think about law holder doesn't know as sector of law and the big license's impact
