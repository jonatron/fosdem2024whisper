 So, it's a one of the C++. And if you build an IDP, and it's usually a Clevis, the C++ code and then you can use because we want to go into our code. So we will build the Rust, we might have a Rust code that is a C++ code. So we have the way to support the next version as the I haven't doing C++ code. It's useful for the C++ code base that we have to start with Python, which is called Rust C++, we also used to be a third application description of Ruby. So we have a JDK and the C++, and we're doing pattern from us. So that's what we are here open C++ compiler for C++ code. That's what we've seen before. And we're coming into just going to be able to have this in there. And most of the future. So we have a lot of stuff, we have some V3K, at runtime functions that are trying to be waiting to load the static code base with these code there in C code base and we are the Java code base and which is a program is the code base is generated by default. And for the languages that we have the C++ code that there, we do this to build it. So we have any library for the, I think, we have our interpreter, we're going to have this. So we have our code, we need to get into C++ code new code at the code was a C code from the Rust code in the code base code itself, the GCC. It's just a different libraries. I said the code that you know, and the latest code and the Rust code is also the code. So this is the compiler for C++ code base, we make our is done a C stack, we have the runtime through code stack for GCC code base. So that's not just the code that we have to we're going to avoid the code. You know what we've got the C++ code stack that we have here. And then do I don't know, yeah, we try to repeat the scheduler. We need to do. I know, was the right? But we have some code here's probably means I was there we're doing in the C compiler code D code that you know it's actually written in the C code that. But this is an like the code because I said there were we have you know, don't have a Python code base. So if you know, you know about Rust code, I'm going to build code that code code base code in JavaScript will be built on the C code to talk. Here is a whole Python code base code D standard and C code base, you can be a large. It's like, right now in C C and Python compiler, and ARM code to be like, right? It's actually you know, you know, the, these Rust networking is, we're going to have C++ code. We have Python, we need to see there's fine on the Ruby, so that's what I think about, the code. This is one is the most important with Ruby code generation. And the C++ code that we want to do is the previous C++ code to do is this code by the C++ code inside C code description. Yeah, because we have the code, I mean, we are the GCC, because we have C code, we want to build code space, so to inspect C and we mostly on the binaries that are like to see this. And that's the standard and we need to be messed up, of us working on the code. And then we can be done in the one of code out online code and we've got to be a lot of the code which is new code. We need to be a few of Python project back into Rust bindings for the library and the library is a lot of code, Python code base, C code itself. And the Intel SDRs are the C++ code. So I think it's basically, you think from C++ code that I think in LCC because it's difficult, some interesting language, like this C code is because, and here is what are not based on 4. So, so that. Okay, the Rust is quite nice. So, for this was actually I was really like like the job of C++ code, we had to generate native code that, right, like, but these are the code systems that's up faster. So, so there, what can, the library we have when we can be able to do. So you want to use the code. So, we can, I don't have a lot of the language. So, we had like, we didn't know, what was there's the ones that we have four years to work with the GCC and we have been seen before and in a lot of the original code, I don't know. We don't have to know, we need to be open source code is that we have to provide those types of the code. And we have some of the C++ is we're going to be a lot of them. We have to build together and reuse them, we need to build code. We want to be an idea about this, we need some things like Rust. And the first other thing that is that are not the next CIM is the first one is it's going to that the first one of these are going to the C++ thing. It's important to be a lot of one that are when we're going to be done to be a different implementations. First, we have similar a very recent way to say, so we have. So in Rust but we are Mambo in the C++. And the C++ code is CNCIX. Every machine. We like C++ and C++ code model with the C code. So we have a lot of C++ code in Rust but we have a large code that we have a lot of code, IntelBLF2, which is a lot of the models. Again, the most important thing that is interesting is that we are going to do with the latest version where we have to make it. And so you can we need to do a strong if you can say that, you do this means you have the compiler, what we have is the C++ does is that is that you want to have to do, and a bit simple example, which's not going to have an entry is that is going to look like a full C++ code in C++. And now in and if you can think it has a very important for example of C++ code, we will be seen a bunch of code base. So most important thing is not about Python code, we want to return code and it's a table, but you have every code DVM. So it's like if you have like I think it's actually really it's going to just go back to an optimization, but it's the last 15, but there. Right. But there's a special, different ones here's a lot of the idea that are some weird. So what we are what we're the C++ code is that are the library because it's the code and you can be able to be used. And the difference to do is the important in C code base are have been shared function is just the C code, in the supervisor. And that we need to have this is going to do because in the point that's the way that the Java code was written in C code. It was used for the function that we can actually. We need to be the function there's not a function that we will be one of the source code as we have in Rust or they are using in C code. I would be able to look at the test. We need to do whatever function in a function. We will have that will just ask me the C++ way for that we don't know by this. And this is there are the time. We are Mambo exists, it's not. We want some point of it doesn't need to add a way that the C++ code. So when we are that's what we want to look at the scheduler. In the fact the other libraries that we call C++ code, they don't need to look at the future, we have time to be here is, which means that means it's the function stack functions are all these two attributes that are now we. And you need to do it's a lot of course a simple here in this and if you have for example or if you want to have a lot of the arguments as you need to do that they think is when you need to implement on this to be used to read to save a different cases in the code in the same as well. You can do that you can really look at the result to save and just call the code base, you have to go down here, which are going to the way to note here. So, the stack and you can't want to address is really what you a different types and we need to do is, just the source code is computed and the stack. So if you should be able to do the function and if there are going to use cases. So the world, if you want to open source code should be in the only readable performance, you need to say the end, I think about this is the library and they need to be available in fact that you know that are mostly used to analyze it means that you know, I think of the only as you know how you know when you know what will see what are going to go, so that are the code is kind of the right? The problem is there are of thing that a, but you set of a value that you're doing is that. You know, you know that depends on the whole list of what object is that you're going to tell you know, so often that you that are in the build, the code of the model, the models are in the vector. But like this kind of the first one is one I'm going to give the number of the value, a, I'm going to start an application can, but you see the goal is that they are doing, I won't have to be able to have to have to do some kind of the things that, you're going to make the right, right? The question is that you know, the you're going to download the first step into the data there's going to be the information to be done by free code. And so this is a problem that our data, we're going to realize that we wanted to continue and we're going to start looking for example of the data sets that we're going to have the next parts of having us our right, for us in the data for us, we need to create a bit of some data, we're going to be going to, but we're going to do so we're going to figure out to look at a look at the question, like a couple of what I mean, is the science in the same time to give you're putting, right, and one that means, like very, we're going to analyze, right, but it's the other people to the table model of course, in the question is there's a lot of the table. It's no one of course we just like it on open data, so how the first thing is a second thing. So the last question, no, I mean, if you don't remember in this case that's connected to be the data format that I'm going to start with the data and then the primary and doesn't want, when you know, does not the data, the query, some data, you have to get in the data, which is using this table. So it's another in the files, we have the same data, and this case for example, so we're using the tables, for the first two parts will know, which is in the third of the problem to the whole layer inside the data. So, if you can do some other data to solve this code. So that the one one is the most important. So I think we had this is the right? It's in level is how we know, just write time, we have got this service and we get to turn to do we don't have any data to have a data in the data that we're going through the data is running memory, we've been using a memory as it, that you have been shown in the data, when you can do the data, to handle the packet and then the main role to tell the data is going to how you how to avoid data, is going to change the data from another data in the data that it. You have this data will be a simple, and you can be a data and the first to deal with two user data to add to forecast between the data. And I'm here is, but the data that's going to the data, so another data in addition to look at the data that's the data with your grid, then it's the data, the data, but this is very important that I'm possible, I'm going to go. I'm going to start and we've got to talk a memory. And basically do a bit later on the table, especially in the data is a signal. In this is a data, the data field and data structure to the data, the data model, but we're all these data, which is the information of these data. And the data can do, the data structure, then the data, we have to be a power zone or the data value, which is the same data call, so even in this data is a data as this is used in a few times. And the power about the data looks like the data is the data is a number of copyright, and you can be first. So everything is the model, the data. And the data and then you can be, you can be able to decide to trigger the data set data. So as data, you can be like we have the data, the data. In these data will be a series of this data, how to eachTelemetry, the global data that is responsible for data. So if you can you have. So now it's the question, we're part in science, we have a lot of the data within the data science. So what is why this topic, if we have one, for one? Because if you have, you can we have more information. So you have to clean to see if you try to put the challenges and you get the first
