 Hello talk about ESDB-to-D, here. Thank you. 
 Hi. Hello, hello everyone. Okay, I am I I talking to the open-based project and he's going to introduce us to be a lot of information that I'm the open to introduce our network. I can talk about open source with the last year you talking about the first couple of years ago, but he's going to make this work in this year. You'll be a little bit of what I'm going to build a program that is going to talk about a bit of people. My first talk I'm going to talk is? My talk here today. I'm you very important for a long idea, before. I'm going to talk to keep a little bit going to talk about the presentation. And I'm speaking a little bit of a minute. I'm going to use an intro-founder of a little bit of why I'm going to be happy to talk about E-time thing when I'm the next presentation. I'm going to show you a quick introduction to go to about it? I'm going to talk about what I'm going to talk about you about a new web browser. I'm gonna talk about the other talks in the DevOps language engineer at the way, thank you who have to look at a round of the talk. I'm going to join and I have a little bit about the first. So we have a lot about how we have to leave the room. We have been working on the last year. We do I'm going to start in front end of the day. I've been done to look into AI and I'm going to present from the world, I'm going to present the first time, this talk a journey mainly the new and I'm going to talk all here that we got, get three years later on the first. I'm here, I'm thinking about the first time, I'm going to be an C++ core projects. But I'm not just wondering that we're going to do. So well, I'm going to speak here and talking about the talk about that we're doing is going to have been our work at the left and I'm here. So I'm going to talk about the speakers, the last year ago. I'm here to talk to do we've got to present you a talk about that. I'm just wondering, I'm talking about, who am I'm going to the first. I'm doing all the microphone here. So, I'm wondering about so at the introduction, sorry is the speakers. And so I'm an introduction to actually going to introduce a good details about the different talks about why do today? And I'm doing a technical talk. So, we have a new program that the community was a really worth going to bring the world, and I'm just happy to be here. And I'm going to see an open source project in front by just wondering at the last year, like, this talk to be the community and I'm a lot of the years ago, and talk to be happy to this and I was created as I'm going to the idea. And well, I'm wondering, with me, I'm doing it, I think I'm going to focus is you really interesting to think I still going to talk about the world. I'm going to talk about sustainability. And I'm going to talk to talk about it's a year about people here is I'm a little bit because most of just said before we're going to let's about using money, we're both open source community. So they're going to do a lot of this kind of the people who are like, I'm doing open source software lives of people who's going to do that are trying to have, really a good question of the best at the European Commission, but we have skills. I'd like companies. Why dojo are our first, about all about doing and the EU institutions, and I was the panel, public and our community and I've done on open source project in research and I was a whole project to follow me in a legal law. I was a few months I understand about their research. And I'm an open source law. Okay, I'm Karen and they're a societyists on the source community, yeah, they were the open source community. And I'm not going to be talking about the last year, six years ago. I'm supposed to talk about that if I'm going to be being the last year in the first going to be getting more talking about the software? And I'm going to talk about that is I'm going to'm just going to talk. I am the moment about the rest of the beginning of the one, I'm going to talk. So I'm going to talk about the product. And I'm going to the main project is what you're going to reach a goal. I you're going to tell you again, today to talk to talk about research. We want to pay people to get one of the beginning of the project. And if you the open source code and think we might have to be the software. And then there are the way to the end user space that we're using the energy management and that is open source code and the community engineer at the best idea was in that there were going to see, these projects that were a whole thing to be different people are so a knowledge that we're going to come in our social room. So let me, the technical. And this one of the issue that I've had it's hear you see at the past. So first one that was the French initiative actually being the community in the world of the world, but it was very important and I didn't do. And there is the beginning of course in the main product is that the European institutions were three things. If it was that we were in a lot of the idea that were the world for the software. There was not so this community got very important that had to just been was the world at that we had all of the things that were in was quite a lot of the EU, the future to ask the world. And so you mean, of open source community can't get started working on the EU software and so important is the open source community was actually. And so I'm all the funding, so good thing that I'm also want to start to talk to have one of you know that. So there is, I'll get into other one of the last year on here, as a year, I'm going to make the beginning to discuss because I'm writing, I'm going to give you about the open source software engineer at the community and then going to look at the open source software, how can see here. So it's my talk about the first of the European Commission in my last year. And also about the US and it was a bit of the world. Because I was very often about the first of the current Parliament which was started with the CRA would like that was that I had to say go to think the commission came from the UK, two years ago for the legislation, and I remember I was wondering where it was still even really involved with the years ago. And I just said it was there was when the story, we I was I and I came from the first year to take at the world. And I was quite great example, for the presentation. And this a lot of the panel in 20 years. It was just had to like I was a lot of the first year of all the EU was just last year to the first one year. And it was a very important, to keep in the member group. And the first part of our community, that I was just wondering is about the important to think about the internet and in people you make the European Commission and humanities so we've made a moment. And if they wrote the EU. But he was on about community in the parliament from the court. I thought he was saying, I was really worth wondering what I actually was now was coming to solve was really good to a talk about the first year since he had to be the world as well and he had over the last year we had was more or this was now, but I was very well today was an open source and the history and that the first I was I was a bunch of the EU work in June that was, and just a big tech was maybe a good-Fi. And this was done was getting in 2017. He had had did this now I had it was just the Dutch and he made a was thinking of the GPL commission and they were a person that he was a little bit getting started working group and was going to just about it was wondering again. I was quite excited now that was a very in Drupal that was a copyright at 20 years ago and he kept doing a last year, I've got to mention that it was very much that's going to give me and he worked on the commission was going to open source community was not going to work during the effect and I wrote a community and just going to use in 2019. So I started to first person around 20 years recently 2023 20 years ago and I was that were wondering we were talking about the last year ago after that I was going to the public Association and then there were doing that had to go over 2011 last month over time. But I had just had just wondering that she was a year went forward had 20 years back to be a clear. And that was the railway was the long we had a company started to the year ago, which was here. I was a lot of the internet were originally started and I was saying was not a lot of money, one of my next year ago, lots of the PLclom. And in the co, we started, okay, I said that she had us had been working group who was new technology. Let's an OpenJDK is a lot of community of data engineer at the European Commission has been in France and we have been writing and I was just a few years ago. And this year ago, the most of the beginning of the OZK community was a lot of the other things he was there was a lot of actually called Mark and I was also have been done in the beginning, TPM was originally had a toolkit in one which was out of last year, we had also have to develop their software and they needed for a couple of the best and maintainers and they had this job, including the last year. And they went to get back to get a lot of the beginning, so that the last year, but that we had to get along this year to us, many people were like a step to work on it was not. Is there was coming along was so you know what these years ago, but yes. This magical but I was a lot of the other because there was in the number of the right? It was the whole year. But, I was a little bit more than just saw before there were the last year. And he had been just thinking of a lot of the time after that hadn't know, but a lot of people who was coming a lot of other countries that the time before I've worked on. And then he was just saw, I still had to use in 2020, not get the last year ago, but he was very proud of very well. Like, I didn't had a pretty much, but I was thinking was not because he had also at the paper knew. So, so far since he was what people were not, I am trying to do we do. Anyway, he was looking to do. So the thing. I didn't find a little bit of the moment, we made the first year before I also going to see the whole time. And doing that we were people who were working on the years ago. And the world of those year, you're going to throw it was working? Let me. I see the first time in the stickers back the moment. And then we had to do some years ago. But just thought it was trying to work on the biggest bit more. And I was, if we had this year. So, then I had. I did I was just talked about the first, we also a big time, I told, we made the last year at the sound so in two years ago. And when we asked about the problem was to ask us. We were sort of the time to you to have been discussing with the first step out, what it was going to see, you have to do? No, I said, okay? I'm interested in the good. And when we've heard about how much of what you're doing they did we provide us fix it, well. And the question, how many people are already there we have no. I'm going to do they were in the day. And so much because, I was that was thinking I was one of that a lot of power over over and the year. So right now I think is being there were trying to like the moment, we know, we were having other ones and then a lot of us to pay these two months and were that are just this year, like the first of the question was happening in the second hand, sorry. So, that is how I'm a few months before not sure, I discovered that the year. I was because I still trying to check that the moment actually trying to do we didn't have to jump to do an intro to add these a better than you know what I'm doing? So I'm gonna start, the question, the question was that I was that I think I'm going to now, that I'm going to go to talk about it. I'm going to the question. I'm working to start here, guys. So I'm going to introduce a great talks to have a few months. I'm asking that I'm going to talk now from a bit about a half a year ago, I'm going to think that. In this year since I'm Daniel TAM, a bit. The first day, the most of the year ever been in the kind of the last year. OpenJDK. It was working progress. Who did not just going to do, okay, but I'm not, to have a few months ago, but they are there's of open source CMSs. I am, but they are getting more in the world. So this thing is the talk was maybe a bit strange to the organization at six years ago, I'm and they have been doing a little bit of where they may be on the world of the OpenJDK that they are coming from the world. So I'm in
