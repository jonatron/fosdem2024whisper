 Thank you everyone. So today I'm going to you. We just a good so we saw it, Alessandro PEPO, VLC and we have to talk about the project called OAuth. We have last year. We have this talk to introduce the open source project. It's, but I'm happy to present a few videos, I'll talk about the next speaker. FosA. And thank you have heard over here at the Enos Foundation. So I'm just a little very So let's next presentation about He's start quite glad to use in the last year. So, we have a long term that the agenda, we want to get the source community. And I've been with a talk to Albuth, a recent things like a research and it's a little bit of the EUN of open open source. So I'm not talking about the two minutes of open and how I'm talking about this talk about our institutions of a lot of scientific community, but I'm a few reasons. And first time I'm going to be the community of the community. I'm going to talk about Project. We have talks and I'm going to be talking about our talk about the last year, is one year, really thought about one out about a bit of this about the open source software, years ago, the CIC. And he's the open source website and I had to speak. The first year, we're going to me how do you know, the company. We're a lot of the year in Europe where we did I'm going to talk about the first of open source project and the heart of the PLB and the goal was an open source developers were to take a European Commission. And they wanted to start working on the Drupal Association, I'm sure that I'm going to like wondering, we've been saying, the EU and we've got five years ago, there was saying what we made those amazing program and how they said, right discussion before we're just think about this is the last year. It was the way between the second one of the first time is the University of the last year, so many people are a really meant to be surprised from the money. And so they didn't work on the first and that we speak a huge to the world. So time. So I have we have the talk to say that I'm going to look at the talk about half this thing that we've sponsored the beginning of the open source folks that. So I'm going to do we've been calling the Commission, I think we were wondering. So I've been using open source funding in the first one of the co-Fi-time community. We're going to know we have actually got a lot of the new people who were thinking that means we have been talking about the person who do we had a senior community. He's going to throw as we had a different technologies and European Commission found the last year today, which is really the EU, but I was also had a bit from the second company. And for a couple of the right? And you know, I was, for 2019. And I was from a few months today I did I was going to do, what I kind of all, but yesterday, right? So I was you just wondering if I was writing a lot of what I know exactly the definition, this, can do I could go. I found from having a lot of a lot of work that. I'm happy to that we know, I was going to us on this, okay, if I was a little bit of mine this guy. So I'm just and I'm asking. So, my talk was going to give you can be excited about one of my colleague. And I'm a bit about. And I have been talking about open source project. I have a few questions, let's about the first to read about the rest of the work. I think, which was kind of how much of the whole thing that is the first of the question's see what's not? What I would I tend to people. And I show what I'm I think is a good. I'm going to make a time? I'm going to be just wondering and with me how it in this thing. And I'm mostly started thinking about I would like I'm going to show you to be trying to introduce the data science model that. And I'm an interesting stuff I did I'm just wondering and I'm going to talk about the first of the DSTAR. And I'm going to know this very quick talk, we talk about how to talk was working on the next steps of the little bit of the power and the design and how it was not going to my details about the first. I did I'm going to get a bit of the talk is an open source community. I'm wondering about the first one of the data. And the idea was a little bit of the question was part was a few years to create a small tech revenue. So it was free software and I'm a senior community industry. I'm talking about the only one and I was to do a lot of my opinion, but of this is talking about the commission and so that, the other, the French. And because I think he was a lot of the European Union said, I think about the things that they got in the European Commission that we are in its own company and was asked about the reason to be open source organizational thing to keep track of money and they've got a directive as we're the people are going to be something that they are we're starting to be able to be talking about the industry that They're going to introduce a very interesting problem and their open source software as well and being paid by the world. One of the first decision is the European Commission who said we're contributing to be looking for the European Commission. We have to this very excited about a problem was always talked about this for law as the EU. And so much as a public sector by an open source EU sector, we have been using open source software and we're all those organizations in the German Commission at the group in Italy. We have been open source software and Amsterdam. And then on the EUGIists have still focusing in Amsterdam and we've been developing their policy scientists. We believe that open source software. This was developed the end is a free world of this is due to basically what they were trying to Drupal group and of the parliament and actually had a little bit of an open source aspect of the first time and that they're very good balance that was the American sector. And they had also raised together upon the organizations being, and have as a good and so much as long term of the years ago, but and so much as well, the years ago we only ones that we did is not have been making a long as much of the commission, you know that you know that are just created the regulation that we've said. And I've been in the German society is open source license in the big of Italy that is much as a technology and he was sustainable. And I was the council and then he was just said that I was a day, but I wanted to give you know exactly like you the parliament were very popular institutions've got to the last year and he was working on a bit of the good experience was like a lot of the CRA. He were not really being a while they've talked about the world. So the only here since the EU Association, so the world and I'm going to highlight that he been heard about this and he had a bit that wasn't worked a French company called Cyber Commission in France that Europe who was the past and he had a place to give us. Again. So who just in the beginning of the last years was very famous, the first time to focus came in the Eclipse Foundation and in terms of the beginning of legislation. And so on the law from the people and the first of the only do I'm all of the last year since even a year to been getting our railway release was what they had to go through the moment, and then they've got in the technology anymore. And it wasn't see that was a lot and it felt in the software was, but it was the very often made other ones to be a lot of the year. And they were the day of what I used to know the company've got in other people were. And this was actually done mostly around, some great ideas or less because he was they were working and we have got to get the European Commission that was a huge group member of the government and he had the university. They had not something that he was also had in which was brought to do was all the Drupal and she said that the first issue the world called an largest company was, the first and the open source of the German history was, because they had the European Commission were a very important thing because that were having was the UK Commission. And so on the government sector to have that he said, in that they are meant that we still had also had some point in the other States. We had been discussing Drupal but I was that we have a first European law and companies can't really get the law and we had, and there was asking before a little bit more of an open source technology team actually just decided to get this public companies that and to create. And they were a chance to the law that is organized in the way more law and we had a lot of the group was a company would say the Drupal in the national rights did actually there was so they could be great lot of technology that she invented by Amsterdam were never had a market so they had a lot of thing about is our educational year was asked them to be a lot of funding for me to actually the act since we had to know because this German impact. And if there were a whole result that's now had a lot of course I had a bit of interest to offer to have their open source license. There was the foundation for the people like that were a software for a civil society. And so they never heard the public government act as a legal point. We're actually have no legal point in the GPL and was done by the foundation that is a half of making as public agencies since the German law. And the definition. And. So they're at least a member of copyright law that he joined the GPL. And this point of the public law in EU law is important to the policy policy to be a German law that they said that there's part of legislation they are are very important law and we're not the United States were at the GPL and they are in the EU law organizations saying of a directive Europe. They've been in Europe. They got a copyright holder and we have any policies to have been published out and in the the CRA and so when they're looking forward and they wanted to get they didn't have been heard these point of them. And I said there's kind of the German law that they had this planet. So that we have it a GPL came from their uh you think that they're a little bit of the educational directive and they're not legally being used to change a copyright in the fact that they're required to be able to go into the challenge in the market that the EU law and of the commission of the German license group think the European law that she didn't started to and not had that to solve value was an hour that they had to have been a law in the market will be been thought that we could be in the EU and in and we could be able to their government law in German law and you know, right companies and then they want to be done this meant 20 as you know in a law law and they were a license to open source software but they were not software supply always to be changed, right they're always an open source software and the CRA and they had to use the world. But then they had been so they just heard of the software liability and then the license is the law. And they're still have a software law and the value work was the general idea we have to answer we were going to move to solve a regulation to the copyright policy as we can't had to the commission that sector to interoperability and they could be being had to take and they're going to the OSPOS to have, and I'm a GPL source law to be asked about the law law that for open source software a German law that's more or that sense. So we can be honest, if they were going to be open source sector on the law and in most important of people that you have seen, they're reading and they thought, and they are just in the issue because they saw it will actually not that open source market and they're so it and they're like think that's not in the PL Association and they are not aware of software so they get into open source funding in there and they're clearly going to know so we are really told the IT law and we think that the organization has no other digital investment in the parliament and they're looking into technology and they're the PLD in the fact that they have been involved and so that they're also have thought that they're not necessarily much
