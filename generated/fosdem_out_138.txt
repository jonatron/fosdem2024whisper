 Thank you very much, and I'm going into, I'm going to be a project. Thank you. 
 Okay. Thanks, welcome everyone. Thank you. Okay, I'm trying to be very much for new stuff. I'm going to make open source, so much for an first talk about this. So this talk is a little bit doing work with that Kododojo and I'm going to show you this talk of all about two. In this project, this is why I'm going to cover for you about this is the person to be interesting. So I'm a great question. I'll send an old front of the previous talk about the question who we start to we'd make an office about us as a little little bit of an office project and how can be a talk about the best to help us. Today I'm writing some of your co-imden Energy and then we have a senior project. I'm gonna start and I'm also a few questions. I'm asking for a My name is a time which I'm sorry. I'm a speaker team in the first four years ago. And I'm presenting a lot of people. And we're interested in my slides. Then I were at the Internationalodojo. And I'm a lot of the end here on my talk before the last summer of a community, we've been doing the open source project system Foundation and I've got a few years at the University of the Internet and I know what I think we did it. And then can was what the main parts of my company was getting a community that she had to the University of the open source software was working on source activities and of the University of the open source software. I started to be the world. I think I was a part. He also started with all of the people who went on and I had a lot as we had to open source community. I really worked with a lot of the work up and I have it was working on we had to come back to talk new customers from the EU at the long. So the year ago, as well, we had to talk to see the workshops of the last year for the years ago at the year, I'm going to see the most of California. We also had to get the community of these people that were in the last year. And it's a lot of the first year, by half years ago, I didn't know, five years ago, so I was going to be to talk to talk in the first year, some hands here, I was the first slide that was the early on the people to the last 15 months. And now, there was pretty good. And yeah, if you know what people had our work well. So you know that. I never heard about the Drupal is that brought a couple of open source was the CRA was released at the most well, but I had had to see in the years ago. And they did I was used in open source software on Norway had a tech and he was going, so that the fact that we had decided to say that the beginning. It was a bit because it was done by a while the reason was in the second problem today were we had our panel. So as far, I actually looked on the time. Yeah, these are just about the funding to have the government, which made an open source data that was interesting idea of this year, because they had been because we had said, we had made the company and they picked a good for their license, you had to come to be able to speak and even in the politicians that we had this moment after their goal was just going to provide support for that was basically taking through our people just taking a lot of the first one of it was just a year. And so I came up as possible to build our work on the first year and there was kind of I had to be able to the first thing that was on the moment, and then I thought well they went to get to encourage you were then you know when someone had the most of the people from the right? And so far because they decided to have a researcher to tell that was to do that was not like, but in free power in practice. So you a lot of the end-owned law since the German Drupal Association in France were the copyright CRA has changed through the law or the world. So of the public law that the law. And the copyright law is the GPL law that's in the federal law law was that the legal value of public law that was used that the copyright, is actually what the open source that's the policy. And whenever this remains the only open court, the standard because the commission was the decision is not their laws in law, and the law, and the first and the European world had in law. That was there was an law. And it was actually entirely done in the data of a license under the space because they don't know and they haven't have had to get been a law and they just one or okay, we're just did not only in the copyright law, and they were very clear to understand that's the money of what we had to find on. Do they did we have to do this point, these copyright law were doing it was doing, oh, the license, I decided to happen and it does a license, these GPLB and I was doing that was wondering, and so now actually he decided to, I was actually an ability to know, because he had more what I was, you decided to know, to say that actually. And I was talking about the license and the copyright policy don't been working and he was in the copyright liability has not that the role who came to the money for a software that she had the law. I didn't have to have been to so far, if they had to know, I was not looked at the end of the only thing that just had about two years ago was to talk was how they came off, but since I was wondering. I was really, but I wanted to go to get a city and going to the success that time to see a company in the organizations of the law of the lawyers can be the world anymore and it was the the tragedy of the copyright policy, but and they had enough we had got value is an act that they have heard more legislation in legislation and they still had been the law, that at the law And the court and they had been this was so they had to the law who can't since it was the value for six law. And if the German law, they released the policyas is the open German law by GPL, sometimes like copyright value end of the license he was something they had the key that was, it back to have been from the policy and allowed to a GPL would be able to get the licensee would be useful. So it would be better as much too much as you know that for the copyright has been the law to follow really kind of course of a copyright industry copyright decided to think is sufficiently effective and say a copyright and they can't know what they went back and it seems really been trained in that could be an GPL and they have this license. So that the gap is because they were there is like, but they were a and then they didn't really want to do. So they have the GPL and in many countries that their rights, is not just a copyright would exist that they could be the Swiss law would have to always be as possible, their copyright would be not only as well as far as a value of legal problem to be this, they had heard, actually part of the most problems and they've been trained in the copyright has taken their opinion that forecast did had some key practice that. We had by that was paid for the law would have had its damages of the open source commission, and they have heard that were created by the license that you were a value in law is made on license policy is, because we could be done by any license, and they know and they don't like actually work through the copyright was, so if they wanted to provide policy to spend the question and the software if you make the government in people would be in the German law law and you are we can't work I know about the legislation in the industry in the copyright law, that the law could we've given as good time in copyright law. I'm in the court was the license, the copyright of the copyright license that they thought it would have a political law and they could have that commission of secret GPL law should be open product law, they didn they do that you know the trust the copyright law by law, they've been said, a GPL. So they are the law that copyright of policy, and they hadn't know, so they're not just being an open source law for two court law in law, but they had when the directive and they can be free a copyright decision for their national could be for actually being in the problem that industry making law. And so I mean an only the law could of a GPL law. I think, if we want to do the open public sector, but they are this gap, you have a value and the copyright copyright directive in terms of a decision to work with court license could be here but it is that you should be the law, if it was all in it's a copyright directive should not clear clear license was not as a copyright holder, but still, you know, open source software license in advance to may be there any directive, the copyright rights in law and there is only no longer law agreement as an organization they can in case or GPL that the law and the value of license that they are a value of law because there's on the license conditions, but they don't well as any copyright law, they were non-factor court work so they need to make a policy forecast. And then they know what the law was the law work sector society is often because of court and so they have to be done a copyright in the copyright policy from law law to be that this value of the open source field which German commission that at the extent the only thing that first thing that they had kind of that's important that was the way it was basically the law and there was an open source model that's the law was a law. And the copyright and then because the law that was like the law was exactly because the second law of the commission policy law that this certification and what I found in parliament was, yeah, that far in that in this so but this means if everything is the software. One of the law GPL law the license was concerned is a lot of TPM and they were the copyright law that was they wrote a license law just a only the policy and so that was collected because it would be the market, but that they ever said the law and like the sector are still don't not enough they do exist in the future doesn't think in a number of law and then the world and they have to make sure that copyright on the field of legislation is often in the law as well as a value because in the fact that was not the effect of the product was really, because the gap was what I did in the energy nature because most important and the law and the market and especially license so I would be the work that that there was a copyright from open source law that it, a directive also open source policy license, and a German law is very well. And on the software was the European terms of the national movement in space and so long term is actually the legislation's true and it was the world. Another of a law in 2022 that data is the license is the law. And I think it was not about GPL and I had a law is the directive to act in terms of being a legislation in Dutch and German was there are a money for the act the GPL German law, so the German copyright that it was exactly for law was defined law like to the world of the law came from German law States and the law that they been quite positive legislation, very obvious, only that about the EU and a decision at the moment. In German law was on the law should be some law revenue because I hope that I guess that you were actually get companies in European regulation that has to get as we get to be used in the legislation, but they gave about the German parliament. So we were a problem that they were the law to deliver or not the issue in the conditions from the court law there was that the scope law were the railway law directive and that the GPL directive and the law, you were it won't a law to always be in the law is the law. It's nothing to that it was a law that long term and it when they were the law. So these law that you had they were the legislation to have found the market law and they were actually have in theory and open law. And that to have then they have before, they were the world at least in terms of the moment open source world they were affected a directive including a law and they only so that we're asking of all in German law to the legislation and a data and the scientific challenge in law said, so that is the law and the law that as I don't think but they are that they have a license. The law, as possible directive in the law in the copyright law value of government law, you have and so they're just had a and they'll be aware of legislation here in the countries that and they are in these European law law, and the court is in open source law licenses could be based as product in the technology directive in law German law. And so that's going on and the law and they're first other law and the commission because they're quite bad practices, the law, but there are also an society is an copyright law that copyright and the law that they actually very important for the law parliament didn't need to have the law that law in the copyright license becomes difficult that they know the third law in open value of copyright law that they're not considered zero law law and the software rights. Okay, the legislation the copyright infringement was it really that people are in Germany so they're getting a data, I've been doing part of key point the copyright law in law law and okay and they want to realize that the court so they need to the right so they have in the law law and they get this law to be the problem in the GPL law and open law is just can mandatory license law and this law and I got this law I mean, I'm the past law which is in a value that I think I'm not sure you know we have enough as the rights the public company. So there are the German law. And then we know that she's of law and that the money that
