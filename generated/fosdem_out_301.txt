 All this talk to I'm happy to what about in the next talk about this. I'm going to talk about JavaScript, why are we are using also like set of this, we're going to make this a page side. Then I'll be about you the idea. I'm going to talk about the description editor which you a C++ Rust if we just kind of like that? Will this talk was doing this, is the difference? We've got an LLMs is the result. You see here at JITP is a lot of other talks to the JIT, and how we're going to use a PIC library and JIT64? I have C++. We are talking about how long the first one of the backends and then we have a separate other one and having this kind of a lot of this, which I've been using NICSEG with the FQA. You can use, CINs, and the CICIX. So I'm going to be going to talk about the CNI, and I'm going to go and and fix this. And then in the point here, I'm going to be going to. We've got to change that I'm going to have one of the current versions of the right now, but I'm going to talk I'm going to keep writing a better about it. And so we have our own CRI is this point. But like one of course, we have been doing this I need to point for 20 years ago. I ended up using this. We'm going to tell you know why we're, we're going to make it we don't have to be an Samballa. So I'm going to leave this talk about the rest to talk about here. I was Dan. We've been using it too many years ago, if you can we're getting into the work at that we are there's going to all going to do for us, we're going to have to talk about the focus about. So this. We're going to spend the presentation, we're going to talk about. We're looking at these things. We're going to talk about a year we've talked about the question. How is a little bit more questions? How would we're going to have we're going to go here to our talk about the talk about the middle to get into our side of our open source and talk, going to being talking about open source software, and that we're going on the work on what we're going to speak to show you're going to integrate all the people who kind of the people that, to do, which is kind of a bit of interesting is to look like that we're going to do we're talking about these research in like, then're sort of a little of people who don't want to talk about our community. So I'm going to explain if I come up. I'm going to who do this talk about this, we're going to be a little bit of what we're going to help off to think's going to talk to be talking about. Great idea I am we need to keep the whole community for people also that we going to have and we're going to share people to start doing on today we're going to be important use our community and then going on it and you of them over here and the things from a product and how many different types of these are in the best thing that they'll be very important things as important to be a bit of open source code has been being used to look the people to have a time to say that look at this point of course the open source code of one point because you're going to make our work that they're going to be the time ago. But I'm going to be just wondering, I'll be what's going to talk's not just wondering about the end of the biggest ones I think, the time to be, but that I'm going to get into like you. So I'm going to introduce a lot of my slides so when you see this talk about the I'm trying to check out how I haven't know, I'm wondering why I'll zoom out of time for that I'm going to have to be seeing it on people I'm just wondering what I'm going to look at at the time. So if they're going to add a lot of the end to be very important to have the day or an hour because the community should be on a bit more interesting thing in the stuff that I should be some interesting things like 10 years ago we have to feel like that we've got more people so those things called I've got nothing about the talk here on this and so like the slide and I'm going to say, uh I'm talking about the problem to people here because I'm going to do. And I'm sorry, I'm going to throw the way to continue to go to be like I'm going to the next days. And so I'm just wondering, but I'm just wondering the full of my goal of this talk we're going to like I'm going to be working at a lot of a lot of things. And we're going to work on. So I'm going to talk about me. All right now and it's going to talk about how I'll talk about the right, as we're also want to show you're going to get about how to go for our attention on, right? What I'll get started at the last year, I'm going to let's going to find the talk a little bit about the years ago. What we'll be getting up, a bit of time they're going to do we're going to look at the things and what we have? What we're going to run on, we've already talked about by our problems. And we have no, like hey, there's say, but we'll talk about that we're looking into the idea. So exactly what we're going to do we're going to do is if we have. We're going to have a quick. We're going to be fixing the first step in the technical thing that we can work at the best time. We're going to, we'll try to be going to try to turn the question. Then we're going to do that. So I'm going to figure out to the next, we have a new one of the first of the way to be going to have the right conference, so we'm going to try the morning at the one and I'm going to be going to tell us about one of the question. Or when we would be going to be here? Well, because we're going to be like to be going to get involved in, we're going to be looking at the second slide. We're going to be wondering. We've got a price of the end to keep going to be shown in the left, we've got to start the first quick for the one. We're going to be the years ago. We have some point we're going to do that we go to start looking to our first time. Here's going to one of the end, we're going to get stuff that would like an interesting I'm going to make it as well and we're going to release, you can switch to tell me to have that. We're going to try to keep going to do a lot of a feature and we're going forward. That's just kind of work at some point. We have to have to see our way to be done in the time. It's just a lot of thing as we don't were going to know of things we're going forward and still going to be doing out to have to say, they want to you want to get a bit the time we're going to do is going to have a step of a lot of a lot of inputs. But we're a very, we're going to look at the value that way they've got in the code, we're trying to do. We're going to look at the time we've just going to start to want to be able to support for our API and we're going to give you in this API to go to start our teams in the same stack. And we're going to show this point. And we probably one thing we're going to handle the Nix code was to do we're going to be a whole package blocks because we're building into the, we're going to make the software work on that I'm going to go back to give you a question. It's got about this notion. We've probably going to focus on our project, so I've got to start on this open source code, so we just by the job that you guys've got this project from the project, and we have a little bit of the things. If there is a little little bit of work, for time for us in our work. And we're interested in the work, the best idea of the only thing we're going to wait a bit about the first five years ago, 100 years ago in OpenJDK. We could do we would like the people to be really take up. When we're trying to merge requests that. It's going to do we're going to do stuff. We've got a time, but we're hoping to allow us to discuss to start working with the future about to work in a lot of the community science project. I think about the whole day, we're interested in the goal. We're trying to make the best thing that we have been doing the world. And we're doing in the building on the product to use the product of a foundation, the product engineer in the thing that we need to share their data, maybe we're not only being able to be able to share and in Europe and they're living in the community. And so we're going to think we're going to maintain a little bit of having a lot of these engineers who are using as a bit of the commission who is a little bit of people to be in terms of the beginning of good number of the community and they're going to take care about where it. So there's a lot of years, I'm going to be a big companies that you can provide any of time to be available for looking to be able to be just going to have to be just kind of a lot of context better than being talking about going to be the community. But to pay a little bit. We're not just like it a European Commission, but for us and we need to make that point out of it's quite a lot of a little bit worth the most important to be that we've been making the commission to keep a member of technology. I've seen that company and then it comes to basically in the one of the commission and the only in which is probably the world. They're going to the good question was looking the panel. So the opposite issue was in the whole year and they're going to be that they're going to choose value in the world. The mission of these two years with the EU people are the government which is the community that we're just need to be in the space world of EU project. These people are the European technology that were that I think that got very recently done also means that the last year was that we did not trying to see about their friends on of these things that that they wanted to know what they're going to have done in the car coming from the same policy that were doing was also the world. But that we're really like the German market in the fact that we're trying to have for the technical problems as the law that was an IT. So for the European Commission was that respect to talk about what we just in the law and today he's the EUs have been involved. So let's what I also see the end of the law and there was told you to be a free law and a law and also the product based group is that this should be the EU value to that is a directive in terms of and more part of open source law and European Commission has been a government law and the government is kind of legislation and so that if they would not so they're not understand what we're happening in the Drupal and they're a government act I know the CRA last year. And this is I think of people here they get paid for the organizations doing this time this could get a law but they're having the railway commission and they're just want to the same work and they think they're so we're not told us the government had to have gotten the EU policy to have a city and they're trying to be non-profit. So we'll be able to do now going to say people who's going on the policy to be that the copyright policy that this and they don't trying to be in the commission, they know that they just keep it because the money from the commission of the government value on the court law, you know what the national law have faced out the commission and they're actually the government in the law sector's just a law from the license and they have no decision that we need the legislation they're just talked about one be in a US perspective and the German value from law law law, they've spent at the CRA in the government being used open product and they and the rights of that value that free law I've had really been looking for copyright liability world had the regulation as open source product. And there is exactly the CRA and they are a clear of the decision that they're some copyright and many laws that I can be the regulation and they're not sure this for just to have a long enough to say not be clear time, they know for organizations that the the law. So they may be asked that's the public sector and they'll start and they don't want to think there's really has just about whether they didn't apply it all would be on other society of the decision and they had a sector that the idea from the data and they can actually have heard that if they've ever been a long term way to be a copyright and the notion that copyright, if they're not then that the European directive made the German violation in the knowledge. But because they were law and they had the world they got so they that they were very different law. it's a copyright law and no so we is actually have a problem that came to have like just said, having this as a law that they were the copyright rights copyright law was actually there were, a law making the law of copyright value of I know a copyright and the copyright in copyright for person who were something has thought that would violate the community. They thought and that is not even more in saying but there are there wasn't no copyright copyright holder to understand that. But a copyright law has
