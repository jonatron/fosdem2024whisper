 Well, I'm here, who's our application, I'm not sure that do I have to find. Okay, we had to use this, so, I'm going to start our next release because I'm going to look through this. You can create an LLM to, I'm just wondering about it and compare a bit to my battery. And I'm going to remember, I'll be going to have any questions? I'm going to talk. I'm going to present this of an application. So I'm going to explain questions, I'm just going to be going to look at this. All right. So I'm going to talk about. I'm going to talk about to get this room. So I'm going to talk about that, what about that's going to talk about this. So I'm going to do is going to try to add some of you to hear about how this and do we have some questions? Thank you. And I'm going to be just going to give you a question. And thank you very briefly. Thank you.

 Thanks. 
 Hello, next next talk will you. My name I, welcome for this talk I'm going to talk about a little overview of the last lightning talk was the first hello everyone. So we did I'm going to talk today I am doing this talk about the first time. Okay, I'm going to present you know what I'm a few years. So I'm going to present this is today. So I'm going to introduce folks in my name of the chat and I just wondering about the last year ago. And what I'm going to our talk about this presentation, but thank you. This is very much for the morning. How can I'm going to be in the next talk? So, sorry, I'm just organizing this afternoon, today in this talk about the European Commission as for the tech. So I'm going to that we have the European metal but I'm going to talk to talk about the CNC, and Juse. And I said that's, what I'm going to talk about this talk about this panel, and I'm just seeing our first talk about how to the name was about the tech companies can we had to be open source software for me about what we will go to work for the community. We have a lot of the next year ago. So I'm very important to talk, the First, and I decided to be a little more scientific network. It is not only the University of our data science. I'm being a lot of open science that I'm getting a little bit of digital work around the EU and how we had to share energy mechanisms of efforts to just wondering for the end of the data science and more and in the question was really in Europe. So we took over to go to this year. I'm going to this year about England and what we were the European Commission and so in the amateur community is where we have a lot of policy. Then in the principles or we started that society and that they are doing the first time. And last year we have is on the German law, so the goal was going to do I was to remember the EU that a very interesting case of the grid and the year, for a peak energy science grid. And then have to do a big problem what they don't it. These were super important to speak a free data and we have done to see here and, so far as soon as a software, no economic we have been going to solve the maximum and we have been working on the last year ago and they are going to use in the European Commission, which were to have the European Commission had to communicate with a problem in the goal of the EU institutions that we were aware of a first step towards 15 years of any of law in 2022 and they were in the first discussion, well last year to more than to be different countries and the parliament and I started with we had to talk to go to work together and so if that we have worked with the world. So the Commission is the first one is that we had to continue to continue to sort of the third of like this is a million conditions of what the world now that we were going to get two years ago, so they are in the grid to see and so we just like they were going to know where we got to be able to do for our own energy consumption that you are currently want to make a bit more important I'm going to think that we had to have in the world and since they were the last year last half of the commission that had a law as we were the German government and so far as a lot about the actual software model and we have in Europe of our software and software can't want to be pushed to provide and to open source and to engage with the software with both institutions are actually more energy and the sector so it's also one year, we're more. And so to be a lot of the EU they're not aware of open source software so do we have market. I wish to hand in terms of the moment. This is at the EU companies are the last year ago IHP and the open source source world and some interesting thing I'm just wondering I'm going to take care about that you about the good question is more how we will talk about that the European Commission Act as you know about the world not be as the reasons in the world but we know there we have a few projects in it is going to use two years ago and three weeks at have a very good challenge to get into $ly to say that we're going to open source projects we'll see the European Commission and European tech world in some people and of the end of the last year we have five months around most and now and the European Commission and I don't know which is going to start and the panel was going to stay in the open source world of software at the funding as well. So we are a big companies and in Europe. I think should have to know it from the time to be able to become great solution to all the software so we are not go to be less than a good to the world and we're going to get on the collaboration and so can't the community and we have the third person who is that we want to work on the product. And their government will add all sorts of the way to be great to have we need to solve the project to be done that we can be done in open source as easy to have a lot of the good ones that we may be able to talk about what we're going to do is like the first sentence on people let's going to do right? So let's think a few years ago this we're going to make that we're going to create a lot of the people to produce and we want to actually working on all the next year but that we've heard here we are already talked about what we've nothing about the last six months to be talking about it was just kind of the ones that we still been talked about the product we know like the most important because we're seeing and we've got a lot of us yeah I think in this is that's really hard to have been using the source, like a lot of the knowledge that are a small project that they've been these things that we don't have this and in the source and the most of this kind of what you are our institutions and be an area of an open source code that we do's not want to know if we can be that users and the community we have made this really interesting thing and so they are we're not helping to see the world we have is that the time time we're getting the things we've got looking at a problem and we want to look at a situation for people and we can't also share a bit to focus has control and we can have to be able to have to do this definition so we have this. On the foundation about the fact that the foundation that they have moved out of the whole policy and then they've been to make it to get rid of the world on the ecosystem and they're very small project to really the good and they're also have we have also on the best thing to be represented by any educational consequences that we have to have in their standards so we have a lot of the actual community and we can be able to get any decisions and we have this certification to share when we have been doing this by copyright in the commission from the railway foundation and going to have to know that's a value and as an issue by the EU and this person that we have to be open source software law and communities. So in the last step will be able to be in a good thing that we can we have to do we have a much for the world but we don't have to find a lawyer and so the fact that was trying to have said we have the commission for the methodology and we have. But we have had three things and you know what open source software as I said that we have been working on and so that we have already have quite a data back through a new time on the rights in this is so the market and we have to learn a new rights and that was when we get and we had to get the EU Association technology in a value of government open source to market organizations in Europe as we will be the license field and safety I think that is the first law but I think about most of the science and still this and from the climate and the PLD is possible standards and how to invest as I'm not done for each other commission as I'm not going to be so we have the directive and we have to show the commission of the first and because people was a real world and we have to keep on the law in the EU institutions. So I mean, we are going to try to be a big influence at the part of the moment we have to talk about interoperability in this directive and we have these market but of the railway and the national impact and we have a legislation and the second point we have a public law as a discussion of the data and the end-Fi AI really important path that we were the railway law but what we've been thinking in this is first the commission has been into open road and the policy, is about civil government institutions that you can are going to a good time to be used to be able to have a German law for that these regulation that were happening well, so much as the parliament are a copyright law is also also good. So when we will be able to have a lot of the regulation in regulation in terms of the law that we are always had also in the German law for research And these research and at the licensee is meant the law to point in science government and we're very easy to have. And I think then it would be our rights on the same challenge because it's the first of the world in the co-profit law is very important to be the sector in open agencies that when we have been the licensee open science, which we're an impact of an effort to to be able to AI law of society and the regulation. And that the time in the current law that cost of the CRA can be a national law in energy field of the knowledge of law and, I'm in French science that I think there's the open source legislation has some solar data to research definition of the world and we can be a directive and also open source directive a national companies that the European regulation could be moved to engage into Norway we have in the Commission to the world between interoperable under society that there is there the value of which was was a longer on the time for the European world and this is the world to being also an ideal of the market in between the rights to open source license making a legislation in hindsight there was clear number of energy rights were announced in the EU sovereignty and so do important to be aware of civil law, you need to train a government law. The directive or the power policies are just open source countries and they need to be aware that means it's not a social field of the German law is also because they for an open and in a free law legislation from the EU Association Association and no law license license of legislation and so the act there is the German law is in tech law is no big gap of the regulation, but the EU law in the organization when the last law law and the CRA was called federal law, very law open law and they didn't remember that they have used to be a German license is very popular legal and the directive within the government could be no political law of free standards actually used to become used in the law that they had well because they need to that the principle would be like to have that that legal energy in such a French law would be one of free standards but it was a paid for some sector in mandatory laws, no federal directive, we thought, but they don't know. So this is a was the law that we have heard of a copyright law and they just used the CRA. And in a law act in a law or law, they cannot be done GPL as long law and they were used to bring this question which was first source the commercial legal law and we're allowed to open source legislation and they're usually what they have said because they're using copyright law, because they are allowed to free this law as well, does is just used back all the person, they're looking into the market so they're not granted in the US law, to be closed no first decision. And copyright policy, they're not trying to be, so they just being a GPL law, that have seen in parliament has the law law law that. The only be open source software and I don't like they're a license and they will be a copyright in the license as long term would be a legislation for us to have in the second law that in a copyright law law or the law, at least in that GPL law, or GPL law, because they couldn't been done a market in the German law is actually as not a commercial law and so to license and that law, for the issue that is, but that's the law. So the rights about that would be here in the law, but we have the commission that it's how a law is the business GPL and open source law that they don't always find the decision so we want to be in tech only because they always understand the rights software and they are still think they would be like to not the rights law to be that that copyright conditions. That means that's the law gets used to the law and are the copyright court has been also been available as a law. You have the license, in value of copyright is only known person that something that I've been got the license
