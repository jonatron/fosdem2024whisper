 Okay, Alexeiei YTGG. In Europe. I'll be I'm going to talk about RSSD. So we have two of the VGP to a normal DATS and how this is also a VEC enabled by having a bit more generic and you need to send an application. And we can go to the room. So we have to implement this together a way to look at a small tool and we have a, it out a process with the new container-V, which is something like LLM, which is great thing. So there's a new thing that we have for doing the integration which is very important to look at, in the Curses mode in this case. And the first way more likely to do this as I want to be as a specific setup that is we don't think about that. The first we're just going to be able to do the question was if we have to get into the data from the data management is going to connect to this this is for the car. So I'm going to come back. I have a real time to my email server for my service, but I'm just wondering. Where was going to be? I'm going to say the user, I'm going to create a one of the email state of this talk, are going to the other services. This is you know which it is, right now right now. We're going to have an email. We're going to be using the end user experience in a message to be and you about the server because that's also can have to give you who are using it as well. It's going to basically it's the previous room. You have to implement it. You have this now any services for instance, the server, that is managed to say that's the encryption. The user is, there's the user ID that is it's the server in this is also called EOTP, the server within an extension. This means that you can then the node to address, which is the server and then configure to replace the server, which, then we also it to, you can specify all authenticate this role, the server, of this role is a client the server. The server is for that I'm going to make a client IDP, but we have a server here. If I don't have to know here? Okay, here. So it's also about the client, it's a server and the server, that is the server. And then it's the server, the server is the server. You can have a server. And for the server server, and the event. You can see in the server, the server request. So we have, you can see just create an client. So, then, this is the server. So, you see that in the server. When we are in the server, we are able to start, we have only have a server. So function as an client server on the server description can see what I will, we are all the server. Right? So, we can just here. So the server to say I will run, we can do client's, you. So there's the server in a server with the client to server, what this, will have to be the service server or the device server, which will user ID to send in the server. You can use. It's not super server, which is the app sends that. So, the client client we want to have to allow you a client in the server. So, we are here, we are working, we will stream that in a server. And it. It's just for the, we just one server. So, and, the server. You can have the client, as you can call on the client is a client server. You can simply send the server. It's going to the server, we're going to the server, just to enable DNS client user to the server. And so on, you. That's going to just the room server. We want to download or at the server server. And it. This cluster and then this connection, the agent the server, the server is created. You actually works in the server, it's going to the client. So, that is the server server. You can call to the IP server. Here's, inside the client, which is the server. Here's our room, this server, the server, these Kubernetes. So, the server is going to server client ID. And, the server, there are it's quite a client on, which is a server by the server. And of the client encryption is the server ID and then we have an to find a server to say that to do that's going to do an server to do this, but it, but it's going to the client. And in the user is also the server needs to be the provider. So the server is the server, we can run the client. It's an server. We'll run in the server to say it and we'll put to end. If it's a server to the server, and now. We have the server. If the server is going to see the server server is going to the server. It's client to give us to update. I'll keep going to work you a server side, all public server, we'll present. The server so on the backend agent, our infrastructure, we said, and our DNS server, we will going to send client goes to it and login server. So we don't use our server. And container service server. I did we can specify we have to expose and my server and say we have to start using we have a browser and we can get the server that we have the server from one here. So, and that's our server. So it's going to. So, we do we have this is going to start using open the server because we want to see a server agent of a server side. We will probably have a server. You can see the server and the provider to have a server. So, well, if you have the server that's all the server? We want to build the service provider, the request, but it's not the secret. We want to do the server, but we don't want to create the server, it directly into the URL, you can check the server, but it's the server locally, your server? We're going to the server, you don't just want to be an client will be able to start going to join the server. So you a, you want to send the client, but you want to store your server to export. You can install the server, the web server, which's going to get it's going to the server. So that you can already upstream in the end service can send your server where we can you want to be for the request. And then you want to do some providers, when you can start using the email end user in this user and the client and then sending mail service server. And we're going to your server to integrate it by having the server that part of your mail client. So, it's using the server to do I need. And now, when you can have the message to come to build a client server or server. And the server, so on the server, but you're here, the server is going to just the client. You need to work already have to be the server and the server to start here and just a server that you want to update's going to create a server, but that your server's built on. You have to also to just to worry about the server. And you're going to have a server, you can have a user provider. You have to get the server level of the email or you should be connected to their server. So you want to share the server and all the server and you can see. And you call to do an metrics. And these calendars are not see the URL. So you can run to connect the, you can, you can specify your server to your server and then it to the end, for application. So, how to this is it's the server or DNS server. From you can see that with a server. You're, you can put in the server with server. You can see here, a file and the server, that's the client going forward or on your service, this API. You can trigger the server. And that allows you can see that helps you to turn on your side. You can just move to, so on, we can see where your server should be possible. So this is something that's only one of this's what's good. You can. And then you can see today, we will find me back to an agent, the email server, it's the server. You can see here. We can see the. And then the server, we're a server. You can see here, we'll change an email client. Okay. This is a server. We have our mail to provide some request. You can see the server to another server to have a server page. And you can see from a server. So, it's going to actually put this is a client. And as a server is that's going to one is a server does the server client side. You can see there, if you can see the server as I'm working. This is going to show you're already very much for this. We have that we talk is going to start the client. So, we have a client. I'm going to give you a message from the server, how do we want to do we work with a page, we have a server to have a topic for example to start on the server. So the server looks like this, there are part, our client. But just done in terms of the server, I'm here. And this is a server, but I'm just heard of a server. So, I'm going to click, if it's going to be sitting up. Maybe I'm gonna be, I'm an end UI is nice. I'm going to talk about. I'm going to, but I also a little bit briefly going to be from the question and I'm going to start on the server. It might be here we're I'm going to have a demo. But you it's done because you're doing the server, which is going to make the server, because we're going to worry about using a schedule. Instead of the client server is going to do a server. And then on the server to be messing with the server, we're going to do this demo server, but I'm going to turn out. And I'm going to present an email client because we have a password, that's going in there's going to get some clients in the server. So an agent is that we want to throw a service that process, we're going to talk about making the server actually done. And now we're going to focus on the server to be able to find the server. And we know the server that what we have about the server being using a server side and we're going to go to need to it's going to start the server, the server. And if you're going is going to then we're going to build a request, we want to work on your client, so you're presenting and they're going to create a server. So you're just want to the server. So as part of your user server, I'm going to talk to run them to have to ask. And that to take a client or a server to go to try my server on to the server. And, you can see if you very nice email user and open user might be, I'm able to be able to get a server of what is going to show the client. It's going to enable the user server server and then doing. And if you need to start with a prompt that's going to make this. So as well, let me to start to be like, I'm just get to generate my client side of the server and say, this is just the server. And for me just going to it's going to show you an server for the server, if you just like this server and this. I'm going to talk about this server. So the server are going to, well, we have an app's going to have to focus on email server and we need to get the server. So here. So, what I don't have to do is we are actually have this is running to make it. So, you can have different client to have a server server? Let's on the client server to client's going to wait for your lab. So, you have this container and now, right, and the server that's just our server, we have to create a server, but... No, we have this to have a server server, we have a server to the server on some slides. So, the server will be going to the server, for it will start up in that next server to continue. Okay, if you. Thank you're going to the GDB application, right? Thank you, we have to see the room's going to ask. Okay, the server? Okay, so many questions. Hi, thank you, so many people, so for the room, I will present on the next and today. Thank you for coming. 
 The good. For this presentation is a discussion was about the Hello. Okay, everybody. We have a little bit of my front end, like. So, we have a good question. So, the community as I'm currently using for many, let's the talk about the demo. I'm curious about a presentation. Okay, next talk, and thanks. I'm working on the next speaker is.O. We have the microphone, RISC and one. Our second talk a workshop already, we've done, we are talking for Airflow. I'm, I'm going to talk to present a little bit about to do with GDB. I'm going to talk about having a bit about this presentation, which is I'm starting in our talk about making a little bit about today, hello everyone. I'm speaking here. Welcome to talk, I'm for all with joining from this topic. So this talk about the last 15 years ago, I'm now in June, and this talk about a little bit of three months. I'm going to the agenda.
