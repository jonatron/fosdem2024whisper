 So we're as a few other people who get to a little bit like 10 million hours last year ago. So in this case when you look like the first in 4 million or less than we have to make it about a lot of states and to make it easier to manage the same thing in a much better and of like six years. So, yeah, I'm going to talk about the model and a bunch of examples of small and find a lot of different levels that's fairly early ones that we have to say that like 2% of thousands of those those two types and a bit less high level five% such as a bit, and so on which is kind of photos between six percent and a much in a single quarter to do with a number of times of bytes. So let's continue and that means we have no of brackets and it's go into a bit more time to four if you don't have people actually you don't have you have to figure out that you don't have a little bit less than you're watching the work in a bit more less than having to think about that we have a couple of months to be a bit in a lot of code that we have some other things and how much see in one one is, it's entirely new code base. So of these six months. So far we're the idea that we have been talking about what I'm seeing about it'll have all the code. So the good question was over 100, okay. The question is the one, two years. Now, you know what the difference? So, one of the question was to you know about. So I'm the most exciting thing is. I have said before. When I would like this means my work as we've like this is that you know, if you know, you know, you're not heard about the question. All right? So at the first time, but it's nice to say I'm the previous slides from a lot more and I've got the same code that the code is the first time, and the same thing, but actually going to make it's going to write will get the code, the code, but the current code is going to be really important to be, but there's got in the compiler, but if you know, the code is just in the moment for the code base where I was it's not the code that's not really kind of code. I don't remember things that the ones that they have to think, but there were there is people have some people got some point. How do it's a lot of the question about that they want. So that you have no? Are they're talking about doing this people who has no, like five years ago. I'm going to get the code in the main point. Also, so I'm very little bit, I'm just wondering, I'm going to fill it to be talking about the code, I'm wondering, the C compiler for the C code, but it's something that we're going to make sure that some that we're going to have all of the C routine. So we're going to talk about how we're coming to be going to look at the next step that, but we're doing the compiler that kind of the, really need to look at the build the browser is going to discuss that we have to just wanted to work in the binary libraries and it for the browser. Yeah, we could we're going on GCC code generation. So we had a project that we just worked on our project for GCC is to encourage you already know how do that we have to do we want to make it really get stuff. So you open source code of our project and we can do that you can do that. So it is it's not work. We're I think we're going to run this code for example of like we have a long time we want to remember an extra code which is like Ruby community and it's a very important how do. And so you have a bit about it's nice for you can put in a look into the compiler. We need to me. That's going in the code base. I'm going to use. And I'm going to talk about I'm going to talk about six years, like whether I'm going to hit this. So this is going to talk to be very quickly and so I'm going to talk about a question. So. And I'm going to be very much of these is that the most people do have to know about that we need to do that the context. We were not any of the right now we've got the right now yet. And now in the first step is a lot of the beginning of other one is we've got the ecosystem. But the project was the important to try to go back to the very cool. So in our vision of the world. We've been about using Blockly. And we've got seen about a lot of a lot of ways of things of people who had a lot of people that actually have been built this new release and they've got had the code, we need them to think about what we've been working on our open source team. There's going to have been living in our community, but they know, we have been some of companies got a lot of our community and the people who are going to have to make that we're trying to talk to be able to be working together and we'll look at the like kind of these open source community, trying to have people who are trying to make it. It's a lot of an open source software were doing that we've got to be a point of how they're going to do you kind of any time to show a lot of hoping that it easier to make the internet code of our people in production and if you're using the community, we're very interested the community, we're doing we're starting to focus on-end community that we're going on the community and the community organizations in the world of the way. We're going to look at the community community project the community, when we're going to know, those projects have about the government teams. So there. We need to be some like the community projects that have a challenge in the open source and also a, we have the funding for the community and we're going to be, the future, and looking at the product, the end is that I think in open source software law. We're nextGI world. And we have also have learned at the first impression and I think it out to find that. Because we have as we're interested in a look at the maintenance, okay, by the answer is a year. And I think I think that we're just saw a lot of this is you're about the job that the impact on the revenue around in the world. And I'd like the microphone of the world, you just one we've got the community and keep the developers at the open source software, I don't like to make us. But this, there's what we're going to involve the first of the next week, we've had some work, okay, we have here a conference at least at the European Commission, all the software and and we had to have to do, what somebody and to ask. And then they are super uncomfortable about the rest of us. But that's a wonderful company already a lot of a PR out of work that they get started doing is to the open source. So I'm going to go ahead and kind of code involved in a few people who's like be the first of the first and give us are kind of things that they're talking about how we're going to one of an open source of the value in the European Commission from civil society will talk to make a bit of how with the first way that we can we're going to be useful things for the product. It's a lot of open source software, we're trying to be open source so actually working on. But we need to know we got started to work around for people we would think that we wanted to really want to build a technical communities, including people know, and we have a few people of the open source work. And we're going to do this kind of our first thing like the organization coming in this and we really need it's what open source projects, but we're going to work together, we're going to really passionate about it, kind of the world. We've checked the community. We're going to sort of the world of the community in the first place that we work we actually have a community. We have a lot of the future things we're going to work on the quality of the end is very quick point of our community and these foundation and we've had to kind of what we're going to be going to see for our community, we make this year. And that we wanted to make work in a way we've got it changes the community. We set of the things related to make money for innovation. So we've been one year at the years off the things are the day. And they're now they've seen really just because they're going to think we've been doing that I are doing and they've got like I've got to create a lot of time to get involved as I'm going back to build the people that we know, but this year, so Seth do we're going to do to talk about how we do you know about this? If you're in this. I'm a few one of people who did I'm just wondering. I think it? I'm going to do you that. I want to solve this about. I was to discuss about this off in the question. I'll be here to start up a little bit of a little bit about the CRA in the PLD developer, some of the world where you know, and a lot of the work and the world. It's because you know what he's, yeah, what I'm thinking about the talk about the largest member of the EU was done. And I have most important news of all of my talk was the EU. And I was an open source community manager at the most of the moment. It was the world. So, we see what I'm working on a twoth of the world was the EU years ago as BGP really important to just also been used to take the OpenJDK. It's based on the CRA, so I've been shipping OpenJDK and to work of the world of the European Commission are they used to work on the energy community, which the Commission and in the fact that is the world of the road from some European Commission has been released OSP community world and I have a lot of the EUs that the parliament to be in the fact that I said so much energy in Europe so that is also of EU. How they made you see exactly the EU technology that we have been looking at the end of Parliament in the policy of legislation and the world to be really have so we have a few weeks of ways and the OSPN is about 2023, at the commission and we could be only have been to try to follow this year. So to work that was just felt that from the commission. So we use as a long as we gave me for 10 years ago. And people to the most of the big countries a company, like I think there's the actual law and since the most digital Commission and so, very important discussion about the EU community and years ago and also have a co-model so that it was going to have almost another funding to have been to have been in the OSP and I was the best and to tell open source community to be, also a real level of the end of open source railway railway freedom to get the Foundation. We are in the CRA with commercial sector and their France and so I am I said that you know that the only the German software to work on the directive that the world of the tech projects have been the software and that also the digital European Commission and to do have been open source Drupal world but in software being developed in the community, in the years ago today of open that were very recent Commission as well as a day to do was so maybe but as we had to get into the end as an open source law started at the same time. And there were of the last year, first reason, I was to do so in a very popular idea was to say two months that I could be a directive that was to be really a law and the open source association that still an open standards called the American law that they were actually don't been very well and I had to do and the organizations in the directive. And you're the second and he was talking about one of software policy. She were a sort of the sector and we saw before it was not so when we were really get started a lot of a lot of have heard about freedom now that their rights of the money. And just talked about funding to some of open source software to be a time, so this year to what the world are the government laws are getting had to the beginning of an open source market that I may be law and also because this and these agencies were a law's still put together a law. I have been very interesting to have taken for this law that the parliament and the German government law. So that parliament is that they had this was done were a law and law and they have been able to think in law, think that is the EU that he was our law was the law law had to they're published. So that they could be free period of open source society about this society to apply and they were very good policy and they're not had the value to free and they can really good policy could be able to be sent with their regulations have a law and the regulation in Germany in law of OpenAIO for energy directive, national law in legislation and I have a German law when we have so they came in the regulation and the law has also the law in research in the rights and since we're open regulation and to I said, the EU and to co-profit and so we had to talk to achieve the European Commission and the last year we had the German law we have in the European law and last year as these law that was that is was quite open law to the copyright policy and have noticed we had the law in one law markets is also so yeah and this court law was certainly a public law and we actually at this panel away that the license perspective so the GPL government is basically so well good court is that a critical directive so to be paid for the parliament since they're like that they're thinking where policy is really looked in a software as much the notion and by tech and they're not still
