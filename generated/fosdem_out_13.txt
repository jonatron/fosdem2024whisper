 Welcome everybody for coming into a little bit of a while to talk about Astro. And I'm hoping to be here because nowadays. And since I'm going to talk about how we start my name about yourself and stuff. So you have a nice program. I'm going to talk about how we're using those features. And I'm going to show the most of the beginning of the first implementation when I'm just going to build a new version of having a virtualization of this to the interface. So I'm speaking a user. It's going to continue to add some examples that the user of your application that I'm going to use. And I'm going to put an open-year left. So I'm going to give them a user of a lot quick developer I'm going to be looking right now, this and I'm going to be enthusiastic about as I'm going to be looking at the different types of language. But the documentation who are going to have a project about it for all of these people and it. And that is the different types of different types of different types that are basically here that are actually using, but people in the top of the most important point that you could do you're using a different ways to change in the use case and the application but you will need to interact with the rest of a simple. So you have any ways to have the most of the right now we have a lot of the end to do that it. And I could like a lot of these two things that I'm going to do I don't seen this thing I would like I know that I'm going to show you. I'm doing. Maybe I'm going to do it didn't have one more questions or less with it. And so I think I'm just wondering if you is a little bigger question as a developer because I'm just wondering that. I'm wondering, like, the way of the question was I'm going to come up and we've been doing the data, but I've seen some of course when we are like I'm just going on the question. But I'm going to just looking at the question if you're going to look like, right now, but I'm going to have the product which is the one of the open source world and that is the EU and he's the EU and I'm using open source software and I'm going to have to work now. So, I'm going to come to be a new and I'm interested in the public sector, but I'm going to have a company, what I'm a very excited was wondering. I'm going to my colleague in the German community team. So I'm super first time and I'm going to talk about that I just wondering. I've done. I'm talking about the product for my company or the world. So, so we're all of the open source community engineer at the community and we've shown back to speak louder, so I'm Matthias or I'm going to Mark's going to show you to talk about open source community. And today I'm going to talk a good slides and we've got to have a long time in the next year ago, but maybe I'm a little bit about it's just saw in the project to have some of a bit of the beginning to be done about today which gives you might be open source and the first time to be, which is the third year ago, as the question, I was to actually being here. Network in my first other interesting here, what means that I'm organizing a lot of the third question is that I think, I've been an open source product that the government and I've got a lot of the first two years ago, three years ago, and 2017 from the French and as you know, but I've been about, so we've been going to been using this one of the government infrastructure in 2022. So it has been that's what they've been doing together in some point in the open source software. So in fact that, there's very, it was the open source software, the world, we've got a lot. Okay, I haven't had this year, last year, we did a lot of the team? So we also about the world as Mozilla 3D? We've been a lot of technology and he's kind of people only open source and the community and I just was in the first step of the moment we haven't always heard about the government engineer in general of the process, which is essentially been started doing the EU field by the world, and it wasn't always in the world of the security that it became around, was actually that was, but the space was actually about Europe and the EU Commission and he's kind of the foundation but the most of how the world may have a software and so I think we've been doing in London in the goal of the EU States in Germany, we're also have a lot of these were to show new law and for the parliament and he was that was just have also got seen it was that person and that actually a lot of what we had his technology that we did is actually have been around a great and the EU Association. So what we are in a lot of the organization who has heard some organizations in terms of Outreachy is at a company was also the law of funding at a little bit of the commission and we just a big success and had a story. But that was the fact that we were just have still doing that we had by looking into someone had to read. That was thinking of data base and they're the market for our civil society and the EU legislative sector. And the field was that we had quite interesting that just had happened with this. Because we had, we got time we were giving you the moment. And then we have talked about one of course I want to be able to be in a community. We have, I've seen here over the end of the EU community workshops and then we're going to that we have also, so these people who were looking up to discuss about the product and the commission who are on the legislation that, for the world. We have done last year. We said, we have the last year we even though we have the world so we're going to go back to one of us to the country that was a national digital world at the railway project and we also what we need to make the panel to do had us and we have in the first time we've been talking about the technology. We've been in this time for work in the product that we've tried to focus on a lot of a big years of work with the PLD in the PLD started a world in the court. So we've been using the first slide of the European Commission and national Commission and the world made of the European Commission and we haven't have to really made the European German rights in Europe industry, but a lot of all of like I've got the EU funding that. And we had to say, you know when we saw that I'm going to be going to have to have a whole law in so the world to see how do there is going to get the panel or what I think we're going to be the European Commission. And something that we need to be getting into the commission, for us here and we got to a little bit of the panel that was we came up to do is to say it in this talk. And then we had in the commission back to be in the community and after the end of the commission actually the CRA and we need to stop quite useful to hear, which year. And how good thing we've been doing in the Product Liability at the project for the Commission since we have been discussing and we used to find an educational agencies, and so we have been doing the EU Commission across government and there that we're doing projects to go to be able to the government rights and we would like more the world. And I'm just wanted to say well our European EU community and we have a great technical aspects to want to, that way to be a part of legislation for that that we're going to keep our educational software fund them on it and we're going to be able to think about how we've done to have to keep open source software. So as far in the companies I think that's something that we're going to start with the directive, we're going to be doing this point of decision makers have this funding, but we're like we're going to pay us a whole world. And we're very happy to be able to think the last year was much the last year and we're going to discuss from the European rights because we've got a lot of open source people that we're not having companies that we need to think there's what we're going to're going to have been talking about a lot of the company. And on the first of the last year, now. And first of part of this year I'm some of open source and we've got a very wondering how open source product, okay and what we have came on source. We're not going to do we're going they've ever have to look into free world into the question were very much time we've been doing and we're going to do we'll try to help us to be a little discussion. I didn't heard about time? We're going to talk about a lot of us, we did that we got a lot of people ask a small ideas about the first, so we'd like, we're going to think about the software? Well it's what's going to use cases. So we can we have some people and and we're going to be able to make it's stuff that we're going to make a big fun things. We're doing the community involved in the next talk. And the reason for you can have some people there's a lot of our open source code out the community projects. But I'm not said that was a company that they were like a hard to hand in public definition of the world because they're just have been a very excited over to talk on the people in the community management community, so we had to have to make sure that the time to invest an open source and I would work. And yeah, we're basically have heard that the important thing that we don't know at Fos and we're presenting and we are just want to be fun to get and how we are not at the community and make out to do we think about what we're making in this in the code for the community. I think that I have made them just be aware of the digital lives of the main ones I'm not able to focus on the future of how we're also have to go in the product that we'll just have an issue and I'm going to talk to think it's going to be looking at the person as well. So in there's going to introduce some people that is a good but I think there's coming out there's a summary of computer is the community and see and we're going to talk about the world. So in terms of the main challenge to make sense that we are going to kind of time we have the community communities and we're going to talk and we're not have to look into a good in the community. In terms of people have these open source project made money that we've been doing companies. And there are really a problem that we're the world and I'm at the community. And so we have one side of these projects who understand is not so much more like so. And it's the first question. So we don't want to summarize two talks from four months. First of all of the amazing types of the right and we've got like that we have to do something that they are going to know that. And so much of what we have you are going to be looking at the big impact of how to look at that we're interested in the world but we had to dojo is come from a really a lot of it was first to tell us what we started working on the people to get a lot of what we're going to come from the technical examples to our community and so we want to do. And I think this morning here the company engineer to open source community. I'm just like well for us at the good so we think you. And if you very much, we think about the community that we're taking what you will get into the community. So the talk is the mission interesting and so young people here, well to being a lot more energy to share those people and we should be aware of the goal and not saying that we want to be a good to be done in the government companies in the open source. But the second point of the world the world, we're the software as many years ago today is we're thinking. So there be a lot of you know the EU for this is a mistake of information should we are just looking into the CRA for us the product source software of knowledge and that the University of the communities and the community-ogs. And these software are developers are just know that can be trained in hindsight and that they are open source communities of the big big impact of money to work on the good and it's the fact that we know how we can we have been to take the first time it. So I'm at the open source project is a legal world. So when there's a technical, there are some new software engineer and last year. And also a lot of the companies that I'm very quickly for open source world that it's the community and we are in open source community. So that were getting started but the focus's what's a lot of the team we had to have is very much better. And after we all the goal. And here was to start-the-time standards can come from the world, we're the big tech in the European Commission to the European Union across one we were actually have the EU institutions, Switzerland. And so many things to be also very quickly to do we are here. So we can we have to emphasize that, we are getting in place to the European Commission. So we will talk about the whole majority between the past year. So we may also want to this panel, we are going to ask for the European Commission. And at a lot of the European Commission in addition to, we are a long tech organizations and to some other EU, at the EU institutions, and I think the Commission would like we saw earlier, we are the world on the European Union to do have also don't think the EU Association law that there are at the EUOS Association and we don't have market in the sector in first European Commission. And we have the software scientists of the past European Commission, which
