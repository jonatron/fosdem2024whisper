 Okay, so we are having a bit of a few years next slide. So we will say I don't look at the time. So we want to use this, we need, we have a bit better and you can do this. So I wanted to go back to that. So I'm going to be being a little bit of a little bit more important to make me more important. So in this case, I'm just wondering, well, this is actually a good. And I got to start using this. I'm not going to do it for this presentation just wondering. So I've got to talk about this. How do you want to use this? Because we have our tool? I'm going to have this. There's also one of this is a sort of the best to think about this again, it? Now, I'm just a little bit of a while everyone knows what this was all the type of a very nicely. Thanks. I've got a little bit about Python which I'm gonna get a little more videos are in a maintain. It's getting more. I'm a little bit of a project of effort. And one of the maintenance of the reason if you're interested in there's a project that you're doing. It's a little bit of the community. I've got the people who have been really great talk for the life-to-source project, the open source project and the project where we have had to build on the project. And of the things. No, the biggest initiative. And you know, we need to say, we have time for the next step of the future that we're doing the technology. So now we could be able to say I'm not sure that they are now it and they're building applications that we're doing it. We want to provide that our project. And then in the vendors are just getting quite a lot of our standards in the product systems. So there's that's some that's a technical work that there's a long talk. It was a bunch of our work on the community that they need to see that in that we have been doing together and they're going to look at all of the very little introduction that they have and they can work on to go to work on the other people can get down to the time. Oh, that when people have. And so as a whole science. You could be done this a bit of this was the project. So this is very big companies, everybody is the, we can go through some of the whole people who are happening on to just trying to be able to meet out there, oh, hey, I think we're discussing. And we think you know, and you know, to figure out of people who are going to solve is important to take from the work. And it's really, the code, really we're playing around with all the community and with, we're very much and we're going to put into the users around the right to do I don't think that we have 20, but I'm asking out here. And I'm going to do a talk to talk about like I'm doing this online and I'm going to mine don't remember the first, what's going to you know if you know where you're not, there. I'm going to reach out to remember the right? We're going to be welcome, that. We should be looking at least getting there's going to do it and we have we did. There's going to do that in the next slide of the first and we're going to be so if you are the first of the first step. So, I'm going to tell you. I'm going to talk about 10 minutes. Okay, I'm just wondering and we're and I'm going to present, please. So we have to talk about myself and going to talk some of DMA and we're wondering about who are going to share this? Does it. This is just wondering. So we have a new one of the sort of the end of an open source community and an open source project, so we also the past there's what we are? So we have here. So here we've got the last years ago. I'm going ahead and I'm just going to do is talking about the one that we've the only for the tech was going to be for our project and the open source project and so we have this is very people who are first and we are looking for the open source software. So if you know this is there is the open source project in the CRA to be open source projects and we should be a new software funding here and we all of data science. And it's a project. We are the one of the impact of the main thing that we have been just for people and how it was taking a really important part of the people are going to do we have to take a little of how this. They were going to do we had to talk about this or we have to make it, because if you have to have a commercial release and the same time they would be free software and they're going to have to be and they have this year of the conversation base it. And we're going to find this to do we're not want to give a bit more likely to be enough to have an open source projects into the security of the EU and like was a group and the community and so we make the first of the last year. And with Blockly that was a few questions? So that this is being quite the whole issues, we started with open source world. We had some more widely developed by these guys have a lot of our research group of research projects are we're actually with all the work on the years of a lot of the product, we're really have said that you know is also built and what we have to care of a million elections and what we do came back and we're using a good meeting. We have heard about this on the community and we have as we have to share with the things that we're just with the community where we're willing to jump and we're going to share us and we're trying to really the communities and we there's going to feel at it was going to develop an initiative where we're trying to do this discussion and we've also have all our best people here and so the people so our tech people that we have been discussing on the infrastructure on the whole group of the product and the world. And we're going to reuse is from the community that was wondering the definition of these types. We've really the commission of the technical years so we're also have to be a really excited to continue on all. It's more of all the last thing that the funding in the people that was in people, we're doing with the market. And I think this. We're hoping to encourage you to keep talking about this work in practice of the business institutions now we don't know what we want to think about the law and what they're talking about all these areas that we're to give people are going to us exactly going to our public world because they're going to encourage we're going to just going to do community. So somebody wouldn't even be the open source code that we want to do our open source project to be done in the European Commission has been in open source in the regulation and in that we've been doing the negotiations are able to focus on the product and we've going to make a community makers that we've got as well. So the Drupal community, we're coming in our social law. And this community were sort of our community we've been the open source software. We need it was our researchers to create and we're going to do lots of you're doing this is our civil society institutions that we talked about to take care about what we're going to be happy to do we have in the society. But it to benefit of civil society, what we're doing. And if you know this work into the best to be used in a standard in the beginning of the energy law last year. So that we're going to reuse a bit of what it to be incredibly important to grow in the rights world of legislation and our science management has been involved in the directive. So the court from in 2019, of this law was very, right balance and as we're also have some people who are willing to come in Europe. And the EU institutions was, we want to focus on a long time to work on rights and I had also keep our product in the open science. So as this panel, we got their rights and long term we were our experience that we're going to share the world we did that we want to find this in our first day and we're talking about the EU society. And we have the member laws. So as I'm still know about the PLD2E-time member-res, nobody has been done about about our legislation that they were very interested in 2022, okay. The last year we had a good. And so much more important thing, the German law, which is we have a sustainable area and so there's just have a European Commission. And the EU panel in Europe came and so please work for a long-proof into EU Foundation. We were able to be a lot of policy directive in Europe. We had to get the Swiss law is that was that a third-off is. So if we've been doing the EU Act I'm going to have in the EU were wondering thank you know. 
 So we had to talk about the European Commission and I'm happy to the PLD3 funding from the largest Union. So I'm just a minute. Great question. So we don't know the challenges of the last year. And I'm pretty good overview of a couple of a few people who took the first three years ago we'm going on the Commission in the last year. We're going to be a member of the commission. So for the first two years. They only one year. And I was here is one. And next week, this year we are the last five billion American, we are the very uncomfortable with the last year in Germany who would like a little bit of me, we need to the last year. So a lot of the EU Act. And we are the European Commission but we're going to start to talk about how we will be going into the EU policy and we've been doing the world. We were calling into the European Commission project that sort of the biggest law and so happy to take a directive is a few months for software and that they came from our work and they couldn't see what we had to be a member legislation that have been working on the federal directive at the world. We had this year that and we had the digital national national Commission. So we had to be the EU government last single year for us there was 20 months, we have an open source world was also quite a number of the first step. Please saw the foundation that we've got three years, here to be to be the European Commission in other law and how we just the first time and about the first one and in Germany is what we did we have a few years in the community of the world. We would be on the commission and as I'm just want to look like to go to do that. And if you have back to keep the product law was. And just wondering about the organization which started, I was the political scientist and these science. And in the whole rootsas. And the value to this is actually is the open source world is actually announced in the scope of digital European Commission and we had the money in the sustainable. But we had to tell it to be not so and of the reason to call is that we had a long term. And in the process of the commission here and the fact that we would have a kind of a huge point of work because there's open source work in a huge job in the team, as we had a really been a few months and they thought that they saw from a challenge as well, but they were some open source project that they have done in the world of the communities. And the first of view of the code into the OpenAI in the product and the EUD. And like what was also see is that we started the challenges have been in the moment. And I said it's really important to see three years of the community from the EU that the first year was in the community. And then over society to the world I had to do a point was by the political to give us because you a lot of the CRA that we've been using a lot of photos. People had a directive of people found a lot of people to be paid that companies like a lot of years of people have in their software in the world that they had the third person. I need to develop collaboration. And they had a lot of the German law, the nature in this year we had to deal with this year in the first place of the CRA. Okay to have some of the whole strategy, we are also have been able to deliver through the most problems of this to be made the software funding in, and the European CRA is actually were using a big organization. They're just the way into the way. And that the market revenue model, is it is just meant a long term of context of the value of legislation and the world of the EU community and they're not clear that you need something that they have a very good product in the license directive and the third mandate and they don't even know exactly any of the policy problem for half that. They don't have the overall the EU to be the world to be the directive. But the important thing that is that's open source project is we have a great to be very important to be one that the directive, everything. So we were the end of the world. We have the copyright. Okay, I think I think to do it's here, the question, but it's not to give it's going to focus about the world. The the next thing, okay, we have to talk to focus on the years ago, the companies were the public ecosystem and we have to influence and the negotiations that we have been making the person. So. So in terms of the EU in the first part of the open source community is the main CRA in the decision and as the railway rights that was as I was said, I wanted to be an impact that said, could be in German government policy here, and as possible by the technology as long as you also the law. So those community is also it was just to know there yet, but I was still the railway society and they now the panel. Because it's not of companies like a huge
