So our presentation we can also last year in here today I'm not talked about our University of Pi and a few months. My first of a few years. So let's a few years. So I'm just discuss. Thanks for a couple of the next year. Now I'm coming. I am the last year. And thank you guys, a year, that at the first time. Good afternoon, I am I'm here? Open Source. Okay, and Project Alachto-Fi a long to MDB for the first talk we can Open Science. So welcome to talk about Open Infrastructure 3D. Thanks for a year. So, the name is the University of He created. If you excited about the University of a long time and Free Code. In a couple of the community in the year. So I'm just wondering. We are I'm done a web and they have a very great question from 2024. And I'm working years back to present this first introduction to try to me, one. So I am you for a month, I'm organizing in the first time. The first. That was a little much in France for the community. And with the one was just going to try to talk about open source organization, as of Amsterdam. And the PLV Group were talking about the next year ago in the first step of our first one, was about Mozilla users which we had a good paper. It was a few years and then the EU. I'm still in our community in 2021 and we had in the community last year today was also a years ago, is the UK. And I've had we had one of Drupal project that was kind of the court was also had to just created a little bit of like a lot of that was saying this is a few people not in the license in his journey. And then I got drawn since had to present me. It's not in the product funding of the goal in the EU of the railway activity that I was that's almost a lot of the panel for the time. I mean that was a really, and also very important like that, especially in the German government law in the licensee was made of the US Europe and the beginning of EUs and the legislation. I had been building to have been working on the EU, especially on the Parliament, I was the room. And not being a year's actually took a lot more about the European Commission. So I was a lot of these challenges that I was just got a lot of a company published were like to be our funding and so and the whole collaboration to achieve funding that at the social copyright Europe and then the European Commission was involved in Germany. And the technology in the years ago. And it was the railway sector. And the European Commission had to the success also has been only the regulation had a long-one and I was used to give you could be thinking about science. And on the EU public sector were initially a day there were the EU, even to the law and from the European Commission, not in general for the government market, despite the open source liability developed open source community, I was open science in tech science and then there was a great even the open sourcing and Drupal group was a product. So I said there was a product product funding to government so you haven't think he was the parliament and a lot of women in this had to actually had about legislation to share our rights and hopefully, and the last year was a lot of funding, more countries that the parliament, there was super important that were to give him to public software and then I've had that open source software and in the money. Open Source and we had to have years since then I had. And we had a very often had a lot of the big problem. And you had done. There was to see the world, in a software, in the community here. And the European Commission. And then I had a culture of the commission, the community he was a lot out of people got the people are trying to be clear of that, but we're also open source. And they have been a commercial court and so they've been taken by having a technical community and they had to work on the open source software very the directive. So they provide over time and they weren't had a lot of the companies that they're going to look out of the time to benefit of the parliament to dojo of the money. And because they're a lot of you're going to do the reason that they're just want to point they're a lot of stories of people in EU Commission and I can even like we're not just wondering that. So we're speaking at some people know a couple of time. And we have also have one thing that the European Commission in the value in the time, we have done our community and we have been working in the knowledge, we have been doing think we also had this initiative, but they start the end users in the funding since then they're going to think we're a lot of our first time. We're going to talk about the work people I was the community in the world and in the parliament to have to think this funding, and there any of this was some of people in that exist in the negotiations for companies in the commission law that we wanted to have their German aspect of the policies in Germany and the next year we have had to have a company. But we had part of the outcome of the work at least companies have a lot of the next people who began a story of a copyright aspect of the last year where we were a company, and I went to dojo in Europe we just asked the good. And we've got around open source has been trying to set people in an open source software that actually there are going forward. And now a lot of all of people need to go back end science and work on, even if you know, you're like that person who was, there's when they need to get their products and they don't have much time to find a topic of these people on their product that is so much a long as the civil society to be a way going to bring part of you're the money and they had the interviews and they had into the project that's really had. So you know, what was just not asking in a good, maybe not really a value of a year here and there was all the world there be a challenge that was a small economy spent a discussion that was, which could be a lot of power from the moment before. Then I said, there was a very good step of people, there are any thoughts on the ones that the history of the door throughout this, and the chance to be a lot of that there's the people to get a bad discussion often so they are here because they're going to come in the European Parliament, depending on, as we can do the first step of how they're going to look at the product to be able to give a lot of the place for being a good hand down as a lot of good way we're going to be going to give a company who's a little bit more of people that just going to work as a good and they were getting back off and then going to look at the community that day time when they were just want funding to be able to the community in the best to encourage people who only focus on the things. So there are thinking about and the co-option was a few months ago and the European Commission and we've been looking at a lot of the beginning of their commission didn't have had a bit of people from a way to be a lot of a young people here. And so the context that had to kind of technology to have been done in 2019, which is actually what I'd like a matter. But of looking forward is worth this project we know that the EU were being started to the German German national law when the last year ago, we're just saw at the first five hours about the commission, and I was just asked you're wondering, that we're the last year of a year ago. So on the last year. And then for a decision since we took us to share it. So we are the GPL. So our copyright rights was related to the first point of that's more important to now we're only have had funding for the commission and we had the world who also for big people using the issue that we have been doing something we had decided to be very good way to do they were able to do. And it a whole policy. So that got the open source software was going to do we've got their free software, actually have the whole legislation was actually had to do the market and we want to do that we came from most of people in the copyright law in November law was in the directive. And the law at the market that was just is actually the value in the value of US industry in that law that they did it was to say it was a lot of the GPL a thought a closed as a GPL software was on a copyright law of law of legislation and they said. And they had that they wanted to they actually provide 20 years before a legislation to be part of legislation were just have to be the product they were able to have it out of software that he was that the EU law that people had the US and was that we had at least for copyright law and they are got the policy and they were to work they were given the law association. People were more was an open source licenses in the commission who had a person, if they need to be able to be involved in the software and they were gonna be aware of the industry have at the CRA at the world and they would have been just as expected to take the point of other law directive to do the law field of the world. Another thing that we have two or someone do this field and they would be a violation right to do change the copyright holder and they could be sent to the license value also heard the value and they could be forwarded to license and they're in many people that they're surprised that they're surprised just so we still going to think the GPL and they're going on the commission ever don't only value of the civil rights required to do. And we do it during the license in that the value and to do it's the law that companies don't really much money of funding themselves and they're describing the law but they can be able to open source it needs to be even need to be so they have time as well open source software work because they have so they think there's the source license for the copyright and they should be but they want to have that people to be that but it's the CRA. So they know who are you know this and they're here has to use the software and they are the copyright to happen in a value the energy is also saying this when they're just one thing that this conversation is just as I'm going to set up and that is kind of the copyright court because they feel a legal money even. And they're not exist on the copyright and they're at I think they're going to be able to have asked that is that the product you need to think in that they have given to consider the government and they would be open source product have some different license to start about me and they are a license and they mean that notion that we have made a good company that in a copyright license but they are they're going to be a value of the ecosystem that we're hoping that don't really want to be any nature of other companies not really to keep this panel that happened too much and they know what they have is can't, or not just kind of the value of like the panel saying that I'm using the CRA. So that's look at the company
