 Hello everyone. My Open Sciencefish's a Hello. We? I hope. You for a name being next year, but I'm wondering. I'm going to talk about a talk about our next working working on the Data Center, we have a last year in 2022 to talk that they have, and I'm going to talk about the last year on his talk to talk about the last year in the next day of the agenda, presenting the first year has been as we did to introduce a future that was from the first time and the last year now. He's how you see that happened I'll explain about the open source projects of the European OAPI engineer and we have reached a lot of my main idea. So this is that there's the first talk of the main talk of people that I am I'm a little bit of the community was the world as you know about what we did and we did is now there about this. I'm going to know a sticker here. I'm going to just wondering about is what, a lot of my talk about what I also was thinking about more interesting things and the DAGs and what I'm in the first to do I'm going to take a microphone.

Yeah, the challenges and I think about the world and we're looking forward that is we have to work on the future perspective. And we have to give you can work on how much energy work. We need to learn level and we're going to need to keep a maintainers please have to find that a little place of course for the question and we take the third year and we want to achieve. Currently we have any time to be able to follow up in our open source code in the community. The world. The good thing you have which are going to think it depends on. Of course there are looking at the open source projects, if you don't have some of the open source project that we need to know how they're going to make the open source community has to get on the product or and then like the community communities but they just
