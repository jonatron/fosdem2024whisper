 It makes a lot of code to be how it works. You got a lot of people. And I think, you can use it. You can go to the tools that's not very simple. You can get a lot of hard to give a little bit blurry. You can use. You can see the template. You're a little bit of different dependencies. You can see some things in the build. You can see the code. You can see how you do you try to see a little bit of the names. You can see the arguments, but you can modify it. You can see what a number of brackets, or things that you can read a graph on. You can do with block. You can see that you can see, a type you can see in Python. You can see the size, then have a variable for the JavaScript function which I change. I'm going to be going to change a number of six seconds. And that you can see is how you will see from it's slow. You can see that you see in block and then I will see. And if you're going to select when you see the result is only going to show you the second one. I can see. So I'm just going to look at here. I'm going to see this way. So if the event and if I'm going to handle this one. Okay, I have a table. I have here. I'm going to go in your name. I'll introduce the state of it. So you can see the first step is the distance is next state of the data in the state. He's going to work. And I'm going to be a loop here in the main sample. It has a real the case. I have been here. I'm going to see here, if you can see here from a number of the table because I'm going to generate as you can see the loop. I'm going to talk about it's we want to add here. It's going to be a second. Here I'm going to make a little bit here. So this was good question. I'm going to add a lot of the input it can only for example if I'm going to see if I'm just saw that. The question, I'm going to speak. I'm going to talk going to discuss if I'm going to tell you want to go to join each commit. But I'm just wondering I'm wondering, I'm important to go to start talking about. I'm just wondering, I'm just wondering, I'm hoping to what I'm dealing with this talk about how I'm going to make a little bit about, I'm going to talk to talk about the slides. But yeah, this is today we're on my next speaker and here. So the start a small. So we're going to note. So, when I'm going to give a few people who I'm going to be going to talk about my presentation. And I'm going to keep the next three years ago. I'm very happy to talk about being listening here in the world, we have the talk about in the talk about some questions and I'm going to be very happy with the workshop. I think I'm going to be talked about the side, but I'm glad for my next speaker was wondering the first. I'm using the year, if you, you're going like, you're going to call it's going to be the question to be wondering. Of course you want to start to help the question about how we have you're using the European Commission team. And I'm now. There's kind of a little bit of a little bit of what I'm going to show me about the internet. And I got to be a minute to do is that? I'm working on the first was in the history of the digital website to get. I was on the day. And I'm going to the last year. I'm a little bit about the different from me at one. So that from the company is a very often 2023. It was a long time in there is they have been a member of the past members. And I've been a lot of you know what I was kind of years to ask me the second five years ago. I also about. I was wondering if you a lot of people at the open source software initiative. And I'm going to know about it's going to do you heard about that. I'm just briefly to open source and I think there's going to talk some people have been going to be sure that you know, but this was the data that was just a bit more important that they have been made in the source software that point and there were not a big things that it and I was only one of this was very important point. And what the copyright has been a huge impact, but there was using was sort of an open means there was something that they had to work and that we could exist that person in terms of time and the policies in one of code and the kind of the way. Because these value that I've just have been doing this is the product and you can do something that to just did with the result of the product. And then you're going to go, then you know. And yeah, you have my knowledge called an easy to have a lot of the one of these things in the idea of people. And they're coming from the issue. But I've got to think, has a lot of what I know. I was in a lot of time of my knowledge to it was at a good open source communities. But I'm a lot of people has been aware of people involved in terms of people that do, people, this is just the market. But he decided to end, but I think it would see the future. It was the last year. He was what I mentioned that's a good project to think I have to do for you want to say. And I'm probably had to all the point I think there. I was one to it was like the only one of the community to do with us and like to be that's basically have really a lot more. And so I think there were thinking about people to make know that the product and they were that they, there were the license being something that they were that they had the product. They went by the cost and they had been got three million organizations that we had listed there. So they went into a bit controversial thing that they came up and they were much more often no, maybe had to go to actually, we had the government and they were not doing so people like they were like what were in the government asked an NGO and they had a good company to get the key would like to be the last year, maybe the US and they had to the last year. And finally felt like having was being a long time of the time. But we saw I'm looking at the beginning. So first one you can't have some people working to think that the next topic of the one has been thinking about the last one thing that we've got said that was doing the moment. I didn't kind of these days of the whole person at the question were that people had a non-time companies at the first point, what we been done a discussion, the idea were the world were thinking about the group with the last year ago. And they were asked that our software are the first of that and they were the market that were aware of the Commission because they have had the end of the co-to- Software Foundation, and so they say we were the US fund their EU and we keep a huge problems in our EU but we have been the open source world, the moment we're interested in the digital office which was a year, they may be shown started in 2011 were now published in France, right year ago. And the software. And that was a long time of the IT for the first thing was because that's a little bit of the year to talk was around people that was very early law, the Swiss we were very much there been around the whole product was quite important by the US, which was very important that had it actually been a lot more and the years ago and the world was made by actually felt that was had then on the developers were the license and had the Ospam and then the way it was the world of the liability is always open source in the EU. And from the whole one of the open source policy could be. And so out that is an open source Europe is possible to the Drupal software is a lot more difficult to have, and open source world. And now now I would be at the market, since there's in the last year of the year, okay, so I was to not sure that also as far the first year so that was a open source law and I think we had in the government and they were doing with this law so he had very excited to have had been now the technology in C court was very excited about the copyright law, the commission wasn't there the licensee was a good as we had to ask the PLD had not sure are of the two years in Europe, but as a policy was developed the copyright clause was the law government that is a law and a GPL law at the GPL copyright law of law and they went over our law's meant that was not so they had 15 years it was made this infringement to completely closed good. And the law. So there was a European laws, so that the infringement has in the possibility to need to make the market. So there wasn't been able to be a problem that the CRA, but since US law but the EU Parliament and these the point was GPL was where things like which has been solved what the copyright representative of freedom is the law. And was that's that they had used in other people in an rights of the court began and they didn't started to public value that they need to say that they had decided that moment the copyright rights about a copyright law and a license was not only 2023, the open source software legislation. And so if they're always find the tech law law is a one German copyright value open source law and even the nature and, and also has been a value that about GPL and so and they were paid for its copyright decision directive that they just also may have funding and then put in this copyright as well that has to be a tech would open source field. The value, that they will be there was a gate so it would be aware of legislation in the directive. So that is the AI people are these legislation of some obvious and thus they have been used to an official national law and a critical person came to actually learned in German GPL that they were quite a decision and we just captured exactly and so that we had to make the challenge to study. Now this is interesting was an open source law and they wanted to be the copyright. But there really a law that need this kind of legislation that will be the CRA law, but the methodology that would be part of open policy would be a cost of our impact of the law is really important in the license and they want to work in a decision that sort of the legislation that it was something that they shouldn't think or they can be they also the market that they had learned, like a decision and that the world. And what the end that would be the European end just talked about open law was the PLD would be made by that she had the commission from the commission and the law that you don't know. So I didn't know more important way. So I didn't know that I was because the copyright law, could be open source law is important time to really, people are aware to tell the court and we had by the German law and law directive because to copyright rights regulation of law there are a copyright directive that the commission that what we're in the European EU is going to first law of this was, so far as I was. I'm part that one directive to understand what you know that the copyright law to say there and a copyright law to that also could be. So, I think was really important to think that I asked how these decision from the CRA on the law, but the commission is that we had to speak into the GPL and we had that we would be said, right market and trying to talk to also been really want to do that were just that have a German policy. We was one of the directive, or not have to put a decision into the source law, but to be any conditions and we wanted to do that law we can be able to start to work on the end there. So in terms of the regulation about the law, also the directive to be the GPL law and the law for a parliament that is just happened in court at law. So I think these open law that was the PLD which also made in the democratic and society in the directive in it was a law we had into one billion law and the copyright he said that companies that is also was the EU competition software technology that they had had to be the public law was as I was one that he recently an issue and we had this cost of that the product and not quite a real software policy actually had this was made in January law liability to open software law in a energy law, and the software mandatory value and open science. That's obviously I've put in a good so the commission and I think that's in the licenses, the law in law and I don't know and when they don't want the fact that you need to think there is what the decision. So that okay I think we know about means about government doesn't know the value in order to accept in the market and we've had before they do we see the commission and that they've got into copyright directive. So I think that we're moving time. We need to do and how this energy policy and also that take an interesting in terms of the court in the law work. And but the commission has been just one of legislation would be just talked about law to be here. And the principle of some knowledge of the second law who have some public public law when they gave a long they're on the law. I can be clear in a representative of the law and the knowledge from the French law's the law at the court we're only two organizations and I'm also have taken to be used to make a one of law and they do not a much and really clear enough money. So the commission are really think this law, not sure that important open source law, in the court person as we are as well in the representative and the policy. The law. And then the fact, because the law we have put in this law that's not completely important to be competitive
