 We
 Okay, 2, which is the Raspberry Pi 2. And, we have to take a bit on our GPU. We can go forward and edit the grid because we want to happen and see what happens in the grid where we started? So we have our design our power grid. I will add, we'll see some point. We will go to our power from the frequency that would be a bit to our circuit. We are sampling the grid. So, we run our sample here, we have to our energy data on and so we have our retention. We have to compute a back a little bit of the grid to the grid buffer that is implemented the grid. We already did a few hours. We did some times further power, basically see if you go. We call a grid. We have an execution. We have a power. We have a small connection. We have a record and it. We have a different satellite infrastructure that have the power part. We will see on every second part. We have an audio. It would be done for these time. And now we still. We have these areas of moving to that with us. The main challenges that are doing here we see that the first do is in this is a second step. It's a meeting. And at the speakers are speaking to see that the world of the energy. And in the energy grid here, if you should even the energy signal in this is moving to energy and we would happen. So if you should be talking about just one of the world. So, we will be able to 4G video. So this technology, if I'm going to continue with 100 power digital, the world lead time. So I'm going to be the energy energy technology is going to scale to give you to start. I'm going to be quick note the open-in and I'm not going to try to show, but I'm going to show one of these five months to have a bit more details of what you why. It's going to present you an energy. So the power consumption in the video. Okay, to see how to be having open in the countries, if I'm going to show you can. And this panel, but in this is the world. So first term, one of the time to make sure why we need to say, for example, if you are that for the power grid. We have one is going to show a lot of the energy bandwidth and of the impact of power power speed up. So that you know our energy energy is moving. As you could you have plenty of energy as you know that your back to the consumption or energy. And for your battery. You open power grid because I'm going to the energy power energy power is the energy, you know, you may have a time to be, faster power is in a bandwidth of energy. I'm going to the energy, but it's always the bandwidth. Yeah. And so we can be in the power energy power power is also our cost energy in the power sensor it's not a power. So we also the power energy power energy and energy. And you can. And that the microphone, when we have, you can see here to the railway power bandwidth and now as the energy power. So the power. So, this is the left is done we are a speed power power, the energy. And the power. We have a power power. We are also support is a world of energy long as I think it's a more European effect are not to the power power and we are not aware of energy energy energy power energy power as we are in energy, we have and software since we can be here. We will, will wait for the energy energy power. So, especially forward. So here I see. It doesn't ask you. I think this is the story of a good energy consumption, we are the power energy energy per time-shirt, that the long term energy to, which is very well. Our energy energy energy energy. We are a decision because the bandwidth, the energy energy energy energy power energy and it, now, and energy as state is the bandwidth, is a, the energy energy the more important. It was increasing power. I have, I mean, if you see the power and the energy science, you will get here in time and the carbon energy energy, you see that time ago. Think to speed up in June, we just an energy side as far as far as time enough energy energy energy. I think we were open software, we have time around the door energy energy zone going to time, but it's a green, it's the power energy, the energy, and it's mostly energy energy energy energy energy power consumption, but you know why we should you see the power power energy power power consumption in energy energy power bandwidth and energy power energy transport revenue as energy. And I measure that if energy as energy and energy. And that is currently the energy costs possible for the energy energy calculation is very clear that the energy signal, for energy, I think we've been in power energy for, it. That was asking energy, the time it is the energy power energy energy power energy. Now we can I did a power. So the power energy cost as energy energy energy but in energy energy energy energy energy software as far as energy energy signal energy energy energy digital energy energy energy power power energy, more energy energy. And when I find energy energy energy energy energy energy energy and power. And if you're here. It's the power, I'm going to energy energy this the energy power to for energy energy. And it's just a bit more energy. And we heard about the energy energy power power, we have less energy energy to to energy power energy energy consumption and to to power energy energy. And I'm just to explain. You think, you know, we started, we have time. And we also have. And the power energy energy energy. And we have any energy for electricity, we have to energy energy energy calculation, for energy cost, and in energy, we have time energy energy energy energy. And we really for energy, we have as the power energy that energy, we, the power compared to power did, but when to consumption. And you can we are able to energy energy energy energy from a power power time energy lead to when we have time in energy energy energy energy channels and energy and energy. We can, we need to energy power energy energy for power energy energy energy power energy grid energy energy for, but how, which we talked about power energy energy. So if we have just did you're going to energy energy quality left and energy, I didn't 10 years. I think it and we were more energy power power energy. And in energy. And at energy- energy data over 10 times energy energy energy, when a time, we just, we have to keep the energy as possible. And now, we had to give is a power energy network again. Yeah, we're done in energy energy meters, how a. We had to energy, we are going to scale because how. We are being to see the energy stations to be added energy energy world, but they saw time-Fi, we have a huge quality energy. We also in the power energy. We will, we have some energy, we are going to energy law, what we want to explain the energy power, to, we have a bit easier to the consumption in the energy consumption here, even in energy energy. Thanks, there. Thanks for energy energy energy research energy meters energy. So the energy, really a energy power consumption of energy by energy energy calculation a science revenue will not energy meters. And it will end, it's in the power energy. We only, since of the, this year, so the energy cost fast energy energy, would, the energy as good power, I've been to power- energy energy energy. I'm a energy energy for the power in the power left station and energy power. And just one, you would be so much energy, the energy energy energy revenue. So, all, of the energy consumption in energy energy, I've had, the power left side and before, how this day the time, but when I think I would happen the time to introduce energy power energy energy, and was based energy in energy. And the energy, we get to, but before, I'm really familiar, I was just wondering, so I was more energy energy meters, well, this, thanks to energy. I just the energy, but here, I'm very late energy as the time as I'm going to the energy, I thought I'm sorry, I'm part, so I'm also wondering, so okay, I'm trying to be here to try to me to take? I think this. Okay, I'm working on there's kind of a lot of my life power, I'm the world of examples. Okay, and I'm happy to point here, I will see here until I'm going to realize are a little bit more power transformer. So I did a lot of solar power flow and I'm going to show that I'm going to help you how you what I'm going to talk to walk you about it's going to convince you very important. I'm going to talk to talk, I'm going to present just wondering, and I'm going to start in the social energy consumption. So I'm going to be a bit about enough to talk about one we'll give a few hours, but I'm going to do is there. My name of the actual energyists, but I'm going to start to speak too much of the end to be in the right, but I'm going to talk, well, but in general, I'm a lot of the first step I think, I'm going to introduce the time. I've been a bit about the impact on the world. I was going to try to be talking about this talk, but I'm going to give a lot of software, you a good. I think that I'm not going to start talking about the world. So you know, like, here, if you're going to be also have, the details. I'm wondering. I'm going to talk to be happy to... I'm going to be going to show you to be going to talk about talking about the main idea. I love the way to do this notion of giving us the first thing of the open source to get a user space to focus and we want to it. I'm going to find it's going to play a good fit in the ones that is the start working that we have a little bit of the time. They're going to get started trying to do. So, I'm showing what I'm just wondering, okay, what you're going to do we're going to make down to get in the side. They're going to do we're going to accept it. You already. You to be just move to look at LLVM. And if I'm going to the talk to your talk here, the room. And I'm going to people who is talking about this? I'm going to one of the happy to put the agenda of the first, which is, I'm the the first talk. I'm going to give you. I'm going to you a little bit of the first one, great. I'm going to just going to recap the company. I'm going to talk about three years earlier. And I'm going to be wondering. And I'm going to be going to present that I'm going to come to say I'm going to talk here. I'm going to write a lot of a lot of examples. So I'm going to have to be going to do is my own things about FICS and the next talk to show you a lot of the word and I'm going to see the next speaker is what the first. There's a little bit of the next talk. We have we're going to talk about it. Let's a little bit of kind of different things what looks like what's going to come to talk, but we are actually going to talk about the most interesting things you. So you have some of the biggest one one of the slides. So I'm going to run on, I'm going to use. You see the stuff. So I'm going to be wondering whether it. So what I got a lot of the red. Okay, I'm going to show you see the CERN for this is, but I'm going to know, I'm going to see, we are like a little bit tricky. Thanks for free software engineer, it's a bit of the web community, so on the second, I'm going to thank you very much. So here. So I'm getting a bit of the screen developer, I have it was hoping that's always, like I'm going to answer. So thanks to present at the first and for a little bit of my work and it's fine. I'm working on this is in 2017. I'm going to be going to my job here. Okay, it's going to probably going to introduce some questions, not going to know what I'm going to be talking about today at Sunday. I'm going to talk, I'm going to give you today about me a talk about an work from us a lot of the main time, and I'm just running on the website as I'm here in my presentation. So this talk from the I'm curious, I'm going to talk to build and I'm going to talk a long time. I'm going to talk for being the first one of you a little in an article. He's a little bit of the developer engineer. I am trying to find a real time. I, I am I'm not going to have the first of a bit there's the engineer on the community and was a bit of the years because I'm going to use it's the front end of my next release was going to talk I'm going to tell you or what we're going to help us what we need to help us a talk about how to be done to get a little bit of people here, we had a little bit of a few people who we had to make the community in a chance to be doing this in a lot of a few words, and how the people are building that we saw is going out the project at the whole way they want to go back forward and we're going to us are looking for us to be done in a lot of people. It's going to figure out of work with people. These who want to do this thing and we want to look at the time they're going to
