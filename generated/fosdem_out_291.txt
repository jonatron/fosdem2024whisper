 Hi everyone again 
 Hi everyone. And I'm a tiny talk about open source and I'll be glad to share an engineer about a tech engineer at the DSP world under the Open Science Foundation and I all from the co-source Security Security funding and open source, from the first question in years ago, very first in the OpenJDK for the European Commission. And nowadays it was for that I'm going to be writing open source and she was trying to maintainers from the world, but it's going to talk about for the EU funding. I'm going to talk about that, what we have to introduce a young people who want to get into our open source communities on the world. And I'll skip this later. I'm happy to hear a couple of people. So thank you. Thank you for the idea of applause for thank you very much everybody so much very much very much so I'm happy to do from the Internet and well. 
 I'm sorry afternoon everyone very much so welcome thanks to the morning everyone. I work for the last introduction, that we have a year at the speaker for the room. We've asked by the next year, we're going to talk about I think we have some questions. And I'm here. So my first time the next talk. And thank the first talk's the story of a very much for all have a year. Thank you guys. 
 Good afternoon. I'm presenting the time to talk about we've ever talked about DSPy for the last year. And thanks. I'm Jonas the Red Hat, DSPOS. I'm presenting half eight years ago, everybody, we have been using OpenJDKF and from the JFR and the OpenAI 2G 3D developers. And this year, this is Rid-D and to start of the years ago on the OpenJDK 1 millions, so there are also announced to be other years, so the CRIOSD, we actually at the last year, and I'm an first year back and I said a few years. And so we are all of JIT4, the year is a third, which is in CSPish. It's great. So we can we have a bit about C++ 3D, there. And we've been here. We'll talk to do as I have to mention the last year we have done, so much with the next days, which we've been talking to do a few months, but we're here a year, which is a year. We had a lot of a small moment. We get more from the last year, are as a few servers. So you know, we have a bit about the first time, you can see an open source project and so. This is another talk about to how I'm a few years ago, why did I am we haven't know I'm going to present, so I mentioned here. I'm an end time to be going on. And I'll get to show of them and I'm working group. So I'm going to speak about this talk about that was a project was a personal open source software engineer, well. And then about two years, I'm sure that's going to talk is going to talk that's going to the first talk about how you're to see what the slide is you get to know what this kind of what we are important to help with the software in, is still got a big aspect of a lot of what we're going to use and how long term, but in the things like thinking about the 90s that is we're going to go ahead of community and we're going to maintainers, and we've got to create a little bit more money and so and they're building, right-time people are going to influence the company or we're going to be sitting here and they're able to get like come up having a company. And then they're going to come to get time. But if you know I'm going to dojo, people going to do this end of the community alone. And I'm going to talk about the project, but I'm sorry, we're trying to focus on open source. And it's just a lot of open source activities are the last year. You can't want to keep going to be at it. You can be more than being full of people in the open source community. So in the years ago, right? And we're going to encourage people to find a lot of the talk about the beginning of people to keep like open source tools and also help it to make our community in our project when we're open source so many people. I'm going to talk about this year to be the end of the community of the day. We're going to talk at the open source projects like I will be talking about the years of the time because you know, you know, I think about and we have the community community and we're now have been part of the first five years and we're going to care about how the panel and I think about the day. And I think that we're like to be talking about the last year ago at least already heard about, I am in and the time that we were going to be working on the community and I will probably going to be, but this talk I'm a bit of the goal of a company engineer in the world that have to present in general people first year. And I'm coming through the project and so far as I'm briefly on the free software engineer at the first year in the last year and I'm just wondering that over before is also wondering that we were on the last year and I'm curious about that I'll start in the next release, we'll be just wondering that was good question and I'm all just wondering about the first time because I'm trying to talk I'm going to keep I'm here for coming in the year. I'm gonna present is going to I'm just going to start the talk about the European Commission in the community and since the years ago from the time lead time and I'm going to the lastly is he's going to thank you very much. So I'm going to talk about the last speaker in the digital Foundation. 
 Okay. I'm going to be at the digital staff, she's going to run for us here in and she who's happy to finish the founder of the DIC Foundation has been contributing to work around the digital activity community to the social revenue and he's the day and I was very quickly in 2016. So I'm working open source teams who are also think we have to be a European Parliament. Just to talk about OpenStack, but that's a good to work that but it is the first that the open standards, it's more important to provide a half a knowledge in France and has been in the company in April. The German and I was a large team in France, energy and the city of the digital transport projects that we need to do things we also have been a European Commission from a national science model, and the University of this technology and I'm not first year. The first open energy of the first group was the whole platform in December society. Glad to have been a long in the first big. So really high time I think. And what I can I'm sorry, honestly. I know, what we understand is to make in the work on the panel, we have to do. And I want to create a few years ago, we have a new product here. For this on the first time that, I guess, I'm not talking about this is true. And so many I'm going to focus on the time the world would be here. Our member of the good stories of the project as we don't want to be more important now, we say the end source community, so we are our community in this is to continue a lot of it's not open source software over time in the open source world of course, like this point. I wanted to focus on the negotiations, and we have to find the challenges of legislation and that there's not so you may be here. So, there's a second. So there are any one of our next talk about the first one. We've been talking about which is a very first time to, I'm not a company. It's a lot of a long a lot of open source projects is also a thousand rights of years and said, but there's the European Commission to not a very well problem is a social revenue in the product as well to establish revenue as I guess they did it's the market in the cost funding and the public field of us to have, including the point of the French law in the technology were made the law that the government law but they had asked they were already made some point or the German law it from Switzerland. And almost there were made that was a very long cost for the term And the law to be is really good success in the commission, but there are a copyright software law law can always somewhat important law to we had an Australian software at least to be surprised. So that was no, we have been doing the directive, right, especially if the European Commission in the law to do we need to use regulation. And of the first one of the law that was that still very long term. And so there are time there. So there? I think this was the EU. And when I think we have the licensee law that the court was a law and the law. So, they just a GPL license so okay. And it's what people that this space, to impact the street. And then they are all about a bad impact of the value of these law law and they were talking about the value and so well, well, but they said, but they had some would have the law, but they say, and there's what a law, what I had to fix law, they had to have to remember the directive and the negotiations in the law where you also would happen to copyright law, such a law, the law, they could also get learned the copyright politics came to that could be used when you know, they were reading in the value, but they didn't seem bad discussion and they had to get a law, but if you know what could benefit from the court is very large value that you know, you know what the least in companies are actually have a small court could be the way to focus of the GPL and each directive and the law we trust, and we have the copyright law becomes very clear and they're following this value that we've said, you may need that they're looking at one they shouldn't have to stay in the law, but they don't like well that the law. And so far's good knowledge to do it's the GPL to the copyright. They've got the law. They're no idea of the licensee license law and they're at the law person and they're just a licenseability of the policy who're the she's not clear that the copyright copyright law that the law. And that they've been a no one and law has actually she says for a representative. And they have no, as the license that they used that value that they are still they're not at the law. And they're that you know, you could be, well. So I said, which is you know, you know that's not the moment because they're doing the infringement of law and otherwise the issue to be the law that you know in the decision law license as the German law it's not only that it's not to be the copyright agreement to worry that there for organizations the copyright open standards. So in this commission law because the government law, I'm the holder's the US EU law there is a nature of that you know what they see in the time market under legislation that they were paid and they were here and they were not all of law funding, but they were doing that we were so they were here just to know, which were talking to the law say they are the law, to the law, the directive. It was a problem, except to the law in law. They did there was. So they had the copyright law they took us said that are even in the court market that we came to do so the copyright law was not had even a copyright and I would be for copyright law that had was basically a copyright law to just in the German copyright law law or even as could get in law laws, it was a was a decision was okay that as possible. So I was the GPL could been in the law was just released because they was is a society of law was on the GPL law that they have thought we have the law law when they were done that they said, it was even I was in some issue we would be competitive or to that particular laws were at least 15 years ago they're a huge law was really difficult to know do they worked at that this is that was far is not, and the legislation here that they were a license law on an law and so what I was essentially had from an felt court law and I was a license regulation. Because it was the regulation was to software that I still, and a license and a secret licenses of license. That was a copyright was just used in practice. The law is actually we were there wasn't been around TPM systems that this not only the court licensee could be a political law is even in the commission because there was not the law. So that should have a law under copyright had the copyright directive in German law, law law that the whole law directive there was always so when you know that's no be done because there was great big license that it was you can't really be this point, even much money, but really kind of there, the law's not not that the German directive in the law is a law, the in fact that they are not in fact that the law in the US that the copyright laws that they are still exist anymore but you're on the value from the law and you know someone else, but that's the law, and the commission that means they are now or there are not any license copyright holder is a value of law did we provide no trust and that the copyright doesn't have to that if they want both law in the law and they say and they could be it, the legislation will be really care in fact, this point. The problem is what I think it's going to the law could be working on the law. Unfortunately, of the technology, okay, the law has been a value of the German rights of that was not a directive the copyright GPL in of legislation would be no idea that was the commission didn't the commission that we wanted to influence that we
