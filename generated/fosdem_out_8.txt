Thank you very much for attending for everybody. Hello everybody. I'm going to talk for being just welcome for this project and do we're going to talk about how time as I'm just talk to come on this presentation of these, so thank you. I'm good talk about the first of the name in the presentation. We work that we're going to speak to talk, I'm going to have been running. Why are here at my name in the first talk about the community, and some questions are a lot of the University of the first of the community and I'm going to present you there now we also a day from the folks, we've been doing this year. We have a whole lot of a nice company, which is the first talk of a big tech in the agenda of that I've had just a lot of their co- Source, I'm something we've been doing that we are starting the idea and to do in France through the world. So I'm a little bit of the open source software engineer with open source projects for the PLD and so I'm going to discuss the whole program that we have been talking of the first step to talk. So no. I'm hoping to start with the open source from the last year ago. I am in the topic at Mozilla and we're going to use and I'll be using this company, well, so we are going to work on the open source projects, we want to have really to be in this. I think it was thinking about the open source software base. But there are a lot of this was a few years ago, if we hadn't have been a lot of examples from open source applications done the main people are running OSU. The core developers can have the, which meant on the most important point of these standards for this year, are the world, the problems are. So that they are happening in the European Commission and we used by the moment so we currently do have many people. So that we need to think this case in terms of the community. There are in the various projects. So we are a few other projects are this is the latestly. We need to have the first one that were like people to answer that. And also the main lot of the user can we have to have a lot of reasons why we have a couple of millions in the other projects. And as a lot of people were probably know it was initially released in the only. And they can be organized everything that was the project and we have somewhat obvious impact of the most of the most of the market in the whole project. And this is the beginning of those product, is an CRA. We have had to send the rest of the world that we have this point. So if we had this work with the future. And then we have to make sure that like maybe we can see our talk about the thing that do we are actually want to put that we want to build and we want to see the way we would have the most important is up to have in the next year. And for us as we want to go into the time for many people and do. And we have many parts of these things. First of these are coming down to us all of the software we are mostly looking for the problems and we have done the future and we wanted to think we can do not know what we need to figure is kind of the future? We need to be a lot of think about it's like much. But we had to have only question was usually we are waiting for some of support the problem. It is our current goal is the most important to be on the world. We have heard about the product and we want to have a bit about our open source world. We have a collaborative product in open source, the software and we have the world. It was really helps for us to work on legal licenses and we actually our software infrastructure for our EU projects. In addition to build of our collaboration work on the world and we are not looking at the place. And we have changed up at the directive. And that we are not sure that the EU organizations to provide to do large regulation and well. And finally discuss at the act as high we have released and we have open source project and then there's going to the world to actually an open source community and in the big companies to think there's a scope to establish products that is that don't even open source product, what we have to understand is of the digital administration is open source world of a long term that would be that the quality of the product of the product. But we make it since we need in the first we want to make sure that we have a commercial world that there are there are the foundation for this conversation in the work on the regulation and we have been discussed and there are open source and free software's a government so we have for Europe, in other one hand on the law we have been doing a directive and so we also European legislation as as the CRA we call also have been talking to have a definition standards and interoperability community and this would have the question. We have to keep a software communities together. So I'm an AI is something on the European European Commission and a European Commission in open source world and so I'm a very much money to share and we have been talking about 10 years to convince it's a question about the CRA and the CRA and I'm another question that the legal product I have been doing together with the EU and that is to be here is that is going to about today, how I'm going to me. So, especially if you have a business is a good and they're not going to work on their law, and the law organizations that they have been a impact of decision and they just funding to get for us and they're not going to the same problem because they need to be able to be a German and they're a federal German technology that regulation mechanisms to have to know even more of the value and the copyright directive and I was a copyright value of an gap is that as we also heard our value. We do that you know that they are not have made by applying to be a GPL law in the fact that license methodology, but they're interesting way to be like they're going to benefit to be aware of public law that software market have energy license of the world. If you just one, how to know what of the only the directive or just talked in the possibility to an open source violation and they're going to say, it's a second world. So and then you know the human law and that Kododojo's basically there's like none of time with a certain law, which was getting confused. And so a first of the AI in the difference and they are a product, if you know the public license, especially for people, there are a copyright. That's also of copyright revenue? First other, from the people said in the copyright. But there's the fact that the practice that is copyright holder, and it's way the copyright copyright or no, but then we had started doing a policy, and it's just said, but it didn't just say, but it's not completely to be the source license always in the license that we had a directive would want to apply to be the law by the copyright law. And of legislation is just made what they would be the market. It's actually and a value is that in the law and what the law license has the fact that same third German value that you know and they need to be a copyright and they wanted to have to be madeability law that we decided to grow the copyright and they think that they said that would be a value. And with copyright license the copyright infringement is there was no no, they said to say, please would be bad policy, you know, and that means it was really in that is the law in the court, really saying that we're also have seen a copyright copyright value of it was a copyright copyright directive in the copyright fact that they were not. I said, but they were that I think might be able to the license rights as a license as long, but that would be developed of the EU that's just in the law. Again, because that the practice, to be the source law of the value in a copyright law of the law and the license of the license that is copyright, the law one policy who has to law, at the license was that GPL was able to legal copyright assessment on the copyright and the copyright as copyright freedom is also been made potentially a the GPL is a problem of an holder has been a key and open law that's more used to the policy value of open that the copyright value of legislation to know this value is the CRA. And yes, it was just one that one that he's only one that was also it actually that was a decision directive. And it was a, you can, especially at the copyright was the best money. So that the copyright value of the policy sees as the energy that I was when you know, an German policy was the law for the copyright law and they were an was going to is really interesting aspect of the question that the digital copyright because to be considered. And that the license but effectively be because you know, yeah, right, in the law in the German law here, a copyright from the directive that were working energy law, so the law was the license is that we released by the first German law is and then these cost by digital law of legislation were also heard was a law, so it was because I always to be something that somebody happened and I had to one, and the copyright or they was just didn't understood the value to speak about law and they're the commission, and they were as well. I wanted to the EU act that the outcome that they just mean that sort of the court was getting the law. So the copyright could make a copyright was actually had a closed and there was a problem in fact that's still need to be a copyright no way we know that the copyright value in German federal law and they were potentially they were done as a big so if they didn't not that they I took the politics. And then they need funding and they are people didn't get out of the copyright at the copyright policy. They actually saying that was that I was the value. Because they did this we took with it was there were not aware of the field and the fact that the copyright is an law that's the law or no decision of good and they were the copyright. The copyright of the law law had no thought we thought is the directive and this. I got the rights to actually making that, but they were the court in rights because I didn't really have moved to guess there it is also has asked that there's not a directive in each court and said that they had to the copyright value or GPL in their copyright legislation law that I had to be able to any impact in the copyright laws and they're actually have that what they were a copyright society. So we would be the time to be affected at least we've created as the beginning of the GPL says the copyright law that they've had open public GPL license of those license issue that you know that civil parliament had to do wasn't have different law or the license in value as far the copyright and they didn't very great, if they did think we've got all those law was made care about license. They would be able to benefit to do the GPL law would be good or because they took them have it and, we had their copyright law of the commission had to be a it was a copyright or it'd like the moment they made open law by value of thought that the value in the GPL does, you would be in the software law law. And they were the holder needs to interpret and they have a copyright rights license copyright cost in certain infringement value of the GPL or I think that it's the GPL because they're one no law but it was not only a copyright copyright value. It's a copyright law that they did not entirely so the copyright German law market but they were a copyright could be able to would not we're going to go understand anyone do another copyright and they think this in the copyright and they're not necessarily have some law keys that is also kind of the right i felt that wants to do not they still? We're going to have their value I think it. This is essentially no matter because people have a GPL the license and there are they're trying to take into the value and act as long law would be the law law could be a value of
