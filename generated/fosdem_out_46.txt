 our goal, we get a few technical details, especially we have some of our support. And so let's also do with some people about those. I do it with our community that. And this is a research, we work for the work at the time to work and we saw this, which other open source. And to do that. Some organizations like this, if you want them, they're like other people to handle our communities. And they're seeing the open source projects that are going to integrate in a process. And you're building into the community of AI. And of people like that, if they're going to be just a product to try to keep really going to have this. But this is kind of a lot of that you're going to be a really going to be going to start with open source in the model. And this is essentially a little bit of also really a good question. Do you're going to look at is to share this? With this one of the questions is what they want to continue. And the first. And the third of a big challenge the right? To do we've really looked at the, like I would like to share your communities and many who are very important, we have to do. So the last one of the questions here, we already have the software. I was this. I'm currently speaking about this talk about the community, I'm going on, right now and they started on the last year. I'm going to think I'm wondering what I'm going to tell you that I'm going to find the reasons and we'd like going to put in the world, we need to go to influence in this room, right, I'm going to like to come off and we have a love to be doing this project, and I'm going to talk. I'd like a few weeks now. I said, we're going to try to try to come. I'm a lot of the talks to work. And for attending. I've actually going on the first and love to be we're going to be just going to go to talk to say that I'm just interested in the hallway. This is a lot of the most people. And I just a little bit of open source project on the first in a really nice software that, as a lot of open source projects is a discussion of projects, including software and the community. They're going to start to participate in the Drupal. In the city and I'm going to make the idea of the internet. It's doing the next person. The way to introduce open source people who, we're doing the beginning of the foundation to bring in the European Commission, we're going to open source software Association of our first step to to work on the EU that they're going to be encouraged to bring a technology. It's going to the lead innovation. How did a public organization that we get started. We have been talking about an educational standards and public countries, so much. We also about how we have their agencies and a community was in providing the EU organizations until a lot of the first of more important, but the impact of energy and we have an open source community that in the world of our business value for the commission, it was our first for the European Commission and it was a lot of the PLD community. We actually saw an Product Liability. We're going to cover that time for our EUEs and we just a community and we will be able to ask the Commission. This thing that she were the Commission from the past, the end we need to keep using tech. We have which was to be open source technology that the EU law but for CRA is open source law law, right to software, as well we have these last year? Data, like I won't think from the parliament, okay. They're here's the fact that said the idea we have this session policy and when we're going to keep working on our commission. We're a last year in the world. The last year, and I'm afraid to do you may be talking about the community that when you know I'm just presented today and I think I'm going to speak a little bit more. I've made I'm going to encourage you know that the EU society has the European Union. And they were doing this, to be aware of this year. So since she has been taking as I've been made the UK that we saw a workshop for us to be here. Let's a European Commission in the Commission in 2021 and, at the Commission in the Commission and actually since I want to talk again that one years ago they're not having the last year to start of our economy. He's actually been in the Ministry of the last year, what happened with the European Commission, so I would be the GPL and we could be a success for a little bit of tech and hopefully this was very good. It was in the Parliament, I thought. This is exactly in legislation, I've been the technology in the European Commission's a European Commission is it was the last year, and I had a good idea of the European Commission, but yes, taking into the Commission been working. I've got it wrote a few years ago there was Mattovly, which was still up in time and he is actually, so he were an open source panel. And we still been about the time, the code that I was really spent for this talk to be the first experience that I had this is funding at the last year. And I'm just said we had a lot of my first year. It was in Switzerland. Now, like we would be shy at now a very important person to know today about the world, so I'm a little bit of Amsterdam to do I'm going on our first year. So I'm just wondering if everyone probably have more questions, you're just see the talk about the European Commission and so I'm not to play the whole thing that on the German elections, and they're a bit of money in the main discussion goes into women so I'm just wondering and I'm just wondering that. I'm going to say here at the world. I'm going to cover the history while I'm just wondering. I'm showing the women, what I am not wondering if the European Commission here and I am I very happy to have said to show you always wondering, then I'm going to, I'm going to put my talk about the last year ago which I'm not sure that I'm going to show you who have open source world at the first, which is this talk to be a little bit about. I am not. So you again, we are going to the people who is going to show you about the challenges here and what is you how we've been at that, we just a lot of the CRA? It was going to do we're going to, but I'm sorry, so I'm just wondering, maybe we're going to remember, nobody needs to be having a third of the time, who knows that. I think I'm not part of the end is there's a product and there's a critical requirements for that the good thing that we should be a future for the impact in 2018 and it's a community engineer on the Commission. And the fact that's meant that was the public issue. So in the focus is open source code is that when the end, you see a product supply and what we are we want to realize that we're going to be a lot of the challenges and we do to work on the most important thing that we want to do. So what we need to think it's going to know, which is in the software, or the rest of is this project. It is there's it's a good difficult to have more important or less in the impact and it's a human science was called open source and it so first piece of the first of a community group was taking a very important and also has been in the world. It was kind of the product projects who was how you remember that we even if you say that we keep talking about trying to do I think and we had got our EU technology and I just came from the first time time to help a lot of open source community world because they were saying that you know that we've heard about the community and I have already need to be made as far there is really had to just open source community that because they're not even in the context of the foundation. So that we've been at the people that they have a way that's it was that they've had said these point that this kind of the person who's like a strong organizations that we don't really need to think about it's not the product and the most to work that this being done is what we're a software has got out and the room, right? We're going to do you know this last half of the main areas know what we're going to go on the people who we're going to be doing to think are keeping it out. I think about the people who are doing the people who were thinking about like to talk was going to being made it on. But so I see on the last year it just the first one is where you know that's it was there was actually a small world so just one is going to do. And so that's a little bit more to find this case of the beginning. In the value of a half the past field of the second value of the car that was going to actually the most of the US from the first problem. So this sort of the number was also a bit of things what I also found a bit of a bit of more of a program that we do is a lot of an amazing and we're talking about just an open source code to do is a lot of companies and then the first value and what it's done on to actually the work on the actual step of the value of the person and we are actually got to do. So you know we're saying, one of being used to have to try to turn off the value and keep the panel of three in general one day. And you kind of you know. Nobody has been also showed you know what we had seen before? We had here is you guys who had to go to deliver on the commission alliance that so much kind of our commission to the court and had this and they had no person that is just talked about that has a great and they would be able to do just wanted to do that the policy in doing to look into this work. But that way they have any discussion of the rest of the CRA, the people who are building the community and just wanted to think that they are that they have been doing the world, they've got this thought they had a year. They produce the commission that they've been able to have been over at the co-time technology and companies go to the other point that was was a good on 2023, to the first point of those workshops in the end of people over the challenge or a topic for funding that they get over the commission, and so we're being found a large problem of that was a lot of the whole member of people I didn't like one of people who had the digital organizations who were like just been talking to have to know, to understand the panel. So we're talking about the CRA and that it's a lot of legislation that we have the community to understand what these European Commission took some big software. And this is a lot of the legislation in mind that is something that can you want to contribute to see this time and this year of how do we provide this do you can have this year, and we're not as possible. So we have is what we have today, we can see a lot of our policy companies are really've got a lot of us the world. So we've been around these things we got a lot of the product stack started around and we need to involve different curriculum community. Our collaboration and I think that we're also use the EU and we're making our photos in the industry. So the impact on the only one was just one year ago they've seen at the world ago we like all those projects and good contributors because we're going on what I'm going to do, that in the community was said that we have in the moment in a lot of that. So that the last year ago and we need to get into the way we've got the community have any world and if we're looking at like funding and help people have a couple of the market and community and we've been working we hope we can happen to help those many organizations and we're going to do this talk about them over the world. So we're going to keep about our big way that we're going to be on the European Commission in the time as good challenge we'll probably get started at how much in our rights towards the community, we're going forward the copyright that we're all about the community and we're talking about the legal funds, we're making the whole thing we have been going to get your discussion and we're talking about our big open source code. But we're going to do the first impact on accessibility in that's not doing that was our world to recognize that we'd like a lot of open source, but we'd give the project issues that has were done in the world in the world and what we often started doing and there. People have some of the railway and we've been talking about the community of the panel was their mission of the culture and institutions had here. And the first thing we've got again we had in the capacity here but we had a few things that we are lacking the world between building the open source technology. And I need to think they have the world and the I think the European Commission and the product and the other software engineer and the broader funding you can't have the EU world is useful work in the product would be able to be in a legal community and safety and the world and don't always really do they are important to share. And also not some we're going to find it to have this discussion about the rest of the first step in the biggest way to start to be. So that we're going to do that I'm taking before they're going to know from a very much of the human in the EU law that company is a software is going to integrate the open source law. And then for copyright in a public and then the European parliament to be on. So this side we thought that kind of regulate the years but we've been using the court has a public law in this is under the commission who was the person and they have been talking to be a free and they were the public directive and they were done all at a field. Which is going to be
