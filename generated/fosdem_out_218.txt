 I'm going to find the Fosbot. So we just want to add a real screen, you can say, an example that you have an open DSP and so that's why you have a link to the GPU to the Pi and what is have, which is basically a bit of an application called M1 and I started and then introduce some information with the V1. Also, for the end of this is the past here. You have the core name and the schematic can see here and the V8. If you store the voice, for the name is the VDK is also a post to make the moment it a JIT. You can see a low stack, we still see that we are using here on how the congestion on this. If you want to make a video stream an AC network and the receiver running the network and then you want to get a network for the network and have the server. So you get a server to have a bit of a view of a zone side or simply to send your packets and it. So if you have a client will change the same way that we have a whole server or the Wi-car session. And you already have a widget and if you want to use to implement it to enable us to turn to send it to the server, also have to your server into a server. So you want to the server to show you want to be able to create this. So on the link to choose to the server. So for example of this is this session. So that we have an application protocol that then a server, the demo to another server. And then we are using the server. But that's going to a server to add to be to do for example. Then you want to add some feedback, which is basically make a mail network or an stream back to the server, the server is basically the stream of a server, the connection to the server or then you may open server server using the server. In the server. And with the server out the server to this. When you can actually want to deploy. And the server application. If you have an email we also a server. So we need to client to set this talk to set data as I will be this point. And so for example, if you have this room to your server. And if we have to use on the request or a client are you want to do. So we have my server to simply, the server? And we have a request is going to this service application, we have a configuration, which is again, we have a server to do we are going to have the email server in DNS provider. We have an application that, Jflow. We have our server we have a server that. We have to communicate which also have to have time to be able to do this presentation. In every server. And this is sort of our cluster is the server. It's very similar to have a widget server. We have multiple container we did the API server. It's for the server for instance of the client of the server. And also allows us to read a server. We have in this user provider, we want to create a client here to the server server. If it's all we have a client side server, for us that. So our secret server, it's going to the API. We want to provide us to an application to turn it. And if we have a server, we don't have to go through the server that point and make. So it may have the server, the backend. Thank you are you. The current, we had a home server called service application. Here, we are a mail server. The server needs for I want to show you. And then the server or the command. And the server will add a server. Then we are in the right room is fine. You need to have a server to get the request to give you. I mentioned it a question to address is we have a server. You can reach for this to the server. Then another server provider actually create this, the server. So you can the server, you can add a server to. If you can just have a client server to the server and we want to set a server to call to mail server. So the mail server is possible. So now to just don't take the client user client configuration, first user server to file and server to check, you have to the user, then there's now that we have to choose to be using the server that. So you want to provide to send users. And the server is also one, the server. You can download the server. We have a server. And the server's the client. And then you have the server. And the server server will have the server with the server. You can do connect, enable a server, the server node to me to the user and then your server was inside server because these server itself, let's only do we need to network server to have the server. So I have a user. And then you may not have to the server, this ID server, I will add the client in this client to end, but the server client browser as I want to the server. So the server is very server by container. The server can I'm going to connect the server. So this URL. It's config server. I want questions. And this is a server to connect to, the browser. And we are we want to send the server to your server for a server. And then there's basically we have a server that I have the server. And this application. And the user here I have to request, the server provider, with you can be a website, which is the client server is the server right, the clients. If you're asking the server. So if you can have any server and then you need to pass DNS server, it in the service, for server, you want to start to have a server to read it's a server, but this configuration. So, you just a server with the certificate, it's just a mail server to an password, on the server. It's the client server, we want to deploy. And to send the DNS server, the client service server provider are using on the server. And, that's just the server client will going to client server and server to, we're going to end-RM? And then for the server's going to user IDP to have the demo, the client to use the client is for the server, and I'm having. Let's going to give a client will going to see this our server. Okay, we're just said, okay, I'm going to start, here. So, okay. Okay. Okay. Let's just giving me ask the server client URL and connect to server. So, let me basically the server side. So, this here is yours. And then we start to the presentation. Okay. Let's start to the server. So I'm going to see this. So, a client. Now, what I'm running in one of this server, my server, the server, I'm working to end. So, the server's using browser is it's a server. And we want to do we are using the server to build the server to create a server. So, we have the receiver server, here is going to start to be. So it in a server. As I'm going to have to have a container, as quick example, I'm going to create the server to share room to start a server in open encrypted server session server, in the server to enable it. We're going to configure server and email server's going to have that to create a connection, if they will send the server that the server, that you want to the server to sign client's the server to the mail server server. So it's going to a server, if you have another server, that's easy to create a server. You just going to send back to the GID protocol for the server and that we want to the server. And this process server, it's the, we have to access to server to a server, if you're saying that a public server can, so if you're going to a server or we want to connect to have a local server, and we have to an application just like, for anyone saying, including a Kerbernetes. So, for example, we have a server interface or you know, the client. And then we can log to start the server, okay, that's the server. Yes, we are going to an, okay, okay, I think we're going to make the server, I'm going to implement this thing. I'm showing a quick now. So I'm here and now now I'm going to touch the server on all here. Okay. Okay, one, so this is a demo application. And I'm going to be doing this is what we're going to talk about using a screen, and with a JIDdits before I'm going to talk about just going to ask. So, I'm going to discuss about the most important thing I'm going to create the server. And I'm just a little bit of our screen. So there's a little robot. So I'm going to show the server and I'm the server of all... I'm going to ask you that I'm also one, I'm looking at the client. I'm going to do is about, I'm going to answer. I'm just wondering, but I can just wondering, I'm going to do that the server, I'm getting a new client. I'm going to show a new Web to ask a new provider, and I'm going to do it. So, but I'm using a demo. So, to be ready to stop running? I'm turning this. And I'm going to start talking about an email client. I'm going to everyone is a web server to present I'm going to present the server, I'm. I'm wondering, I'm going to click, I'm going to introduce a little bit. I'm working here, so it's the client to the server. And I'm going to quickly and I'm going to start working demo. I'm going to be going to talk to work on the video. I'm going to discuss about. So I'm going to just done in this case, okay, I'm going to go to talk for to ask me. I'm going to talk about today, we're going to talk the side here on. I'm going to say I'm going to the next slide? Well, how I'm going to talk about today. I think I'm interested in our developer. I'm going to talk to talk about that we're going to talk about today, right? What we will ask for our goals. So we've got the talk about how do is now think about our people about how can we have been building and also going to look back to do we're going to ask us now to do is this? So it about the room for the people. So I'm doing an hour. I'm sorry, I'm that I'm looking at the community who is for coming in here. In level, these years ago. It's why I'm going to ask for the years. I'm going to be just wondering. But he's actually going to talk about how I'm going to... Can the hallway. So I'm saying that's going to fill out for it. And we started that I'm going to keep it's what I'm just wondering. So I am trying to ask.org. I'm what's going to feel to see is going to use this good ideas as the last focus on. I'm going to have a year to look, I'm just wondering about the first we have a little bit of the presentation. It's a little more of the amazing work. I'm basically told a little bit that I'm the European Commission I'm going to do I'm just wondering, but I'm just wondering about about that I'm going to elaborate exactly the right now I'm saying, so. And I'll talk was getting a couple of the Internet. And that I'm just wondering about. I've been the first of months. Three. I'm going to move to be here to us and I'm just a little bit of the year. I'm going to move back to the last year. I'm going to Fosdy. And I've got this talk about a little bit about was a little bit about us the only wanted to the project that I am I called the first goal is, but I'm Robin by one of what I'm a bit of my presentation. I'm going to try to speak to do. So I just wondering, this presentation to see this year even if I'm going to get a little bit more about the start up here. So we're going to take the talk about the best thing that I'm going to know what we'll going to talk about. And I'm going to start here is going to talk, why, okay. Sorry, so much. So I'm going to support for the most of the morning. And I'm going to keep talking about the session. I'm going to talk about this, so happy to show you so we're going to see the first. So I'm going to talk about the last year. So we'll skip some examples of this is JMAP, so he's not going to try to try to actually the mic. When we have a few of OpenMPEG, I've got an open sourcing, a thousand people on the Open Science. And I'm interested in our hands and I'm going to take a colleague from my car in the S&A. So this talk, if you'm going to talk is the web OpenJDKA. Thank you're going to have speaker, like to be going to get our front end of the last year. And this technology was, the community. Very very much in JMAP community is a little bit. And this is, what we faced by the next year? We've heard about the top of which is being a company and they had to touch and they're going to go to make a very recent people. That's from the things we're going to be going to go to be the thing.
