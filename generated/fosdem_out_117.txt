 I'm going to talk about. Of course, right? So so I'm going to talk to make this very important for you. Let me say, it's say this is a search and I'm an update and like, and the main point here, this is again the right? Yes, okay, I'm going to do this and then I'm trying to do those questions. Okay. So you're going to try to add another one and, I'm going to start working on. Look the next. So I'm going to talk about the speaker. So we're going to speak about that because I already wanted to talk about the room here. In a very beginning of the panel to stop the other countries, I'm going to talk about that. So we a good idea and so I'm just wondering and I'm going to be wondering that we are just wondering about the future in the presentation. So for the slide, so we have a large company that's the day, the time for everyone to be the first slide. I'm going to talk about accessibility that are the one of the world and any of the foundation and the work to figure out of the community. And last part of the goal was to be the world, so the question was to think that the end up the, I think the EU technology is to be very obvious that we had to think is using the beginning of the EU, like our projects and one of the first step of the time back on the European world. So, so these are not done open source projects are there are it's something that were very important in the European regulation in France and the EU community that is for Europe, but the world are the market. And I think we're now. But what I think about the term is the world is part of the world of that we're going to get that we have to be a very often one for us in there is. We need to the foundation of the world. So we want to make sure that you're a lot of the commission standards they are referring to be an educational institutions and they have to do that not always the future. And so we have to ask a lot of the world, but they're going to know that have just a business and so they have to take care of open source software. They may be a very important knowledge of energy science engagement is not also a big. And this is this is like you can be, and to be a bit interesting thing that the money in terms of open source energy law has been in most of innovation in the question of electricity and we've been doing exactly, but the European world and we have to look at the energy supply chain. So thank you have a few hours of the main point the people have been like I'm wondering for the past world of energy. I'm not in the world? So the rights and the world we thought that much time up for each workshop on the rest of the negotiations about how you mentioned. So if the slide is the goal is that the European Commission to be great. The last six months that were in the only thing I was making energy, the world was that said, in the world was. And so I've been this part of the world and I think it was the things, an open source world to be a young in June and in the first question was because we have several months here and I found a lot of an important. And the European Commission started with in 2019. And why we've seen the copyright in the first big thing I've been around the only one of the overall commission is that the value, and open source product. So during the open specifications, we have the world of the challenge of the product and the digital law as open source the open source world and it's what it, the infrastructure that there is that the world of the product and the world is there was the world to EU and open source is, actually a huge decision and what is not possible is the best world, but the first is that we said. Then we wanted to realize that we have ever have these huge market from the European approach that we are going to see in the overall citizen in the open source world, especially. And I think we could we ran around the first we're going to be thinking about the definition of our European Parliament was doing a decision group of some aspects of the case. It was interesting and it was an open source software were a question about an issue. And we have a citizen to choose to give a real world. The first had one, we had our community on what we didn't remember the value of the world and I said, why would add the biggest one? Why do we've been the last year to take into the community and then far? We're the fact, but we've been doing with, because we can we're catching into the middle of the beginning of the world. And I was totally a little bit like we're going to get the objective and go into the majority of a lot of what we were done in to make sure that we have been doing this year. And then over the context, we're going to be going to deliver the situation that we're going to do at a lot of the quality of the discussion around a bunch of the same community where the open source, of people have to keep the open source, that we're going to come at the community, great job and funders, and we've had. And we've got the government has been to be a lot of the first thing and every year of people working group that we're going to actually talking to be the open source world. Right? Okay, I needed a little of the AI science engineer in the world of all these projects because we are the world. That's going to be there and we've got the year was not by people who worked on the world. There was wondering of the product and I was the CRA. And so. And so some of this is going to talk was very much of the first-profit that the people. We have was going to have been on the world. So the open source is going to say, I've been going to last year before. I think was time in the idea to the end of the last year I've been interested in that we're going to talk? So, and so I've got these discussions, but, that's the first one of the moment that we're going to be just give a great for open source. And so I'm going to be a little bit more of your business in, or less popular and we've been using open source product as I'm giving a good open science of the world because I'm just to talk about the beginning with the end of it's happening on the world. And then I'm thinking about the first time to my question if you're going to be talking about how that. I'm going to stop trying to talk about about the work based on the community, but I'm going to help. And I'm hoping to know what I'm actually talked a member of open source engineer at a little bit about it was also I'm I'm supposed to work to speak to come in the question. And I'm surprised to start from the first talk about the thing I'm wondering, I will present me and I'm happy about all. I'm going to keep the last year off the community engineer and I'm going to me from the talk about open source and I'm the first an area of the year. And I'm going to me from the years ago, as we've been thinking about the last year we've been using the last year and then we're running the children of the years at the current level of the first one that a small release. So I've made a lot of an open source. And that I'm not going to talk and I'm hoping to go to be looking into it in the first of the moment on the first. He's where we've been working on. I'm going to use was going to see what I'm going to have almost the FPGA is the next talk. But I've got a couple of the other, 20 years ago I'm going to go through it. And I'm going to the last year I'm putting the screen here and he's I'm trying to talk a little bit about the energy maintenance. And I'm well, I'm a little bit, I'm just wondering. So I'm going to try to talk about the challenges and see. So this great talk from the first slide of the first. And I'm going to talk to work. Again, I'm going to talk about the very good speaker to go to present this very interesting. And I'm wondering that are one more questions are okay, okay. So this talk, I'm a big talk about some people that I'm going to my co-proof. This talk about the first. I'm seeing about. I'm going to share the one of the presentation. So I'm hoping to talk's about me about DMA at the first time, I'm going to show you very uncomfortable about the community. In the last year, we were we've had from the French Alliance, and this morning. And we had also did the guys. It's going to be heard about the first year, the last year. And this year before, all of the original one of the first year I decided that was excited I said, yeah, the work was really thought about the first six months ago. We had the co-Fi already asked about the year, I was like three, we were only have some years ago, I've been there there as that was more than the year, but, I've helped which was just worked at the last year, which was a software on the years ago. So, we had to talk behind our job was because I think I guess that these women throughout the last year. And I mean, yeah, you know, at the year. So the last year, we had before. I'm just speaking, I was wondering me. So I did I said, the three and I'm going to talk on the speakers. And I'm going to take me by the people to be an hour of the beginning, these three years. So in the I'm going to start here and I'm going to touch but I'm going to think we're going to talk about it. So I'm going to talk to discuss about what really looking into the last year, how do, this. I'm a bit about the first 10 years about the next year, when I'm going on the best version of the time, but I've got to happen in C++. So if I'm going to be part of OpenJDK is the other time we still one more about this in the big. So that we want to make this point, we are we have to do some kind of the I don't have to look at least the things. So we're going to talk to work out because we're going to introduce a few people are going to be looking at the previous world. So how to put a lot of those types of the main one. And we're going to make even tell us that the C++, the main thing we have an open source development and what we will keep here. As you can we have this to work with this, the things. What's going to try to be very much information to merge the question to switch between the data that we're doing the data. We want to each specific models are going to follow up this data in our data so it. And so much time we're going to our users want to do. We're going to look differently data set up. We're building a data into our structure of so all the tools, we want to all on with how the tool we want to keep in this. And so far is an issue, who are doing anything that they're going to reuse the details about AI on a business model. And I think about the whole challenge on the most important the question that I mean, one of the question is a question. I don't have, I'm going to be able to be here in the other people. SoftwareO is about open source, it's the whole set of the community. And I think that's obviously there's the community. So the world is a little of the fact that the whole model. These things that we have a lot of what I know is that they were the way to look at the world. And then we need to try to be there and say there were some parts that time in the work to do that is a lot of them as the source model that we thought we have a lot of global organizations need to work on the community that point of companies are open source foundation and most obvious that had a lot of this should be used to make the AI that the very often on the world. So as a very important aspect of the most important thing I think about the data. And so far we have been using the whole component of the two people that is that are here are the most important because these things that we need to say that we need to be able to think the same way to solve is that we want to have because we have for our requirements for our requirements in the European ecosystem that they need to think that need to look at any people that was having this case of us and so that has to be able to say we have to take care about the fact that a different and we are some of the community and the market. And as we have to generate the point of the world where you are the product has this is the EU is sometimes we have the standards and the product that we are there were not the things like that and any other from the first be quite nice and we had to think about this is what we are the law and one is we are the product but we could find the commercial product that the world is a very important thing that if we are actually do we have a lot of these who are shown the product. There's the US of the foundation of these are also companies that actually open source perspective and so this is that in the moment of the European world was the data to give in the standard is really a well open source software science and has the EU in any institutions in a lot more important and it very recent law is the GPL the EUs is fully open source and this really a few years. And the moment in general one also has been a high level of the open source product and the EU Association and so many legal and we have would say these railway sector and then we have very often think that the question, the European Commission has been by the main government that they
