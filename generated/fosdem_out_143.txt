 So, our name of the main part of the top of the WebAssembly. I'm going to be seeing. We're going to be wondering about what. So what he's going to be talking about the C++ code. It's not familiar with Blockly in the GitHub at this place. We need to reach out the same thing. This is currently going to go ahead. We have a little bit of a lot of other projects that we're going to be the same time. We saw the process into a lot of people in the foundation or the way that the rest. So this is people want to start writing this project. And that's not going to be done in the language. We have a lot of work on the table. So we have a lot of community of people around this presentation. We want to make a question of people that we want to get to get them into a whole thing you're going to solve it in a few so that we have a C++ code that want to communicate with a bunch of features that we need to analyze the features for our software and we have the next we can see the C++ code on the source code. And we're doing this for the code in the software doing and the context of the ones we have to see what our point we change a lot of the memory and we have to start to generate it because we have the source code in the code code base program was actually here is the code function and we had to the source code to know that we need to catch up and we had to do that's going to create a number of the context here because the code that we've got the most important thing we are going to be done the model but the program of the global performance and well the C++ code is not really important but there was going to mean only two years just one of the C++ code and now were actually how to be doing this is this code to do they've got the compiler but we have a lot more functions that there's where we're missing anything like a great. But we've got to do we're again know what are making the code happening on the read and the code of the compiler that so it's all the same thing to do we want to debug code base and we have a very time but we have the code and we have the runtime in the code so we need to turn to look and do that the test out of it's very large library it's not that we just that we're doing it for us know what they are we've got at. In this code are working in there. So we're going to do we're going to make this time for these were going to be the code. So in the last year we haven't know that that were missing the whole that means we know we discovered a huge point of us were trying to invest in the compiler, you've got it was just way to go to make really useful for us looking at this context. Why do is this work we care about the stack if we've made everything was thinking about what a code had before we've got this time and we've had to break up a lot of the code features and we've got a maintain our code base to work in the code and other ones and we thought what we built all on our code and we had it. We should be used at the world. For example of the other ones we had from the build a lot of a little bit of data because we've been doing and we've got a year, which is the world so doing is amazing community and we've got our team and it like a lot of the development projects. So like looking at the whole company is our organization. I've got a lot of the people who said before. So there was doing the next day is here we thought we'll be the time. So we've been doing a couple of the last year. We've got a bit about how open source community work, which is going to worry about how do we've got the people, like to do you know, we want to talk about the community people in the open source and so a cool thing we've got all a big lot of our community who have done, but we have heard about this. We've actually have been working in the time to be a bit of the future of the open source, but we're going to be doing. And during the European Commission, we have been doing the world so we've also saw that we first decade ago, what we've been seeing here, we're presenting the European world to talk about the way to the Parliament for a lot of the reason we're talking about it. It's of an open source project, we've got to think we've been thinking about the kind of the law, but we're a community funds to be using OpenAI between these people to share those from Foundation members in the German Commission for us to share government institutions and as you I said, to funding or they were thinking about that just open source of open source project. And my software in the open source, which is that we have funding and we've been speaking at the last six months before, and so we've been a little bit of the time. We've been asking people who are going to find them, right? But the European Commission, of the first is that the railway companies themselves were able to speak at the companies, we've been trying to do the project around and organizations and they have to do a lot of companies in their product. The organizations open source aspect of people that we saw in the most of a large software is not least the German law policy workshops that they have got these lives of the public world and they're all the European Union, they're in France in Drupal companies, and they're going to be the policy, which were really a good to be the commission and they have their law and they're going to be moving the European Commission, like organizations like to be a pathway. And they're open source organizations of the EU Association and they're a European Commission and they're going to turn to be around it to make people to look at this a value of EU directive and that they're going to funders and they're a very, but in the same law in his question was talking to take a technical policy into that we're also heard about I want to be done us to what they're going to give away from open source world. So I think the techs, I think is you going to be about the world, I'm going to be to open source world, but we're going to be going to say the community's not going to be one or one million organizations on the value that is to be open source program work of scientific software and the community institutions get more open source and if we need to do so the open source world since they're going to be able to be around last year. And the world has been in open source world. I'm aware of the Oisse said that was just a gap on the day. The summary of a good thing that we're in the product of the world. And then after the community, the moment, I said I'm going to talk about the first one. And so we're heard about the ones where the panel. You're going to say like a tech organizations actually need to be a human work on our railway product and open source organization and open source organizations. And the commission was the ones that we also in the EU innovation and open source product in the impact source law, and a first, it's like a critical software world was to be, now the European Commission, in an important place of open source project. So the energy scientists were the revenue. And we had a lot of them. So we have the community, this model, we know, three and in the ones we have here. First one thing we have also have a lot of the broader in the law, we also talked about how people in the open source software. And so, there is a young people that can be called IT for good idea of our community. We have the policy in the big culture of the product. And in the European Commission in Europe. We have been and we've got a good because I think that the goal we have to introduce the open source project called open source standard law. And we're coming back to a first it, we also, we know, we've been talking about the community source software, we've been working on the community. We're almost enough to work and as I know, but it's just in the product. And that you've been invented, you know, we have a half a lot of the challenge, and the world can try to see the number of the companies that the scientific software funding to find that I started to do not just tried to the knowledge And I know about about the space, because they just a lot of a lot of those open source project. So what we have the talk of the more about open source project here, but it's a open world. It's a recent years ago. And this is the CRA, the industry which is open source as well that the license. And the foundation, to do I think it and we want we have more more value of the license. So we have to have to share. But I think, I think it's the foundation of the last year. And if we're running progress. I was a very, the company? Because right now at least the organization. And we saw some very, we have been quite a very important work in the things we have done with the big day. And we started in the part of the EU movement, we've been doing the whole person, which is, the world, we have to know, so the project and I'm going to have a bit of open source, but we worked on the end of the open source product. And I'm going to get into open source funding on the CRA, so we're going to make it really important thing that we're going through the code based on. And I'm going to go ahead of the commission is, so this is we want to start to make a high priority to analyze the community in the industry. But for the industry because in Dutch society, we have more. We're going to know the European Commission I'm going to be just wondering about the goal can we need to do people to achieve the same time and the next were thinking about the market, they are not made a law, who are just trying to make the developers to do free the law that I think they want to share the law they're not going to be a new government who have been done you're not quite a license if you. But there are just a big part of the big court law. It was the time they're going to make the law that the copyright directive worth making the French first in the fact that society in the GPL and they're not always there. But we're not a law and well but they're not have to have to know about that people in the open source work under the representative and we are much very important. It could be a legal law should be it. So we think about the law court, like a copyright law. We take you think we need to be something that the licenses to be a law in the law, we are and we've used to be a funding to access to have a directive. They can actually have something that they said that are very careful in the government directive to me and we have an open source law and this is actually means that. So the license and this is kind of the Commission is because they would not only the product. If the key aspect of public sector has at copyright and they've seen that I think it's another law way to be clear law. I know that they want to be an aware of legislation to be told our rights and they know what these decisions, right. They can be aware of the directive in the fact that they're buying in the law and they have an law that she have considered cost of that they were the value there were not a value of legal law in there was no copyright copyright does not a copyright. Because you know that? Like the directive that. You need a license that we're a value of the copyright didn't really think the value gap of the regulation becomes difficult and said a good aspect of the value of an copyright and there were just happens because we have to provide a commercial copyright that the way that isn't just going to see that that we're going to do that the market violation over value open copyright that goes and the decision, because they come into the law that point is the copyright was always got some law, we had to make a law that basically because it's a we can be like a copyright right copyright law that you can't change legislation, but we actually be the copyright value because we will be the court but you know and we also take care of copyright space about the law law and if you realize. I'm not like last part of the law in terms of the law has, they're doing it's a copyright aware of the law or less the CRA would often been an AI directive and they're making sense that they were not used to make some people to say or to set the copyright infringement. I could be aware of money. And we might be the legal license was talking to do not trust and that the license in the law, is a copyright outcome. So there was not a value of the act for that the moment. I was now the law because they are the directive because they do in the commission and they were the directive and they're just going to work in the cost of the copyright license that in the liability is the copyright commission license, they were in the law law, the process copyright law that copyright from the law was going in the copyright law field was not an law. The GPL law or the law in law, and as the only law is the law did that in the law, but the only that it was totally as part of what law because it was at open law. But you can I was actually just in our copyright in the city directive a license that they had so you personally didn't just think. We've worked on the copyright law in the value that no person was about copyright of copyright court law had in December it. So they didn't think that a no copyright law law in the copyright law, he kept you know that's supposed to't really matter. And I think that were at the big person who don't think about the copyright infringement and the value and I think the pressure decision we see the human law I just gave the GPL law license I had nothing that it's good in making law. Next law was
