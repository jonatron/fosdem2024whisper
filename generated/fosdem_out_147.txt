 Hello everyone, very first? Well, everybody. And if you want to ask me your main chance for four years. And the first thing I found. If you do you want to use the build the print. And then you read the table. You have, for example, you to show you a simple register. In this case that is how the string on the index which is an expression of the object. So you may use the file. You have a string. You can use the error string. You have this database. You have a the code in the role to the class or any description. You can run this state of the prompt. You can use, just create the this in a variable. If you have a name of a number of four things that you have to, you can have the output and the first, the second is an array of pool and I'll be this. You can see that is the error list. You can allocate a type of what? This is associated with pattern that you can be happening here. You can see if you start putting the table. You can run here to go to that's just generate the number of two. Here you have this result with each other. Right, right? So, if you build more languages? In fact that here, you have to use the result, right now the code and you can see on. So I just write, I have a literal to add the read a way, you can choose the JavaScript file with a input, but you can see this here. The value of the line to select the table in that I have the result as much. It's an object prompt that I'm using the JavaScript so I'm going to read for instance and I'm going to see here. So the one has read. And so I have you can see here and more. I'm not sure I'm here, I'm going to see the name of the description, I'm authenticated, the list of the most important that I'm doing the scheduler is I'm going to handle this. So I'm going to show the variable. So I'm going to start out and the way. I'm going to look at that I'm going to read the idea of the namespaces. So these types, I'm going to be familiar with the table and so on? Let's the key, the table to the table and I'm going to see this is the response. I'm just wondering. Let's just wondering. For example, I'm going to write my, which is going to the same. I'm going to read this program number of the second part of my return and I'm doing this. Like, I'm not sure this is going to show you're going to look at the first one of the next time, it. So I'm the I'm going to see what I'm going to start with how does is going to do I'm going to present I'm going to do you in the left and I'm going to show you the moment. You can show you the session. You can go to look into this page to your server and I've been interested in this. I'm also for all of the right. I'm going to the user. I'm going to show you for this is a challenge. I've got a little bit of course, but I'm going to explain every time to the time to be happy to let's going to make sure this the right so I don't have a lot of this talk. We'll use it's see a few minutes to put the same time to step to go to look the server. And if you use. In this room here. And when you have an OpenID to do this is a question. And this is basically, a lot of how this, the client is actually work for our API, right? And as we're going to deployer, we're going to remove the idea of the server, specifically for example, we're going to make a question to be a path. How can be going to make this whole, what I'm going to talk to basically we're going to be writing a little bit of a technical issues. We'll going to start to go away before I'm going to ask about this first. And so I'm going to come out, and what I'm going to explain me to your presentation and I'm going to talk. Okay. And I used in time to try to add the next talk that I'm going to you'm going to start to present another talk about a bit loud. Okay, how I'm going to start working on here. CERN and we're going to start and to be coming to give you for that's a talk about the left to be interesting. I'm a lightning talk is I'm going to talk a talk about the session of the future in the world. It, of a way to talk about that talk about us to talk is that. So I'm going to about our next speaker. And I'll be talking about having a few people in this. And as a few talks, we'll keep working group of the details, we're looking at the right now have a couple of our friends, of other one. We're talking about it. Okay. And this case we've been going to the last year, really enjoyed the first talk at the last year, all today. I'm going to show he's a few years here, all these projects with what we're talking about what we're this in a bit about the company is open source project. And I'm the beginning and the end of the talk in our developer lead talk, we're in our first of the last year. And I started in open source community, we've seen about five years ago, but we're working in the world, it. And I know, I'm very first been doing this was here's that I'm a lot of a lot of women in the time and I'm probably at the people who's the end of projects that can't really an open source curriculum. Those were going to talk in our big companies have been doing for people who are done. How to be like I'm going to do we can we want to try to start these issues. So, we have, we've been talking about open source communities that, okay, we have our work yet. And the people can be talking about the first time and what we have is to have decided to do we have funding with Kododojo. So the next were doing. We did I've heard a focus on the people who have seen that we're like we have to do the best thing. And I'm going to share the community. But this is a lot of the one thing I already did is over okay? It's a community. And this year. I'm actually a good question of how can I think of the time to come from the challenges. We have the people? But I'm going to talk about the first, we have a very quickly talk from a lot of the world in the source projects are there's very happy to the same way in the world. So I'm going to do we have enough do have been thinking to talk and looking at the goal was going to start talking about the software. So we should I'm incredibly interesting thing. I'm not going to start, we're going to be wondering if I don't know from the future and we're going to speak. We're going to give a question, an end up to give that we're going to you an open source project and we're going to jump to get into the day. So to see you're going to come back to you a lot of the first time to know the future community is this is to do not a long. We're going to come on the point is just look at the project. And we're going to have to be open source code. We're going right now going to try to be hoping that community for me telling us to give me. And we're going to keep a lot more about. And this project and we're going to make this year, we're going to talk about this work with the first hour to talk about doing the technology. And it's going to look into the community world we actually kind of what we open source projects, we want to talk, like really tried to do. And we don't know the whole way to make... So we're looking at the world, and we've seen a lot of what is we have, we can we're going to do. So we kind of our software engineer. And I'm going to be able to talk about the first I'm going to to repeat the first of my life to get into Open source CMS projects to, we at our career. It's going to be a little bit more legal teams. And we're going to have to make the European Commission who we're going to be the world to do that, right? There's worth going to make my talk to be a lightning talk. We're going to talk about energy, but I'm going to try to explain the next speaker is enough for your open source person who are talking about our CNCF and how they're going to do you're going to improve that they're getting the Drupal Security Association, this? How we're talking about the DAGs a community? We're going to do you know, we want to give it? I'm going to talk about human in tech. And I mean, please give us that, this presentation, what you a way to actually the communities, this kind of a big need to be on one of work. And I'm going to do we're going to be, right? And I understand how we're happy to know what we're going to know, I'm just wondering, we can just going to do? The reason, these people who actually know, that they know why we'll find all of the person I'm a focus. So from the folks, from some organizations free world. We're going to keep the year. I'm going to put a bit of the world. I don't really care about. I was an open source community. I was thinking about today I've got from the projects. And I've been thinking about the time at the first couple of that I'm working on the last year ago, thank you'll ask that in last version of the very much so much work has been doing and I'll be here, in the last six years before, so we're moving into the project and he's, but I think that's got more people here something, more years ago, really the community that the whole that is not really actually in the project and I'm trying to have is my community. And I ended up a lot of the project. In that I've been the last line of the community, the point were, a very old tech, the industry under the company when he took the main goal was a good documentation that they've got a few months ago, but that they have had been using this and they're just kind of us about and they've had been wondering, they've got three months of people to encourage people today. And because the people in the people. And if you know about open source community, you're also want to emphasize that people who's like that. But I'm just started at the people were getting started using I'm trying to be going to talk about a bit of... It was thinking at their community, like with our project. And I think that's really make it's just in our community and I'm not going to look at the people that I'm going to do they'll say, and he's the projects, and you know that you know, but you're doing it was going to find people know, you the product they've got to have a community, I'm not about. I'm not going to be going to present on to remember the person who did everyone. That's going to be doing the beginning of the end of the most likely to be going to think that they're a few talks of people who would like open source code, they're going to do that you're going to say they're going to be hoping to have of that, and out this think about the new people who's the information. So kind of Code, the whole curriculum project is the maintenance. And that we have the community as well. And I mean, you know, just write source project when you know, you know, you know, you know, we are using the build a real-bombs that. But the project obviously, we have been just have worked on the vendors at the project. And the world that they're doing these things that come up to the start that they have been here to the world, because the company, you know, you know, we want to have a lot of the EU that to, but they use the community in the companies that the market because that was like, we had to think, we don't have to buy the community, but it. So they're I can probably know, it's important to they're looking at a lot of the community. And they did we'll go out of companies that was something that we had some what we have and we can do, we try to give the community to realize that, and then you see before. We don't be able to be going through the first one, this and yeah, but there is the ones that. Okay, right now, I might like, I'm talking about it in there's the fact that a company and well, you need to have to find out, and you can't need to be an expert out that you. I think about, this is this is like a good to encourage people can do that we're looking forward. This is. I don't really understood the beginning of these companies are moving the question about this gap that you know of people involved in the process, not actually that people have been working on, so many things like this? Yeah, the I think this talk is just spent a very quickly because and on the reason the time. And that the first thing that the people have is that we have a much before they have been affected the place in the community are developing law, because we found this product industry research and then the way of course had was kind of a problem, we have to make sure that there's more on the big tech technology in the organization who gets to see that we have a regulation and we just the commission, but it would like the end things that is that we have asked for a lot of the world and we just took us to get the product that the world
