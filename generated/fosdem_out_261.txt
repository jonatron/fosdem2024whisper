SPBP. And this is the good part is it OpenShift application, for now, but if you like SIPD to deploy OpenCL or Nambo or the OpenCLV, you can say, if you use a C++, it will get access to. Yeah, I was kind of the C++ does add more work into LibreARB, just run it in the C++, so you could add some Rust and C++ API with this into this, which is a very high level, which I had a few things I have also the DNX. I did it. And of course, we have a lot of things I can do that it, we would like to know, we have to add some questions, so I can't probably use this, so I gave us this is not been based on this kind of an operator as part, but we wanted to do our own version of an idiot that we wanted to show me a little bit of what we're going to be able to do with all working with CCSP that. We have the Hflow project. We have our goal of this toolkit in the SPDX and so it's basically a new library for the Java code. We have this issue that we also has this whole process of the open source. Sorry, is typically see a lot of the whole thing that our own API has been there are available, so it's also the tools if we're doing with the most of the technologies and the library that we've got the common project which is the Java code in a Janster project of the code for the different cases and so, we just there was to get different places and the new is there's mainly the CNC that we've released with C++ code analysis but the same Criput around the main one of the first have been around that we've been working on V1 and then we've been talking about the whole stack and we've seen our own container which is the Python functions that we just had to we started to ship a Java and the COSDEM by the Sox. And the FFTs between the OpenV, which is a Python C++ library. So it's kind of the idea of the most of the Python is if we don't have to provide some the native code that we didn't think we have to make it. It's not the compiler for the Python world. We have the code and we don't know, C++ code in the whole part the future. We have to our code. This is the code base is for this code. It's like CEG can be part of a work inside every GCC VLC projects that native Java will be used to our C++ code, so there's the future. And the compiler is there are one is some stuff that we are using. So the other library that's kind of the C++ code and we have only with C world and S8 but just using native. These are C++ and so the next, we are the most of the library and so we have the function library, we have a global library because we can be able to be using Rust code support for the actual compiler with our C++ code code that the native code, we can be a C++ code base and we have a step has a shared page which is probably kind of C++ code in C++ code stack in Python code which has to just one to do that, which is kind of this is not have some, you can be executed at the first thread state and C it's the Rust code. It's not actually difficult for native code code. So you can also know what we will be able to run CCC is we have a native code. So that it's a lot of all the Ruby code to compile code that was this context. So I think about the need to do we will be here. But we want to test code where the class which will need to implement API code at runtime. We need to provide support. And there are most common option. And we have this extension tools that we are going to open source code, there's something that the code, which is also more important in the C API, right? And we need to be able to have to build it will be used to create a bit different code that are here we know how to compare the C++ code will be able to the right now it would be used on the API, which is the code, or very frequently used in the way for the code base and they have this library that it's not only are not. So that we are all need to do you can do for the whole version that in this is the code, we want to do that we need to think it. Of course, we have this work with this, we need to look at that. But if you will be configured, you need to choose to say it to that case it will be handled and if you may not just work, so it's not be very important. So we have the first branch of the arguments. I said, I will not too much harder and would be like to start working because I think that is just some other things. We also in the question, with this is also point, and the question. And if I think it's the main component. But so you know how do have time, but if it's still available in the future for most important. I think we have a lot of the question. I mean we don't want to think this. So these are the two minutes. And so this is, we are here, really, maybe we are both the question was not something is that we have to express the other than the language than to the right now we can be able to look the implementation of the code base is good on is important I think the code. I mentioned, like the code because we have a bit about it's there are using sometimes there are the most important to understand what I think that I mean that is we are we need to have the big ones that we going to do is going to go back end up to be done by the most important for us. So I am I think what was, I'm going to know, we ask that I'm going to tell me to have some kind of some people today and I'm gonna be a tool to try to get to be talking about the security and why it's not always a lot of what. Now we do the last year for the last year. The big ones that I'm going to show the different things is going to look at a little bit of the big difference is that our infrastructure of the European product was one, and the idea of the first thing that am done. And so we still kind of the moment like it was it should know why we have the world. So the most of the impact was made the GPL itself did we have been taking a decision should be something like a long bit more about trying to do not. But in the end of being available as far as I just the software is about the source software and the source software as well. The software. I'm getting started this community of the software that we had like 20 years. So I would go off and I'm going to the last year ago and so I have like that I'm used to mention here to get a last year. So I was a bit of the next year after that, because I was not sure that the time we had a lot of it was just were released at our years ago. And the beginning when people tried to be involved by the history that of different years ago. And the beginning when there were like the people are companies. And we, the last year was both of the years ago. So especially it was about the first thing that 2018, although we want to do because they have been an open source community science in tech around the company was a year. And I decided the internet or they're having a couple of the time in the end of minutes, they'll explain to make a project itself in a lot of the work with the infrastructure for the world. So the GPL society is used for an open source software. And the licensee was released one and yeah, the people you can think that said, they are good group. And that, which is also said, we are in the CRA in November 2014, we had here in France that I was in the German market, 1, the EU. And we had to run in France, what you had the last year for each year was that was done a year ago because I think since 2021 is also 20 years ago, I started in the original law in the EU, I made in terms of the last year ago, thank you to be here. My year ago and we were looking at the end working here the EU we were about that they are developing all of collaboration in software and so the CRA, honestly and this year. And we have this from the way, and they are there were just that you to think in the civil society that they were out of the European Commission at least three times and and we had to look just wanted to break to tell you in that they had a day. And so that we have been using this. We are also had at least for us about Blockly a directive as a huge term of you to go back on what we had this year of the last year, the market, which was I was going to get done for the last year. And that was really happened to be a huge value of a little bit useful to 10 years ago, but we had the Commission on the EU policy didn't think this point and I mean that. So that was an, we can we didn't remember it was going to have done by going to start the digital rights money to actually had a few months ago. It was the EU economy would like that we're at least the world. And he was kind of the definition of happened so far at the software to the moment, well because they weren't they were able to work for the railway customers were a digital sovereignty, they did not copyright law agencies that was something to be that they were not just asked for us to the law. And they found out the law. I think that so we have been doing the law directive in a law so and they're a law policy value of a law,000 and they were not to politicians against copyright infringement and a third year was an GPL was the open source law. I shouldn't, so even in the law, mostly were a copyright part of the law, six six years before that weren't really to it was wondering hey I didn't so we wanted to be the directive and the law, but we have not taking were discussing that the case of that I was in a public law or license, they did it's a positive value because they wanted to be done the copyright law even that you are always remember it was no law last years, but I think they were the copyright law for those law that was actually the key in the politicians to not just went into the law organizations, they didn't quite a copyright GPL law makers and this court law was the law becomes a value of civil court in copyright law was law is they were completely there was really copyright law that person, I've got a copyright was really has ever had one that the courts in terms of the GPL law that was nothing that last six law, they had the law. They can be used to not always be open GPL law and no copyright value of third license because you know, if you know that your law law and they had to think about copyright said that they had a product and they can only have some value of the GPL should be a value of legislation and they have any decision and they have any law, and they brought to be there was quite important because I also on civil licensee violates their market to the copyright value to had to. The copyright value that was all know what they said that then they have changed the court history in the copyright directive time they have asked so, I couldn't know that this value is the public value of that far nobody was very clear had no matter of the court law and I think the copyright was saying that is that they have put the law because they were like they were not so they had on the GPL can have had changed that I could the license nothing in law. I think it was the copyright licensee was being an GPL law to all of copyright was done it found in most German termination because that was not used in Europe was the person which could be the end people were even though she had always be in. The value, but it was the copyright law is the copyright is potentially the copyright is a copyright copyright, I decided to the law as a copyright law had the legislation in the value and they had to get paid as far as the law directive because I will just I was it could not the licensee law and the money for law and I think our law to have never gotten a copyright law for the law and a important when I did I was first one, it almost before I had I was to the law. I told me if license source but it were talking to what was already at because in the GPL law. So I said that for the third of 20 a number bit of a huge law. So I think that was a copyright was the first law of the GPL law to know the so the second law in a court law proposal to and that the GPL was. So there was called value. The he he wasn't found for the law in the law that he was from basically from civil law law law license was a copyright or only idea in the court policy license might the law was designed by the infringement. But, that we also the EU to do the EU directive but was the copyright law and so I mean GPL law and these law and these law's the copyright infringement was happening that they can be made a copyright directive in the GPL license value against copyright law or and that licensee's a directive and that decision and license law and even allowed to mandatory copyright law who wants to give it's the license. I think the licensee was a law that really the license if the value. Yeah people in this in their rights but there was here is no care about the market was like open German license to about legislation and the market and that could the law and they go to the value because they have the law was huge software companies and they asked they're people, and they have to be allowed that they don't care of the big laws that they know a copyright value actually public law because at the commission in the decision they have is GPL law, which clause of the CRA because they had clearly have to be a license to forecast and they're in legal licenses to make
