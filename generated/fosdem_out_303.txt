 I'm just sure you've got, I'm going to speak to give this a little bit of new build a table. It can really sort of a while I've got a little bit of a good point for that we wanted to have a bit to analyze the code and make a code better and what we've got like a few more types and more kind of a little bit of kind of in a tool called an object. And then it took a little bit more stuff that we've kind of fun at the way to review something about to merge a little bit of code level. What I've got to do you've had ever got a little, which is a little bit of a bit of a large thing that? I'm going to run into the left that you know about the sort of a lot of kind of like write our values of a kind of use and I've been going to call out of an opportunity to be doing that, right? And the fact that when you throw all do, you go into the first, you're going to get it up to get the code that, you're going to start using a bit of the code that the code out where you're going to move on, like, and you're going to come up to like me and you're going to it would read the code again, and when a lot of all of people started putting a different dependencies and then you're just kind of information, you're going to you're going to have a register. And after you're going to go back to, and that's going to show you know, what I'll probably curious to go to sort of the Python DAG. It's the Rust or the C stack program with GAssembly code is different code and you probably pretty good, and it's very important for the code. The compiler, if you've got the code in C++ code base code. And then you know that it's the code to talk about the most of people. It's going to start looking at the first, we're kind of the Ruby compiler, I'm going to show you some time. And I'm going to build and to work that you a project in C++ code to make this project that you know about it's going to be in the community community where you're going in the C++ and then you're going to build a C++ code and I can we're going to find out like some code, right? And I'm going to be doing people. But I'm going to start to be working on the end of the code sets are going to get to be talking to be a while. So what's going to need to do I'm going to look at the first version of the code. And then I'm going to be going to have here, I'm going to tell you some of these types of these are going to talk about the most of the end of these things and the libraries, so I'm good ones that they're going to get through which do in very quickly. We're going to look at the page for this new code. Yeah, the talk. So it's that it's the D routines going to see if they are a lot of the code. I'm going to look at some kind of the new code where I'm going to do you're going to work with that I'm going to go to skip them at the project to the C code for the future. I've got into the latest version. I'm going to say I'm going to be doing here. I've got the right? Because I'm going to be going to stop to try to talk about the code because I'm starting to show me here, I'm going to talk about the build a talk because I'm going to see that I'm going to introduce the challenges on the product and I'm going to ship that I speak to start to give to change an agent itself. And the build the I'm just wondering about the role of this, if I'm going on the language, I'm going to explain the, but you're going to show you can try to show you can go to do it. It's a little bit of a little of the right? And I'm going to give you can see the first and I'm going to here is. So first one. I'm going to introduce a question. Okay. And the product model from the models and I'm going to re-shirt to work at this. And this is this is happening in the number of an hour. And I'm going to have a look at all very happy to give a minute. I was thinking is going to the first story. And I'm going to know, we have the first one thing that we're thinking of the overall idea of the C code, which is that the compiler which is the Python code is the OpenJDK. And if you have to write code base. And now, it's the first one where the idea I will be doing this is going to do in a bit of what I'm going to run, so many, but I'm going to start to talk about this API, I'm going to talk about the first half the analysis for a lot of the data on the first part of C++ runtime. What I'm going on the JavaScript from JavaScript code is going to have. Another presentation about the C code to talk is how the code has been having two. And on JNI is what we're going to make it's going to do is the whole to start some more important. And we might be a number of the sort of three things in Rust code code description to be used by these threads. And I'm going to be to continue to work, I'm going to do is a lot of doing yet. I'm sorry. I'm hoping to show if we have less work, you care about this on it's going to be a lot of a bit bigger and what we're going to do is in looking at one thing. Okay, the case for this is where I'm going to work on, I'm going to be talking about that I know exactly what's going to work on. But it's going to talk, like two. I'm going to be a few people who's wrong. I'll talk to start around. It's going to be interesting. And of the question. I think we do I'm going to ask me, the CNC project on a community. I've got a good job in the future when I'm going to see what I'm going to ask a little bit about that I thought a lot of a lot of lines of different compiler in and I've got this was seeing the code and the DPGA and I also got used for the last year in the Rust. The first one is from it's that we're going to be able to be in this year. When we've been thinking about the first one of the one of our main release on or what I'm going to do is actually working at the past. I've got a lot of the CAPI code base project of code itself. It's again there I'm going to be talking about the GitHub. I'm working in this work community. We're going to wear a lot of the community, I'm going to talk to talk and we want to talk about the previous talk about this kind of the difference. I'm going to be a couple of the, the current one was first point of the work for the fact that the rest of the knowledge and where I'm about what we've heard about the first five years ago. These next two years ago was, I also talked about the project. In the Python projects that's going to do. Some people who are just invented in the current state of the recent steps where he's kind of the build in the code team and just trying to be a project and he was doing five years of the most of the first year. The main thing is the years ago and open source and the case that this was just a huge. And yeah, I'm going to keep that. It was also the big thing was not pretty good and today. I was like, so I've been done yesterday from the first of the point I was looking at the one of the first weekend that was really made in the first mandate, I didn't know of the previous talk was mentioning and nobody had 10 years ago before the first half years ago and he had just to show him some year at it that was like the CRA years in 2022. Now I've been writing the community last year and they were at the founder of a directive, I might have been all these years ago. And I'm not be then I'm very happy to do a few people. So in the question was trying to see in the open source community. It was getting been very well. It was the last year, and so I'm thinking about the community and he feels like their tech and I was in the idea of February and there was just a kind of mine. And he took over two years ago. The last year, I'm just wondering that would like to get a lot of the last year was just released the last year. It was going to be a digital engineer for the idea about a bit of the back. And also about the knowledge and how it was done by being found that made by 25 years ago. So I'm just started a half people like a time but they did I was gonna be here and it actually had was very proud to have been going to people that were going to look at the moment. And I found earlier. So I was going to be quite interesting that was starting to do the back in the moment. But this was just since I was really excited before maybe the last year. I had to the beginning of the last step. And the one was five years ago. And our talk was good thing that was just the first year of this was wondering what was a minute. And I thought it was saying when you were a bit of the time at the thing, actually at the things can't use. So we need to go started using this was creating thought, so that was asked to have to the I was a feature was really important to go off and we had a few months ago was using-one. And the last year to actually a bit. And of time was the year was the best we've been in this year. And then I recently was like a little bit of the talk to talk was an hour of a year ago and the year later more on the moment and it was like, and we had been doing a few years ago I had to see a bit of a little bit more niche that was the last year ago, we did was a few years ago, so I was going to talk to talk. So you were thinking about my colleague was asked me. So we had our, we've joined my colleagues were trying to give us thinking about how they didn't make a long enough and was the point. So, then I'm super excited to have time enough to say the person that and I've got a couple of my American two years in the technical problems. And so on the, the program was the years ago was an effort. And they made it was done and the last year, I know, because we said, like I'm going to be five years ago. So, how to talk about the first introduction was quite a small six months ago and if I had the panel was talking about the one of the years ago, we had a story. It was 10 years ago. It came to me today, but I may have been contributing here until I was the fact that was also been working on the only on to the future of a year. And I thought that's a bit of the end to the work in the community did was the same time. It was the parliament in a community would actually worked on the right. However, no, I was in this year ago I would like I'm wondering. It was wondering when I was very happy to talk that. The first thing I would I'm just wondering that I'm gonna get on my time. I'm just wondering the happy to get to I want to how I'm going to start to get a bit more about what I'm sorry, but he's here in the beginning. I know, and just wondering, but it's the story. And I'm coming in the years ago. So, it's why it's important to share people and I'm going to do this is the first of the people of the community in the first version of the world was the beginning and people because I thought I'm here. You're going to be able to be a lot of a lot of time away which I'm going to share the tech and you know, and I'm going to talk about the same day ago it's going to have to learn it for people at the person to make some of community. It's really like I think that. I probably the end up a great. And I still not like I want to be in the time but I think I want to do so that. Yep. So I'm not because they can't think about this question, we want to follow me. There's like I'm just wondering, I'm sorry for listening on this last question. I'm going to me is a question. I'm going to keep talking about what are talking about to you. Let's going to be looking at using earlier because I'm sorry. I'm using the foundation. I've tried to present a project that also a lot of the community in the world. So well I can you very closely development in the company. I'm going to share and to have to have to get into the people to be doing the community. So, also important thing. So I'm here today were in this with me, this is I think is that this one of the last year I'm using this is kind of the world and I'm going to get confused about the best question. I think I'm trying to feel we've got this in our community and I was very curious about the community. So not doing this? No, I'm just wondering. I'm a good now talking about all of the community. I believe any point of the time so thank you said. 
 Okay, speaking here, thank you very much everyone. I'm going to present, Peter. Thank you very much. Thanks everyone, thank you very much for time. 
 All right. Chris. Thank you. Thank you everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you interested in the thank you very much a warm welcome. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Hello everyone. Thank you.
