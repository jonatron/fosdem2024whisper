 Hello everyone for the first of the FambA. We have a different use to make a video network of a bit and it's a real protocol to provide a network. So I'm going to focus more about the flow in a few machines online database that I'm going to present the mobile you a lot of links for the real time. The question is is to me to have to the code, the data of this service in the data is developed by the data, and everything I wanted to keep here for, so the data to be done. This is not fully a table and just the data that in the question is the main one is a very important is that we have a bit of two ones and the most important part. So we have a second one of this is done in the data or the data list of the database is to save the data. We have to that you can provide a concrete in the database we have time in this case down the information that we say that you don't need to be a data that the model is still the data set that is a database and which is, and the first one is also useful to modify the data that the data in the data and is automatically that's also a high term. Now question is the question to the other kind of the more because it's an idea of an operational data, the rules are also being the data to use. And this is the data, the data that we have is used as far as a path, so to define is that we have a lot more an error. We are now we are getting the idea of data from the other groups of the data editor where we are responsible for us that what we are a different types of the data, we are in our data model. And we are there. So that I understand is our project group. And so that, we are here as we are thinking open are a few people that are also at the data generation two aspects, four is actually in the data. The data is there are collected on the center is also a lot of the data in reality that we is there are used for more packets as you need the data group of work. The second step is that is used by the fact that is called value of a common level of the state is a different data model is the power consumption of each data. So we have is going to query that we have. So the data. So it's a problem of the real data is you need to have a few different structure of the type of the data structures for the data and other parts in a table here. And when you can be available. There's with the grid perspective we have developed this kind of these three times in the data. So that they are three or we are going to see some point, the congestion so on open source to show that we're going to keep in some point and there we're going to have 100% of the data from the data to go into like it up to compute also are not a lot of the grid to be passed to three papers and second to the knowledge which matters that are interesting is what the power on the energy to realize if we just when the data is our data to grid that we are shared these in the satellite looks like the transformer is about energy data. And that the power model is the car driven and the data. And that we are interesting in the power in the data. So we have my result in the power as the grid and the energy is the world this is a low energy we have in addition to get the grid and we need to the power power. We have are all the power power act in the energy transport also aware we are safe in a long time to provide electricity into the power goes in many energy so we had to focus and we want to speed this is what is always used in discussion was very briefly talked about the solar grid. So this power power left to be at the real consumption. You have been very fast. This is about the second is our grid. So thank you're going to join, which is working together with energy law. Any of the power. Next, thank you everyone. We have had a small more energy science science in digital braking. So, we have great morning you up to have this year at the power energy, we wanted to talk about the good talking about the question we had about energy, which is the story about the energy energy power and energy because we are the energy and we need to for our energy consumption. So this is the first. We can you so we are having electricity level that we are talking to be here also in this is there are done in terms of the bandwidth to be a little bit larger challenges from energy energy power and in this time, and energy energy. We have time futures in energy power and the power consumption about energy energy energy or less energy energy energy electricity in collaboration we have time in energy power bandwidth in time. First energy and we have. We have to talk about energy energy, we are for us to energy energy energy to energy energy energy from energy meters of energy consumption. And in the solar. And if we first term life or energy level lead energy energy consumption, we are a power energy, if it. Thank we have much. 
 Hello for instance, because, the energy energy energy time stamp. He's just a energy energy. She was an energy and he was an to start. Good. I also a bit from I'm going to present the power energy energy energy now and I'm going to note that money and to be here, so welcome energy and I'm not going to be on the energy energy, time to the topic like you some time energy energy power energy. I also the grid movements and the world. I hadn't have any energy energy. My question. I have power power energy energy energy energy energy energy energy energy is here from energy. And I'm Daniel, I'm a energy energy work for, for energy world as you who are working time-spative energy, the city is, which also an energy the national energy public energy production energy power power in the energy bandwidth and the energy energy energy time work, I will give quite a power processing energy. Third to energy power energy energy. Okay, long to energy, thank you to about power and energy energy energy in energy making energy energy, thank you to energy, the energy energy energy energy energy energy and energy grid energy is and energy energy energy energy energy for energy. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, very much for energy energy power during data to energy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for more energy energy energy energy energy energy energy time. Thank you, everyone. Thank you ask energy energy grid energy profiling. Thank you. Thank we have energy. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, so much. Thank you. Thank we very much very much. Thank you for the workshop. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

 Okay, everyone. 
 Okay. Thank you, thank you very happy to introduce us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 Hi, so this also have this presentation we talk about Code. So, so much for the first speaker is a talk, how we are interested in the presentation. I'm coming here today. We are a bit of the talk at that is going to let's going to be talking about the microphone for being said if those last thank you are coming last talk we're so much for this year I'm happy to talk, thank you. So I'm going to be talking. So, thank you. So thank you all here this talk before we have a talk to talk to WebOSDEM meeting. I'm going to go to present me backends. Hello everyone everybody. I'm wondering what I'm excited from Karen and I'm here at Redama, I'm going to get all welcome for the talk today that we're going to this talk. You. I want to tell you on the talk about how I'm going to introduce you to be working on Firefox and thank you guys. I'm going to start to talk a long time to start a few months. So I'm hoping to see a little bit about the end or a screenshot to be doing it. I'm going to talk about the FOS. The history of an interesting thing about GAPI, I'm doing this talk to keep a couple of how you are we have a lot of years. You know is the left to make the rest of Go, open source project, but I think about it is more than to focus on. And if you know, right? So I was, if the developer engineer at the little bit of the world. I remember, it was doing it was a talk and you know, and that in a very long time to know, I work and I was so you know, I'm gonna set up to improve the people were working with the right? I'm working with that they were trying to it up at some of the community. So the Drupal SecurityC, we have a very happy to know that we had an open source of OpenJDKN for the OpenJDKOS community, at the projects. So I'm just wanted to be a lot of the first. And I do it was we know what we would like, maybe, I'm talking about the community to do in the community, there was trying to get a lot of our, hey, so that the first day was also the idea, but it was I was really, because I took the top of the same product that we had around, but it was in that we had to talk about the question. We had to work on the industry took a bunch of the world. And I think it seems like it since I was basically had no, you was the years ago because we had because we were I was actually use the people involved at it was a working on the first six months later on the data, the time we had to do something from the problem. But the question was in open source community was actually this open source community. And I was you know the foundation to know I had the moment at the first time that I used to assume that I was made 20 years ago and I was it was kind of us to have recently launched, of thought that I've had a really wanted to have done in the last year ago, because I was a long time for us here, the majority of the largest day that I'm a minute, but I was just going to be wondering later on open source community and we did I'm here until I'm going to talk about the open source, which was, and I was where the main slides were doing that was a lot of the people will get the people in the tech, all of the things we had to make a very often in the great work around. And I think I wanted to let was a, but also thought, as far
