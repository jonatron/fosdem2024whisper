 So we have a different application. So maybe you add multiple scripts that is a backend, but we can also use multiple ways to, and you can have your API that is very important. The goal is to use this. You can fetch from the AI, so you need to read the documentation on if you use for example. You can have a system, and make the AI is like the idea of the first one is the first one of the web-time. You can create your SQL database. You can see how the data, which is one. You create a static type of a set. You may say, I have two to that is an example of the code. So this is called a JavaScript. It's just a file and this is the application. You can use the first two VLC or three-based, and you can do this one. You can have the description to describe the Cys4 it so the JavaScript on the CIPI. So here we have the previous one is okay. You can see the Mambo is just see here in the beginning of the interface and see a bit of four, we have the middle of a lot of things that is based on the previous one of the same thing that we have time. In this is this is going to be used by any of the backend. The Python CERN runs into OpenAPI is a bit of the right because this is 4G. Here's not a row of the DMA is the DAG, the end is a lot of the state, and the open source is really important. And so that's the source code is very weird the WebAssembly code that we have is that the first Mambo are we have are now has four. So that we are the C++ code based on the end of the C++ code base package is really useful for the whole ecosystem and this thing here in the C++ code and we also was already know, we have a C++ code so that's how we have to look at the last half there was working with Rust code base here's a lot of the code we have to make a lot of the types of Rust code that we can be able to make a lot of Python code base, but we have a, which was kind of libraries in Python because it's part of, which is the code libraries that we don't have these code in Rust code. So we had very the code that we did have a new code called that into C addresses. We need to make code about and on the C++ code base code runtime, Mambo, which is it was used by the Java code. I won't have more code in C code but we have to continue and we need to be the Intel code in which we have a wrapper in C++ code for a lot of C code work on Rust code running C++ stack for Rust code. I think it before. And if it's not, you know, you don't know how the whole front end because you are, but you know, there's maybe some open source code compiler, right? I think that I think it's it's a project. I think are here you're going to think it's what I know, this was that you're the GCC was the GCC 4. So, I think about the GCC project I don't know what it's running, you know, just important point to worry about the C code is that I mean, let's we've seen some Ruby code and D code itself, the code work, I think. So it's say it's all those are running. I'm the code. And it's now we have in Ruby, have been using Ruby Ruby code, but I'm using this code in C code from GCC code, so we've got multiple code because, the Ruby to see there's the Ruby code went to Ruby Ruby 4 and I'm doing we've been doing it, but we have the code base. And with C compiler that we have is C, the C++ code base code in Python gem to do, so we've had a Ruby, so there's where we've got it, which looks like, the read of GCC could be, so we've been using Ruby is on. So I'm just have the Ruby code and then we're building Ruby code execution because we're trying to call C code to that with Ruby code to use cases. The Ruby code is a Ruby code point we have the code base. It's the C, we're using to be written in Ruby code and we're looking at the code and then do the Rust code. We have, right? We may be our Ruby code. So we're getting there's where we have any code code base stack can't doing it's all JavaScript code that Mambo runtime JavaScript, the JavaScript code. You just a Ruby Ruby code that's like we saw that C code. And we've just generate a look at the C code version, we've seen. So exactly what I'm sure that's happening is just going to show. So the stack just get the code base. I'm going to the code here and they're talking about Ruby code that's a code in the, you see the code base code, where you write to give you're going to look into Ruby Ruby code. I'll show that to write and be the whole level JavaScript code and this is trying to a, right now we're going to be doing. So it to do we're going to say. And I'll start a function base thing we're here. We've got time to see our code we're going to start talking to do we've got all the build Go. We have an Java Go routine in Rust. So here. And this. We're going to C code in the latest library are going to build a C classes, and C++ code, we're going to build blocks, it makes it's kind of C code. So we're trying to make this to show me kind of a very recent version of thing about something that we're going to do now. We're going to do about. We're going to be going to be able to a template. And we're doing the JavaScript code that Ruby code right? It's going to the compiler code might be used to get the version of JavaScript code-bombs. So the world's going to go and we'll get the JavaScript. So this a C++ code base. So we're going to be the C++ code here in D code and you have the code runtime for the future. And we want to be going to ship a project. And it's going to have a fork of the code that we're going to have to run XAssembly code base. And we're going to just to work. We have Rust code base, which is it's a function that we're going to go into Rust libraries, and be compiled it's going to really important to go to look at it's really weird. And the compiler's also there's a C++ code, if you've call this, right? And you're going to do. And we need to do, if you've got the GCC binary Java. And here. In Ruby, you're looking at the compiler code in GCC should be Rust can use JavaScript code, we've got Ruby Ruby Ruby code that's already want to it in Rust code base. So, we have one. I want to see the JMD compiler base Ruby interpreter. So, so the program, it's not something. But I'm going to, the compiler, well, the C++ implementation to be written. And I can we've been working on Rust, but you can run at that particular. And so, this is, the C++ and I think that D stack actually with Ruby program. That's one of pattern base, the Ruby and the Python and Ruby code, but I'm going to Python, has been just using code. But I'm going to live fine. It's going to put it's going to actually going to be going to wait, you can't have it in C code, you're going to... I need them, you. But there's on LIT. And I'm going to talk to be in C code on this is the, we're going to go on over a Ruby code base, we're going to our, we're going to be speaking about Ruby code base, which is there's the RMPEG, which is a CMDV. It's going to talk about the Ruby interpreter are actually built as C++ code. But the same thing that happened over Python is when a, I'm going to go to be going to show me here because it's going to say I'm going to wait for all, I'm going to see what I'm going on what it's going to make an online code so far that we're going to make here at a lot of the C++ code. So I'm going to be going to start a couple of you can get two years and I'm going to be doing this whole project. Okay, I'm going to give this code that I'm going to jump back to me an interesting thing that I'm going to like an old front. Yeah, that's going to do some details of the C++ code, right now, having to talk, and I'm going to get it, but I'm going to make this talk a very important thing to change it a compiler and it's going to do this is going to get to focus on A bit of the native code matching. To tell us a lot of the top of the C code. And I'm going to make it's going to be and quickly going to be happy to find the code in the most of the difference from the first Go, what is not going to change in a C++ code in on and I'm going to get back to note and get an online. So thank you said that's a lot of what I'm going to do I'm going to talk about this way to do you, next talk about all the C code that we're going to be done by using it. That's in Python code, I'm just know, we're going to be going to call this. So this code's going to be going to be the code on more space for the standard code and how the code would be time to be very quickly. And so it's going to be the way to be a thing with Java code. So that's where it's going to wait for the code base. It's going to be for the Ruby code base program is going to see what I would be a lot of this code and does is going to one of the code model and it does is going to be useful to be used in this, but it's not in the code. So I think that I'm of Rust code is all the code, Rust code is kind of the libraries, because we kind of need to know about it's the code description of code base. So what's a tool. You can we have to put this here with C compiler? So this is, I'm working on a project, to Ruby is the Rust compilation language. Pico. You might be pretty difficult for the C code. So the Rust and here, the C code for Rust are, is much more? And I'm going to make it's going to be going to take to spend about Ruby code up to add Rust. You can. You can start and you can see, I'm going to introduce a one to build code for us. You can see. You can find a code in that's going to write a block, you can see, that you some cases. It's just a bit of these in Python to match a program of the code array. So I'm going to see how I see how to take the number of the code pool has a number of global object a lot of Java code. You can probably here here. So every code here, I want to be something that API, the program. We have a couple of library. If you can be in the code is the implementation defined, if we can be careful about the end role and we're going to create the code that the code in the JavaScript. We also have going to be able to say it. And this is not only here. Don't in an easy for me. When it's going to go back to an event to think, you're going to do this. You have this is the code in this. And the code is not very important things, but just interesting. On this is that we have a sort of the whole point of the function. And this kind of the stack is very low code made because there's the code in the model of the same code in the actual code. So we don't have a whole function that we can have the code. So if the whole function is that's the function that's the right code stack. But that we know exactly the function kind of the first we have two kind of the number of the cases that we call for things. We're building code. We're just wanted to just going to do we can do with the function that. So the fact that's compiler are going to be really, if you're going to sort of the function to be the function that you know that kind of not doing a result into the code. So the code is not to point is, and not a result of the code. And that the function is that very powerful code is you know the state or something that those. It's why is the code. It's really, because you know how it's not going to happen. But the code is run code is going to be, the, we've got to do our code, we had some kind of these type is when a function. But if the kind of function is kind of the methods? You have privileges of brackets, you're going to be, to have, your code that this JavaScript code might be executed and you may be not find in terms of code or some point out there's a function. And when you don't get the structure it's in fact because this is a function. And you have the output of that's just put, you need to do that you're going to run. That's going to know, but if you're going to have a function, but the things that's really, they're going to really sort of analysis and they're really make out there out what I've ever need to actually there. Like it means, right? Like you have, you know, a string, but when you've got to do you may get the problem that you've got to
