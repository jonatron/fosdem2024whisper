 So how we have a user data from the client and then help us to deliver a container and then set up and it is getting more important to show you how you want to do it and this is a bit less difficult to do this with this, but you can just go and write a second place, you can expect it to this, as a list of things like that it's also a lot of things that you can go into this, like all these links and you can see how often you can get the data so the types of different types of the data point of what do I can we do this, I think about about them are in the data model which is actually for the data that the data which is going to use it's going to go into what are going to know that you can choose to map and then for the one basically the network. Now the data is where the data is going to be some of the data, an data means is what the data is the way you've been about of the world we've got a lot of events on that want. Now when you're doing an error user to create in the source prompt where you want to know where you're going to be what you can see what is stored in an argument that your code and what the data is going to do and if you need in that you know, you want to create the data and then you have, if you can call to do. So you see here, for example, as an object that, which also talk about that these two are a lot of a really important thing that in the data. This is that you don't have a small, I'm going to look like those are going to do is going back to show you to be able to create a few other models and the description of a class and then you that's what is going on the data and you get into the data into and you could be able to do and you've got from the only thing that you have, you who can see, the data from the data and then you know, and the data, but you see the data in a point. So you can see here's a database, the data. And if the data, you know, you are all these two years ago, now you're going to use, how much more how do we just need data, the data, your project, if you're going to make that's going to be so there's going to have to be a data in the data, to go to be looking at that your conflict, that they're going on social data points to start up with all these are going to the information. And so that's going to be part of the language, but it's just very important to do and finding a little bit, which is that you can be the data in this component. So this is a table, which is where the database would be in the data is really very interesting, though. You have a very slow. So, a very good story. So it means that's the standard part of the data model, you can see exactly the data will see that for the code and in order to turn that's also what the left. And then if you're using. And that is we have. So this is we're going to go on. So this open data, we need to be able to analyze, which can see that we need to set this, so the data can see, if you will open data science, as a little bit of data, it's usually. And in the first step is a data to take the data into data to read data, we're going to make a block, and the data. So we're going to have a model and so on each other parts, we're ready to be doing the data modeling. And so we have to look. So. It's a lot of the time that it's a lot of the table, so we're going to create data, when it's going to be a couple of users are going to be very fast, but we saw in our data, well, right, we will try to be involved in this example, we're to do this kind of those workshops, but we are moving on that. So like reading for example, but you know, I need to be able to go in a big talk about it. So I think, I'm in this is. And I think, I'm going to talk at the data. And I'm going to give from a little bit of this one first I will be talking about here. I'm gonna do I'm going to share data name an open source, if we'll be talking about the data. You can give us about the data and this time to go back and give this is going to the first step of the data. So come up to your data from, I'm going to the prompt and I'm going to say, not going to the session here. I started. So the most important thing I'm going to do this is that I'm going to talk about this morning, I'm going to talk about this kind of course, but today I'm going to present, so I'm going to my main part of a long time, and I'm the second parts of the data in the grid in the first things that I'm being able to be able to give you know it a lot of some of the real data. It's just a very quickly, how we are in the data. And I'm a bit more often, I'm going to do I'm going to talk about my next talk about DSPO-end. And I'm saying the talk about it's a little bit about what I'm saying I're going to the first year. And I'm going to talk. But I'm going to see in the most of our life cycle, I'm a lot of the CRA and we've got like that the European Union, the second decade. So I'm going to give me up a bit about the OTLP. And I'm going to start. There's going to worry about the panel, I'm going to do I'm going to be just looking at the full of the first. At the best thing I'm going to speak a time to talk about 40 million money, many years of the CRA and the European Commission, and policy was open source companies in the decision told us. And I said, I'm wondering if we started. But we've seen that I've been thinking about, I'm really had this year ago, I'm going to be a European Commission and I mean the time. And I'm going to share a huge one of the outcome of the world. I'm going to be so I'm a couple of the organizations and I've heard about the first of years ago. I was just wondering if he's going to put on the I've got the last year, just saying, the people who was I got exactly to take the data and I'm sorry. I was about wondering. I'm surprised about them, I was presenting and there now and a good question. And I think I can I realized that, I'm doing a real-time initiative was enthusiastic about three years ago. I had from the political field that I didn't see here, since the foundation that Mike was the law. Let's not just a bit. I thought I was just the court in FOSS. I had this has been quite a workshop? I don't know a way to be here and they were talking about the first topic with the commission in the year. And I did we took one of one that was wondering if we then I was being a workshop that was the first person around the company were thinking on and a strong place. And we had their own stories from the CEO of the first week. One of the years ago, I've got that I was going to say I wanted to do that was a lot in Europe and I was the US law. They were using the foundation companies and they were in person who were both even a well. It was just doing the law, we had a lot of these they have a risk of people in the license to ship on many years. Things of the internet and they were actually really intended to push and that the civil rights of the product and they were a long time when you could be able to be able to get one to find the two countries of tech sector. And they found a critical revenue we could then far time away from the commission that they were able to spend into the moment, when they hadn't have been there was actually't a wider law and they were so they want to take out of these photos of people were in and they were quite the thought that that happened and feel for the end was there's the way so that they don't only need, can't know the best big legal issue that we have to have to have to be clarified some time to be more people in the market and so that they would be enough as a good and they were open license, the world they need to open source world they were the regulation of the people who had someone who were going to be done to be used to be incredibly large court law and the law, but they were, although they were just made a clear and they would be the law that they'll be a software software or copyright, they could be the government so much and policy. That's the law in at the court time to the problem, they're going to have the product. And anyone that, I'm going to be a copyright. So I'm going on the court legislation about the situation. We're going to have seen about the law could be the principle of open source act this point for the copyright of a law of the standard law that they had to be the German law. But they were the law didn't have any copyright rights law and that you can be used, but no law to have got to only one of law industry in the law had this law that is to act as difficult and so you had in there would be the challenge software law has to be any law that that they don't exist in the law market and the law act on that is done and said, they will be a European directive of the bad copyright directive by the copyright and they did that's used to the license conditions, which was okay, because they heard about value in the GPL law law in their rights and the regulation that they have only thing they don't remember what they want to be kept the values in a copyright law license to actually about license money that as far don't want to use cost by copyright liability because they could be, you know it's probably the copyright law to go into is potentially by the political law and that the law was not GPL cost of the license has the law then in law and they're going to have they will be to be used in the rights license rights in the copyright market law that the product holder so it's important, to get there's still a law and maybe it's the law that they say the law law who thought you're not the policy and they're the law in the copyright law and they are just been all right decision and they think it's to be a copyright law and they have is aware of the copyright issue that's supposed to be on a law. And only of course has not related to have enough law has to get that money that are not too, but nobody had so that this was pretty interesting good things that I just is the money now it has a really worried about very big and they're like an injunction that you know it's the market and it's all the policy and the GPL and those licensee had to be the directive the organizations may be the value in this matters that it has to be an law. So everything is the law. And effectively in the decision term that I wouldn't want to the law, but, and it's a law license is the rights and the most of a license. Do you know the copyright law that don't know that the fact be a law. I look at the law has just came from the challenge from she mentioned before that the law, but of the way. And there were used in our value of the copyright or just wanted to be copyright law was done, and just one day. That was a law in civil rights law, I was that court law would be a reason I think that? But he's just a copyright law. I said, it was that the law, I would like at the license in the license. No, I mean, I is, the room, but he could be, is some was always been working on a law, but as well, can't there as a copyright market was a value of a law of copyright issue. Or, the commission, yeah, open end, I said, as far is something like the law, but, the court was like the directive? And in the question of the copyright model of the EU is actually has been a regulation and the law of the law agencies. And in the idea, of the court fact, and how nothing was that is that is a law is nothing, is that the value of law in the world. So the copyright value and should, decision said that they shouldn't know that they know, and they get the copyright law was in German infringement, they are known in copyright law did they had spent the copyright law, right. In the value, it stops the law, they can't use and then in the copyright because for, it also quite copyright law and the copyright people are the license copyright value of that the value I think it would know, but they're not be done and their directive and they don't have, they are to decide to be it out of. We have learned that you know if you know, you remember a company, you know, the copyright commission, we have the legislation and when we have got through energy law and then they have time the law or they know that she did need to be able to know, they thought that, is just a copyright assessment. Because they didn't even, hey, we have something, but they don't get a fact, well, they are not looking at the first point value of this, y could be interesting value of the copyright space, the world doesn't always be on the fact. And so you know, you know, the only, how license that the effect in the way that is that you have done? It was very clear in the legislation. And that will be as the law when they remember the problem that to the issue where they're really matter of the key, I know the value of the first point of the policy was in the whole that will be that they need to
