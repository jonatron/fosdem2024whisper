 Hello everyone all we are very talking about where we want to learn the work on. We've been doing. And we have to talk to introduce the first of all the open source community, we're talking to what our project we want to take our great money and build, people like to join us. We have a very much and we have to say that. And it's really. I'm one of the people, like, like I'm in front and we have to talk about about, but I'm a little bit of going to look a bit of a little bit about our community. You haven't just going to do for this talk about our research that. We don't heard about open source code. We're going to talk about this. We want to discuss about it. And we have the conference at the next speaker. We're going to come here. We're going to do our talk about you're going to be a lot of people here or a few weeks. So we've got started talking about how you're going to focus on the project that we're gonna got a little bit and're going to start with that. I'm going to talk about, but you're going to make it more new people to be able to do a lot of the day. So the speaker in the first thing I'm going to talk about the name of the first time. This year. And I'm going to talk is the company about the community, again, I'm a good morning. So let me, if you very clear talk. The Commission. And I'm going to our community on the definition of the company lead right now. And I'm doing a long time, the time when I'm going to talk of the end of the only talk's going to start to be talking about like the world of the whole thing. Like I'm going to make sense of people, and we're going to say, and there. I'm going to be a little bit to ask me with a little bit of a little bit, which is going to the community. And and I'm going to be got a little bit of a bit faster. But I'm not a little bit of all these are interesting things that. I'm going to do I'm... I'm not. I'm going to explain an end of what I'm happy to be talking about this really excited about the speakers on the community. I'm going to be talking about the thing to figure, is just wondering. I'm going to give us going to wait for that we want to see a small quality of the community as long time that and we're going to do. So the company, I'm going to talk about the community, I'm only going to talk about today about the speakers to hear me to introduce these projects because I'd love. And I'm going to talk to talk about what's of the whole topic. I'm going to talk to be on the product science and I'm going to start a lot of the money to give you to my co-ups around. And all the challenges are this. So here, it's the last year you are in this and we have about the community, talking about this is to you, we are going to say you can use it's going to talk about the people is going in the world, we have the most of the community science is to show us to be a really easy to be a bit of the people that we don't know better for people, so much about the time I already have to start the beginning and I think that. So it's the goal is just like you know what we have been doing in action. And this is we're just the world and we know, but we are just saying that the open source community we know, we have been doing different policy to convince people are talking about this and we need to do some people in the product. So I think we have a lot of the commission engineer at the panel and from a lot of data scientists can build of people about the community and all the product and so I think this open source and like the time. And this part of, the CRA and this really useful for this conference. So what was also if you know in these kinds of the law and the world, we've been working on the software who has had a particular and as well. And I'm going to actually, as well, we've just the foundation. Or the European Commission is going to be having a little bit of the European Commission? And that I've shown a little bit of a common piece of knowledge and this was just as people who had to be in the success group was not saying that they call as the license was originally had been here. And I was just saying that there was working on the moment. And we've heard that the work for the work against the first place that I think the law. And then I thought I have been actually been saying that many of the other people were made out three years ago. But in the same outcome that's the big law for the law. And I said I know me here today are the law after the she has to the market in a license and we're looking for a lawmaking, we are here and we'd like so we may be going away from here about the EU. And it's now we're going on the law is essentially going to be a directive. So they're going to be talking about the law going to be a copyright law, it forces that the standards law of copyright didn't in the copyright law would be a directive. And then the legislation, they did you will be a law, and they are not be heard about the copyright law and who are going to the copyright industry last year in advance the problem. And so on law, they're very important. And I think that's part of the key that it's the CRA to be been doing the law in the law within legislation part of legislation now of the rights and the world in a legislation was a law and a German federal of energy in law, the industry law, just the was an policy directive, right policy license law becomes potentially a standard that would be a value saying that is the rights value of legal software standard to copyright value and is not the value of copyright law. But the digital rights of Europe value was like is the decision that they were probably is huge value and copyright holder has made and civil society in the legal value that the value of the court companies're only the law is that in law to be an law did open license, they were made a politicians to a law. So it was a directive and they're not every law are not the copyright rights and say he was closed and they were the license of copyright appeal law and he had in policy and in an copyright so that society because they actually being any public law as I had a copyright value to a regulation of the copyright law didn't have market as you know what was asked about to solve was, which was a copyright violation to exist only the law that they would be copyright and of the law and they're in the free German value and copyright value and they would assume they are just had that the license that license directive from the law in the law value that was only think we had said. And now and there was trying to be there's an law itself because the copyright value to exist. The same value that the law, so that was not always an American public GPL law. The license itself was the risk mandatory law or part of decision might be or law that has the directive that they talked more because the license value as the license could be not be used anymore has copyright lawas was removed that they were a law, that just because so they decided to be aware of copyright law then they have the law to be bad parties. I think of the value was the law since said no copyright law would be, okay they are they were a directive the German law law were no copyright and they decided to end policy about this and they would mean that they could be clear and they have that they were the law. The, that was had to the law and they were in the GPL and it was a directive that was there was out. And maybe that they are a copyright would be more a GPL interoperability at public law that they can actually we do a value didn't say which was as a law that the injunction that even the law, but they didn't have I said that was the license thought that the law we did not as the legislation that the market that it was just might be copyright value as the law is also has been caused the law. We would be good. So we actually is really know that we had that at the question was done that the first thing. There were not too good to change and they were about this, but there were the license in the long market that was quite important in the law directive because is that was being used and this value of the directive. I know was the law is being had to the law, if we had 15 more things because we had got a license that was designed to our last regulation. So the copyright law in the copyright act a GPL to understand the law to the most value of the law of the government law. And there was for was no that was that had another law because the law, I were any regulation was the copyright felt I was like a copyright and they have not always one and they actually a law directive that we had some money who were a copyright and I was a copyright law at copyright law of someone had no matter of what were they should be the GPL law and they were trying to impact law law directive and they were afraid the railway law you are the copyright value of the sense that have value and they were actually said that there two key rights holder would always the court was meant to they had that they didn't just see in a copyright rights and they were looking at EU law law and had on the value and this policy, and they were a long law is the policy. And and so we had its law, but at the it's really the fact that you said the person that they could be an German law directive law. I knew that's just found their license not every law was that well an GPL was somewhat important thing that they were out was to justify as well that law that they had to really discovered I'm just talked about scientific knowledge in the law who was able to you know what I just know is going, for that nobody to be happy to be what they are I think it just wanted to say the court GPL law, you know what they did is the license because they were going to think it was not the law and then they want to do they were doing and they have the law people, the GPL copyright directive need to say that the copyright holder can be made as a law but they think I can still have to be able to be determined towards policy in the gate said in the commission who was very good that they just kind of the last point at last half the law law and they were doing some person with government law in the fact that's now got a directive at it's in German law by the question and they don't made it so in law would be, but I was you know. But you start in the copyright that was an aware of the copyright law as it was from the law to that's only in the American law or just the court. I had initially was a law that they have had no license license that copyright law holder cannot really, but they had the law regulation, but they were a copyright has to and they had to just thought that commission court since we had in the parliament to copyright who said this law that they actually have the copyright rights law that need to have value a GPL rights for liability in the copyright as the law and they were still just to actually this law and they can't have the commission but that we need in open fact that they've been legal bodies like to be found that an GPL would be actually be used the PLs and they would be published in the law could tell that their two term court law market and a google has been just the clause was the law directive for the law in the overall and the law no government copyright law and the law to copyright rights don't so it was a TPM has said which would just a copyright policy has to a legal license was no, was always an court or directive that was actually the copyright in that had a the GPL was interesting policy he was the licensee into the nature from law about the law and I couldn't know to think that this way to the law the law that the court but well and they're the software law was bad law in just didn't have two political and to they will be a world in the law law is, but the law would be had the law but it was the law by we don't open software's not a GPL a copyright of long law called law they actually had and the German law would always just also the copyright law in just did a copyright and they did that law I'm not want of was just wondering. The had in the law and it was that she was still something in the law at the copyright court law and I was and in the GPL could be in copyright copyright actually in a copyright and as well. And that TPM actually, right. And I was the law to do I didn't know, no that we had to make that they could really follow the licenseekeeper and and the American had then they're not know I knew, so it was quite a law got a copyright rights is happening on the court. But even because I wasn't know one point, I was needed to that I think okay and I think this incredible to actually be any only and he joined the real of the UK law and I was clear did some kind of the copyright thought that the copyright law clause. It was worth by the license that was very cost. And time is only because sometimes it was a public law and it was not the copyright's in law because, but it's the decision because they would be the law and the policy from law but it was an open source law did they were not the companies doing was really a public value as it could be. So that was like the copyright was just a copyright has no longer has the law law, said, but they hit in the value of the policy that you know, and they're mostly in license under there were we wanted to be better and the license law of the problem in fact that law that I mean that at the copyright value and the CRA is a non-genericating the commission in the law value of law said that still means nothing that the law that the law. But as well I think there can be the regulation of the copyright license has been quite
