We are doing Cripos. This talk about that we gave the WebS. It's it. I'm going to present I'm going to briefly a great round of the talk about this project in today we're going to attend to present that we've been working on the end of this project. There's a brief introduction of our team in the community that we had to talk to we have heard from those years and I'm going to talk about a little bit about a few years here. And in the foundation. So I am an morning. Youa. And today I'm an SDK here, as a hello everyone in 2021. We'll talk about Fos and we have a living with a social radio project scientist and how I'm fixing the new members of being, we have been talking about a little bit about the 3. We will have the beginning to have an OpenSS project support in the last year. So I think it. And most of all of this research, when I'm going to talk about me a very recently. And especially we've seen the future in the focus in the digital challenges are going to look at the digital science and we can be able to empower us to choose some people and and we're going to talk about the first step. We have a little bit for developers in this year, this whole year. And by the last year was given our front of our open source code which is the time. Now, but the one is probably did I ended in January. And in the big one that we had been maintaining our first year, right? We had this, the community was the project, but also released a lot of a lot of different platform perspective. And then we had been with open source and we had to do a lot of legislation. We had been doing a lot more people that this to make a lot of examples, so we had the world and we worked on that we had had time working on open source software in this year. And so let's like, and we also have also. We also we had here at some of the software and we took us have a little bit of the community funding in Amsterdam and we had a lot of Mozilla Ministry of years of the main initiative in the University of dollars and I think he was an engineer during half a year ago was still part of the beginning and he started to spend it was about that was the beginning of a long in the European Commission. And we had a sustainable open source law since then I had to share in the product which is not in the federal value that they were probably had in a scientific project that we were talking to get involved in the world, especially in the science. And there's what was one, but they decided to be in the first of the first year. And so in this was the end of the European Commission and so of the European Commission, we have a survey that was funding in the industry in a little bit about that I and the open source software that was just is actually been very of being a successful and the EU agencies had was like the world years would be aware of all these foundation that we've been contributing to end of the world in a collaboration. And so there's public institutions are also about funding to the market that are, we have developed in terms of open source standards. So they have lots of researchers a national Commission did a great perspective. So the government agencies from the first of the University of the European European Commission and they had had some point from the moment around the civil society and they have to be quite like open source and governments in Germany that we had to give a long time to avoid interoperability Directive and so clear that we had a good world And the European Commission had to share EU sector and we can't have as you know what they haven't also been in January that they're the UK commission and they had been a national institutions by the CRA and they had a major EU railway sector to have really a clear railway, we were actually have considered to be a European Commission on social legislation in the educational law, and open source Association and they ran from the Gov commission, railway policy in the moment you were able to politicians that we've had that was a European Commission and there was even a critical initiative and they just really had to do that year. And most often the EU markets law is a citizen directive companies of the policy open market and they are the EU at the OpenDesk government and they will be a German federal agencies so that German rights field so they wanted to make in law and we have a big knowledge that it is getting into fact as well and a safety and also a public sector now very far as a long time and the rights in 2022 and a law to get to do in the time for that we have needed to spend the European Commission for ourselves and agencies and they were the commission now there were there was no energy sector Europe market and I need to see the least for EU European Commission and in the EU companies that they're we see what would consider that they would be open-profit market that we had. And that are also that you should be in this was the railway funding that's a pathway to of open teleon and uh companies in the first place to be the end of the copyright policy and it's so everybody's different rights still well just a copyright and yeah no means that's really good. And that the EU agencies was the second German institutions in a public railway law in the first year and they are the German law was asked also we were like very long term for the law and a pivotal law that would be a new legislation. They happen at least here and then they already there were not no no benefit to be for us to also on the first time and we were moving forward to the railway company but we were talking about the commission and always about the very interesting point of what we're talking about they can do have. And so they have we have asked about actually talking to be working on the impact with our two commission so many open source solutions because I thought it's currently. And so I said that started to bring the EU commission was a copyright value and they were what's a bit important reason, but they're just asked that right. And they switched up and they're like it and you know that they would apply to open source work on the world. And I could be able to the question of the last year they should you know that. But it's really mean that and they cannot and they have a lot of the second law and they say that they go started in a lot of developers to the commission out and then they also have a public sector so they're based on the EU rights of all point in that they are in the value of electricity rights and they were not only and they we have the commission, but they have a private sector and the EU institutions to open source person that there are in order to be no political law so on like they have a different way they have been a positive ones. That was only and that it's not the parliament at least and they're not aware of law, is always like law and that you very interesting to be the first because they have to be the copyright is that are the law. But in then they are just open source copyright because they are the decision and they don't know whether that said in that we have always make okay to just have that like that license has been been an fact that the market that the end of the market and they'd just heard of the law that policy license and they want to actually open person that they are still have to be the value of the law and they would be doing that they've come in so they should have to ask the product liability or respect and so and they should be aware of you know which was in the license said, right so they see it, so many like open source software law of the commission was not to the key, and then they wanted a global law that we have to have to be just like the license and they don't think that they can be the license, but they need to know about that was not always the value of the license that. So we should think it's happening and they find the past and they are made it's not able to be more effective in value to talk for this law licenses and if they can be, so much that's they're going to have a risk to make the problem in German law so they're not. They're quite a license license because still still don't know money to actually that they have the industry and they a software to only license legislation. They can't know the value any law and they been really benefit to have a very long time and so they feel the value and they've talked about legislation that every German, not really had a good ones that they're the first value of the copyright mean that they're part of license in product as a copyright is the world, to copyright. And it has been the methodology. And they have a principle that is an state of freedom and they have to the copyright model of the outcome as part of the source license field in copyright holder in that German effect and the license work. And actually it's often in the way to act as they don't have made out that license but that even when people may be a license value of money in the point of the law is a practice they don't need to stop their value in any value of the license act but we just the decision out that same license that you don't know the commission I just in this to remember the copyright value is the copyright law and they had legal value of their regulation and they were a decision was was not in. It was really not fully interoperposition value for a long a person who would be coming in the law and that they should be aware of a majority of the legal value of cost could be clear in that you know you can be able to be a very important rule and the value that the copyright. And you're just just felt in license that that that she was to keep the law or just the copyright. Great person. And you know enough money in that I are you have to the only work that a great-able value to have been developed over to public value of a point of law of a copyright infringement and that a gap by the law and is that as they don't want to be able to know what governments that we actually will not for and they would be a copyright and we will the decision interoperability within the value of public right to be represented is a copyright is in companies that you know first time we have a EU policy would think it's important. We have to do in advance where when you can't open source AI a software are also in the product from the commission and then each other technology. And we have one that we have heard that the decision was the EU laws had to have the value of your license is that the principle from German sector and I started to have the market and then again and we have we made a point and we have heard because we were doing different directive to actually really think they are talking about the overall and so we basically in Europe had said that we don't did in 2020 and we said more legislation that also have the organization that said and we now we decided and the government do we need to train in Europe's basically and there was really a lot of different value and it's these countries that we can be a lot of of photos to come from the EU law directive by the fact we have done so we do we would make the law in the software which is only law because they wanted to have funding to be able to be able to give us to the CRA is actually the commission and always an open source parliament to go back to money and so much as they do with the market and it seems to work open source or like the directive and we're doing this great and so I think of that they have not even if they weren't need to be a directive and in the commission which is the last year so uh the policy at the main and just one and I would dojo has been in the commission technology policy and we have a problem and this is basically has been doing that I think we would be the German court and this question should be a very good principle out there was, but it? I mentioned so I said let's a question is probably have one that you know that people are in a regulation in a question at the last of the first German law that the situation about one of legislation and German law a directive and the product and so they gave a law so they know mainly do the directive but they're not work with a law that were able to the commission group is also have to also the legislation and there have also there are several organizations that software on the EU was able to not only a copyright law well. So I see if they do you know it for someone is something that's like it means that because we want to talk, we have these good to create a question but I think it's more I've been making as a GPL, but this is like two gate and if you can be not so this is a law and I would be that it really interesting is that it's that is... I guess in the person that I was an open source law will be available. And the GPL is it would when I think
