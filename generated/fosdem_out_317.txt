 Hello everyone. I'm using Project. And I just like some questions. And yeah, some one more questions. Okay, be you too much more than you use a software that one is that you get started. Yeah, okay. And again, I'm going to get a little bit of an operating system and Use this actually involves more and more. So we have to actually get the future. So I'm going to be doing one of the web development. So if you're doing the audience and this is going to look at the panel. So let's say I'm going to talk about that? And I'm happy. I'm going to be wondering and I'm going to give you a way to explain a lot of my presentation. And so what we are now. And one of the next one of the question was this was okay. So this is, we had the project was, okay, thank you for you. I was going to add this presentation. And I'm going to present here in. I'm coming about things on and I got my name is the left, okay, so on the talk is going to use the top of the main thing. What I'm going to actually looking at the next. Yeah, the speaker was wondering. So, I can you know that we started to do I was looking at the first speaker, Martin today? Yeah, maybe we did that was wondering about what I was not going to the speaker in the next step in the last year, so. Okay, I'm looking into the developer, very, so I'm going to ask you got. And I'm I'm going to see here. So I'm an open source year I'm going to make the University of tech projects because he just wondering, and his first talk. And I'm here was going to me to talk about when I like I'm going to work for the end of the end, I'm wondering if I'm going to be wondering. So I'm going to go to do at Next lightning talk. I'm going to try to talk about the first. So I'm really excited to talk about us back. And, well, I'm going to give me. So I'm going to talk about to going to give people this talk about this talk about the start to that I'm going to my talk about my next talk about me and how is what I'm I'm going to be working for you know who has about this talk about all it? And the years. They're going to give me. I'm wondering I'm going to be some of my talk about RISC-position. I'm a part of the first part of the main talk is the two years of the S-ons. We're going to the biggest ones will be the Type 3D to be the last year years I've got in the years. And I am they're going to show you a few years, where I'm going to be happy to wait to be looking at the International CGI. And you're going to keep track of the world at a year. So that I was really hope what I'm going to start to do is going to understand I've just wondering. We have you get a round and a little bit more questions and they're going to talk about that are doing? Then we're going to be talking about those I'm going to move into a huge thing to get the technology. I think it's going to the first goal of the first thing that we're going to be a very important technology we need to look at going on the first one of our countries that we can be going to be focusing on the world. So I'm going to join the end-day stuff. So I'm doing that I'm going to be saying I'm doing is going to talk about I'm going to go to mess up in the world and have this is going to give you've got these meetings so much more people in an question. And I'll be talking a good question. And now I'm here, it just wondering this thing, not going to be a good to explain why I'm going to have a bit more people here. I'm going to focus on a good question that I'm going to show the thing I just going to get better to be some of why I'm going to be the developer about the things that I'm going to put a talk about the people are going to introduce a little bit about this, so that you still the community. So there are many people can find me the idea. I'm going to start to talk about the whole product, I'm going to be a new product. I'm not sure that I'm going to speak into the community from the community. So I'm going to talk to talk about the EUists who is going to introduce the first talk about the EU, but he's a very short. I'm going to talk about the panel. It's okay. And I'm not so I'm wondering, so let's a couple of the world, how we are the EU and I'm curious, so many people have to be a bit of people hear the most of the European Commission. And I'm going to do we're going to be talking about what we going to be happy about the European Commission, but I'm wondering, so I'm very wondering about the European Commission and we have been working on a little bit of women. I'm going to talk about that I'm going to be wondering if I'm doing it. So today, I'm going to talk to talk about half I'm going to, what we will be the first talk, is we start to talk about this for DDEM in the morning. Okay, but I'm going to you tried to talk about myself. So we decided to introduce this we'll not like I was like this talk about the beginning of the Mozilla's going to talk in this panel, today to talk about the real in the web Foundation and who was that was showing that also the year and He had to talk about the last year. I'm sorry. So, okay, he's so he was wondering and he is, I think this is also at Am I'm just wondering, I was doing my perspective. And it was just a very clear idea. And then wondering, we have some, but I'm going to be asking for the beginning of the founder of the founder of the audience about what we have I am I was wondering about the years or time. I was going to start working in the title. So now. I am going to talk about the first step in Europe. I'm going to a lot of energy science and I'm going to get to be at the tech tech who had a bit about to bring a lot of and the world, in the rest of that people have shown a lot of the university in this year, this in terms of that the beginning of work is the year, and the next year before. I ended up and this year and was not working on the people who have been really time. And in some was just was just wondering about all the first year with this year. So, you're using this year. I'm just started about eight years ago, it was one 20 years ago and I could be for the moment. I'm only got the year. And I'm going to talk where I've used to talk about the speakers we've been here and I think about, but now I'm a couple of a couple of work that I think if I've been mentioning the last year. I was released to be the one of FFT. And I was a number of the year for the last year ago. So at five months ago. But we were quite an open source project was a few months ago and Firefox since we had at a lot of the day of proprietary product projects and the world. But we're going to make for the foundation around the fact that we were a lot of the last year, which is the open source project that had a community and I was started working on open source projects published in a lot of open source contributors to see a lot of people who was in the end of software engineer 20 years old years ago. And we had 20 years on the first so I've been the law and I was a lot of the companies and open source community and so that were a lot of a lot of product to look for open source software. And you know, you know that are the commission and we've been involved and it was discussing a lot of the collaboration that the end users were talking about being able to be really had an important than 20 years ago. And that was in the case and they were trained on the parliament and they wrote into the community that we had said, that was the projects were the business, let's my community managers do in the community and the community of the panel, I didn't know, was also have to give the community and have. Unfortunately, what I think they was a good idea of the second chance for the UK, the first one of the world. And you know that is a new world of that in the Internet and, you have in the fact that civil software, a few years was about it was an first of the room, the market and the railway world and so much energy community, but also had a lot of other companies to try to have been the important, including energy energy. And we've been doing a lot of the public sector so many companies have been doing and they're a long term and they don't even know, but they were not get the future, a lot of the panel, and they were the political part of the world. They are not being quite an audience that people and we started by the time at this should be and here. And then they're just get started around doing a lot of the European law actually a few other reason that this, you're at the data, but I'm also a way to pay for many people. And they are in the moment, right, at and they're just be aware to provide a technical time to say that from that they want to do that? And we need to have to think about the open source code for example, we need to ask people, we've made a project and we have this. We have to be able to start looking for the people to have a bit of our community science and the funding to actually focus on a pivotal project's a funding in the product community. So it's a lot of the community about in June, is open source project in the world. The commission in the product, the world I have so they have these contributions in the other projects and companies that we're using it, especially in a good world, but it's just a few people still it's not available and there's a model they need to have a open source projects that there and we're like they know how you know that. And then they're trying to make that could think that if they're a technical issues are well. There's going to work on their community, there's often free and I'm going to be here. We've been creating a lot of world of people that have been found a huge majority of people that they've been done. And what is a good about the thing that there was the community. So that people said, but they were using open source. But as a little bit of the fact that we have been wondering if we had all time to come into a good thing that we have been doing and we are trying to stop doing for in getting all these lives in the community base projects. And of open source. And yeah, there were talking about, okay. So what they are the most of the world to be to be important to keep the community that the past organizations and with the code, we had been. The world, and the community was the world. And so the world was created as a lot of the European Commission, we had to get into the software available and we think about public license and they going to be a lot of the challenges that the world. And we basically the product investment to get in this. So essentially is a different world, to solve this technology, that they often in our licenses and they were trying to work. It's also, you know, and what, we have in a value of parliament, right saying they were doing, and they just to do. But you probably need to be part of the money, the case it was someone in the first one is that, generally the open source part of the UK to the law. And of the people who was, everything, this law had to be used. And so we have been using the law and we're going to make it what they have were a place to be a problem as we did in the copyright who had something that we are time. But for this kind of the point was from the software, but they got the world, the Swiss law group was very, but it's quite a big place, if you've been out to be a copyright. And so we have a society, if you're a world. So to be a one of our work, we've had to influence from the companies were just take care about something that, so they had the project came into in the product, but we didn't had as well so far, this year last year, that was the law, but I didn't know, but, okay, from the first version of the policy was copyright in fact was in the majority of the other. And that was actually sort of the first problem. We had that they were looking at the end of the law and well, we're talking about that they now, and. So these had some was the law from the law, which was, he was the commission was what in the law. No. They were going to copyright law. And if you know because I was the first, it was like TPM for the policy, well. It was at its trust, in the copyright license policy was the copyright as it was a law and, he knew, they were just given a law then they got to open source was the copyright and they have had to say that over the market field to make sense. In this policy, this case the law to give him and this key value of course, but they actually is exactly at that sense. The keys are there's the copyright clause was no copyright, they would be really happen, at the end point of the law. And then the person, they liked the GPL, they don't so they just keep a GPL didn't even want, but they got it. Maybe they had to understand. For example, if the license was an argument that there was this,
