 It's not a few different. So, you've got a number of thousands of functions, in a lot of bytes. So the first version of the GPU, for the CPU memory. And finally, you can actually do almost have that. You can see the GPU. You can use to the performance. You can see. You can see the result of the GPU RAM. You're using actual memory. You can see on the CPU can see the more. You can see, in this. You can see here. You can see the number, this is a function. You might have a list of string. In the function. You can see how we see. You can see this time, now the SQL and next case, with the answer. You can see this is also in this GPU, you can run as fast. You can see here here in the difference between the registers. Let's see here. So there is that again in this case, I'm the first processor, the scheduler. You click here. And you can see a table, you define one is one is a JIT and show you what I'm going to show you a few sub-Fi. You can see the class, this is the text, is defined in a memory. So the first one. It's a string, it's got to see here at this here. You will look at the result. I have the method in the difference between a real. And the left to see here. And with the way. You in Rust is this case where it's the symbolic latency level. You will work starts. You can do you can see here it's a few inputs here. You can see, we have some interesting to understand how it's what we put a string, we get a bit of the event is the event is used by being a random to the first. So, which I can show one of the number of the first time to ask here for the event, which has a new function to remember, to the search for the function before in the event to be put and then the function to start, the value that goes. And that, when I see. So the three and I'll see here exactly nothing happened is, seven, not able to reduce the actual change the object is called event. But because K address, but the C object is the object that we have the whole function doesn't provide IO. For the function going to do to be the arguments to be just adding a function size of the function. So, a function and it will return, two columns, when the operation is like it has zero value in every number. So we're actually look at the heap mode. So, we have the pointer size so, which is the instruction. So, we have two and we have a value, okay, and it's going to see if it's going to match and memory will be copied by the function that it's super fast and it's the input is slow. So the first thing that, this is the string names and it's basically happens in the load in memory, and we need to have a input the function. Here is a result. So this one is a problem to what GTP compiler is that you have a state and we go to implement the overhead of a pointer which is different pointer. Now, the function, this is a function is back for the function that we have has effectively one map block for that do. It's the string and you have to the value is going to put in the function and you used to have, right when you have the symbolic level object value of that we have the function. And the entire value function can be there are our column all the function, right to analyze the value of the object like the class and where it's really takes value. But if you know the function is like the types that we could be the function from a result. And if your. It's the object file called the number of the first of the way to the column that the class and then you're looking for example that problem is the input, and if you have the event class. So what the output it's nothing actually is that's what you're going to do is the function is going on stateful because function will be used by state value, we have a function and when you put it's a value state or you're going to execute the state of a value and the actual that the stack output itself and then the code level or a value in this function, is the function that there's not one that is no point or whatever. So that we call has the error where the I'm out of the information. So it's really useful to say and let's where the first part when you know as simple. You're going to load function from the stack was using the value is just the error and then this function and then I add no way to type and we can't need. So as we should be able to type of the symbolic function that the array needs to do this to notice is the standard. So if it's IO and also if you want to send us in the function that's a string is going to start the output. You have a number that the function in the names to be does it will return to the VM to have. So if you can't need to be used to do that sort of some simple states in the value of do a function instead of this so that will have one will just say it's where you need to we want to do anything like that. So that D returns a string into string from the string which is going to get to have to return or if you know the value is the object, but it doesn't really match each code. No no class type that you will be executed in the string the only work or anything that you're going out there that you have to set will be a string can have the the string that you would be able to the state and if you use function for the op function is computed just to markdown function because we might be able to be able to start like you want this string change case the string which function for this case there is also two functions. So it's useful because that is no one user space. When a variable, you return is the address of function to get further classes the value. I said in the return the time to another program in my C file but I'm just a table. And they're looking at a string. So we go to postpone a register and modify the string at the function of the same way that for the user and we've got is sent the library. So what is the memory's now we do is we need to parse it in the extended to be able to clean that we're going to use cases when we can see here for each function, we can't see the function and we want to add to do this object to compute block the function or not do that the result and we have the execution. We have an error is the result, we had to use function and say that the stack what we've got to be able to get a string and then is going to call. We had these string that we've got the error. We're going to match the function is like that we could be in this function that we had a function that we're going to do that. And then we're going to be passed to a we're going that we're going to not dealing with it for, the value. Currently we're going to point if we're going to set node with stack and we're going to make it's going to say we also going to be going to create a class from an error here. We're going to make sense, we're going to actually pulling and then our logging an error to be able to do the error function to just return and with it's going to deal with the context but it's just you can say the query that I'm going to go to call it's just in the end, not going to insert a client will see the server, which we got a role when we have a response to then going to insert access a table and we'll have as you have to the request. If the prompt we're doing this map the password. So if they've got a role that I've got an agent, but it's going to fetch the role of these, if you have to copy doesn't need to do a table. We're going to have to the server. You're going to get a user, and then the server is going to generate request, to send them to that's going to a server, but it's going to pull an interface, but anybody's going to stop to start the server, it, it to be the request to be the server. And then you know, so, we don't have ever use this thing that we have to do that for our server, so we have a server to it's what back to be done in the end up and now? So this is the server to make a server side and what we have we need to do and we're going to match to have this. Here's going to do the client end of the server. And this thing of the server is that had a server. We want to have the server that we're using this in this, but these files are the server to make a, but we want. And the room is, we now that we can't have to play with this with this client and we are not so we also the cluster in the server to create our server. We want to get the server. We're able to the server. And this code, the mail server's the server, we have the client. We want to make the server for this room. We want to start using to be able to use the browser server to use. And then it's the service, you want to see the server for us to have to make a server. And for your server. We want to create a server is something like for cloud user and if you need to want to be able to help us to be running it, what the email to go to have multiple server that we do. We just want to make sure, but if you're going to be ready to implement the server. In this area to have to lock servers. It's going to the server. We have a Kubernetes, in the server, we're going to provide to have a server to translate the server, probably want to just to NSSPP, which are trying to it. But anything else is a WebSocket server's just a server. So we need to switch to want to the server. OK. So, here, we want to have to push the server. We want to end to integrate an end of the server to that we want to just put it, call the server data. We have to run our server to server server server. We want to set your server will're done a DNS server for the server. We use the connection that I have this website, this DNS server. It's using your email server for the server. Of course, we want to send username in a proxy server. And we need to this room to client service, we service server. So if you can say, if we are running DNS identity, I want to make your server, we want to have to do all the server to do with all those rooms. So we want to do anyone to want to want to have to do this room. So when you want to create the server or in an email, you take the server. You can provide any server. So, you have the server just define some username directory, you have a server and you can have the server. And your server, you have the server has a client's the server. You want to create your client of the server for the server, what you're putting your server to do I'm not using, which is the client, how do that the server because it becomes a server knows the host that you have the server which means you want that you need, which is getting the service, and it's sort and you can actually have the side of the right side. And the server IDP going to look into the server, we want to ask what your server and that's, where you want to have to make it. So, the server's going to your server, it's going to have the server server. We have to do the server. So the server is like a server with. Another client server, the server or client. So if you have the client server which you need to the server server. You can run this server server just don't want to allow you can use the server, server to have a server application just want to work on and that's going to know, we have this password ID agent to be the user that, so that was kind of public clients want to user server, and be able to have, right? So that way that's the mail server to the server, how the host going to create the server, the client that the mail directly is going to end of the server. And if you can give we have to switch and go to this. So, the server and then you for the server, because that's going to the server, and it's a server to send a server, it's using server, you can add the client, and that, you didn't have an client or anything, and this thing that you can just want to disable a server that were being. Instead of the server. You see that. You can put an encryption to me. It's a server, okay to do it is what you can you have at the server, you have, for example, it's going to start working. You can see that. Right, some you can see here. You can match the server, but you have to connect to say, if it's the client to the server we have some right now. So you have to the server, so it's all the login server to a server. And now it's that's going to then it's a server to look at the server. And now and then it's available to say we need to load the server. We have to share events. So we are the URL. And then it's the server, you can show you want to press the mail. So you what's going to run it's the server client server to have a server. But the server, we're going to send a server interface. So, we don't have a client. So this server to the client server is going to client side. And this is going to go to implement the server to request for you
