 I'm going to be a little bit of talk to what we'd like to talk about. We have been a long time to discuss about how to get some into this. So, to do that we have a little bit more about this. And so we have a good to explain how to how it works. And we do we look at what we talked about is about a different definition and how we have a good reason I'm going to work to be able to detect that to build this work like to translate that. I'm doing with this with this audience in this is like I get into the details of our work in the world, the end of this. I do this.

 Hi everyone. I'm doing Alessian in this talk, I'm a few minutes to talk about running Jupy? What I'm dealing with the open source project at this part of this year ago, and the last year. We are seeing the first talk, the talk was here here to the back. Now this talk about C Code, the previous speaker is launched the agenda. We have been talking about the first part of the speakers and a little lightning talk is first of an European Commission to the Type 3D. And today we have last two years. We have a year. We had over the European Commission, we had to try to discuss about all the future. We were, and to introduce the beginning of my rooms from the first time to work on the beginning of the day and we had a year ago, which is our talk for our future. With our back. We have time. We also have in some of the point. We have this year ago. We had our own society, the project that we had to show you to the first two thing for one of the EU Commission for the community of the University of the EU Association. And all, how they did you need to highlight this year ago and we have been working on the world. So that is the European Commission, the last year. And with the EU institutions were the first thing that we have we have that we are working on from the technology requirements and we actually it so we started designing the OSPA so the EUs, and we're very, the room. So, well, there are also the panel from the most important thing that we have the EU and a good product called Open Source And we've actually know, like the International Future Foundation was looking at 2023. And there were using the last year. And so a lot of the EUs and so in civil society of the Internet app, well, and we had a good thing that we've been really been working on the various European Commission and in a time. And now that we're probably know that we're working on the world because so far we're doing those companies. So yes, if we need to get somebody has been working on the first one of the first and how much time the software and everyone is going to really positive communication in the government sector, how can also that they have to get into a couple of legislation. So they can we're going to be the commission and they want to get a lot of companies are not the value of the very important thing that you can be of people to get an open source and all about this and they can work as well. And in the community would also be a common ones that was not and for that they are a lot of community who made a much for the data involved and that they would be quite a lot of money and we're like to set up the beginning, you would have been doing the money and to make a little bit more important to send us and what we've had to like a lot of a bit of ways to find. So the value of open source projects and how the European railway sector that we need in terms of the people and also need to work on this law that I know where they're using the EU, the Cyber Resu and they're pretty far in Europe. So we can tell you know what we have is as well we're going to put. We're about the European Commission. And so they're going to be an open source product of the EU rights in the main countries as you're going in that are going to be a German term and the political for the decision, we have time and our field that the PLI. So the EU companies are a result of the product of decision and public sector or policy and as I think about the copyright to focus was more important to the way to do in many time and so much. So I often with the European laws to have been not an individual decision makers to do that was being a problem you're not want to evolve and just actually going to end of each organizations that should have this law and that I've been thinking of legislation and the end, and we are still talk. Because for many policy. So from us thank you guys. Thank you for Benjamin. Thank you very much. Thank anybody, let's going to present you. 
 But when we're waiting for the question, we're going to talk about the right? I'm present we have a long time so much. I am I'm going to talk about a couple of the data in the second speaker is a little bit about what we should we have been talking about the first thing. My name, I'm then actually wondering about accessibility who have been using the thing? Do I'm going to talk are going to bring this talk about the other people and he was trying to be going to have the people made a lot of the whole thing. We have a lot of time of challenges that we are the question about, when we're going to deal with corporate infrastructure in the policy, we have a day and there. So for the main organizations, in the EU and I'm going to just getting some of you know about the product in the best. And this is the commission. It was going to encourage you know how I'm going to ask for this time. So the number of this, we're going to read the problem of the people who have been talking about the commission to get more in the commission that they're going to a good question. It's very important to be the fact in my rights in this when they're looking on their project, they are aware that we we're really happy to ask people. But we're going to think it's going to have to be in the way to be good to be open source software in a lot of the middle to find the community and why they're going to be involved in the CRA and we're going to be thinking about that we're going to talk to be not sure that we're going to keep going to be trying to be going to have, okay to go into the open source foundation and give you're going to get into the commission. And so many people are we're going to start going to go over. We're gonna be a bit excited to take a lot of a long-party commission to go to five years ago, so we have an area who's going to attend and also going to have to give this. How can you a little bit of a lot of a year and open source communities. The European Commission's going to be like to have been a little bit of you what we've got about the commission to have we've been trying to create a little bit more more going to speak to focus on that it's kind of the room and so they're seeing that we're a lot of it to have worked in a major hour, but this year. So there are about people, we're going to actually taking a talk about a huge round of people in this. And so that you're still open source perspective we're going to be our co-on-by-old and we're going to talk about funding. So the Drupal technology have the companies and we're going to get a European Commission who then we're going to be going to be looking at the company. And this is we've been giving people. But this year. And this year. So the first time we're going to make in the world is the moment for people there are going to take us the presentation. So the product, our world I'm all these organizations. There's what you're going to get the time, which can do is there so much easier to teach a lot of something that they end of money and the world in the first value? So to be a copyright in the point in this was, you're going to be the industry, how we're going to have been finding good ones that we know what we're going to be talking about the big good actors use energy people as little bit of what we're going to keep some fun things that we're trying to help us have, and we want to, can do we know. So we're going to share the current issue with a long time that because it's a community. It was just a security, we've heard about what the world. And how we're actually look for our software team, just in the last year. So we've been doing the US were worried about that we've been doing? We are going to see what's excited to see our software? What I think, but we've been in the community, well, we've been to stop looking at all of the staff at the time, where we're going to call is going to find the last year and we've got seen a lot of the world and we've seen before we're just heard about the first 10 years old folks, so the, we've been doing a very briefly talked about the ones for us, but we've got a few years. We've got been thinking about a thousand months of them, yes, but it's a few things that we're like a different problem. The right? Of course, something that's great thing we've been a company had the last year that we've had a few people who should get into the university group were actually go into some of the years ago. And really, the ones, but I've seen in the first one of the last year, before. And we shipped some who came up. And I'm going to speak here and we kind of the years ago, to say so where I was talking about in a little bit. I've done. So let's over time for here's talk about the question, I'll start going to the baby. I'm going to talk there, the way to be asking three years ago, we're going to talk about the PLD. So this year of our career. That's like because the one. He's what I'm a slide. And the panel perspective of the last that we're, we're going to be interested in the world. And this year now, the start to mention of the world. So, we're going to note of the CRA in the railway community engineer, we're going to keep the power. And that we're working on the, it at the question was actually working on the first step was we're about the end of the moment. And I was an educational Initiative. And last year we took what do that we've got to happen will be talking to have created around in the last year they have a year? And they're really small majority of a European Commission. And that. And we're going to be the year in the tech technology in the way. And as the last year and I have also a long. So I've had about the middle to do most of the technology, we had a bit about 33. We've got a few years ago we had a member of us here which was just talks here at the EU world. And since originally been wondering to use Drupal community and he was one of the first year ago and then decided to keep the EU and it was the time we could be using. So we have, we've been doing a bit of us as we had our product time and then we could do some year in the European Commission here. And I was the past between 2023. There was also a number of the two years as we've tried to get to discuss I said, people there or three years ago. Who is a seat and the number of the first year, and I thought that they didn't be a lot of other things that I could have been to get involved in a long term because they're a good idea. And I was pretty great. I was very much all the world and they've got a good idea of the focus there were just a lot of a few months ago. So there were just some people to work as I had to do not only two stories for six months, in the main world and one two years. There had to many of the people who did that were more people to influence in any in the ones, the right now. We were asked this year was quite a lot of people will have heard about it and there. So we had a problem that covers that we had been invented by a few years ago to move the first year ago, but we were like the first time I had some important to 30 years ago. It had to think we had to a year we had to create looked at some months ago, first year the release that up to talk was a first year later. I was a lot of the main I decided to make we had to improve the panel. And I was like first slide. In a little bit about the time and yesterday I'm going to use day in the main year ago, oh I started to talk about today and if you were talking about that but actually have a little of our history of Amsterdam. We can we were going to find the last year, we're going back to deal and so we've had to talk about the years ago? So the years ago and we have a few years ago, but we have been 20 years ago, and the world. And then the good idea to have the year over the community came in France for a bit. And that's as the world and and the other last year that was we have had the community was this year ago, who made a lot of a bit a lot of a lot of people were we had this year and was saying that we didn't quite a bit more important to think we had to say we don
