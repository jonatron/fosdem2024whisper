 So this case, well, I'm going to set this is going to try to give this. So, you can see a specific example, a system to start point is a string and then you're built with the schema. Then you can also work really sort of test. So a string error as well. It's say the most important is it's going to put the object. And in the next example, we have a process that is an array of a string. So the return entry. The thing. So the coverage is basically the array is the first because I'm not going to be a string that the type of rules, though, the object, so this is going to be going to be useful to go, right? And if this is the function just a row of pointers, it's not not we're going to be computed inside the function you can. It's going to use this. So sometimes you're going to be more if it's going to be a string for it's just a error pool to be able to do that. It's just going on a function. So the index of the result is going to represent the value of instruction function. It is running is the first one of the function that the function. And then we start the only the JSON size of JSON takes be computed it. But I don't remember, it. Well, I only have time in a way, yes, there's it's no, but that it's one. So if it's going to look at a function one. Because in cache is going to read in the value, this case, I'm going to talk about the function. I'm going to work on my thing. So if you're going to the code that you load balancing is the first iteration of, well, you're going to see this kind of a state of an array where we are we've got the time. And one, I'm going to move on I've got to what I'm going to the first one ID to the fact that, exactly to be used in the idea of the, the way to do I'm going to make the first, right? You are going to have in the value of the last step, I guess. From one of the message state to show you aware of the future I'm going to talk about the same thing on what's an ID, but I'm going to know here, but I think it's going to show to follow me if you need to hit the right, you're going to ask. Let's going to be able to have this is a whole read, but I'm going to do some of these steps, and I said, like, it's going to go to continue. It's going to start to be a jump to build space, so that a bit more time to turn GPT and how I want to do you should I'm going to put some sort of each one. And I've got to the other thing I think I've been a little bit before, I'm going to play at the story. We're trying to go for us, like the first time thing to talk about that do I'm just kind of all of how they'll look into it all to look at the things that way. And I'm going to get to talk to say, this is, oh, this is kind of, this, right? So this guy here, here and, we've got a Rails team. Okay. So kind of all, here is just been at the new school, I'll have. So as we've looked at the moment. Sorry, the first talk was what was at the year. The last year, we had to get started to be very quickly in the initial... We've been doing with the new project. And I'll see what we have was the time to talk, we're going to be going to do we're going to say, but I'm going to be going to be a year in. And in this is this year at where the next 3D is my conference was going to be there's a couple of a great talk about. And I think this is something is quite interesting because we're working on for this year. And it's the first talk, we're on. And I was the last slide. And this was an early year, the last year, the same time are the years ago. So I'm going to talk about 2023, this year, I've been brought a version that the first year, which is the time. I was to the first year. And I'm a lot of the whole project group was was that you to two years ago too much of interest in recent years, but I was. I was mostly talked about Alas, and this, I'm going to be done this year, a good. I'm going to try to talk about the last day, the workshop for the panel that it was, they were wondering about what I was just heard about how I was being been an open source of the last year ago. But I was the last year ago, but I get been just wondering that was so they were a little bit easier to get a bit of an hour last year ago had a lot of the years ago. And I kept before, as I was wondering, but I was like, I was actually joined at the open source and think I actually at the last year. So I had a quick talk to talk I were up from my co-shirt was from the world a bit of the reason that was wondering, I was trying to stay I guess they took in which was it was wondering? I was at the, and a year. I had for the point, let was in a very happy to get an issue and he was actually got a lot of the, and he was really hope that was really worked on the slide where they had to get started to maintainer years ago, but he led to have been around, and I was like I think there was getting two years ago, and I was a lot of CentOS engineer. And I was quite worked in this, I was the first year ago I called the end of the years ago and they had people know about the time, really, they were really came to go up there was released. So a lot of really open source team in the years. We had some of people, there was part of big little bit of the last year. Because you've been there's now like a project. The community is a project that, of a lot of a lot of people were working group since we actually started with myself and the product and so that they ever found around the things we had to try to make the co-source community. And so it was going to tell the way that the people. So if I'm going to speak to be talking to do you about the project in the years ago. I was running the last year ago. And I was going to give a little bit of what I had to do, because they're going to keep doing that. And finally have some of the time ago, we're going to make their communities need to be the software and these days of these people and they're going to be a thousand people understand where they're going to do a lot of the community, even have the people who can keep it more people who know that have like they're just keep as a very small people to choose on and they are providing people that like we have got started the kind of the last five years ago the European Commission's a lot of companies are very recent years and they are going to come to be able to have projects who decided to talk about. And I think I'm not going to know what I'm going to talk and I'm going to present I'm not saying I would like, so I'm looking at next time. I think it's going to try to just a little bit more of a little bit of the the second. And I can we've got this year. It's about and I'm going to start with a year ago at the slide and maybe at least we're going to remember how it. The talk was focusing on the last year ago we were in the year. I'm going to do we had some of time as well so we're all the years now as I'm one year in this year ago and we're going to give a few years ago was going to go to discuss that we're going about the next year. I also welcome to ask you. And I'm also started working on the 3 release and it's going to share. I'm going to see a couple of the release. We've got one of days, so I'm going to talk to talk about the first year. Okay, I'll talk about FOSDEM here. I'm going to the first talk is the European Union. I'm going to going to talk to talk back in the year ago, how I'm going to see if you saw that I'm here, the last year. You hear me, but the only talk, the morning, for that you. And so I'm just talked about today, if you guys are just showing the panel, we have started writing a bit about a bit about the rest of the time to do not work? I started at that. And first time we can do we call me working on the next step. All right, I guess we remember this. The more than also more than I'm speaking about today. And I'm sure that and I'm going to ask you. So this I'm going to be talking about the talk about the way to talk about us today, which is that was I'm going to be a great for what I'm. I'm going to present to be wondering to be a very basic talk about the architecture. It's being a very interesting. And I'm not sure that I'm going to be speaking about what I'm just wondering to introduce my talk about our last FOSDEM here, the work is that I'm going to me, here. So the point I'm here 20 and I'm going to find a few of what we have, who is the beginning here is going to talk about the first one here, so I am I'm going to present. So the most of the last year. One of the project is the last year, there's going to think we saw here. So I'm going to present here. I'm running this. And I'm going to introduce some work at the beginning. And I was in here today I think I can I'm going to start, I'm going to wait for the first here? So this year, I'm going to talk about this talk.

 So they as a large tech project, I am I am going to talk about to here to talk. So thank you very much very much. Hello, I am a little bit about back to talk about the last year today for the first one was the beginning of two years in the latest release called Run today I'm Matthias and I am a year. I open source community. I first year. I, we gave me. And I was a year ago, for a couple of my company, which is 20 years. It was started and I started by the years. It was I was really invited to the slides. And finally I was very challenging to open source software. It also the history of the university in German license that was also was open source software engineer in the first world using Project 2022 and he actually released in German law and in the fact that I was also knew as well, and I was an open source law. And he was the big in this was mentioning in and I was very excited about the companies which was good decision. And it was the first year ago, we had to do see the beginning. And I was a bit of us about 20 years ago, very useful for a few years and the panel was completely sustainable software open source world and very interesting to be giving me and was actually a really hard to the society. And had to get a directive and there were a lot of a lot of their software that started in the European Commission, and we said, but the actual decision are the governments are some big directive and people are hoping that on that we weren't in the European Commission had in German law to look like a government revenue in other countries. The other law, the EU developers are like the years. So we should be very likely. Because the core years about the parliament is the EU and so we are aware of law. And I think we have always think so they're glad. The long-founded a political member of the court of the law in the world what we have is and it is the licensee was only part of the EU directive and they can not at the GPL to look or the commission that they are able to also the law. And the German value of energy law that was a good in law that we have the GPL law in German law, so it was no risk and the German law happened last step of software is that the law where they are the funding?
