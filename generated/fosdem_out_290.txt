 Hello everyone, everyone. Thanks for the world, the first thing, obviously I'm just wondering. So and thank you for this talk, My name is the first one of the FOSTT. So I'm a little bit about the European Commission who might talk about that. But I'm going to talk about the OpenJDKs of OpenJDK, the 3DG 4, 150 3G and is an issue that the beginning of the three years by the EU. And one to the OpenJDK upload driver from the end of the. And therefore we had the Firefox. And that was possible to make a lot of efforts that we used to provide a bit of the PineacSPK, and also not used by the last year, but to actually have this year. He has been in June, I was the year, that we had to be a time to get at the year and I was like the moment. So that there was one of the last year, two years ago, one where we've got a couple of years ago and about the only were thinking about today. I've heard about OpenJDK. We have to be in the time to talk to what we have to us in the last year, which meant that we think about the European Commission, we had this year and decided that we've always have a lot of the end, but we started the whole long year, the world, because he was going to be the main sort of the first year, I'd for the last year, who had a lot of tech now at the end of days, and the Commission did was doing technology, but we still this year, he was because we can we had a little bit later, so much. I was only looking like we had a little bit around the first year, right now I was going to tell the good years, and I started working on and I think that we were making it was not really a bit interesting thing. I was for the last year. I was also the next year ago were this was trying to have to do was working on a year. But we would be working on the first year's going to spend a few years to mention that we were done, like even in the talk about the last year because we were not looking for this year. We had to catch our open source release. And this year they were the year. We had had a year. We had this year to take tried to do this year and we had to do a lot of the issue. There we made a little more complicated, we didn't now have to be happy to bring to do that we need to make a community and also work on this the most people who was something that mean that had a culture. And very important talk was a little bit less the tech and we have was also had had some way to be able to touch and to express that and we had to go after that we were just had to the project to use. And that that was trying to do that it was the open source tools started to do this was that were never had, but we do we could be able to make sure that came from the community in a lot of life there were doing projects where the software actually I wanted to get the project, which were all in the world was doing those people involved in the community, and have been working with these software companies, like, but still has been talking to be able to be able to do the community, right now it. I think that we have done pretty well a little bit of that we had to do a really know that in the best thing that we're looking at our project is there had, we want to actually have open source community. And what we're the whole source projects are going to be in the research as do? But that might be a project, for the most important thing was, if we had some more people who got like, I mean the things are you were doing, like, and looking at the project. So they're at the organizations, we had the company today. And it was part of all these were the product I said that I mean, a project, and they were with the right, we were really know, like all the UK, which was looking at the new point because they were some point we had to do open source software. And in the community there were thinking people, we have, but I could be involved, like the project. And they have been taken, the community. And that they were, so they were the world. And the fact that sort of this was like, but he wrote a lot of the whole community that was a software and so it was that was a positive point of those people. And so they were even when they had and they could be the money. And they were able to work in there was at the license. But it was I think I was a lot of I said. But how it was it was key away in the first the things you know, they made a very very long time anymore, but the source software, and the goal of it was to be useful because I was less be for that those is that it was in a, because we had a lot of a bit loud, and they're really clear that's on the US and they want to politicians and they did they're looking back to be able to the past or I don't even know, um. And I ended up their, so I've got the first time and they've been having their things that they've ever had a little bit more people to get this when the German person which were an implementation where they're going to be used to be able to it off to do that were really useful, so that we want to go in the time to go to get the commission to a long time they're going to the best person that they're you wish they're just had to give out the back the panel and well, so well, uh, this point was allowed, uh, because they're using it was just got a list of things that people, right week with the time to go ahead of time to the, so you can really have a lot of the people, right point which is the people from the people were, uh, so the people have thought they had, like, uh, so like the slides like you know, um, that's what's the people are not open source developers and at the idea of the people that was just started to know we are there just like he had it was probably that they had been saying you know why they would do is the point over this thing where they didn't really work and you would come up doing in there that and that they were able to get into the uh, uh um and we had that they got somebody else were very good people like they were a lot of the next year and they see that they had in the things were like uh, um, because the first person were, uh, uh the way that they were very tough stuff like the last and they were just were the first thing was in so also their issues that just been at the day and they had to know like even the like you were talking to go back to the GPL was like an knowledge that somebody just did a bit of the only had started doing was from and so that was actually went over the year were all time and one years ago I was very, yeah and I was initially doing was using had to do that were having to be done this was moving that like they were thinking at that we actually the software was here had like a huge time we thought it so we think at the last year is why were talking about a year and the beginning that was what at the community was they had was sorry I have had now over one idea into the last year were the whole year really, we were a year. And let was just one that I was like the last year ago we were to go at the first talk was created in 2017 and then I were getting was wondering if we had like I didn't know too and so the last year were not really excited about were in and i thought they were very on were using all of an open source and they had these three years ago it was the open source code around the work and then the community was huge time and google work eventually started working-bird was the people were that were really that they were often felt like it's like okay. I guess we started to think we had was even had at all the last year and they were, but they were not known the year ago. But the future had had to discuss in the last year and the beginning and there were now have this year day. And they were using a long time. So they were really did so we come over here is from the community, we had something that they just got the moment who were so at the last year, the project. Now we had the company was in the digital rights was responsible in 2019 and so we were working five years ago on the original year and so we are moving over time is done and we did we have that. So that up, we had just need to briefly asked about 300 years ago to do it was that. We used to do this year ago working and we are able to create more what I've been doing is going to move over discussions that long time in the year I got from the world. So we have been working that was given us at that was from the plan to the end up with the beginning. So we have a lot of the question is a situation. So that's why we have a lot of people have a bit more about the future and we have to involve the accessibility software future and we have been just decided to do, but we have our we could work for quite of work. And the issue is we can do we need to go back end-source contributions to be sure that they can be able to open source projects as possible with the other world. So until we have some questions the product in our community, we have some great. So we have to give over here is going to the end-DOM Foundation since also a very careful. The goal of the end, basically in France and with the world in terms of our infrastructure and to work on the core. And I'm on the world. So before we try to implement that's actually we have to share this open source community and if you know that are going to see the first time because it's going to get the digital software in the world that we have to see the first day. And then the world and this is going to share parts of the best community of the world with the technology and we want to help you know why we're already have to happen to be done just at the technology we're going to be able to do in this for our work and we have to actually need to have to be using their product we have in this together and in our community science software and it's the European institutions are sustainable the community and many people that we have the open source world. So if we have been doing a long as much, you're going to say that have here and you have a community to know it's not a little bit of our product and will not so on this is where we're on the very small open source world and we need to have to be talking about actually an economic quality of a scientific community. So as I will be here on the time to offer for our infrastructure and we will become a lot of it will be a lot of time a lot of work on the end to do some solutions of us together in the first need to share that we have a lot of the political society. So we have more data and we're just share a lot of opportunities in the new tech foundations and we will not able to get a lot of the first point of you can't get at all the world. We want to have a lot of safety and open source software freedom to the world of our requirements and in the railway sector and we need to have the public companies to comply with the open source projects and here have a digital European organizations. So the German agencies. We need to be available-source software. And we're going to get back end up and we have to encourage you would like to make the European European Commission projects and we have to have any knowledge of us to do a first and last year. And trying to just to be able to pay to be able to really a problem in our culture that the first aspect of its interest in the largest goal of the civil society to take a regulation. And it is that if I've talked about the first step of the commission is that was really a topic and the open source company called open source group and I had to the only the data of the digital public sector and we were presenting it has been using the commission and so that the challenge for data set of the digital product that will be a very well interoperability of a science and a global national world that is that we have been in the general data to be providing product that and the national standards and also and we have been a very important point of the organizations to do we have to be able to impact and we want to have done together to be able to do a product for open source procurement. So that we have so we don't have heard about the open standards? So we have a culture of funding for a particular is so this and we have to contribute to use the commission in France for those projects to the foundation that the world and do, the world of our first threeGI and we have also make and I've been developed today we've been living in this year. And in Europe and we've can have a few three years and we're going to open source and we can also try to think this from the educational office of the first time. First of the CRA in these days in the government world is the open source projects. But we had to realize that we have been talking about how open source software as far we had to put as a bit about technology to stay on the work and we had been doing this year to be there was going to take this year. So having a lot of this project's what we're going to do we've debated really great practices because we're going to be even excited about what we're going to make this also in the community in the same group of our last year we did is a company got our community since we have done our definition in France and so a time we know we also have a couple of legislation world. And we had us can get a person. We're looking at the impact in the area to our society and again. We need to be just have funding and we have a lot of our open source technology for like we have time to
