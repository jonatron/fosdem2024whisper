 Go. So, these who is going to explain about the very cool. And I should talk about implementing an edge. It's a product that can be part of all the things that they are new and to manage to other languages. But the idea is this is you can look like the things and can use a few of the most of them make that something more. So what your future is going to look for the details. So, we have more and that we have, we have, and we have to build some other talks about doing that? We have been looking at the worst. In my case, I used to put it a very first version of the point I was about making a few months ago. So I'm an improvement. I've got here to tell us like I call it. So I'm going to say, you. Okay, I'm going to have a few months and we're going to show there. And I'm going to go to start to this and get the next I'm going to talk with that. So, this is exactly where we have, I'm going to talk about the front end of the world in the code, I'm going to be here. The next slide is going to go to see. So let me, you, I'm listening to start to kind of a good afternoon. And I'm the first. Thank you get the ones. 
 So, thanks, thank you very much for having a little bit more much for being a video. I'm going to this talk. I'm a little bit about it. I'm going to present some of a bit excited about how we can we have to take a long work for the back in many people use in the slides. And I've been working on the speaker, how we're going to make a few questions, you guys about the Game Boy is a bit of the journey of a conference and a lot of the project in September. And last year, I am Manuel, and we know, we have created an next talk about the speakers, how I spent in the end and how we moved to see that we've been doing a massive weekend. And I'm not a member of the maintenance of the first of the OpenAI got a little bit of the day, the company. And he's happening on the European Commission. And I've been doing open source in November to go through the same day. I'm going to the first one of the European Commission because the community was a law, but I've done in the parliament from a lot of the European Commission in recent law and the last year ago. I was the last year, you were thinking that I had released the commission since I started to have been in the German law, and I spent a little bit bigger tech law, at the moment. And that was we've got a community around the world, so I think, and in 2023, European Commission, because we just spent a half to be in our world, so he has quite a democratic way to be able to be a few years, and a long term, and so we can be shown six months ago. In November since they had his first years and a year into open source but I was a decision the team and they have a company just learned the last year. And about four years ago, but there was not the world that the law, we've been able to be 20 years ago for everybody was a lot of Drupal and it was that's some of people, the commission. And so in the railway technology was a little bit of people that was about the beginning of the railway policy of the day were saying that we had to actually made a big in November was not the panel. And these ones, this year I have of January 23 million a lot of the first decade of being our way to work that we started to point of people, which was really at here on a good organization of a year, which was responsible for young we've asked this by two years I went into the society, I think we go with the European Commission, so in the other years ago, who were there were still a few engineers are a year it was the company and the European Commission had been kind of the EU, came in 2019. So from and there was still various years ago. And I was also with 2011 until the city had a lot of people are not have a year in France. And the world, the EU key sets and in the University of the Open Rail Act and we had two years after the licensee companies are just see people have also really a lot of them were doing these have been different institutions have quite an outcome of interesting way of the CRA and we had heard of people in the the last year. And this year was because it, we also there were just a lot of the time and the CRA was already been in the city to the world. And I'm quite an open source software that's like that he had to be there could be some months in the organizations and there's a very like a long as you can go through the fact that the person was very important that there were just said before. And they were they had asked about the EU practices for a member of the beginning of the digital European person that so he wasn't know about it was to be very good for 20 years ago and I think there was also a European Commission. And so far in like those law and a German Commons and that she did I've been doing was in the world and I was a number of German commission. The negotiations, three hours that were the way to say that they are the society they actually have an open source rights didn't think they were just have a government interoperability? And actually the years's incredibly interested in the PLD to do. They are looking at the licensee open source society was there's meant to, whether far all the most years, for that they had, they still had been an EUD and they actually we had to train actually interoperability forecast and so they had said we said. And the big value of that we had the court law that they got into the open source value of the value of a two value and last year they got some point were the idea to be the European Commission had heard of the space, just a second person that was relatively long time because he had the Neo4. And would be in being the EU Europe and he had was they started kind of the policy before the public law and had had before has paid to work for more law to spread from the society and the German policy that actually was the end of society we've been said, they was a positive because they said there was a different group had for the best states need to promote into the EU, there was a point in the organization in in Dutch law, for each European Commission in terms of all was that the market could make their damages of the world and they all of legislation and they we thought of the government would be involved. But they don't necessarily have to go to interpretability that they had to the ones that they have a huge amount of us from the law. And they came even an open source world and political. They were made that world, and they didn't work far in and they started around the law, they had the policy and long term and they created in but since we have been doing like this policy to say that they were like he didn't that we wanted to open source liability. The law and they did some regulations are not affected the AI government field is to do that the court of having their policy? The commission is the market which was only has an open source company was in Europe that that they've tried to also was that we had well in, so that they went into a law and then he was probably know these law in the German% of the Commission away from no they didn't really be done so what they couldn't have been a member as we've been had a license a decision to talk to have asked during digital rights could have thought we're that was one was just this had a very good thing that we had to think that was quite been, yeah we're here, okay and the summary of the law that she's the least that that we'll do learned that. We're going to have quite a law and just to be done together with the GPL they had the GPL said in what was almost happened and a law itself is in the heart of copyright law would be in law and would be affected by a copyright that's no license because this law that there were actually that the license would be. But is just be in has a license world because of all the best directive, like that that you know is what does not about rights in the commercial parties that we have to understand the license actually the rights could be asked that they do a mean, which they're not clear but they would become at that value of the licensee but they have to go to be some separation between the copyright licenses and that they don't like commission. They can't know so they're happening alone, even they're actually don't just need to find out of it's absolutely be a value of this value so it's no mistakes, but as they're part of someone else you can't know if they've worked out it a license because we have to, but it doesn't have they can't really care about that they're kind of copyright infringement has a sense that they're in the copyright thing we want to try to do that the licensee would be known as well as an CRA had, but you know that nobody could go to do the first this together now that right to the same entity that needs to the copyright has been had to be in a copyright the license licenses that we heard of those should be aware of the end of the mandatory on the license as part of regulation and the parliament in the copyright in terms of the politicians at the copyright evidence could be a risk law but they could be a license for free license license in terms of copyright terms of that big license law has any open license under a sense you and copyright law does an law that copyright as i always be represented in that a but that he's the GPL is a copyright law just the law and he said they were maintaining off of law to spend more decision and to the law and they were a copyright in the legal copyright law and they were a law that they were so this German license was not, it copyright legal, but they're they were there were aware out they were the first law cannot be doing the GPL they were a law and was only a copyright law right didn't really just one GPL is the copyright legislation and that law. So the commission means that would definitely a copyright copyright law could be a directive law in fact was a copyright parties that the copyright holder is an copyright regulation for law and a copyright and they had done in some copyright rights law and that's really the law is essentially mandatory clear law of the value, who is mandatory copyright GPL copyright from the license holder in the law to the licensee and he was said that so they could always have to they were the freedom And then they were kind of copyright clear of copyright came on the CRA by the regulation which said that you know it was not always that would be happening and i have a directive but probably has also a value of the same CRA to be an copyright, no, but just to be required so they then the court to have the GPL fact that the copyright key and they have key law is the GPL% on US law and they're copyright holder value, but they're not and they had never're also said there were the right license could because they were some sense that they are the license that the law clause and they follow in the copyright infringement's the lawyers do didn't said that they're not that you know the copyright law at an evidence. And is got an GPL has been quite good law laws are no way because they gave the CRA in the idea that you got to be a copyright policy directive because they're sort of the value that's the law and they are quite the copyright court copyright and they'll be in product called just been clear law so like open that value of the GPL law is it was kind of copyright goes wrong because it's going to the CRA is kind of copyright value a copyright he had to have a bad copyright space or an AI in a licensee tax, but like it's open and so they have this person and they can do don't join into the same nature of a license rights in the same violation is a copyright that they found that the law the copyright in an legislation as we did I know that the last and this policy law and policy that they don't understand what they do because they go out that we've been kept the copyright is not at the fact that and then the parliament didn't have these court infringement and I did we had the two years was still know in the commission law and they were also but they have also then said they had that public world was just because we didn't really know like, then they were going to use what we can do was going on that. That's what a law and the law, and they I should be a closed source policy holder if they said it has to be from this is a decision. You're hoping to match and you know. So they do you're not have a copyright holder to get to ask the whole license because you know that or I think that I think they're going to be in over there's going to say the middle or thinking. And then we're asking that. We take care about the day to see that to turn the entire value that we speak into the copyright holder? And that we're trying to start a really really hoping to put over the PLB. Another part of the right now. And they're going to do now need to make it and they remember what they are actually have been trying to be free rights and they're not necessarily a law and they're trying to say but that we are hiring to do we want to share the values and interoperability. Maybe we're going to think that we have something is going to ask, but what would have? And if you what's it just to do we really want to share. And also have to look at the whole policy, the law is that that I think we have the first two sector to be a success that we're then in the big citizen to have to like open source freedom to have to trust the commission, which is a European Commission. So that people just take this, you're going to understand what these and why we can come back to the power of technology and we're of the world and we're going to start the CRA at the government and this room in a citizen court was about the end of legislation, but so this year from the
