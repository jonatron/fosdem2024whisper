andro our own world. We are also focusing a few point of a lot of time to make some of them. So I'm a new one. I'm going to explain to what I'm going to come. So I should be talking about how much to go to this. I'm working, all of it's a little bit. So the big one of a huge idea. I probably need to understand how it works. I'm going to realize for our description. It's really a bit of a matter more important. I'm going to reach a bit of easier to read from our AI. Just am, is going to speak in a lot of questions at the morning. I interested. I am not, and if you're using the developer. No, you want to have some questions. Okay, I interested. And I will be happy to present the first one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 Hello everybody. It's the first speaker. 
 Hi, so we, everybody. Hello everyone. Thank you very much, I'm going to talk for this talk about how we're going to present, really going to the first talk about energy from what I am this I going to tell the question about this. I am already to talk. So, my next speaker is you, this talk was really been doing is. I'm going to the next talk. So we're going to talk about the first one of our first talk are the microphone. In some questions, and the first talk about the agenda about how you for the microphone. I'm going to be going to just wondering, if this talk about the room and your radar, but we are the last year because most people in the session is going to talk about the day. So I'm going to show one of what we're going to do. We are going to speak to talk about. We're running. So I think about the question that was just a good for an introduction to kind of the presentation for us and the microphone. So I'm going to Hi, I'm a bit about the CripPad. So, I am I'm going to actually wondering about here. My name. Okay, we just going to remember the presentation. So you guys have to come to talk about the slides. So I'm going to a little bit more details of CMA in WebPGA with the CCC. So I'm getting an first-cad. We've been dealing with M speaker was talking about a few years ago. And I'm going to you hear me on Code at the agenda of the back to let's talk was wondering if you have heard a lot of Openbernetes, which is a number of people, for quite a couple of other years. And the first one I'm going to say that I'm going to present the Go for this talk is a little bit of kids, which is the first is the idea of the DMA and the same thing that we are going to have the best to be able to start using the Jupyau-Fi talks, and how this is that we are the CNCF, we continue with OpenJDK and OSDB, so I'm going to talk about this year, which is actually. So it's basically, in the top of OpenAI-SIM 3G End and I'm going to make it's not happy to talk to get about the last steps. And I'm going to talk about the last slide. Then I'm going to have another year. And then we have to talk to talk about the JIDh, we have a few different I'm going to speak a few words that I can we've been presenting what is going to actually the first talk, this because I'm going to. So in the question, I'm going to be talking about the talk about Go routine, that we've seen it's going to present a lot of that we're going on them. And I'm going to talk to give you. And I'm going to start briefly about the first. And the CERN, the world, from the NSSmetry team that is, the future of the product. And this. And I'm going to say that is actually the open source journey, this is kind of the product for the fact that we have started that we start to talk to talk to build the software because we will have to work on the process a software and to make a long time I think about the main point of the source code because we're going to help us to just about the code that we've done. I thought in fact that we've got it was wondering that and so we had an end of what we had to talk to ask this is before it for questions. And I would be working on the first step to me let me to do. And we built my talk about our most of Gitay was to four years ago, okay, I'm going to talk to be talking to be one. I'm going to present I'm going to be wondering it's going to be a few years ago, I'm going to be talking about the reasons. And we're an open people who'm going to be asking about the work in the question. And so you know I'm going to this. And I've worked on the title of the CATS has been with Java code. And I talked about this project and He's kind of the right now, I'd like just like to bring from the first day, I've worked on the first of my, I'm not getting the Drupal Act. And I'm going to be saying, going to be building blocks. So I think, I'm going to tell you know, what's going to make you will be able to listen to look at this. Okay, let's the first one is. But in the world. I've got now I know the next one, who I'm going to park. Just having a little bit of the first one. It's going to be a moment, it. Let me. I'm going to introduce me here. So I'm a new talk about the most here. And I have to give me go out of the last year. I'm going to a talk about this talk about the next speaker. I'm going to be looking to give you're going to work on the day in the company, we'll show you guys, and I'm going to go to go to me and make this is going to each six months So, and thank you. I'm going to have a good. I've like if I'm going to talk, I'm going to have okay, well. And I'm going to explain. Okay, right. I'm going to the first. I'm going to show you about. Okay, okay, if you again, like, looking for the top of the question. Yeah, I'm going to find the next time. So, I'm going to see, I'm just wondering. I'm going to continue with the topic, and what was wondering, the first talk. Thanks everyone's our presentation of this is the time. Okay. I've got like I'm going to do I'm going to send the first question. So first slide, I'm going to show you to make me to be going to talk about the title to convince you a bit of the time, I'd like an interesting to think you can you have a question. I'm just writing a question. So this question is just about the different type of the question. And the screen. So I'm going to talk to try to skip the presentation. Yeah, as it's about it's going to actually going to make a language is that you a lot of the most important thing that I didn't happen in the microphone. And as far we have been experimenting with a lot of the part of things. And this kind of the talk to have this. So I'm going to talk is the other people are going to be a bit of people, and we want to have some people in the same problem to be a lot more important. Yeah, but we have on the world. We have this stuff to figure out the people're going to get from the whole backslz, and I think there. Yes, there's going to come back to the back and that. Okay, thank you very much. 
 Here is this is a project. So I'm a little bit, I'm going to talk to talk today. And today. 
 Very confusing. I'm going to make a little bit about the first going on the first one of Code. So we have a few months ago. I'm going to talk about Airflow with Scam? So if you today I'm going to take a few minutes. You can do the most of our talk about the presentation in the rest of the university at this talk was also also going to go to introduce the stand-time. And I am I. So, here I'm going to the project. Inventor, I'm going to be a very important talk about here, I'm really grateful to go about the last screenshot on. Okay, what we have here. I think here a good talk about the last year. And the first talk I'm in the whole talk that I'm not familiar with the C++ code before. And this's the first conference in the main hand bit of the top-end can I'm just see new community engineer under open data open source. And with the beginning to see. And I'm going to talk about that I'm going to be making a few years. This is this, but I'm going to set up to talk about that this? So what I'm just using this in the community and I've been going to show you, I'm going to show you, let me an open source project, I started and I'm going to talk about the next to start from my name, I'm going to see this presentation in the end-to-based architecture. I'm going to talk. And I'm going to talk to be in here. I'm going to we're going to talk to be going to talk about myself for the challenges that I'm going to start about my last year, I'm got a little bit of the talk about the Internet. No, I'm here, trying to talk I'm going to talk about the real-to-based perspective for questions. And I'm our talk about making it, and the first one of the web. Could you have to explain what we've got a little bit of the presentation. I've heard about Fostor. So I've got a lightning talk about the first number of the main year's why I'm going to be doing this year. We've got our talk about this in an engineer in this stuff and we'll bring a researcher at the work on the first thing. And I'm a very lucky situation. I am I'm Karen was a company I I'm going to the beginning of our project called OpenJDK to show you know, we've been using the NICS support it as a lot of Code. However, it was really a bit of different program. So we have been doing the community of the OpenJDK, we're trying to be able to build a tool that. We're trying to build a free software. So I'm going to talk about, I'm a place and I'm just am just going to start with a long time, but I'm going to talk about the Go. But we have we have the first one of how to talk about the last year, the first one of the whole use GCC LN release of the first release in the web code base at the CERN. And then at a project, but I'm going on three years ago. So, I'm going to talk about 10 years ago, and it's a hugeening project for the technical stuff to be a little bit more about a long, but the years ago. So I'm a little bit about the talk about the work. I'm interesting is the DERN is it's often made in the last year I'm afraid to start at the world. I'm just wondering how many years ago. It's super excited about the main big company engineer in the first and the software also had to open source software, so he was very small community. So at the last year and I said people who was wondering at the new people to be here today I've been talking about the community at the past year. I was the time, which was wondering. And basically, so I think we've been talking about here, right now in the thing. And sometimes we need to build room. So I'm going to talk about the first iteration of my first. So, because I'm a little bit of these, you know, you know, I think I'm not a real time. And I did we know, you know that because, actually, and if you know, I'm using a little bit of being done in. So I'm going to show me. And I'm the product, I'm going to talk is probably wondering, is my first of the big. It's a little bit of open source community of people can run a lot of things I made in the future. And then there's worth the project that code, well. And I was a lot of like that I was one of people are most people were a very fruitful talk to realize that I'm even as well, so the future in the world. And what it was the time a lot of course, I'm focusing on the future of the world. And I'm maintaining and I'm just wondering, the documentation, many people here. So I'm going with the way to do we'm just the question. So I'm going to go to be going to, I'm going to be going to be like, but I'm going to do, so, there's going to be enthusiastic about more and I'm just wondering where I'm not going to know, just wondering, they are getting doing a world, but in the way. If you're going to look at least, they can't all right. I'm going to get to start because you before you're sending people think about the people, right? Yeah. I'm going to start looking at that there and I'm going to leave and I'm going to do you're going to start doing this, and I'm going to keep working on this. I'm going to be going to be good. So I'm going to get there's going to start with this kind of our talk, right? I'm not going
