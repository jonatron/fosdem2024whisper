Okay, I'm going to our talk to next talk about the talk to coming for the time in there? My name is an end of being asked about the first talk about one of this, but I'm going to start for a little bit of the screen. I'm wondering. The talk about a little bit of a little bit about how it more about I'm going to join. This talk was talking about how this in the agenda. I am I'm going to say a talk and a question was going to have a two people here. I'm going to work in a little bit easier to help us when you. I don't know, because you know about a brief introduction to share it's going to the talk about E&A. It will talk was I think about these two years, the question was going to that they just a bit about how people on it was going to build the presentation since the open source company, but obviously, the data science and open sourced to ensure that. We can be a good to have in open source software. We have a lot of these people to support. We're focusing on the work that is open source and other ones that we have a lot of the whole world of people can change the community development of standards, then be happy to make a lot of the community. We have an open source community research teams, we have a lot of community, are very important to do not coming in the EU law, as we have our software and we need to have to understand their own market to work, what's maybe the fact that means that is that it has been a world, we're going to need to work with the one of the company, the copyright work in terms of the CRA has a problem that we have in the technical market that is how people who are there's going to have been to think that in the best way to have the first iteration of the next, we have also have funding and they have that we have this group who had many organizations at us in, you had this law, you know what can do we found with the society as developers and it's the world and they are just a lot of the IT. So there's the PLD was a great to all the standards are the CRA on the last six of the foundation. So I said that I think that's going to have had five years ago but I learned to have the EU as a European Commission and since the first person to be there were really aware of open source citizen or an issue that the UKists was like it was before and I was in the court and they've had to think we had asked at the rights that was a parliament who had taken a public market in that he was the big law. It had in the moment so I wasn't been doing that the same decision, but I can you know why they found out there were involved in the commission were a huge association that they were going to do was even when I really been part of German law and at going to be being asked this point in and I guess there was excited to do that the question. I've had this uh of the court as the PLD he were actually had had a question and he had another in their court. So I had some kind of the European Commission for us a huge concern that I would be something that this from the commission and I really and I would be so I found at the commission is they were all the world going to be a couple of the law directive is they've got to be quite well as going to make out in a place. And when you can point of the law and they went right now. The legal value of the GPL. And if you know that they should be the licenses is going to be so we've had to learn to turn on. And the law that it's just a huge. The past open source would even if you know that. So the act in 2022 for the law was the license is really a positive to be a second time has been completely different law to the source law for everybody has been actually a copyright infringement. It's kind of actually of a law and an argument we've been getting a copyright law, and the copyright holder. And then we also a copyright law is a directive that has made in copyright infringement for copyright and the GPL which is that will always used to be a court or the only one of value and it was really meant to be only only in the GPL that before but a GPL this public copyright policy and so much legal law is the court which is that the copyright is not in a in German law for national rights they were shown up the case in regulation gave that German court. And we were very early but it was actually also the US I haven't had as well had to be the software rights. So there was the energy law. And so I had was developed in these national law or I was no one of the licenses in open source law was like a clause in law to an legislation what is that they had to know. What happened if they came something that they had been heard about law and she says that has said, all the copyright law and they said where they were in the GPL the court holder and they didn't just get money in the license and they had a matter of the law we were. You know this person but just seen in the parliament, they were actually keep money so the law value that was defined law, or the copyright directive and we had to speak as well as a law that the market she was in the law to you had already have the money that they were the fact actually very clear on the GPL law. The law that I wrote an open the law could be in the copyright law. They may be a copyright value and really challenging and it's what they were in the copyright and be able to get pushed to the license. And so we had my private copyright holder to make sense that the nature though so yes no idea of law is that there was that the people were to it was last court or something that and they had said it was called, on one is open source law, super open source law. Which she joined to the open source work was needed software, who has heard I also about the copyright had their co of first law is very clear value of the GPL license law. But this way that meant about public law that's of open as there were some representative and what they have at the law, that people with this they are mostly the copyright law we've seen in the copyright law, and copyright law that the lawyers can do is the license the license in copyright law that value of law as these law as copyright space in that means that I think we just was they were the value. And that she had to be part of the GPL because there's what he was that we found out of the copyright public GPL. This is that they were, they actually went into the reason not two thought at least you were effectively defined a law. He's the copyright in the value of the terms of the fact that you can do has to be the EU license, which means that the copyright in the impact that a license violation that that it will actually have known law that the license has been done in the global value that they are a copyright clause were important and a copyright has had enough decision is to exist as forecast of funding. So the first to be adapted a court could not that license law had been made that they're not a copyright license that the law at that in law, but they had to just it was not in time, but they've got to see a German law also that was the money, the copyright reason for the copyright law because they were not just and the she had a license, well but they thought it had a copyright I think they heard with the copyright act of value for the copyright was just was just because two copyright infringement said, they got into that money there was a law and law that no idea of value of the policy and so they were actually just to the law. And they said that they were a license license could actually actually don't do it. The value was invented the GPL copyright act we want to work, but they can be another copyright was a copyright holder and so the value that I was going to be a really very great law that do. And they were a license in that she would expect it had to be an open license was a copyright of the license for the copyright. The law, is to about the German copyright infringement history of law that they had like their rights has had not very nice this same value to become copyright license GPL and then they are at it to say the copyright. And they don't, they were a copyright value in law that TPM was the law. And they were the licensee failed the law for copyright law legal violation is also if the politics had the CRA. The value that's, well were nothing to the copyright mean that the law was the law, yes, as nobody got the license has exactly to't always to be open license value in the mandatory rights thing to copyright fact of value the decision is at they'd at that's a directive. And they are most of the world, it was a copyright of the GPL license is the law, we have at the injunction. And it was the market, looking into copyright clause out to model that was not, right law, the copyright law that was a copyright value of the copyright does. They were an GPL because of GPL value of any copyright copyright laws that I think it actually just to it was for the court liability and were in copyright license. But so I said, we have heard that was an activist law software but we were at 20% and then one, we had like the law was doing was not just done in many women was a copyright policy. And it was trying to what I thought this is that I think there was like even three policy. It's a law rights in the fact that I didn't understand the copyright think that people that that policy to be is an copyright directive was just because we have uh were going to do on that came into be, like I was a value of the beginning of the public law, like it was you know, uh, well, just a law also person were not GPL that but they decided to be in copyright holder. And that they also he also have been got to happen, we've got the fact that I'm just had, we said that they have the law and they were just going to do a really do not just think I've got any consequences that everybody's happening first half years. And you had a copyright so let's really heard just really thought, too often at Open uh, okay, um, the end the standard law. He had to have said, you could use and he would like copyright and they were very good to access sector. And but it was really, like google was, well a legal was just not well because you know, I was we were involved who said we know, it was, like they were using the end of the licenses and then she was a copyright person who had in. He were still heard in their law before they were I was not even understood that of the software as a GPL license license license would be ideal and they were published at least they have been there were a copyright infringement. So of a copyright of it was so you know, and you can be done in the idea and what I was that I wasn't know that people and I really not trust that just mentioned that. It was in the idea was that we needed a license and the copyright who wanted to know about copyright holder was very, and all know that to not a copyright saying that was something that was actually had nothing as a copyright would. There was actually it was that actually more important to these only had. And so I started to follow the policy was clearly so much better and I remember the value that we had heard he had a copyright value of this, but then could be in the software to be considered by the license becomes the GPL was just be the law that kind of the AI value of a national license and that they have heard of a law that people, the GPL that he didn't get the problem that they've was about at thought anyone could not felt that's very bad license. It would be a value of the law. So that was the license we came from the license, all right? Because I wrote a user, right? I say there was happy to the GPL law as well was exactly when I think that I was the person are the law, I was a law and he didn't to understand it was initially just able to the GPL was also a law, but they were at the violation. The GPL law that this law in law and the law that's the GPL and had their law thought that something you said I said, then one space were a very important law of laws and the directive it would be a copyright to be much more harder in copyright value the law. And that they had a GPL doesn't do free law that the law, the value to be also would you have the law itself. And that because it's basically's being moved to the public license has just has an to work in the law that bad law in law, long of policy is that that it could be, but you know, but you could be
