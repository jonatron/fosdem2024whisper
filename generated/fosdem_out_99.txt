 My name is a few more things. I am not sure that they're doing it. I'm going to be able to do it. Because I would ask me and how to throw it might be allowed to do it with the code or how would be quite work with the best and how we do we want to do all those features are the LLMs in other tools and we are not for us to think about these challenges. We have to do it. We've ever been about what we want, we have to make some discussion. So let's say so many people know about. So we've been talking about it, if we're thinking about about the best step we've seen most more questions, our questions? So this is a little more we're going to start with a new representation of to have a way to go to be a lot of great question. I'm going to be so. So this question is how can we'll see if I'm so quickly from the question. I'm going to be talking about this talk. This is the main thing I'm going to talk to be one. The question is that I'm going to talk about and I'm going to ask in I'm going to think that I'm going to be going to introduce you to introduce you. So I mentioned it's going to talk a way this talk about DMA. I'm going to be able to talk about my question. Thank you guys. Thank you for your question. 
 Okay. I think we have time thank you very much. Thank you very much. I'm a good. 
 So I'm a little bit of our talk in the main talk we have the end of the next year. So, we talk currently now. So I've heard about this talk was a little bit of our talk really interesting. Good afternoon. I'm the first talk about how do that we have a lot about how we have been looking at another talk about that we've been doing our first step. The first question is going to introduce I'm going on and your first. I'm going to talk about the talks, I'll talk. Let's going to be excited about what I'm going to talk about using something about getting the energy the talk about the most of the world. I'm talking about the first office is a huge things I'm going to come from four milliseconds. I'm going to give you about how to get in a good question. Maybe I'm a real talk on this talk about the data, right now the open source software and I'm going to this one. I am not going to be an open source community in the important. I'm going to talk about. I'm wondering what we've been talking about the CRA. He has a little bit of the social life at the first time at a topic. But I'm a little bit of the world. So I'm going to start from the PLD because I'm going on an first last four years ago. I'm just like in the slides for Daniel and the first one of the women. And so there's a slide. So I'm going to have talked about the developer, so I'm going to speak, depending on the first one of this way to start from the future for the future. And I'm supposed to have to do some time and from the topic. And I'm never thought, I am going to show you could I am just wanted to be sure that at the future for the morning doing this, but I'm like for the time. And so much, I'm glad to present me. And I'm working on that I'm just wondering a bit the discussion. And I'm running. And the best thing in the point, in the time I'm not wondering that I'm going to the moment when I'm going to start the meeting room. So I'm talking about how I'm showing the audience, I'm going to run the slide, I'm going to talk about the open source code in the next year a time I'm going to be wondering for the world, and I'm going to be present again. I'm going to present you for today. And I'm the PLA and I'm going to start going to come here, we were my talk about one is going to present the web UI. But I'm going to talk. I want to, I'm going to introduce us. And if I'm going to introduce me to present to talk about the first one of the talk about the end of the examples of the first idea of an X&A. And I'm going to be told me about the first talk is going to getting into the first time. And I'm going to ask. And now I'm gonna be wondering, no idea to talk about next year, I was getting questions. We're going to be going to look some of people who have in which is great. And I just to figure out and what we have was to go on these things like and they're going to start to work on our slides. And I think about a bit more people on this. And this project, if you know. And I'm going to that's like I'm just wondering, I guess you very happy it. And we have to mention some. But this talk. So I'm going to look. I'm going to be talking about it's going to talk, I'm going to ask at this one of mine that I'm going to a bit. I'm wondering about it.
