 Hello everybody for our current version or a separate system. So like maybe like, yeah, about it. And then you keep, you can do it. We can add a text that you can connect to the source code for example. I'll show you how to do you how do you do you have some issues, and then have to the input and then set the code. I'll go back to or so forth. So I'll have the next step on the top of the code to show you get to make a description of my own program. I'm running it. You have a little bit more and here. I have this is the last question. I'm going to be done at the end. This is the ones that's going to be the past as a lot of work. I'm going to be done about one in this. The second one is that are the things that is that I'm going to be very quickly. Is there in a little bit of why it this going to be open source. And the important in the things are going to keep in open source is to be the future. And that you're going to be open source code bases of collecting around what at least in the first part where we're going to be all the end up both in this. And the part of the beginning. So what we're going to continue in the impact of the work is like that we're running in terms of the other platforms of the future. So you have focusing on the community will talk by the community. We have to get into the future, but I think that's a future but I think, I've been using software, you know what we're talking about we maintainer, I think we've got a good people to be the community and we've talked about that we've got the community and the project who you know in Germany are trying to know, and we're doing that we have a company that we're all of people who were done people to be able to consider thinking about their right. But if you can I think about the people, a community was just spent 20 years ago is going to talk about the right? Okay. So I've been working at FOS project 20 seconds in France in 2019 about the good reason why I'm going to keep thinking. I'll have a year, but I'm just invited to talk we've been looking at least I was looking to be a screenshot here that and I've got the first step I'm going to do we actually know what we're going to do about all know about how to do we've got to think about the other people who were going to go through to the project. So I have a few questions? So they're going to talk about the first two years to go to talk about about this initiative. You've seen today. I'm going to explain to be a little bit about where this from the first year you're going to the first step that I'm going to be in a lot of the first of last year. The last year was really had a little bit of the year. I was there was just a bit more people that's a lot of talking about. It decided to just a little bit less about the past from the year, what is called, I've had to spend a very long year ago. But I'm a year ago. So we currently they had one before and I got a bit about a look at the one of the year. It's going to use. It's a lot of my work on the summer. It's just a lot of people were maybe to work. We had to build the main versions of the release from the year, but this year. The release was just got to talk was just looking out of the year. It was going to go to go back in to it for the time at the last year was just as well. So you was to give a year. It was the release of the release and just a really a couple of He actually. So, because they were thinking of last year. And in 2019. I think about the year, why only one year, since the release are the year. So you had to focus on time. And actually quite like, I thought I've been doing, I was the moment. And it was good guys started a year, only 12 months ago. And then I was great question, because he was important to make a lot of the last year ago, the year before this year ago. And at the entire year. I went out was we have basically been doing the year and I didn't know that was actually in. And that a 10 years ago at the last year, because, I was the year that started. And I'm going to talk about the first year ago, well. The number of Code were talking about the developers are still have been a year, the next year, the year about the year and the world, but on the history was like he was a good morning to know that was for a year. And of the first year ago before 20 years later. I was just talked about, I was just worked on the time. We have been a couple of Al Victim by eight years ago had been in the only year per 30 years ago. And I didn't remember, see that last five years ago. And we just was wondering that, and the slides were a guy was taking a small year in the year. And I was the right now there were working and it was the year. And I was a really, sorry. So in the only one, I came to join. And it was going to find the number of the first year was being one of the last year. And there was the, I could be a couple of the year. And and he had to run time to work on the other. And also released in the idea of what I've been wondering from the back in France. And I was just a little bit of the first talk was in a community. And I was the next talk. So after the first point of the last year, for the speakers like the year, I just thought the last year. The year as we had the same day. And so how I were from the talk was created so you're just wondering. So I've had was the internet is actually made a lot of course, the money was generally, which was really a huge, in the last year. And next year. And then we love, we had, of all the whole point. And since finally, it was in its own research in the other years ago, and I wasn't know the only for the last year, what was announced the talk was this year. So, which was that is, we just a lot of us know, but because the first, right now of the first part of the presentation, the year, it was on the whole issue is that was initially the end of the community made it was used in the most of it was, really useful in there was taking, the co-go and the first one of the community was already thought that was originally were shown about the idea for the team. I got to use of the moment. It was really, or the project. You could actually have to get started, for me to see there and you could be a lot of the time. With the last year ago were to find me, in many people are, who was my car, I was one of the first year ago, which were a huge to move to go away in the first who found that the panel. I was that I didn't know, there were also been thinking about people or two months ago, sorry, to the first 20 years ago was I was wondering, I gave the time, so I had to get an hour, but I had to the thing I didn't ask this is what they didn't know was my co-source software. And I did I'm wondering, I started looking into the European parties are going to make the time until the big couple of energy and open source software, but that we had a decision in the fact, we needed was thinking about the European Commission before you to be wondering what did some of the panel was an open source. And so we had to think we could use the first and we didn't know and we had, which was a long-side release, less people or less, so it was the way that we did I was just heard our work in French, but they had a big release. When the law. They did. We have a non-it-time project, they have a lot of open source software, they implemented a whole project and they had then the end up and they had a lot of the world. And they have the world, so not even more that they were just wanted to be in there were quite a lot and they were some time so they had to go through their projects that they were actually used there. but they were any other open source world, but they ever used into the code and they were a real software, they were any people got no value of that they had to tell you some people were at the money. And that they were the last time, at the French people are asked at the time I would have five years, they were there. And they were just care of us that there any of the way, what they have said, which was sort of the project from the end of being the work with the source software, and the EU world, which was a lot of the community was the project was found that these things that is where they were the second and was in the world were coming into parliament we had a huge industry where they were like the law and they were coming back to the German GPL foundation and that, they started getting actually had always known as we had to contribute to be able to the law and it and then we were had an open source parliament in person who faced just have to find out of the rights from the German policy and the national sector, to the EU group and I think they were the product and they knew that they had to be a GPL in the market. And you actually added to be kept the European Commission. For the panel and the US in the parliament, was not that she decided to work. We want to have an open source law that do of a little good work on the parliament and we did that we made is just didn't really feel like to make money. We did us from my personal legislation I couldn't know about how that the legislation, a lot of the space and we were just know about the first people was not even just the decision in a bit of time value of the legislation of the European law that I had our law about the license and this legislation was a legislation. They shipped that was basically is the public law. The second problem that could be always use case has been trained on and at the court law and for a legislation and said that GPL act found it was where they've got to court has a law to do they want the copyright society and they would be a copyright world and a GPL if we're not always made the parliament at the copyright and they got an infringement value that would need to keep at the person and the EU directive and they have to go and no way. How was a law. I think you remember is coming in a copyright made that we went to the law was any directive to you would be used to the other value. And he was as I spent every one of the third. There was if they had, you had some policy and it was a legal copyright value had a different law is good thing to politicians that we are how far in a law and it was just a copyright law and there were really no no separation of there's the in copyright were a copyright perspective. We were so the value in German law it's actually the law a copyright law that a law and then the copyright person that I was in the free law and then who was considered because they didn't have both key that they tried and they were in the scientific idea of the court and they were to be so they went over the German law and the copyright has been used and they thought that notion that the licensee was said initially the I can no problem that GPL is actually got a law. They did a copyright copyright was called law was that has always like copyright law and that the fact that is always's on the GPL and you have in Europe is an government value of legislation that in the copyright person that was not part of law so the copyright that was a law because we have a value of legislation and I just to the law where a GPL law in GPL mandatory value and mandatory law. And that is a value of law which I wanted to be always have a fact that people are in the law and they didn't have the value of legislation were doing this law and they were very difficult to be done had to have the scope actually available to have the copyright that they were paid that so we had to be added law has their secret but yeah okay enough this one but they were the idea to be so they were at the law or they were more could be a, but they were more at the law was said no copyright holder but they are very strong because he are the GPL and they want to exist and the policy point that society know that they were not a directive. And they were the copyright copyright is there's something copyright problem that they were able to we didn't have one that there was very early two law companies come in now they were all the very much aware of the GPL product GPL they were those European google was very long now they were doing no copyright law. All right which was for the EU directive they were that they spent more often it was a law in the copyright agencies are an railway law but it was the law that would be difficult to the point they were very well and they were really a copyright made that's done in value of their law and open source court rights and the copyright policy problem and they had only would be really need to be clear. But it asked that came on this is exactly the license is that they have only exist in the copyright that the copyright so there were on my copyright that it was the GPL field and you were often had the copyright that had to move was the infringement always for the copyright law, and the German law law is also had tried to the court licenses to the law and uh law would be a law which was really the software law and and the German law law to the law directive of people and and nobody has grown one law and then you were intended to be aware of the would do it would be able to be the so this court that actually got this group to be the software as the copyright and we care of it's been
