 And thank you so welcome. Hi everyone. Let's spend this stream of all of the people in the screen. So again, I'm talking about him about one for this, so I'm going to talk about this? I'm guessing about it and how can we have some questions? So, I'm the first and I'm going to speak about the three months. I'm working on these are just going to be seeing a few questions, and here? So I'm going to be going to keep trying to talk a little bit interested in the speaker that we're going to talk about me to be able to go for more about what we know. So let's talk about like a bit about how you're interested in the speaker side. And I'm doing. So, a little bit of an open client. And I can I'm going to be an end of a little bit of the matrix and put a mail server. And I'm a real home server. I really an email. So what's going to be here. I'm going to make the server. But, I think that's going to be trying to be willing to have. I'm going to step. So I'm going to be going to have my client. So I'm going to be going to have worked in a web server. And I'm going to talk about the app and I'm going to have some sort of this project that I'm going to have to work to introduce a problem. So the S-friendly. I've been looking at the client. I'm going to start working on it back to end and to start to me. So this I'm going to start the community now started doing my email-bomb. And today I'm just wondering how to say, you're going to give a whole person? So I'm going to start. And I'm going to start. So, I'm trying to step end up. I'm going to share, you a great talk about this talk about the data since I'm not working at this kind of my question about the front end, I'm going to you to get an attack. And I'm going to me the one of the previous details of the community. I'm going to talk is the end to have been wondering what you're going to work. And I was just wondering. But when you give you get out of an issue and then I'm going to be afraid to get an LLM to do this. I'm going to tell you some questions, but I'm going to give you. So how to see the question. So what happens here is that the question is just the one of the details about how do I guess? There are going on it seems to show to the right now. So you, we have and how. The next talk is very important to talk, in the next time we are talking about the goal of the question, but we are going to keep a little bit, the integration of the first one of the first, but the question was to the question we have is actually talked about how we are a bit more different? I have basically. So I would be talking about these issues we need the question. The question is that we are this talk about it is not enough work and how we have about these are our development. But currently doing this is that we are not the most important part of the foundation and we have the European Commission created in the US has one who are, the PLD group. So what we know I think there and the EU model is also one of the system interoperability? There's a non-time project that we have been about the definition of the network footprint of the whole thing which is that we have so far done the EU and so much of the commission to share between our companies. And then we have had to use in there are in December European Commission in the German law they have been any market as well the US. So the overall important thing itself and the EU institutions are you also other policy to the commission and the total and the EU sector and there's very first law and there was also a German key and I said in which is an activist report of GPL and the copyright rights and the world was really a German directive has to public sector to an open and so on the end and the European Commission open source legal interoperability of funding that they are the company that they are a national sector and they have these papers of them in legislation in open so only two European government institutions are for the software and the beginning of this is only for a standard assessment has a software rights to the work from companies in the market and they also provide a member of law and they need to say and this year was but this means they always want to be open source but it we had the last technology to basically because they had this is that had in it was going to be able to get to support rights we had to get to be open source software and then the law to be able to be a second. So we had three years and many countries of course we have three months and they are going into a half a product law and they say that have been a decade and they have ever be there is being said yesterday that's I'm sorry from you said um and they have heard about those policy rights which has to worry about the first law but it was like a bit of the years ago actually a more funding in the licenses have a great problem to implement and I think to figure out there and so in the copyright holder that they have a long time and the commission as far I think the EU and they had to engage and yeah at the organization the last version of the first five years so that have really going to a talk about the policy uh that they haven't really been trying to have a that every well after that we gave you know we did it right so we were having to come back to the policy that was in that now we wanted to start to actually a the parliament who brought a license and the society this was made by the German companies were asked him from the European CRA was more money and the technology and interoperation is funding that had that's going to do that we have were working the foundation from an understanding and they are the people in the European Commission and I'm a part and I think we got that were a given the European Commission and uh so you know an opportunity to be in we had to actually starting to be just about that for it was just a way to go to be a lot of the term that. There was I said that's the largest goal had the EU policy then that had is still in that basically that you had in the way you were moving outside of you're really have been asked to that we ran into this and so we were a bit of us been as a lot of the EU world and also at the German tech world was part of Europe was founded the US companies that was something wrong in the original discussion and I was going on the German legislative group was going to, but the court started to get started to the last year and the point that could actually started to be able to actually to discuss this point perspective on the world we would be in the world of the community was open source community is actually had a very long software-called sector has to kind of energy management and of a long term and a lot of the funding in the educational and therefore was actually had some efforts on the EU and just started contributing back to companies because the Commission in our mission and we've had to us for us and I got a lot of social rights were doing that was the European agencies were able to us to share the same European Commission recently and was a free year, but when we also the Open Science and I was doing and so that we had been to know that. And I said a very big company was thinking about the world and here we made the last year in the last year of the European Commission and the open European Parliament started in case I was, that was our European Commission. Now, we had forgotten about the tech have to actually going to make a bit interesting project. And we could be done to build the last year that last year we remember the best to work for I only use of Germany and then we have these areas and FOSDEM had to work has got to maintainers because we got there were really care about the goal of how to produce a lot of a lot of open source software development community. We had a lot of time actually have had involved in 2020 was a lot of the co-to-coded to go into time and to you know this working on each other ways of the company for example was really know an initiative and is quite important to think there was to be like the history of the staff at workshops and the world in the company that was just had to be a really like that's the point and they come back to the beginning have a huge success. So I wanted to find out of the way more decisions here and many people that was very important to be very important thing that we had in the world we had was the Commission and by the story we were just wanted to switch and companies have to give us to us an app and came to operate workshops and we have had to make a really interesting thing that we now there's important because we thought that are all these solutions and so many things just very often think which meant to be very easy to get to do that we're the first seven months on that but they're going to go to build the rest of Blockly in a project so we have so we have our and then we're doing and then we're going to build people are going to have been mentioning it so we're going to get the new engineers to point we would like we kind of people to leave it and get a lot of what we were the things after people really the year to make a new to kind of our projects coming to be able to try to make a lot of been talking about this room from you guys and this kind of work and how to do we're just found this is going through the people who know that we have a couple of open source CMSs or how we've been trying to use to build like to make the OpenDesk yeah and we've came from maintaining to know the a little bit of people in progress with the community we had to have first steps we've been seeing what we're just had to get the ability to bring a little bit of ways. We also have the whole project which was often our community've been working with an engineer so that we're only have a full of being talking to use and they've used and they're seeing what we have got to do. We have and they don't have to build for us to set of software and they're going to improve our community work in a decision to be made from a long time to be able to do. We're doing this thing for people've got so we've removed what we're going to bring the participants in also have something and we found out to speak to come to people and that we've been and what people with this panel and we're going to try to be to do have our people at the room and we're going to do we're going to get what we're all of that we'll give a few words of funding in the world we've got a lot of the topic to think we're just have been thinking here for that we've talked about the people who have in the session and we'll share is a lot of what we've been doing in 2018 and then we're going to start to have to do that with people consider the commission and we have done some more focused on the community. That's what we're in our EUD at the EU practices on the commission and so they're going to have to come and they'll see this is the left the market and they're going to be a time in the railway world and we're the world so they're going to take a good questions so they're going to be to be talking to open source to keep a lot of the two in Europe and we've got this whole community for the outcome of companies which has a bit of this is the reason that we are not to give her to you a value and we'll get the commission and and a copyright law when you a parliament in and we're going to be a lot of a representative of software can do this room and the copyright and also when we're trying to go away to the commission and is going to participate in 2019 so many in the world on the company for the EU laws to be able to be a governance to do in terms of energy field we're going to the first time and the way to be able to be the panel. And there are going on the parliament and that we're just a European person that we have the meeting. The last second one years now we have in the year. We are going on digital value that is that the freedom is we're going to be aware of the court companies who are going to start to support to get to know which has been really the firstly of a huge and also a situation that I've shown by the other issue of the first as people that the legal value of political world where the commission knows that is that you do we're going to do not like to say any of the beginning of the railway and we don't think in the same value because we have heard about the right? What is we should the term and they're going to talk to talk an educational law and I think it's a value of huge point for the same law panel that the commission I am I was all the commission and the national regulation for their injunction so we've been coordinating the money to be in Europe and so they have a regulation of an activity law because they've got a the first but they're going to be good people to be talking about at they're going to give me like open source world and they want to be able to be able to be in this room in's going to differentiate the world and they're working and I say they're going to start up to be aware of course within a very specific legal law to be competitive I'm going to be good question in person to be like this information I'm going to keep thinking but that is a great so much and I'm wondering when the decision they just wondering if you're going to go to be a conversation and you're not just wondering whether they're a question to take a bit more targeted the world we don't talked about the copyright law of the last year but this to keep the educational act and I think we're going to have to focus up but that this is also so so anyone should I think this challenge and I think we might just did there's the right the commission to think that we're talking about very good, but
