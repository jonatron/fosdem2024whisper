 Hello, do a presentation. And if you want to read the event loop, a profile, you're just a block in the initial challenge to generate the previous one. And then you to start the stream, that's what it's a really, with this example. And finally, you're doing this. So I just wanted to go with a very big name that using it's a graph to show you a little bit more about V86. And then we start. And you can also use that we have a lot of work. And in this is on a lot of extensions, there's a lot of ways to compile the version. You can start with this. You can run. You can see the actual libraries in the runtime. And in an example there's a command line that we have. And there's a runtime. You can see here, it's an example. And most can see that we have a log. So you can see how does the future. But I have to get the thing I are going to talk about. Why do we've got, because you get the main page? I'm going to start at the bottom and you can see. You have to see this part of it's the first number of the... And then you can see today. So this, this is almost 10 years. So the other one of the goal, four and that is that's there's the main one that it's the world. So well, the first thing is a thing that the main thread is right side, it's very important to be nice thing. And most of course I'm going to do I'm here before, right now. I'm going to start from the demo, the end of the first one thing. That's going to I'm going to copy of the end of the code, I'll show you first point. So I might get using that I'm going to a lot of my demo. I'm going to do. This one of how it. I'm working on my code. I'm going to start learning description of the documentation on this is the next one there was we've seen why I'm going to build this new, and I'm going to think it. I'm going to be in a bit of my game into the next. But I'm doing this is a lot of a little thing about that I'm going to come in which is going to start the end source. I'm going to be curious about. I'm just wondering, okay, I'm going to start by the stand-da, I was going to keep not going to talk about my other people as well last year. The things we've been doing that it's not seen. And I'm just wondering, I'm going to say the first one of the first step of the first to go out there. And I'm just wondering. Let's what I'm going to make it with this thing. I'm going to tell I'm going to put it. And I'm going to see the text, I'm going to be seeing the beginning in the right now I'm going to show you to talk a little bit of the middle and I'm going to talk about six minutes. I'm going to start a little bit about it is what I'm going to look at the whole year I'm going to be starting in the one of the slide, right to talk to be, but I'm getting the main point at my first half here, the time, but I'm happy to be about this on my laptop. The left and I'm going to say, we're talking about that. And I'm going to talk about the back on the next point. I'm going to think I'm wondering, but I'm thinking about, I'm talking about the slide, I'm going to explain my next are a little bit about the audience. I'm just wondering about the guy. When you here. So this is about. What happened in the audience. I'm going to start a project. Here is the deaf room to be going to talk to speak. I'm wondering because I'm thinking, and what you see. And I'm not going to talk we'll have before, the next up at the beginning, so much time, thank you. I'm going to talk about the, I'm going to present you. So, I'm going to be looking on. I'm going to talk going to the panel. I want to talk about the D was the audience, I'm going to talk to have the first time. I could, well. I'm going to talk about the presentation. I'm just wondering if I'm looking at it. So my talk is me. I'm presenting the video first point of the Fupy, when I was just wondering. I'm going to talk about how about the end we have to do you're just introduce an audience for the next talk. Thanks everyone. Okay, what I'm showing an open hardware, I'm sure that I'm going to present here in the rest of the microphone. The question. So I'm thinking about the next one of the audience. And I'm going to give you to start my talk to give you a little bit. So I'm not yours to be welcome to the open source developer from the... I'm going to answer is a microphone.
