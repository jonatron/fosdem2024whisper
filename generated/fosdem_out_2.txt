 Chris everyone's talk about in the MDNF? It's about our EU and the last year and the European Commission for the European Commission, but the government and for the largest organizations is digital open source, but we are also to do the European institutions of the big practices in the whole and the developers. So I was as the European organizations can do one of the EU workshops to open standards to do and I think that is that was the institutions was an last year, a year old EU Association also very long was on the world. A lot of society happened in 2018 we have a lot of weeks today and we can talk to do that have a year, which were also realized that we were having a bit of a lot of electricity and we had to use a lot of discussion that used to do that we are actually the world, many other people got like a lot of people can do as the idea to think about the world. We have a lot of other years at the end of like that we are seeing the world at that the community and they were some point in the context that we have to be said, but that's the OSPOS and in Germany who are a lot of people that has been participating in the EU government projects that I said. And the EU. And last year, the second one of course, but very important to be the world there is that's like we are some of open source group and we currently speaking of the European negotiations and so many open source community can think we're talking about two years ago, two years ago to the EU and therefore where we are the goal of the same ideas from the European Commission, which also a law and then half the IT in which is funding was only because they were also very clear that a non-lth became a project is only the last year ago we've been really interesting of having to set of the German law back to be in September. And we have this year, which means that was the end of copyright law we started this idea was able to achieve I'm just the licensee was from a law at the GPL source world and by the end of the end of the GPL law law and was. And it was a law yesterday and a law of law that they are the CRA and they haven't give a civil Commission in the market that industry and the court in the law was essentially the directive because that it was an regulation of public sector was used to German injunction can definitely a panel on 2022 by the copyright and the future with the law, they also is digital rights and they were shown to know really saw this as well to be able to say and and and as long as long as Teng that the only needs to have been shown in the public sector at the EU law, and government law. And the software in the directive of the key in the course they started in the European federal federal law law law in copyright as long as well if they did that they did not a copyright law could be known software and they can be paid to be clear to a big court and to be a pivotal value to the copyright in the money. And they'd at the commission in order to be able to have no always one second law law to do that they're not in the law. And the license at law and something that they know, and of course it's the German law because of a commission are a law and I have funding for IT as well. So those value of the GPL sector, if it's how they have a law were in this mandatory law directive for that they've heard to make their legislation agencies by google government that this law economy in Brussels is what the second. So they're already had as I did well as a copyright in the law that on the first copyright legislation is because that the copyright law is the law there and mandatory in practice, the German court law that I think that they actually was the law that were not a law in the standard was the copyright law and has been asked earlier first law of the law by the law. And so that was also in the law to what an important if in London is still did those gate law was more open were to keep this US regulation and I got asked this mandatory rights. And then I was wondering what we had been to only wanted to work well I have the civil fact that the law person here that was that was like for a GPL law that we've been using copyright in standards that was that actually a law and German law because the sense. And then the law that you had four law in the commission is going to be interesting and a copyright law in our open law saying to become copyright standards. And in the only because they had time they have and the copyright enforcement in the law and the German law as the law this clause has was the law that it was there was a law. And just at the act of the most first law that that he just the first clear happens in that we had to talk about the way to do not just felt even have a copyright law that the German law and he tried to the law, we've been a regulation of decision of the law and we will be saying we were looking for that they were changing that were very beginning that we just do they were, so which was not enough to just did they were here at the law that and they did was, we could be quite important but the act a value, which was that they were aware of the law was really a copyright said, it's important policy was actually allowed to the first the liability that was, they had that they were to put an open key funding that, which just last of the way I was in the law and had to make a GPL law, but they started a number which was saying these legislation should be done in the copyright and they have to find only and they did what was a law was only would be had to be a first one that nothing to apply in the court that the history and they felt that was asked the key. And then politicians were asking a copyright holder to the law was the license who was, the copyright and then they had just heard the law back, we had to get brought into that that like a copyright for copyright thought they would also had exactly very, but they weren't know on the courts in open source law because and then they've got the reason for people who said it was not in the software industry. But that they've just wouldn't just they could've had to do not always the one so they knew that they were not only no matter the GPL copyright policy law. And it was open source this policy of the GPL is that they're a she said that you know that their law, you know if they had time that have were they haven't really been wondering they said, they were the decision the copyright copyright right license keys didn't seen actually really did I was kind of because they have I haven't not really had any copyright that google laws said that it was meant to the license and GPL and they had for the first sort of the law and copyright value that they had to be the um at least, but I would be there were a decision to the copyright principle and you know and get an GPL but they're a copyright in the uh law and they could always really get this law that he's was in, this was about the license that was something was part of copyright value on the license and the software. And it is this actually pretty clear and they was the software directive because they've made and they actually is very clearly their GPL law law that the copyright infringement had at the decision because they had made in that they had the first technology and they said a copyright law clause is the copyright is only I see at the copyright could be changed but then they were so they cannot a license clear license and they can't know no copyright they've said as copyright law. They're not in German outcome I think that they're all of the licensee holder was pretty far as well to could have a copyright as they thought that they did not to the copyright didn't this interoperability decision was that they have been been quite a copyright and that they didn't add a copyright rights in as that only so I was just wanted to open license copyright license rights and it was really a copyright. I work was like was a really that says that you could be possible no money in the infringement now only been that they were the rights open license is that they could still that you could be in the license. And that the question was, but that we didn't work in the license it's it was, no and they didn't have so you still there's really in the GPL decided that the market knew, but nobody was a part of copyright and he's a GPL is the copyright was kind of the license that we're a license had I had that public law and they can do not saying there has a only not actually work because I didn't tell do that I could be no, but I had some license and so right in Blockly that I think they did just remember we see the commission. And you had to know that responded they were like the copyright value of people actually found as a copyright law and they were because they actually's copyright and they were in the GPL that they were like they had would be the license law. They are allowed to just kind of had some copyright so they were in they knew there was the market and they were a copyright and they were the directive so they had no copyright keys in last six weeks in the license source law, although they did we were. And they don't only court so it has been a moment on the whole law. And it was not a policy. But there was just talked about law of a copyright law for a copyright is the law the right because nobody was just they were in the, or this was just for for me until they were being found something that people that had that was quite, you could be more and would say no access and you want to the act as or license and you could be the technology. And if you know that we could be able to be very cheap and they had some license's really useful to be able to be this the GPL and they found out for what's of it is always the source and they didn't really really great I was a license policy. I could be any people but they got a sense they could be hoping that, this stuff so many software was a new decision that was kind of the copyright, but they were actually see still that they faced a chance to know how the copyright was even more clear good chance to make that they are you know the time when I had ever to do they had paid in the only because they were saying that was in the law. But that to worry that said a mistake because you can not want to get into open source license of the fact that you know how the person that you know they were putting away think they've tried to know more agreement because they want to do it out that they're all of the organizations at those as I think that the license there were the market because they do it was just got a law and the lawyers, we have this market license's useful for EU agencies and we have been just saying that they as a copyright to share that the licensee but that that the decision wanted to open source, what they're trying to guess that somebody about those licenses that would be a way, what they did we could be that is going to do? So I didn't know that the same, like, no. And then I'm always get that it, the GPL is basically has been about a mistake for the copyright of the law said as digital law and they're just looking at the first time and we just said, and a thing that was like that, like this's the methodology that I wanted to go ahead and we're very important to share was I think there are sort of projects that the third question might be the opposite of risk so I think there is that open source world that the definition and a big idea is that we like that you know what we're looking to give down and then we're focusing of like far as you're just a technical impact of the copyright rights agencies that the ones that we're the community and aware of the license and regulation and could be there's where they're in a value of a cost of open source that open source copyright law at free term. But we've seen that they're just said too important ones that they have been the first five and potentially need good enough as on the trademark. And they saw that I think it was not the code that they're going to find that we're going to put in the panel and if they're going on and they're not the last year and they could be in the world. And I can do it. They wanted to mean a place or they're starting from the first I thought about the audience, there are going to be the product to come in a good question. So we're going an expert group of the nature of the government and this. I think about the state of the copyright law and the product in legislation that was the CRA was a notion that the world was, we don't know what they can they're not have been the years right person would like the GPL way to have a time for the challenge to be, right we're doing is one. And you know what the companies, we know if you know is just don't have the issue that the license into the law of the energy and they have to that they have the moment if they are they're saying that they know the market in the value. Like it's a problem that you're no one and they're going to look at least said that point out of a clear. So that they are the software. So good idea of those decisions are a bit often if they wanted to really sure they have a certain keys or they don't have a copyright policy but they are not going on a directive. They're willing to decide to realize that they're going to get a license out to get much this and they're not had the people who made somebody just wanted to worry about it or you know that we think that so they're looking through what we're trying to get to take into and get like as well. And if it's kind of a really want to be able to produce a copyright and then they're going to tell us to open source and they go into a big software in and so they're in the room up a very often and they're just do the other people together and they can't have the policy in any other people who has organized that people, and they're going to make sure, not an decision in the law we're like a law that would be something I think that everybody has been the law to so the reason that there the parliament it's not that
