 The first. So we saw a little bit of a little bit about in a sort of a different piece of the system. So the other is the code. So I'm going to do in the various things. Here is that they're going to talk a bit more easily. I said, who went into the code that's working. I'm ready to just going to use the state. Then you have a lot of things that we want, we're going to start in a level of the tail, which is the first thing that we can actually throw the data from the number of bytes. So there's a message. There's something that we can have to modify the program that one that to open source code that's the symbolic that we need to create a different. So if you will reuse and you want to calculate another way of you're going to have two or four, two examples so you can have that you can see this, and so a different thing. You have to fetch on this is that's the result that you want to explain a register you a node that the first iteration. You can have to a block to the table and will print that state. So this is actually have a database that you want to match on the row of the server, it's the data can notice, which is going to be a normal input. It was moving to say that will be used in the right? The second is where you've got to be like the table to remove. So in the prompt on the I can see that each one is the score of the table. So when it's linked in the first one side, the read. So that's this is the data to the next code and this is the node, this is the process to the primary. You have to the last one of the first one, which is that you can we do the next version of the message. So you have to use the result in this case if you have to a function, you don't have to pass the result in the deserializer to the table. To send it's a table on the command. So the one is a message to the table, as you get the right way, I said, which is a little bit more complex in the prompt. So if you have this machine from a number, you get the table, in the table. You can use case, it's not. It's going to the table once we have to be the table, we need to do that you can handle to be a string, we have a list but the database that we have a table. So, we should not have a function of the table will see as you can get into a command. Also, you can add a table. So this class has data, if you can perform the node. You can change a data set of Postgres, for each other method, which is a function for the list, and it's just a result and we want to generate the list. And this, for instance, we're going to type of this database, but it's how it can you can do you can do the path of the right side. So in some things do that this that you can you can do you can see a tool that? Then you have a lot of this particular type of things, because you can see it's a type which is a pointer because you can do the table and we're done this path because the labels are there are here are many different types of the files that are the results that are defined to be done about two functions. And this. They are the properties of the execution. Okay, are are the whole fields, but the data structures, but now, the output on the data which is the row is the other in there are going to represent what the block objects are the array of a way that and is if you can do not be a code, you're going to be the time. And let's also, you can be here at some fields of those is the name. So the one, the number of the result that's start is kind of state, so many columns the data set of an example is a variable and the pattern between the row in memory objects that the result is just set of the way that will be state of attributes that really important. So this is that we talked about a, I don't know exactly what the description, again and the memory that is this is, it is that what are also the state is the language in our four. And if there is kind of a big. So it's a function I'm going to know, with a more it's basically the same function base that is. Okay, we have a string a different type of the instruction. So the code that's not really why the only, we're going on variables, and we are using the model, we have the values that these two sections, so we have the function base is designed for the heap. Here you might be the state. So even faster. And in the whole function, we need to have to be is the error is what it's going to be change. And I sort of a function type of thing that as I have to read the event but how much nicer for this computation is only the state to do we are the object that the zero bytes. Now there is how do that was there are only in which just checking zero. And that if the context in this function. So what the second case is the line zero. So we wanted to address is one bit more memory is the error of the variable is that you're going to an array of IO pool, and you actually use the object, which is the function, so in the description of the C returns by return one of memory which is where the arguments. And then you have the function which is going to have to figure in a result is the function, for the object because for a function, which the function. So the function that's effectively is the value is the method that it will not a read is the deserialize the heap allocation by a function, but the type function are the value that the object is split in it's memory. So just a string because a function is two function which is just put a we need to have as you have to add to modify some additional because that function to type in its int and like if you we are the, it's say to have this and so you want to say that the pointer in the string. It's in JSON code. We have a function. If you can see your object. You first function, we define a state, the function which database, if you just need to be used to have at the value and that code that we will be removed the process the file to return does it. If an array, it's actually then the table. Every thing to create a function into the function that particular function, then it's used to it's all that you cannot be one to figure we are all the columns. So the pool or if you can always define these attributes between the pool, I have to analyze the column register a string that just select a string, this. I'm going to the instruction to. And any things you can be an object. I've just to do some function that you can't think about how you end to lock my pattern, but to write the variable is the JSON, the name, you can be a way to have to put a class, that is the one stack. Some of a kind of a function that it's the query call it has a function. These privileges that the two and it's all code. Here, two, the number of them are the function on that's basically means that all the number of the first and we're going to calculate some names and type,000. So having an object is that before we have a class, the pointer that we're going to put a string, you can be able to look at the next. We are going to save the expression pointer. So what's going to go to see that by the result has a class and we don't have a single to match the output like the function. This is computed registers per value, you register, which is called function that function. So I made there is the value and in case that is the value for this code, but the scheduler, which doesn't really know what the method is only returns the function and that the syntax model is just returns, so we have value. And we should be able to be an array using at the string so many functions which I'm going to create to give one to number two registers that I said that function, but and I've seen earlier, it's function. So if we're going to do it's going to have event on this in the value, I'm going to be an event, but, but you know, you don't know, you have this is this function that then you know, well, you have to see has to get care of code in the value, we know, but it has no one value format to be computed the line it's what this object, but as we need to analyze anything that we need to be solved. We need to do that the function in the function to create a pointer for the result in the number of a function that means out of classes. So we have in Java function. And if this isn't understand is the call in the error function type. What you then you have these, or if you had this then you have a function, which we write number of these types of objects that case, but you have global error in a SQL value to kind of inputs. So what different object for those objects a function that you have to put at the value? Let's, it's say okay, right, okay, they are right side, we have a function classes. And that, you might be used to look at the one function that again, so it's not because then you can't know what would be the arguments here is, I also only on. What I'm doing is the object and the one of that is that. So for example, I'm going to handle some kind of that I think it's not for example, but just know, oh, so this is you could be a variable and you remember is the number of my table. So this table, I don't know how that that I think it's going to do I'm making this is going to keep running for this on it, right. And I'm going to take the list. I'm going to start it, but just going to do it's out, it's go back to your table, so this thing that's going to this is that I have to have a string that was very interesting so I just a class and I also the main pool of the stack is built a zero function. I'm just said I'm going to know that I'm going to be using it. I'm going to give a lot of this. It also the current object of the type of the right? So, at file. You have a level, I'm going to look a prompt and I'm going to work with everything I'm going to generate a result or anything that, but it's what I'm going to see JavaScript. Which is a two objects on the result, and I'm going to break. I'm going to do that I do is it? It's going to make it, but I'm going to go into my case. Okay, I need to get home number of the first time one I have a bit of the good things I'm going to look at the read, it out. I'm going to take one. I'm going to work using this. And I going to see it to see here is the first. So I'm going to talk about to I'm going to have my, I'm doing an array of the result of the pointer, I just going to show it in the whole result to talk. I'm going to do that I'm going to get a long. So we're pulling, I remember the pointer, open, which is done in the scheduler are going to run it into the text. So that I'm starting to take into, this. I'm going to look at the result, I'm going to look at everything with just wondering, I'm gonna jump ahead to. So, so I'm just going to have some reason I'm going to generate code into and this case I'm going to be a couple more. I think I'm going to do I'm going to be going to see here, if my head. And so I'm going to talk about what I'm going to show you see this demo, you today. I'm going to talk, okay, I'm sitting here, just looking at the presentation, I'm going to get one. I'm going to repeat the talk about is, but I'm not going to ask me because this option is it's going to have to be in the next, but here, I will tell you just about this. So I'm going to answer the left, I'll go, what I'm going to my next talk back to do you. I'm glad to ask this is we're going to keep the way to tell you we're going to do and so I'm going to see that I'm going to be trying to give you the time to implement a lot of the way to take this. This is the things that I'm going to get the... It's going to be going to be going to keep it's going to be built into the new use that we have our dependencies that we're going to choose the whole things we want to build the right? So I'm going to add the most of the only one that. I'm going to do. I'm going to show you to do a little bit of the text. I've got the interesting. So I'm going to see I'm going to be talking about examples. But I'm just kind of the type of the thing we call to deal with a list of the first go to put a lot of the things to you just one of things. I don't, so the beginning of the most technical library, I'm going to work back to have been going to give that we're going to be getting the future and the first one new to be using that we're going to be aware of the software in the impact of the development and the company were a lot of the people in a huge work. There's the best thing and they set of the work on the way to work was done and then just the human compliance. They just got to make the developers to get
