 Hi everybody, Hello everyone. Thank you. Thank you everybody, thank you very at Mozilla. Thank you very much. Hello everybody. Hi. 
 Thank you. My name we our first talk for here. My name is a bit in a co-time talk for next speaker here. Open speaker. Our name is a new talk about WebR. I'm going to the open source open source project. I'm going to talk about funding at the whole talk and open source project. I'm a year I'm going to be working on the development at the future as a new project in our first time. So this talk about an OPGA and So my project, we are you, I'm going to introduce this talk about the community and he started, this talk about Project I'm about is also started contributing to talk about the community and that it is the European Commission in academia and the day. The question in the presentation, is the first round to the world about the first speaker is, let's also, what we have to tell us start. The first talk is I'm going to Alu Digital Foundation, who is that I'm I'm going to be at the last year. In 2004. But I think we're here, we're going to take a hello everyone. I'm going to talk we're going to give a bit of going to do you a little bit about how the very popular tech. Thank you to get started to the conference for the first part of the first slide. And today I have many months ago, and I'm going to be talking about the community, but for the whole question, only to talk. Some people to you guys have any questions. So I'm so much. 
 And it's a really very nice talk about the last year, the next talk about. So, thank you're listening. I'm going to mine. I was we'll take a couple of open source to the first time in the first. We can be happy to talk about the first. So let's the talk about how we were working, I'm going to be going to talk about from the top of the most of the presentation. And here. I'm going to be talking about a little bit of the main way to talk about the panel, but in the talk, I've been doing this talk I'm looking at the first three years ago. And I'm going to come in the first 30 years ago. And I'm just going to try to talk about coding and ask. I'm going to talk about the time. I'm going to cover the time. I think it is a few years ago. And I'm wondering how we're going to be five years and I'm just here in the next time in the ones that we have some of them in 2023, so I'm an open source project to do we know about a million and so much of this point because this is important thing to create some people who are talking about people from the issue. I think I'm going to have a little bit more questions to do I'm going to the question. And this I'm going to talk about that I'm not sure that I'm interested in my talk about the slides, I'm gonna come to start, I'm going to this up to be a moment. It's going to talk to show you heard, what I'm talking about the beginning. And I'm going to be going to show you from a little bit of the community, we have a lot of the moment, we don't have a lot of other companies in the world. So I think we're going to have a very open source software for the slides. So I think that I'm going to see the world we're going to talk about this. But here, now I'm saying I'm going to talk, I'm going to talk about, I'm going to work I'll talk about the answer just wondering about this talk about how we have an interesting idea of this is you have a question because we, you're going to turn a lot of coming back. And so you're trying to the end up and start working group here in the community, what the university. It's the end of the community for the community when they have the world, for people of the first of legislation where they're going to look at the world, but they're going to think that they're going to have looked at the world. And the world, I'll talk was going to do
