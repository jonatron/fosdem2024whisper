 I'm going to talk around our co-dian 3Dden. Our name is Open Science for attending. So I'm so much for all. We will thank you for welcome everyone. My name, and thank you everyone for the University for attending everyone. Thank you very excited. I am I'm going to give you from the open source year. Thank you about the talk about Matrix and I was this talk. So thank you very much very much for being the first one I'm talking a good. So I have I have been working in time and Alex. I think most recent, the first month we are the European Commission. The first one was the Netherlands, and then we are going to continue to talk about the last year about half the previous talk at the last year to present the Commission support to the European Commission. I'm in June, and he has been thinking about the last more and our open source project as an O'clock, I'm pretty a member of Open Science 3D Energy has been started in Canada. There was the EU Commission, and the European Commission, and I'm going to talk about our countries, and he was a Open Science. And here in 2014 at the last year-year talk was one year. And I was where I created by 10 years, I had this open source community and Korship. So the co-profit, I was a member of a little bit of tech industry, but would briefly for the open source part of its open source community, and it's what I said if the digital liability between the tech we want to work very fast to be a lot of an app and the last year at least in London. I'm not just preparing the past year. So it was a good and the years. I was not first year I did the first year until you know what have had a little bit of our presentation in a huge organizations. Can you're here in a screenshot of tech in the future in the International OpenAIOSDEM which started at the first day. I was a few months. I was not asked in 2019. And I was trying to talk to go to understand what I was a couple of the main year. So I didn't know what I think that's going to come on the OpenJDOS Foundation and wondering. But I'm going to be aware of the project at FOSDEM, the talk about the one year. And the world was used a member. Now, the majority of the code was the International Commission in the Swiss Commission was that had a democratic society. So if a lot of the European Commission has a bit of tech organizations have been talked about technology a bit of clear that helped you can be paid for the last year. And the European Commission. But we have had to look at the product. So that were very cool and this point of course, we were here. And I'm not talking about the European Commission has been a lot of the Product Liable funds, it would like this year to highlight to be a lot of a lot of people who was really think he was not the past one point of the open source projects as well, do a lot of course. So it was actually is how it's the people actually a good. So it was the project was not saying many projects we added like, but we were the audience who didn't think it was a bit of the public sector, but then they wrote it was probably not very deep in their website. And the Foundation started in German laws. They're building the market. So yeah, that we have a very much energy and they really be aware of the commission to make sense for you know the very closely to have time that it was coming back to a few two years ago. He was open software so we've got been working on that I'd like I didn't hear this software and we also been doing it from, had not like to be a lot of the years ago. It was we were that at the last year ago and at all of women who was going to have been done the time to be able to be at the ones from the commission. And he was going to turn on the last year. I'm on the one year because he was probably just allowed to do that they've almost the workshops and they were in a moment. But this was in the University of the time. And she had a half and he was doing it was the open source who was the first day. But actually had a thought I started working group. And in the slide got the end. And as a huge part of the commission had a little bit of its open source, which was the European Commission, which was the year and decided to be relatively long term in the legal money, but it had always not just wondering about the commission and we got there were contributing some of a world in that is not so we're going to the commission. And I was probably heard on the EU and they were talking about governmentas, but they saw really hoping to keep an open source so it when they had this time and they had done had made a huge women. They're all the best to be talking about the money. So they were half. And they said, in the opportunity to be a lot of time. We're going to have to really a huge focus on the world on a lot of really difficult. So I'm actually, we had this and you know that we're going to get the work on and we had the commission from the commission. And if you have been familiar with the open source world as far. And then the Internet and I would be going to be open source community and look at all these year, the day, speaking at the slides. And I do we're going in September and I probably've got the panel. So I'm going to happen here, we're going to continue to get a good time. And I'm going on the long time for open collaboration in the day. And I'm going to work out. So really interesting about the two years, the first time. We have seen the software, there were the community and many I had to be the Drupal community. At the most of the commission and the goal. And the future that was to have at the point of the PLD law, which were also the community of the organization of this panel. And since we were even with the organizations. And that we were the EU commission will just decided to try to know what the current person just have is in Europe and we've got the market that have been trying to be to try to create the process of a point and open source license field. And this would like an open source of a European Commission for example of the PLD's part of communities in an licensee to invest a product community that. And that are also the organization that we had a open source project completelyilingual model and the European Parliament and data is the market and they're looking for both European Commission and think that was the foundation. And I have a lot of that we have and free software who said. But in the challenges where the most importantly, all also ask you know. So we now, the last year is there are the Commission has been to be our co-profit Europe and open source as long term and very much as a member of Amsterdam. I didn't think they're also had to be quite a company. And there's a few of the company talking about the knowledge and they're more and they're in the world. And so they're starting from the political world organizations that this European European Commission. And so is what are the world, we're even aware of open source software, but they're creating been involved in the funding, but they're talking about the community. And if you can choose is on the first of the world and sharing government and then they are coming from the regulation forces the product and they were often there are the negotiations of the community. I thought it. So as many projects, for the first, the third of the source product in the moment we don't think if we are looking at have to follow the time to understand the society and how to tell you have this. So when you are part of our product is especially when you need to engage in their decision to be able to get started to train electricity because they are the source, okay. And for commercial economy in tech in open source world and, we're not going to know, all the time to be for you know that much about the EU institutions who are a way we have paid as a European EU Association and to be in addition to do something different agencies that we're still have some companies which means that's is an open source definition of our open source companies, but it's a long term law in a good but it's the standards. So we decided to think that we have three people are the OSPOSD as well as opportunities in the world, we do a way to make open source community of the public act from the licenses, which organizations and a lot of the world that we have been having an internal commission would work into the PLD? And then also a company, especially if we have been talking to serve about open source on the EU institutions are mainly in the last year and the US in the big companies in France and then we have the same part of the car and we're still have been doing a little bit of the moment to be the rights of the place is that they already in a person in this day and this CRA is a good to a huge project while you're the very big product, we're the European Commission and the world, which it's why we're using And I think of course the foundation and we're looking into their world and we want to go into the first but the law and I don't know what's at the foundation of a definition of the product, the way that we'll find that we're talking from the public Commission has been working on and then going to be able to tell you also interested in the only because they were going to deliver any way to see that they are very important for those open science, is just a matter of the tech projects who I would be too much people about the point first story, because I do. So I can I'll be and so much about the beginning of data related to think that you know that are here are moving data and I would have ideas about scientific level of those people and what we're looking at the challenges to each other companies. So if you know what we're going to do you're going to get it in some time to talk about this is going to say you're going to take care about what about about. But we're going to talk about coding in the challenges that's important thing that the open source project of a model, but it's going to be a traditional world. And so we keep the world but we're the impact of the impact of the capacity of the first thing that the rights will have been very important and open source licenses of the long as the openness in that they're going to be actually actually has to work around the world where the time we have to have. And this is we're doing and we're going to do a little bit of the beginning of a discussion that open source standards and safety perspective and really we have been talking about where the end. And we're going to find is actually looking for a lot of energy and how much energy principles that a big problem in the last few months and I think that we are the open source product in fact that had really if we had a good in the first step of the software since we want to provide electricity and we're trying to get been thinking about the EU society and so that we said there's going to make on through these communities and going to have a lot of all of companies that this regulation of people who also there's on the moment for of the last year to have been an only one person, which is a lot of the ones that the open source world is a lot of things that there are the second three parts of weeks of the open source, the world. So here is a bit more important to come to see those the commission that we heard of what needs to think that we have been from the project to have to be a long time to be in the last
