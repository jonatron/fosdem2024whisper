 Okay. So, please, but please the end of the project, we have this is, okay? I said, how many, what I did? So, I think, I'm going to focus. I'm going to speak to present the talk. I'm going to start. It's a project yet. And I'm going to talk about what we have to talk about that. I'm going to talk about the community, and we have a little bit about today. So for a little bit about how we are the last year, I'm going to make it going to be fun, which is not a technical situation. I'm going to be talking about the first of the other one was to tell the new thing. These are we about the best part of the most people who has been doing is that are just focused in the design we started with that we're a open source world. And we've heard about. We need to have to look at the goal as a lot of our second thing to our knowledge to be a lot of what were, right now. We need to give our own friends to share the world. And I'm Chris who's Alessandro talk about open source product law, the main version was talking about some of OpenB. And they're just discuss about the money at Red Hat who are the rest of the last year, I'm a time out in a lot of this project and they're going to talk to speak and open source and we're going to say that they're going to start doing that we're going to be more people in a lot of the whole lot of people who are trying to help out, actually trying to be in the notion of the open source projects in the open source and kind of our industry. We've been doing open source community in Europe, a majority of years in the last year, when it was, you have a big people could benefit from academia, at the world, the best of the first, because we're very tough one person that they're just saw that people at the situation of the CRA, the really, they guys at the year, there's going to happen on the time that they're going to work to be a bit of a good opportunity to encourage you know about the top of an open source community. And I really interesting place this is that I'm sure we're going to start a little bit about the thing that we're going to tell people in the community and you about the first one. Like, I'm going to start going to talk about if you going to see a nice topic that's going to change that we're looking for the last year. There's the word that we're going to get a bit different work. And they've got the first time, I'm going to think about the time because it's going to have a little bit. And in terms of this is the room, you're going to be time to look at a lot of life and they're going to be used to have to have a lot of free software in open source community, like open source software, like the time. And that people are we are not doing at them. It's the last year. And we're not just going to the focus more, we are about the software, but it's not necessarily a moment of German world. There's made to be a very excited to talk, because I was to be a lot of the last year we're going to be the good and about the last year and the first three years ago. There's a lot of the world. And I're a lot of people here, like the history at the challenges in the moment. So the world, I was the part of the time we been in the years, but we got a community work on a lot of the world, so we've done our software, we've been talking about the time, to spend the people who is done at the world,000 million times. So, it's a successful yet. So we have because we're going to be looking at the community, we're going to do we've been living in the door. And then people at this point in our market in a new society. And if we have a half the open source is, we've been told me again that at the point of the right? So we are Martin, the European Commission. So I'm going to talk about the European Commission's a day. I'm going to talk about the world. And y raised the best open source community. We have a very much energy Foundation and here last year ago we have a lot of the moment, and the end was here is in the last 12 years ago. And the first of his community that was, if a very, so this is a little bit of the commission for the organization were really important, really been in Europe. And that. And there was the government that we have a decade, a lot of the European Commission members of research and they worked with a long work. And there were the most sovereign community. So this is the EU government organizations in Europe which had the law and a law was something on the organizations, which has been around a tech and a directive to be an important to something I think the project, well. And in general, was just here, but this is not going to describe what we have also just wondering to work here at least a few people and policy, only in the German European Parliament, about the community and then we have been talking about TSOs, okay. And I've done this, we can come in the European Commission, you can say it to work that much better. And I'm presenting the European Commission is, I was more, this company that we've a different institutions were using Commission. So it took the market sector, we were some of the world of the moment. So a year was running years ago. The first one that was the last year. This was not last year I've got in the European Commission, which was here we had to volunteer and the product. And we took the last year, when we had some of my colleague before about like also work with two months ago, so far in 20 years ago. All right now, the original time people for those women are the knowledge in the first point. And I'm hoping to say in terms of the University of a foundation because at the European years called the open source open source projects, there are mostly one part of the EU organization which are open source activity in Brussels, they have been a huge tech and they were a community were even a lot of open source world, a great paper. And that was a lot of society, which was a lot of contributions actually a very, the fact that was very limited time for example of course of funding in 2021. And it was kind of an extensive activity 20 years. So that was the first step would have been organized as a lot of the world and the third question is. Another thing that I have this was the first one was to be a lot of the European Commission was the years ago. To read in the moment, the European Commission and we're like the first one that I was just wondering if they need to think it as Cyber Science, the EU are really you know, of the world. And they were not always at their scientific world. So they were very proud of a European Commission will be public open source that the European public sector and law that is represented energy rights in France. So a medical government law actually a very important to the technology they were like companies were talking about the public public legislation and they been about proprietary software as the law and they do we were making organizations and so the product agencies are open source free demand will always been solved in the big policy liability in open source world where they ran into a free software sector and they've got the German directive. And so this is exactly the US-toed and was working and they had been one of good in the EU law can really heard about this and they have been maintained in Europe last year and they had had a technical legislation, the rights of legislation that it was just said that was really, but when they know the German law, we have taken by 20? So as what the law in 20 years and that she was, we had a policy scientist. And they also had a year at the panel that we had was clearly thought in the EU community, so he had a lot of legislation and we had it was that had funding in the EU is open source community that law and being a number of people was that is a very important for law and the year open source and they had to do that and they were in and they were looking at the European world they have thought a good and they have we made a year. So we found out about the time liability for a software who is because we have been a lot of the national field that came out this is also. And we are really think that the law in German infringement from the last year is very briefly in the world being a far we have a bit time to be able to get in the German license to do in the IT and the law directive. Let's the decision before the history of time to do there were coming around so much more but they're going to understand is some people to bring a law and there have been a big technology but that they're doing that I'm not that the companies who had to do we'll be sure that and they're now. And it's the first of open source product, but the scientific law and they're also had to do a German law in the first time. We have a commercial law, the first part of the product and we have benefited the legislation and there were free decision source laws needed as many years because open source funding is of open source law last year, so we had that people which has just said that already know who had this year too much that that was the open source and a German laws of the commission went to solve exactly the European court point was part. And then they created the CRA law because I was a long time to me know that don't that you do it's the law and they really came to do is really have. And that this was very far to be the fact that we were a way long term that the law did it has gotten thought the way and a bit the government, so that came from any EU law and we were not get from court law and was paid for this was in the regulation, like I was actually kind of a national society that was what is the GPL was going to the next sector that I don't remember from the decision was somebody asked to make one of the GPL law was clearly the GPL law. I was pretty much time. People asked for the only one. And any copyright law was just used because I had to fix that the open science was just gave a law value of funding but had taken, there was like the copyright value of policy when the copyright law key was the law was captured by copyright law and honestly is only enough license will no copyright law and why we didn't want us as a copyright value were there was funding license in the infringement and should be able to value of the copyright person were just that they were trying to know the copyright law for the license even this copyright law has been somewhat aware of what were the copyright and rights would be a copyright ruling that copyright always being talked to be often as the copyright legislation that would mean they were in copyright, but they were often started into law. But it's a third law said to actually important just is that to be able to get a government license directive because they had to do anything you know. But if the license said you know a problem was you don't know it's very different terms of that it's really the copyright that were the software. At a German law to the policy was based in the moment that they had some legal value of the license as far is often has looked I definitely trying to be aware that the copyright license and they would be aware of product actually the same. But I think that, not necessarily in the copyright bodies like I could be kind of the copyright has been made the law open source part of the copyright saying this was, as well in terms of law. So yeah, the law and there were the law laws who ever started in it was any parliament to the license rights and they could be taken the world and a good as the German value of copyright as possible to make the GPL law and the law people have, yeah, but we can be open so you know that the copyright thought that he is this law. To be the only because the court was the law directive that the license of the GPL law that the law that it's the German law and he said is in law you know that problem that they have also said that in the GPL that law was it's that they were in the legislation that there were saying that really a good because they wanted to work and they brought away from the license license key always in German law is why they're probably don't aware because it was not often the license in the copyright directive because the law was value of the law it's done almost so in the law they know the value that was used and it was a third product to do wasn't have. I had to be the law has been to be open source law under the decision at this case. They were used that was at GPL is because we have even so people were using TPM and that government to be just asked that really a big license and so that they had been made from companies that these law to get the EU law in the copyright licenses or a good software is that we didn't know in its law law said. And I was speaking that said very many years to a regulation that doesn't think that is often that they were there was just heard of it was exactly GPL is not no no money as long law that this needs the German law and in German copyright value right it's not so we did they were that you know always want that is all the act to have been in Europe really hard to talk and we're quite important for time and still have this in other regulation and they are required at the law and they could be a sense in the law and they are still want to actually a market had also work that was just at it as long time you know the value and a law in people to take care about the government policy itself to get the open source and the licensee has almost and it was an open source and the EU and this law rights in interoperability law law by copyright IT in the law and so we need to take a legislation in the court law and they had been available to be funded to make a law and it's a license you know that license under
