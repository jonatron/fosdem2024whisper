SDC. Our name is the 3D. We talk about JRuby. It's a 3D 1. ago, we have a long time for a lot of technologies. And that we need to be able to use that. We want to have some points after this, to reuse the code changes on the way to find some more than adding a separate application, which is what we have the interface is where we use in a cloud. It's a lot of time for an application level that can be used for the application from the other in the process. We've got a lot of people, which are aware of, right now trying to do this to do the application that already, right? Because it was running to put this to have some of the most of the RISC-party library. And then you can pass in this to this and then look at how to have your application and how you can start, how to you should we're going to have to play a look at the backend. If it. We have a little bit more complicated. We're based on this, WebAssembly program, JITP state of how to need to need to go into JMAP, which basically the command line is what we have. We want to compute LLM will be able to the full to the server on the server to see here. And it's the JMAP back to have some other languages that we have our server. And then we have this new, we need to see the GPGA and we are also have also the good and we have to get a lot of having local server. So we are looking into my own applications. We have a bunch of these ideas, we have a little bit of them to use the front end of other things that we can create a way we have to, we need to create a way, when we test a framework, a container, we need to run, we have for our API and we can, we are right? That's running the open and for the end users to check the first support as we want to implement the API. So we probably have some of this code and we have the stuff. We want to give new code, and start to the same, which is to say, right? You need to turn it's going to the next result is going to set up the library in a bit of it's going to start thinking about the first one of the same API in the definition of our issues in the goal is sort of the beginning of the first, but you can be doing it and we have all of what we don't really really know what we know in this? There are going to be, we are a little bit of work with some people to be done in the whole library and they're getting into the model and we're going to encourage people into a more things they're ready to do want to focus on this. We're going to have to go back to another like the LLVM. We're going to do in one of the main users, but we're going to have our question. We're going to offer them to me to that people from our community, we're going to be trying to work as a lot of the company experience they're going to open source community, we're going to be our goals. We want to think about this opportunity to try to use open source project for our own open source and kind of legislation, a developer projects that will be getting the community, they also very often made a few people that we're doing a lot of what we're trying to get started to be able to be able to think about the world and how to do we have some of our ecosystem. We want to do we have to open source developers to learn how to think we're a lot of our roots down and we work and we can go into a good and try to help our own people that we're using the challenges that. And I'm a few different software has been doing and you feel our software developer developer and some people and we're going to give us talking about C right? We're going to help the last year. So I'm going to talk about all the next speaker's going to go and we're going to be, say that we're going to be a long at the most of the most of the people're going to go to been talking about all in last year. So let's going to present a future. You're going to introduce another version and a lot of CMA. You may be a lot of the software engineer for the time. In general idea of people that would be the question was just say it. They're going to say I was it's worth people getting thinking about doing this question in the community. There's a little bit like the thing. This is that you write code and each other version of the Python. I'm going to tell you can also don't see it. And in most of the most of my goal of the Clevis and we're, but I'm not doing this is all know, we have been doing this kind of our code we have a long to be a way that we are going to work on using the source product and we're going to build our users to get this is maintaining and this is really important from each other people in the last year was actually at the SNCF and we had a lot of the third step years ago and we had really know, one of our software? We started making sure we had the world. And so the people out of the beginning of the way to be doing this for other people that we could be a really can we had to support in our community with the future model that we're talking about the quality of software. And we have ever seen before we're going to be the question, we're going to have the fact that we're going to be just with an old one of our one of the issue because we have been doing our project there's now had this project that we have been doing this. And that we had these contributors to share and we're going to do, or a good news that we're going to have good point of what we're going to have in there until we don't know, we're going to think the fact. We can't want to try to be a little bit how we're going to have a time to build that we're going to show us to produce we have to look at the product. We're going to analyze something that we're going to look at the same time we're going to hear who probably going to be going to be going to be a little back to introduce that I'm going to talk about the current day for the community who's going to talk. And we're a little bit to actually going to be going to keep a few cool thing about the technical money that we're going to realize that you know, and I know, which's an impact on with people from next as a senior code to find that. We have a lot of the open source code base, we want to have a list in different things that the end, we're talking about the audience in the big companies would be going ahead of the last year here, even about the last two years with last year. And that was probably we've got a bit more people. So we've got heard me, we're going to be a little bit of the main thing that made a bunch of the kind of interest on the people involved in the first years ago. And now we've been around the community we were doing this sort of the same thing that the people who got the community. So I'm just want to people like also the people with me who get some people who come back and then have to collect information in the people on, if they've got people who were just going to be able to make the whole person that they were just did. And they're going to do. And they don't want to be able to do that what are we would like to make a bunch of that they don't want to give some of in a bunch of these are so they're going to do is you know how many people look into the other people look at this to do that they're able to have a few more people who have their question. And I think that I had to sort of my kind of weird, but I would say that would we had to get to get it in place to see how this we'll explain the world. So that I'm going to that's a bit faster? And that the question was called in the one where we have been thinking about was like to be removed that we've had to throw into a bit more people who's how many people are looking for the open source software were working on the open source software. We're going to do we're going to do we're going to solve. And we're going out that, can get to work on this day we're going to see going to focus before you're going to have a little bit of our code where we've got all doing our community there's going to make it on that they're going to look at the working group who had a way to do the community. So thank you have to do we ever heard about our people who need to follow a community for people and we've been working with a much so this is going to be getting into the next year was coming in the people here because he wanted to turn out and he's going to have had to figure out. So do that we're going to do we're going to come ahead of people who got something to talk, but that has a couple of what we just continue to see in the open source community we're going to make a lot of people going to do the process that have a lot of a few people can do the community and even test open source code that we need to make this because we're going to actually do this work around that are talking about. They're going to take a little bit of people to do some part to be just a good job management and also the collaboration in the things that they want to implement this and they're really need to have had all the way to open source code that is to do maintainers that are doing that we want to be like to get to deal with those resources for that you can be interested in the tools with the people who are looking at the build the world right balance that I'm just a couple of the world and I know that you know about me there is the other engineers who are a very important in the community and I think that can I'd like to me here. I'm sorry the project people are open source so many of open source code that there's been a very often as well too much like we have the community model in open source community there's what I know the first but we've got kind of all the work and I don't know how they're that the one of looking forward right we have a young people doing at least really want to be able to work and make it's like that we're trying to do a lot of the right now really something for a project and so we be there with the next time that we've been trying to give a few things in the technical world right now we may have a little bit of a couple of a few people to go to do that I think what we've also want to sort of people here. So I've created a good thing is that we have in the people since the code in the right now I think the last thing we can do kind of the code that we remember the right and what we're these a lot of just right so they're doing where the product is the software and what we've said in the people can get to do is to do. So we know is we do we're the most of these people was what's going into the people are looking at so we're saying, and we're going to have one of the best so I'm going to say? And we'll add a little bit of the kind of our project to start from the software and that what the main stuff that's happening in the end of the community and the world that we were available or also made because there were the ones that we've recently and there's something that we've been doing that we've done there's the first because we've got for EU that were really all in the market and there's not just a culture is basically a lot of the product that we're going to go out of months and then was just it was all like it was going to go and he was a happy to our next year before is the first of the fact that was that were in the civil society was going to be a major point I had before we just thought we had to keep and it so we had and we didn't give a way we had this year. And I just put a list of thing the license in the first step was like this year ago. So we have a kind of them to add, they're going to the term working on to come out and they are currently just going to get again, like we're on us just a little bit more people or less comfortable with this and this community's actually talk still a new users of really meant to now in the community we mentioned last year because we had some people I had to give us to work on the people in 2022 so many of this morning. And I first, but I was to be a lot of the first step at this is, maybe I think, but I think he would be talking to you know like it was wondering what's just worked at the people to get something to it so I did was just wondering. I was, I knew very excited to have do and I was like, so I was just told people were wondering, but that I had a question. I just wondering this about the next slide, that was here, I was that was, he was supposed to know was just not done last year. And so that you are like that was quite a little bit more of been a little bit. And I think the years ago. I'm going to be a little bit like, but I was the first time. Okay, I got the first I managed to do I'm up with the introduction to work on that to see, so we have multiple people and now. And I invite you know we have left-shirt at my project and I was thinking about people to do. And that we have this project. I was to think we've got to co-founder of the general one and I was very recent four to share about an hour to offer that was really the world. I was a little bit of the years ago the next speaker. And I was doing a talk about
