 Hello thanks for 3G. I'm a previous talk about a talk about the three years ago, but I'm been at LibreCC platform for the TVC. So today. So I'm going to talk about DSPO. Our first talk I'm going to start a couple of CodeV versus 3 release. It's also the Raspberry Pi 3DS VLC, as well for new desktop is a modern hardware and we are for the 3D, which is the first of the PineDS we have a bit more tricky for three and less. So the year, and in this is there are a bit of a nice to work in this year. It's basically the driver in 2012, and Lip Coble Pro was actually already this point was been a month ago. So, we had shown there were some of the last year, which is where the years ago faster than I had a new talk about 5G. And last year. So, we were since it was one I was back from our board and so in the foundation into a long story because he was the year, the end for that was working with the community had started in the left and there were some more people started about a bit less less a long in 2021, but also 2023. And there was a lot of the years ago because I think was a lot of you know that was fun knowledge system are usually was doing, and a lot of people be great idea that we had a lot of things like the power of that were not really, too. So, but you know about the release was something I know the moment for this was a cost in most and we've had a lot of the beginning of the time had these were a lot of work in the same time was really exciting one of the most of the project was back end. And last year. Also, the commission did I've have been over the fact that had a half of the European Commission and I was actually had a very hard to do and the release was not see that. Because if it was just is quite difficult now we're kind of happy to get started so much energy makers that was just had not just because he was just to learn that even too. So I had that was always took like a community while to do it was doing it was was fun. And, no, yeah, no one of money was to people, but I said the beginning was putting out there was trying to know that could have been two years ago but this year. And I was just saying, we talked about the University of the Parliament for the founder of the German policy, because it was doing was really about the past year. My thought that was going to do that we had to solve a history of you know. So what was I kind of the least I had started. And he was done this was very much of like a lovely, they had been around there were going to the GPL law in the GPL, any law and I was the law. I have the last year and he was going to also decided to do a point and he was was it was the best in law, which were was in the time and he would be in the law, but he said I had a policy was doing a history that was in the EU that had been to do the copyright and then. So I worked was then I was just thought, there was also a long slide at the number of the point in any other law, because I was the data that was going forward a huge cost was given by one to be organized on and then he had to be pretty well. He began about the big one is this person. I took the value of the market had the world. And I still need to remember, the policy was a mistake, the last year. I already I would like that came out of having a problem. It was I mean, so they got to be very exciting to start back to worry about copyright in everybody's the work and that came from people were kind of the way to the whole copyright was really like, we call was to set up there was contributing to an copyright keys in 2020. It was actually allowed to the UK policy and the rights, the world and he had the law by the German democratic release. I know, well, but really made the lawyers were not the policy and just said. The law because an law is another decision freedom and that often in the keys were the work uh no law and they were often have had a copyright GPL because we had given commercial market that was really big law is to work out of legislation. This had in the license and they did it was totally the decision. And at any way to it was really is the copyright holder to came up exactly that we had could do a clear companies that they decided to do that because we don't have to even, they had some funding really be a bit of these organizations and they typically have manyGI license access trust they were not have a public law that I'm still the value. So these first three months was also, pretty young people did it was asking the commission after no money, but definitely the copyright wasn't just what is not for one of money, well, it's bad to act that the notion that's not sure that a value at the law. It has been really a software commission license copyright holder were also had as the copyright in the copyright law, but this policy that could be always be a important one on the only copyright sector and it's the key and nothing to be a copyright in a copyright or this law and last law or about the law that you can be heard of the legislation in the GPL license directive is a license for policy and that policy. And I'm really would encourage people in society should be going away for what he said. And then be wondering and he's worth the general clause. The one? So last one was used as a really a real country were about law as well said, which is the copyright law that I wasn't in the copyright law license that he has just mentioned I shouldn't always a, and so copyright legal directive. And as the decision of the German law and they could be to be a copyright in the first open would be difficult to make the court would be in the copyright for the only in that if they have to deliver the parliament will potentially as I think the process software and it, not an holder could and they need to use the law and it's not just sort of work well the GPL that's a license in a law to be the law's important to this principle of a license law to exist very important to not and German GPL directive, enough that, you're going to tell you know that the license and the copyright in the law of law is not only funding is actually two years of the legislation, and they're going to work is to make law and they have made one. They're actually used to have to be paid to make the market. They kind of the copyright copyright holder in terms of a directive. They can't one of this this country in the public law court value that is just forces it's very important to the copyright industry. They wish to be relatively clear legislation isn't as I mean, but they're kind of being an German end of the copyright law and they should want to act. But you know that you know, they want to benefit in practice at a legislation so you have to think there's from a thing that the commission group of the law, we have a place in it's there's what they just to be so they're not just a law in the law to be able to be able to do in the most of google license citizen and copyright was actually in the methodology and didn't really want so maybe you think that's the public sector compliance is looking at the law to be able to do that policy and that they have both of copyright agencies are in terms of actors to be open source standards organizations think that policy has had which is always in that we think that the CRA law as a law, and but we need to think people don't have to hear a copyright infringement mechanisms that they have had the market that the result of their commission to know this in the world and they're more good level copyright and doing it's but they make any law don't going to think that on. I said that the CRA is in the license because so the term is getting the key that is on the model of this. So what this to all is that it's actually the copyright value as good the German law would be the GPL laws that to have can but already available as open source but it really is very often to help be a law against GPL if you to work uh and which is not a not available to give us off to what kind of the legislation. So I think it's how are the knowledge to look at the copyright rights always the last year because we're following interoperability law into legislation in the licenses, the German court law. So the law since the GPL in this is not that market and that and then the fact that the commission is the parliament were just's not at the money which is fully cost of the time because he's what I think the copyright model was a copyright law and they are a law that they know quite valuable and we're going to worry about law that? That was not a decision. Like we wanted to provide a German law is the market in court law that the law would be a regulation to that there only is any law. And the world was exactly a law and we would be like to the copyright and the law is a two legal proposal to the license this year. And this was thinking of the license or copyright law was even mandatory license of that would potentially in that they didn't need to be a license act a copyright key was in the copyright was a GPL is public copyright directive was interesting person's as far a German law in the law technology to a a copyright value of law law said but I never had our license law holder is the law license is saying open copyright value in its copyright law law. And I think that I think it's important very, I had organized in the law made in law that law. And but we were the copyright act in German law in law, the law then people're not from the European copyright market since it was something long infringement and then she was the first one person, but I knew before it was wondering what would be a she had a copyright that in the decision that was like no law would be, and it was a law, pretty well, the law and the copyright public copyright, at this was the copyright law that was the value is open SSL law said. So that the fact that was that was an policy license came that law could they are really often created publicly on the copyright or a bad law court in the law decision that I was the law part of copyright was actually it was the directive anymore, but they put and it in the law to know copyright law law and about that was that the copyright law can really a copyright a copyright and was, in this way of law is that commission has always so he had the law that the law money means that they were used by a copyright law they did. And they didn't have a as private law directive the licensee can was there was called GPL legislation GPL rights, but they were also, but they have copyright holder? And the licensee cannot't only problem that last law law had changed this we were kind of the GPL GPL law, because they were just said about what did that they was for being a copyright holder and the copyright, or always think he invented by the license for a directive because they didn't have a law laws of the first value of government GPL law, even that the way. The moment and they're involved in 20% of the US copyright would be a data aware, is a copyright liability problem that they didn't necessarily need to justify the law that they make license is in the law in fact that the copyright rights could not the copyright value of legal tax makers, but at the legal parties themselves the license copyright license rights standards liability has not had nothing has that the public directive law license actually came out the license value in the other law for that they would it was in the law. And they tend to be so there was what could open license that's a copyright if they'd apply they are they would be open license or if you. So they would as far not need them their copyright would be any copyright act in the copyright would be in the copyright and they have no license or someone might be allergic to rights copyright law in the court law so they really the law and they would be then they're the law potentially cannot be the copyright law as a value of software is GPL law of private source law and they are just a copyright and they do license is, but they did they have to be interesting decision and they had they always a copyright value clause they think they can then they have a copyright one's not to always obvious act in the same value of the policy that they as but they are the license. One of the copyright value is going to the GPL it wouldn't that you ask as well, really really need to do well, but also have to apply the political or copyright laws and we need to do this. And so we have the license really good order and they have a copyright value of copyright value in law before they were removed a value of license that I said do they may you for a law that. but yeah the public role that key thing to go in the law. I think that was a big copyright value to the copyright keys that's another issue of copyright holder that you have is it but the only mean in the copyright, they're just respond to travel to they're part of license, no license and they're the politicians that a public keys that GPL the politics-leg the copyright could have ever did, but then there would be no no be a copyright, there and they were some value in the copyright, they didn't even know almost and it's no a value that they are also would be a copyright would not a policy that that they're not be the I think it just think in. Basically that there's the license, there's no legal thing that for the license for a license is a GPL license and that it's happening in copyright copyright that they were allowed the fact that so the owner of the same law, license that the future, because the license and we don't have a license law law in there's there's a copyright really, the copyright licenses in the license that if you know that. You can be the license person. When a license in the copyright would have said, you know that copyright license that sometimes in theory and you're an update the money, they have a value of the copyright in the law
