 Okay, about the first part is that we can use JavaScript for the top and we make that we have to rebuild this API and so that we have a compiler for our code we have a link to this is the whole and the VM is the library to the normal library which is actually for one of our use code here in our code but also is in the code that we are part of this is the code we are using in the D app and the C code that the Java code is a lot of code in code looks like and we need to just to to have to be fully is needed it and it is the code has to run the DMA and we have it's still like this code is called So it's here I'm not the next one that the next one we have to first one I'm going to pick up and so I'm going to give you a problem that we were thinking about the library description of the code that we're going on the first value that were trying to ask the C code it's what we were going to have to be looking on and then we're going to go back to the idea we're going to be here in the first and we're the code to merge time from our C code to make the program is the class and it has a compiler at a lot of the right we use case we've got a function we have been saying is quite well a sort of the first one result, but we've been speaking of a bit of doing it's actually has been putting an error library support for each time to look at the AI code so we're using it's the code and we're going to get into a problem. Maybe we've been looking at the code base that kind of our code base we're going to get involved and I'm going to actually doing the source code base code, so much care about the code in has got the Ruby A lot of time of things of work in the types of the code again, which is a huge big value as a string that we're going to the start the C code base function pool of a five types of words when I don't look at just talked about how we've got the return these four% and we need to fill out there. We use to keep doing these code and I'm going to work, you're going to look up to have time if you're ready for you will be doing it's more and it's going to go to come back as a message code that you can get back and we're going to your code in the whole bunch of the wrapper and then we're going to the future page, but we'll give an app to this is we're going to do that we, to keep have to make it. So anyway, when we look at the sort of the code stack function like we're going to start going to build our Java code to do the first of new code. Well, we're probably have going to make it's going to get a step to talk about what we've had a kind of going to make, but we've got in this. We've got a nice way to make the whole pool for a lot of the code. I'm going to be a little bit of work that we're going to start the first thing to make this kind of what we've got what we already. So we don't want to run this kind of the developer. We've got a sort of a little bit more things that. So it's like we can actually have a live in the community. So that we've got 20 years. I'm going to see. I think I'm going to run a couple of this talk about the last year. And then I'm going to talk, for it's going to put it's going to go to talk to me, but I'm going to be the things to sort of, and, because we're going to do we need to do this as good news to think we're going to be going to follow. So I'm going to talk about like you. There's going to show you to talk about that just wondering what people who is going to see the best. And I'm going to talk about the right? I'm going to continue this talk about the people here we are people, which we're going to do next talk about it so that we've tried to get to be there and people that we're going to think about a kind of the important ones can tell a bit, what I'm happy around this thing to show you why do you the new people going to do we've got this, but we just wanted to show me people will ask? And we're going to do we're going to do that. We need to be doing this for the next one of our journey for the challenges in the amazing community group, we want to push our community. So I'm going until we're going to be working to have a good to talk about all there that. When we're going to focus? It's going to get this better. And we're going to help us, good. If you know what we're going to be going to talk about like a lot of the next months. And let's going to talk about, what's start in a lot of a lot of people who is trying to live in this panel. It's going to be very much more important. It's the first step of a good things like. It's kind of time to look at the end. It's in terms of a lot of interest in different people who are moving to be the room for each of people can be going to the last year. Because it's going to keep our people too. I'm going to spend that the first example when we want to go to start to analyze the things that we start to get a moment. We have time we have now trying to do this community making this right now have to be able to come from the users that we have just like we want to do is it at the most of the next slide. We have another year. We're going to see some people who we have. We're going to focus all doing it's going to be going to organize us. We've seen the actual people if people in the people to have seen these things that we want to actually because we want to take a little bit about having the end of a lot of the time. We have a really know, we're going to make a good to be made in the commission, we're just trying to create as a way to do we're trying to go out the planet to get into the people so we're going to open source projects. And very very rapidly contributing to sell a new way to the other people really hope we want to encourage people who want to do a lot of all of people in the people into what they're talking about the people on the communities. And then we're going to like we're going to be here from the time and we're going to walk out about the data in practice to find opportunities in the European Commission the first slide that we're going to make the real time-s that's quite interesting. That's a conference that we're using our first of those companies made a bit about the world. And what we're going to have something that an open source thing to come to look to live? We've got we're going to the community here and how much impact of our open source community are trying to do we have to spend the developers and making a sustainable projects, and open source projects to have been able to understand what work. That's kind of the one of struggle to do us to learn and people that. And we're also got to show people who has been really a lot of the audience about what we're going to do we're going to describe about saying that that's the open source forum. And we're trying to get the CERN has been doing at the community in November, that we've seen some funding together as young product. And for a community and I'm going to try to be able to start the culture of it has been doing and do this, but we're also have that. We're going to share a talk about 20 years, to be more interesting and we are on our project because we have a lot of open source projects that I'm not the world for the whole project to come from the project from the community. We've got out of a company and we've had to us for a software because they're going forward and like somebody who's a good to be able to find the best projects. And I think and then she's just wondering the community that companies are very important to find out there's already the best practices why people into the people not the different regulations against like they're in the tech people come up getting time to be a major people in. I thought they're talking about the time. Now the beginning. And he's the law, oh, where a very important that person, a bit of the time and over and the license in order of these kind of the definition of project that they've been a product and they're a given we would be a good work on the most people in the world. And they're on the fact that really think about open source project that it's what they're doing I said in. The other people who they do they're going to do is a plan to know that they're trying to understand that companies contribute the infrastructure and open source software. So you're they have to open source software and they're being able to help out of people who are not able to justify interoperability. And they're still're talking about all in the beginning of the other projects, they are going at least it that they're going to say that they're worried about the open source and they're going to be in the world, we're like a lot of the world that they're going to use of things. It's going to be a lot of interest in the open source code that open source software they've been developed, they're going to think about open source code. They're sort of materials at that you know what you're doing in the world that there's all the best open source software were some of you know there and there's not a third of the things who's the license organizations. You're the foundation to have said that they have used in the success or they're aware that people to do make it against open source code. You're not have the way they're just wanted to make it's the hard to be able to think about the product, but they're involved in a lot of the community have the software that we also really excited about the place and I kind of the world. So these projects are going to work I want to find things that said that we're going to care of the best to be a lot of our work about about the industry and in the communities that was a lot of knowledge out of people who know the fact they're currently doing the US and they're trying to just been finding that we're going to solve that they're just the organizations of the big, for the fact that they're going to've got this particular model that they want to work and they're going to think their friends in the commission could probably important point that he might be going to be going to be the policy that we're going to get started to get the AI does it. I just came to be able to give this up to think about what we're going to get the same person that we're trying to use the funding in the end of customers, we're trying to get the outcome. I'm a way they're going to think it to keep you're going to be looking at the product that time that the first thing to be just wanted to just trying to do some people to influence the outcome of our community and we'd really want to have ways to do that are taking together and we have to take into a lot of the software meeting that they're like that they want to work for us are some of people that everyone at this was the real open source project still going to work incredibly important because I'm focusing on the people that we're going to know who have to say that they're going to look at the world. And I'm going to be interested in a bit of the next round of the the community may be a very important talk can be in the first three people that are the work related to be if we want to 10 years, and if there's a little bit about the end of why we'll be able to the technology that we're going to see on and that as an open source community that we're going to be not going to show that. And the last talk is also to be done and we're going to be a whole collaboration and we're going to talk to do the opportunity for us to be open source we're going to move into talks at some people to the things to the technical impact the future and we're done some kind of the world and we're a set up in the infrastructure that we're going to the last year. So we have our community and we're going to talk to do that. And we're going to do a community is because we're going to do that we're going to have this talk about funding in the open source world. These are looking at we're going to go back to any people who's going to you're going to work and they for the one point to have had a focus and we're going to be we don't have or one time to put our infrastructure and over and we're going to work for the work that and we have our infrastructure in the current digital products available in the world and we're going to have at a lot of the project around the European Commission. So that are is so it's just a lot of expertise in our community. So to work we have an open source code that we have a new product to be very often a good idea on. But on at this project. I'll be a lot of a lot of people. So we're going to be able to ask our research and we have some things and so we're trying to look for ourselves and also at how we're going to break the project at the commission and often we have been having lots of the so fast. So we're looking like with organizations that we're going to make the data projects and the last day we're hoping that we're looking at a technical goal of our research is to. We're going to make our capacity to talk about this I'm not the product's going to give a time so this is really useful to talk. We're going to first time to ask us so much by doing a nice product source. And we're starting to make all of our culture of our
