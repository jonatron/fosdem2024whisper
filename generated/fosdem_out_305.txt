 Okay, tell me, thanks foram, hello. Thank you for that. Thank you for everyone. Thank you. 
 Okay, thank you very
 Thanks for a little name. My name's going to talk, today I'm here about the internet with my Summer of the CNC Association. So I'm a new talk about the open source engineer, I'm the Mozilla Open Science and digital Foundation. So, I'm going to talk about how me from an University of OpenAI will be the Oovter and finally to the Productorship. I'm going to talk a bit about and Chrisias and today I'm going to do about what to have from our first F Software Foundation, but I'm going to talk about I'm going to present the European Commission here is about one of the Ministry of being launched a million topics. I'm I think my State of the new Open Science Foundation's going to be probably heard today that year the Commission and Airflow in this year. I'm going to talk about the CyberTech. Network in science in Brussels. And I was I'm going to bring back into OpenC and I'm going to talk about a couple of efforts to be like an idea that we have been created, with the PLD and that I'm about the last year. I also trying to get a foundation to get a volunteer. So I'm a little bit of a huge open source project called C++ project, which is a lot of the first of people with 20 years of Open17 implementation of the industry. And I'm a lot of open source in 2016 and I'm on the EUD community. I'm going to share a lot of a little bit of people from the first FOS project. I'm not going to promote the EU standards. And I've been started to develop year ago, and the future and has been a huge plan on this kind of OpenJDK 2. And of a long time, and the last year was the first year. So this is the history of a year in this year, because I had to talk. I'm not focusing on 20 years ago. So, I was a project called OpenJDK 2023 talk. I was a little blog posts, I've done in the last year, which is that's always actually a couple of the last year. I've heard about half years is a quarter of months when we have been discussing the European Commission. And that I had about the last year last year. And I think today I was the year, I think that this year, the panel, I probably is the lastly a little bit. And in the first reason of the project was that is that they're at Dripes is that a software software and she was open source knowledge to invest by its open source development. So since the open source and they've got a year. And so we've got a big round of the last six months to talk that a pretty much more years ago to do is was just a bit more in the beginning on as I don't know when we said I'm just released a lot of a bit of the only had was not going to do that period and the industry and they've ever did this and it who had on a good focus on. We had the EU Commission last year ago. We're going to do had to make a half the last year we just looking for the world and we've actually keep a time to make the European Commission was like starting in there. And that we had like one of the first person at 20 years because they were actually played around to just like we had a lot of you know about this product and things. And then yeah, everything in open source software is quite a research, if I'm going to look at the GPL one, to do is a question of the idea. But also do we're working on their own one of the money on the past that were like that they didn't have to get all the moment it and they want to be a long time when we're going to understand you're going to get a huge use data and I was just wondering to have a safety context of money into a product. So we're just would like this all this certification and we're doing this point where people who are developing a lot of open source community open source a lot of people for looking forward. And I'm not think that not so good and we were having a part now and making a lot of people already give people of money for their product. We've got one that if you know what they said, we can thank you. 
 All right. My name is talking about people are mostly have heard of the largest people to each of the number of the person who couldn't know that are going to make good ones. He thinks that we also as a lot of people that we're giving people who actually talking about. And we're going to do have a couple of open source software who have seen a few people have been thinking about how to make it done a long term that the software and now. So. I think about the software meeting room that we just talked about, how to do I hope that. I mean it's energy science that the first one of the European Commission was about this? And that we have had also in fact that was trying to be a lot of the technology that the European Commission and European law. What happens to say that was the last year here is their market and a good thing, and also the world. And if we were trying to compete with companies that. Two of the world and we are very interesting product. We have faced with the moment of a big news was that you said we had to be able to solve in Austin and we could be able to throw out a good to think we should be in this technology. And we've been going on the city of the things that have been around the question was important is as an important. I said that the German commercial legislation that we used the product there was about the world and there were a new software world as of people we've got to focus on the world and to be on universities and i had to open source software engineer was paid for the technology for many people in the software. So we were I'm not the PLD, we was even believe there was that in 2015 and I was in the Commission in the regulation was at last year, German law and we had said we had a huge world had even the problem of the law and you had into a lot of the first person to be able to work the same law law until it was that then it was just worked on and that it was a law and the EU Act were actually a company before a sector was done German law, and that was a sector just at the GPL from the German law of law and German law and she was published the US And in the commission was the only in January years last decade before this year. And he was the rights we've had been a directive. And would be open source panel at the moment the one of rights in fact that's like even an CRA and in here. And it was an panel and last year I didn't remember the regulation from the Netherlands and the EU could you got the German act because I was the law where you've were using a regulation that civil society also already involved that. And the only have got there was not so they had a member of law are some first one of a CRA was basically coming who had to be able to the rights that doesn't care of the fact that happened and they had the law so that this it was quite's not there was used we had to be in legislation which is a regulation to just that GPL and we went to try back to start to a German Commission, and what was going to share is that was, okay, so you don't have a risk to have to be a national law that the public license but the standard law was a law under the TPM's often there was the first law that they were any law and the licensee was the other copyright that they had all the copyright was not that that most politicians and that was a copyright law and policy was the policy in the copyright value to and a copyright commission was the copyright of law doesn't that so they had kind of copyright that. And that the course they knew he had a could actually had any market when I was mostly on someone has its law they were not. And the GPL would really and to be not be a commission. And yeah, you can do this value of that would be checked is an copyright copyright changes. But that the value of a long court of a only in the time and basically the license and we're already had this to be pretty clear policy could be useful and the copyright legislation is what the future, I said that law in copyright? But of the law that means of the would even going to have been moved forward to the copyright the law that you can be willing to a copyright copyright on the copyright of the law would be an money. And because I said, we asked that they did things like to happen. You can think that the law and just gave us to legislation of the license was the law even in German license directive just said this could also because nobody wanted to think that the court would contain the government think was allowed us to get into license and they had is that copyright, is the court law, into the licensee made a copyright license, we had no, but as an license to access key was the secret, but he was there was... But it was just is much, but it was the open uh have very important to know what they have would rely on the value of the Drupal or the decision that was the commission because they was made it's their law so exactly it was a very in the best you know that it's basically in terms of law and he went into it could be messed up and he's why just not actually told a thought of the risk was the value that the law that he had to the GPL would be paid, the moment maybe to think he was being made that actually had a to take away and the law it was the GPL law. We have, but that's something that the law that with the act as as far the copyright in and we have, then. So it's a good majority of the law was essentially is with that the law, that was the license is a law. This was that was very clear infringement initiative that it was usually useful that I had to find what it. It's the GPL violation was we had to say in the regulation that they're there. The GPL people are in government law. So you've been a license and they would be done. They were like GPL law and in the copyright law, they were some thought of the regulation, they were got to what happens on that in the value to a law that not the law, and they are aware that was actually an policy model to to the law, because they got away from copyright infringement is the license and they were making laws that they was always that open source legislation. They were to be in rights that much money, but they did be using copyright law because they were in the law in the court will just law, to value from a sense. They actually know that they're a copyright directive in a copyright license. And they are the only the license policy that the copyright would be the act and that they were the EU law to actually the commission. They now trying to law and being nothing didn't know the directive. Two licenses, a copyright to be done this Drupal directive, so that they could be not do and they had been used for exactly the legal policy and they know that was. I was given that were a directive is important to work. We still had, we made this notion of a policy, so they may know a policy had some of open source policy that, but they just put in the European value he went into the copyright a only in. They gave a democratic policy law. People may be the copyright infringement and a law that was a really the public law was not that at the case that's not had the digital court was really aware of law of the rights forecast is absolutely legal policy. And they guess this was just to the value of the space. And they are important point, and they didn't know that law that they were not the license. They might be a directive. So you know is really bad law. But we will be the market, that we have their law and they also had the copyright rights to provide a directive and they have had about law as well known as I would be done for many German law as long I don't ask that in the law was the license, that means you might be a court in this copyright law, they wanted to, you exactly about she asked or would tell you to speak the value of society, but you know whether they have the commission at the second period but they would have the court law. But you know I don't think't use problem that the court in there was there just to be a citizen and they didn't really care about the CRA world because software is a policy as the funding to care of legislation could be a second law and they do they said, but they could always know that they were not be had asked for the value in value of the US law because they had no parties that you know that the GPL law and they were a matter of license law would be even have no other law value and they haven't open source license could they were made that they had because they were often a public regulation and there were also a copyright court law had not at just a key because they said, there like commission were only directive that the law to act the directive and they could be. So the laws directive they are not that they know that they used from the legal law and open copyright is a German EU association that means not only the law and you know which is only had to be. I would be a law or something more as long time for a law that the only has made by law license they said. The GPL law law of you could this European value of time was a law said there were just legal needs like huge law. I were no matter that the value of law is something that the methodology? The law does not they want to forecast but they are the copyright so the term of law law and the law and they were the GPL law clause were paid that license was the law's a problem was developed in its opinion but they said to not no no idea that the law. But the rights would be as the parties that they haven't know that the GPL law means that would be the commission that under the national law often started by copyright law to do they're aware but they had no law in the
