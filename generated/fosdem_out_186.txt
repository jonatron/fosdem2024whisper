 So, if I was just like. So, we needed to make sure, if you're doing some errors with the logs, how it looks. So, we get a lot of other things. And then I'm going to talk about it in the whole thing I saw earlier. So I'm going to run it at a very first time to talk about how to be used, I would love to make sure that we have to store it to query, on the first one, which is going to show you that the other thing. And if you talked about the one of the rest of it's going to try to look at this particular. And that's used this is the documentation that you can make it really, then we do and ask only provide a much better than using the result. So this's you, in the state of the original one for the data. And as a concept that you allocate a file which is it's important for the fields of the schema. It's the table that you want to get what the function that I don't have. And this is that I'm not just going to be the only going to have examples but this is important in the method like that, we need to get to do it in fact I put on the whole. Here we have some kind of the other library called the stack where the thing we always need to be shown before, which is the value of the algorithm are going to be the code for the first commit that we just as an array on our thread, which means we go to add a function for every method that we need to be executed and then we're going to create a instruction and then keep it's going to show the next value. So the value to be, this point one is what's that the representation of a value between result itself is how to be an immediate value that the value between the result is going to be going to be taken into the value, the value for that is the names of it's going to do the dictionary if you can choose. But we can do something like if you can then we want it's okay, what we have a function as far as you want to have an equal in the table. So the value to see that we have this, we have that we want to tell it's what we have in our fields that needs to do. So we're going to be able to use the properties so we have to add two threads and the function and the value in that we just the result to allow that is the next instruction is going to set. We want to have some so. So we have to try and we have some issue for this. So we're going to see it's going to do this thing that we have a function into the function because we're the function that the function for that I don't do is kind of this is like this a function in it's going to another function and say okay, I'm going to run. I'm going to be going to say that we have this information that this problem. So what's the first time that's not going to work in the only in the value return value of the value and in the request. And then we've got the table from the read the, y and we call type of this is the result in our struct that automatically to be changed. And if we're going to look at the object that that those function and then we have the function that I don't know that I think it was just does want to get into a return it happening. Okay, but that this file is going to register, so that it's going to this function. So when we had a function and I just this in your address and the stack was the object variable. So we were this. And the first thing is very simple. This is this, I want to add a function right now. And then I put an equal array is just saying we just an error because we want to do that into the object in the function but basically is where we need to use case, but so I'll talk about the value of the argument. So I want to just looking for example, there are going to do. So it for example, again, we did I'm going to push the same, I'm not doing this point, we offer that we call to create a pool. So I said, I'm going to say, right, the line. I'm going to look at some code. Okay, what I will be able to talk to look at the whole version of that, we have the right? Because the beginning, we can just have to make a cache. So I'm going to have to add this point. So if I'm going to wait is the function within the same instruction. So it's the order to talk that I have been running on the IO to the moment. So, I'm going to write a small part of course I can match some value in the first one it's looking at the function. We call that you can see what I'm going to go out. I'm guessing an option that I'm going to give a bit about the slide that I'm going to see what I'm going to show you can I'm going to be going to have had to see it out of a few examples. Yeah, I'm going to add a couple of an extension that just going to me. I'm going to do this going to use the thing that would be the last iteration of these two? Yeah, I'm going to show you're going to do that, so that and there were going to say this. It's going to show me up the code. And I'm going to show as I'm going to find a number of the people we'll going to share and you and we're going to do that we're going to just the inputs. But I'm going to do the object and do things like add a bunch of one to do. So I'm going to tell the first one of course I'm going to look at one of these things and so I have a lot of the table value or I'm going to react to show to see the question. And I'm going to show you why should remember here here. So you an ad in Fita and I'm going to run GDB on a bit of the right and I'm going to do I'm just wondering tell you have this here to be here and we are going to one Xwiki. We're going to keep going to actually going to get so we can start by going to be able to join us how to speak to wait for us. So I'm in the list. Okay, as I'm just going to say. I'm you. Whatever you can see this talk about it's going to say I'm going to start to be the end up to talk about this talk about what is the new to see and I have a lightning talk about it open source code. I'm just a language, and the models, which is the things that is the one is very quickly. So I'm going to say that you are the one is very quickly, which is probably going to be like what we need to be going to do. So I think I'm going to have a developer about the rest of the next question. I'm going to do. So this is we have a good idea of this, we have to have in the C++ code for the kind of an online. We have the European Union did, of a strong analysis, the most interesting thing that we don't have a very quickly show that many people were. And we had a lot of course, people that we've been working on it was going on the last three months, but they're going to be honest, but some years ago, but no, you know what we would you have to make this project, so we're going to talk to talk about that we're going to talk about how it? But if you would you are going to say, you're using different people do we're going to work and we want to start a project. And maybe we want to be talking to get into those, we work in CERN, we want to get a community, and have the I've been doing that we'll talk about the question, why I've got great person who are we're going to make out. So I'm going to be able to know, we've been doing this kind of the things. We're going to start to talk what we'll talk to talk about which we're going to stop the end of going to get this. And this is that we're going to do we're going to be talking about today. We're going to bring this, and is that we're going to continue it. So I'm going to talk about is going to talk about what we're going to coming from our goal. And today we're going to try to tell you have a lot of how you're going to talk about. And I'm going to talk about it, what we want to give you to turn it as we're going to keep going to talk about what I'm going to be going to keep this we have talked about. The most of interest in the product, I've got talking about what I'm trying to be in the community. And I'm going to get to present another talk about being doing and a community. It's going to build out of people in the work because we want to add our community and love this is just in the world. I'll get to start working is a lot of the community. But I'm a lot of the people are often and they are like you're going to have like people an open source code and the open source code and the license that we have to make it. We're going to go back to the community repository being a very important that's very important thing. Or I'm going to try a good thing, I'm going to work at our product. So with the whole version of us, this is open source, like a little bit the person that we have been doing this is a good, absolutely great community, we have to do. And I saw I think that. I am going to go into open source community. But I'm going to be speaking about looking at this and the company and I said, like I'm talking about this is I'm going to show you so we're trying to share. We have any people that. I would like, it. I'm going to ask me. I'm going to have a thing, less comfortable with people are writing community and they are going to be a reason? And I have to mention it, we also a good idea to keep this talk about what we're here, for more about the language. Thank you very much. I'm going to give a lot of code that we're going to do is that and make it's going to be going to say who can be doing so much other tools that. I'm going to say it, I could have a lot of what we talk about the team. So it's a good. I'm not only going to be talking about, if we've proven to talk about the community and how do I have to know in a little bit. And I've heard about the last one, a little bit more about the project working engineer. I'm going away. I was I'm going to show me. But I'm sorry, I'm not going to talk about the way I have to start to wait for staying up the front end of the next one, which is you're not like I'm going to see how I'm going to do you guys. And I'm going to do you hear that you. So I'm the microphone. And I'm going to talk, my last year today is going to talk about. And I'm doing the first round of the main thing. And I'm going to take at the same time here. So I'm a very happy to share of the back to start, but I'll stop the last year. I'm going to add questions. So, I'm going to present your attention. So I'm and I'm a good afternoon. And I'm going to go to do. We're just going to introduce us about the future of my email app and we're curious about it. So as I'm going to talk about the room here for the last year ago. So I'm going to stop again, I'm going to introduce us. And I'm one of a little bit about writing my next. The first one is that I'm just in the real I'm just wondering. There's the fact that I'm doing a bit about that the video and making a little bit of the next step. It's why I'm also working in the first round of the slide, I'm just wondering for the front left, which is a very quick video. It's in a little bit of the door. It's a little bit of the next one of a few talks. What I'm going to introduce the room. And I'll show you'm working, I'm already heard about that I'm going to start about to introduce the screen for a little bit from a bit about how it. I'm going to talk at the screen. I'm also the software engineer at the source project was a lot of these years ago, I began the maintenance, I'm going to present by the latest round of time. So this project, my thoughts on the first year I've got. There are the Internet. I'm saying, I'm going to do you to try to work in here. And I'm the project. I'm going to present the first day. I'm going to stop. I'm going to start working. I'm going to go a few of American last talk about that I'm going to talk about it mostly about the last year and he's going to talk, we're just asked that. So I'm a PhD in the University of our founder, you were moving open source software engineer at the first focus of the end of Mozilla first, I'm giving a long to 20 years ago, I'm going to work on, more focused on open source software because we're going to talk about the last year. This is the software team. We're going to contribute to be my panel to make a back and actually up to the world and I'm going to tech. And that has to give a discussion of a few weeks. And I've been in the year ago. I am Robin. I'm in the last year, it was seeing the last year at the years ago, the last year, I'm just wrote in 2023 and I'm hoping to present, who am
