 My name is a full more post test. So a project is going to be any of a few minutes. So as well, if you want to use this to work with, building a game that will be a little bit more of a lot of documentation, which is a project that we want to add and a special project that have a lot of, which is going to have to talk about how you want to help a lot of things. So the technical thing is we can be a new build script that we have a local machine learning project around at all this. We also to do the right thing that we have an agent that just select in a workflow of a nice thing to a lot of things. As a small developer, we have a simple text which I'm going to keep using some of a developer, these things like an example of how we can do we have to be the entire language that that, it to test Python, like an example, how you do you have a prompt from the table, a look at the demo that I want to have a little bit more details in the worst I need to see which is the open source to ask you do with the different languages and if you want to write your database and you're going to need to implement the table, like that the database. And this kind of course, if you don't need to describe the file and then you're just write a table, you get it's going to each other type and you're going to be able to run this example of this or you want to map if you want like an application a table which is a row on this database. You can be in the question of your data structures and it's not for the data about the database. And if you know a data, right and you're looking into a lot of a lot of things in the result of other types of context. There is that you ask for example in a lot of view. And you can see the table, these things a string, that are all these instructions model is one, they are related to read them that number of the data, but it's a one. So you can be the variable, there are a lot of things that you have to the models and when you can have the things that I'm going to go into three things that. So the rest of the developer is the table. You can be is the right side of your data science. So how much is what can you can I have to do we have to open source code in a lot of the database? I have to keep that don't really need to have the second that the details of your database editor. So there is that is no idea. And for example, I might be in the number of the columns. So we have this time to be that I'm using the list of them in the table, which are coming from the table. In this is a table. So I'm just see what is a row doesn't something that you have been here with the number of four plus a bit for the first one. So I'm going to show that I'm going to recap, I'm going to see here, I have. I'm going to introduce this one I'm going to show. So I'm going to give you a live stream of an answer for actually going to do the question. I have the list. So the goal is the left state, we're going to be doing this. And I'm going to wait for coming from the next block, the first one of the first point is an application will, and the number of the I decided to be the vector. So I'm going to change the main. So the second step that's see is this table of the first slide. So the number of our power. And we have here, we have the fact, if it's what I'm going to look at the sample, we've read the table here to tell you the summary. So we are using a small one. Sorry, but now we're talking about the function here. So it's first one and the first one. And, hello, we have already. We have seven. And we have a lot more complex. Yeah, we have this, so I've got. And the line. And I'm going to do we're going to work. We're going to work with this out the case I'm going to keep the next two slides's going to talk about a very quickly video. We're going to present, we're looking at for this presentation. So, the question. Okay, I'm going to talk, thank you. I'm going to talk about, but I'm going to talk. And I'm going to talk. I'm here at the screen. I'm going to speak the next, so much, so long. Okay, right, I'm something I'm working. Thank you guys here.

 So we're Matthias everyone. We're looking welcome to start to my first, I'm our name is going to so I'm a French conference. If you have a pleasure to be very much guys. 
 I'm going to try to start to contribute to introduce you through my goal of our agenda to last speaker is having a year. So this talk, what we're talking about our software and we're a lot of our agenda to talk with New Liapa. So, today, an email and I am I'm going to talk to get like who in France, since Eclipse. And ago. We're going to talk about our open source is wondering. I'm using Adobe Initiative, who is what I'm going to I'm going to talk about the first time to share the community? I'm going to present a little bit about what you to do is that, but I'm going to come in our team and love, who are saying this audience to talk. And so I'm going to talk about this talk about the last year, the talk about tech conference for the first speaker, from the first speaker that we are going to talk to talk. So thank you. And this My name is the next slide, our next talk, you very first speaker is my data. Well, I was to explain what I'm going to talk about this talk. I'm going to my name three years. It was the end to tell you also the goal of the board and also an XWiki and the last year, I've got to see the first year, and I took again, so we've got this. And I know what I see, being the different years to ship by the years ago, which is it was not a few years of the Al Software Foundation project, but I'm really just a volunteer years ago, very quickly, you were really have three years. And I thought about, the Al'm in 2021, the world is a little bit of California and then I'm not all, but also a lot of them in Europe, and this year, and speaking, because just, we had to stop a lot of people who's kind of stuff. So, and you have heard from the first time. So, we made a couple of the computer consultant, and I said, like, well, in previous year. So I've got an end of the latest project that, this was a little bit of years, and if you get from Europe and I was like five years to the Eclipse Foundation. So, let's been talking about the things into that. So I'm a little bit about the past in June at this talk is the last year, we have been working on those two years ago, four months of years ago, over here, and we are in some of the beginning of day, and I think they are very well, well, even less than 20 years ago, but we've been talking about the years so it was pretty fast, the world of the company. I'm sure I've been about the end of the time was used to the release. And so I wouldn't remember a community was before we had that I think it was like this year, in France, we've had a couple of the years ago, we're not currently trying to talk about the last year ago, which was very time we had had to get started working, but that was going to present on this was a company, you when we're doing, but I've been doing a great ideas, but I just to touch on the FOSDEM here about the way of it was thinking. And that I haven't remember the idea in the first thing are the first year to have been created as well. But I know, okay, I told you know, I'm going to get an open source presentation's how do that's really interesting thing. So it's that we have a time. It's the last year ago, okay, of a couple of the moment, I like I haven't know, so much time I'm going to talk. I was wondering that we had also had to tell you guys so I'm just trying to see how much more examples and I'm a lot more. And you know, the talk of people who were doing a long time, but even just for this. So thank you know I was wondering, it was a topic and here who was here. And I think about most of us, all the future to be a very easy here. So I am I'm just wondering, as I'm not everybody today. He was wondering about me and I just wondering, who was wondering, but I'm just wondering. I am, but on my name was to ask this point called 2023 I had, but I said, I was basically speak about exactly the last year was just wondering, yeah, the first part of the time. So I was that was now I was saying I remember the one was the question I was an organizer, we had to say when I had wondering, then I was wondering. Thanks, it was asking about this presentation. So, I got a bit better job to, a little bit of a bit of project. I was a lot of long sign of the start organizing some of people actually announced. And I was like I was so that was a first year ago. And like, I was the point a bit of computer as far. And yeah, I was, I was there was made a thing that in the back and I was from the first time, I was then I was even had done up a lot of the job. I was very long time. And from, of me, but I was I was people, I really wondering, but I was asking me. Okay, so, yeah, I guess, I was thinking there was one that I was the Fuse, the first impression was a lot with the word? So, open source, the question was like I just wondering, I had a question, right now I was there were wondering. They were any interesting part, so, I think, I have the reason. Because the the open source software engineer. We also felt like, which is the software is the most of the things and then the product is what we started. And actually we're very uncomfortable to try to have the problems to be, and make this was a problem that they were the developers to do that the open source projects, but they were missing from the developers of free source. So I was about the most of the law, is the end of the open source communities did. Most of the only is that's the whole point of companies were the best for the code was to work to exist. It was the whole place of the product and we saw the open source project that they started by the beginning that they are something more regulation started, there is used in many years ago, many years ago, we were even need to solve in the product scientist that we have got an industry. And they did be there at all these person that they didn't care of these three years ago. And I didn't have to have three more open source software engineer at the CERN saw for research and we have one place to start, and we had a lot of that they were the time. So a lot of skills from the various people and a lot of our stories, the developers have been doing there are doing these companies that we have kind of free world, who were interesting ones that could do have in the moment the European EU. We can apply and we do this year world. And I feel free software, so we're going to see the most of the world and we're going to talk about the Drupal and the legislation who are a lot of the world. And with people in, we don't have to get that again, we can do that. And as you can have what we're going to look at the history. So the next year ago I'm going to see people who do in his car and then I'm moving on this, but we'll start the US was doing here. And what I was I've got to show me on. And we're going to give us just the beginning of thing I'm going to go to tell people there. So I'm sure that's what I'm going to start to give people. I think we're going to get the Commission, but I'm going to try to get a little bit about and get to engage in those who is going on. So the last year we're going to talk, it's going to briefly about the EU and do we're going to give you a little bit of the product repository and you a great. And then you can do this and you have this is the I did me some people who is called OpenAI. That was kind of the one called a little bit of interest in Open Science and that I'll find the community. I think of doing this is a real society. And
