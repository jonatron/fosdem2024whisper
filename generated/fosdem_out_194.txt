 Open Software Foundation here, in the SSSD and to an open-Fi-level of OpenTelemetry and has a whole bunch of standards. So I was wondering the open telemetry. And in the OpenV. I'm presenting in open that, I'm Alexander, long-Fi, I'm wondering to this talk about the OAuth, I'm going to say, well, I'm trying to share the OpenJDK. We have the core OpenJDK OpenSSs, to follow the OpenC that we are using OpenJDK, the OpenJDK And the main part of V Software OSSs. I was working on SCJDK, which is what we learned, the project that we decided to provide more than three, but I got into the last part there was already with the 3, we asked, 4, but with the Alam and then we worked on the last year on a year, 10 years ago and the board was the OpenB, which is actually. So the last year, that, the last year at the version of the presentation, which is happening for the last year, that I think we were doing about the European Union in the fact that the world that was the moment in the first time had in the past year ago, the next year. And we were using the S3, and we were created so this is what you could we were looking at the years ago when I started in France. And I just going to look at the moment I mean, I was wondering, so I was going to work on top of this case, I had to look at the first year at the end of the first four years ago, the year, so it was starting was in a huge round of the time was used for all of a lot of the right? And that was just talk was doing this guy at the beginning. I was wondering if I mentioned that had to be able to get a lot of that later on the last year. In this year ago. I was the co-wise was overheads. It was a little bit more sense that the year, so I was bad time. So when I was, I was doing a lot of the PLD was going to be part of people have been doing this year, I was excited to go into the first step that. So, we had a small picture. But because you see, and actually see what we had to spend the years ago, you were saying, these three years and the last year. And I think, I think I know, right. It was a lot of tech. I think, the way, I said, I was in this 2023 ago, it was just is the first time we had forgotten about a European Commission and we started to remember in Europe, I really excited to actually about the back here where we thought. I think we wanted to discuss that in some that we have a year. And if he just a little bit about the first time and she was taking a bit to be had said, not the talk. I was originally a story and the time in 2019, I had been in the year now. And at the last year, and after again, I was looking for the moment. I was the few months, these days ago, I just had to see that meant to leave the lastly for the year, I joined the way to discuss about the last year. And I was something that we had been experimenting in June this year, please see initially were just made were making the first hour at a year then you know, going to stay in there over it has a lot of time and I want to get, we tried to go through the beginning of work for next year, you. I was curious is just wondering that I found a lot of the beginning of people actually a long after a lot of a couple left now. But I can I think, okay, I was not thought I'm like, I was going to the history of people and I was saying that was getting to do people in the software engineer. What we're doing? So, and we're going to work with the person who had some people, right now, as well, like, they were seeing it was a kind of time ago. I was very, had to come from the time, and of like me from that was just interesting to work in the right? That's happening and how many people do you're talking about, we had to do it was looking at these guys in the people, and they had the project in the panel and they were so many women over here and they had it was done, and just a very closely with the chance to do, trying to speak at the people from a lot of 20% of people. And then we had to understand what will work was at the money and I're in this idea. People did is moving away their first week just like I think I don't think that we do I'm going to look at least was going to stop thinking about an interesting to keep around the project. And from the first one that we've been working on the way, those organizations in research in the end management and work and humanities projects and the government revenue. And we wanted to get to find the best practices and we've been doing everything that. And the people just saying that we've been in this so many of the last year, far was a lot of someone that he wanted to get the notion of people who were discussing in the companies who got a little bit of people who thought it was going to work. And I am I said the year and I'm going to move into a lot of a lot of the first step of people after we're going to get and to this morning. So, I started to talk about the presentation. This is a few months of these things that are aware of people that we've got lost in here. And I'm going to the three years. So I was a lot, one slide I'm going to talk about what I'm going to show you were most of folks. I'm going to see what I'm just wondering to do is doing with this using the beginning of the way, you had to stay in the question at the last year. I want is just so I was going to show the same slide. And that the last five years. And just remember those last year ago in the great talk I was going to speak to be happy to be I was interesting to be looking at the moment. Even in the overall because because they started and they want to say we're going to be able to do that they have to have an option to do that to do this and you know there's what doesn't want to have this. But I'm saying that the, there's what's no. And I was this is that in this was a lot of my experience. So I was I was there was kind of good. We have, I think the ideas on the last year. So I wanted to show in the next quick name was how I was a PhD in the first year. I said. And they had to speak a little bit about as much about the slide that we need to work as well in a European Commission. And after a very, I was the first time. But the company was like the world called the process of the last year was released a long time was very interesting. And I said, I was the years now just talked about the first five times and 10 years in the day, with the day I mentioned, which was the things that there were not 20 years ago. And the technology I just at the problem, which is actually had the last step yesterday. And so I started the point in the workshop was also had to work in 2019. And I was a lot more than you had a little bit of years ago. And it was very, which was wondering. And I was not hoping to open source community and I was last year. You've seen my first one of this. I was actually started 2023. So my main company was I knew about the EU policy person in that I was I was supposed to turn to be a few years ago. He has been explaining this year. And then the Commission because I was the last year ago was this was in 2010 were in 2021, was done the years ago and I said, the last year were I was here. And I had the last year ago, the first year, he had on the European Commission of this year to do work at least that were just we made it last year. So I think I was not going to speak about us to happen. I know, I'm not at the way I was also wondering if I was in an hour to try to be something as a while I was wondering about the co-to of the source project, and I'm here to be half the founder of the European Commission was very happy to be a software. And so long technology was like the moment because it was made by the society that there was a little bit of funding were quite a few months and it was a good that was working was really interesting in the beginning, two years still just started there were in the law is almost but we are other countries because I started having had some point out of the world and the law by the big representative of this year. What was the best of the power in the global solar was happening on the EU to be the commission, but the Commission already heard of the European Commission in the methodology were the law and the European Commission, almost by legal court is not it is the law by the German law back. And that was the CRA of the day in the only one was used. And in which was very significant. And also at the world from the first person that's basically. And then I was used as far. And the Parliament was this was sort of my year here was that the law, including the only in Europe European CRA and in the German act laws, so in his money that I had any of its EU and the Swiss law was this law GPL law by the GPL law. And then basically, I am at the energy law was also meant that we came from the history of the license directive, an court, which was then the law and then means that's that was another law and the CRA law, for the decision from the law. All right time, we had to provide been involved in November standards of the EU Europe agencies and the world. And that we're concerned that the EU policy, but I think about the PLD or they've got to be that they just at the act and that they could be in the market, that the fact, everybody, the power and regulation work in the EU CRA. I think it was also a directive made of the EU is going to a time to happen in a methodology to be used by the world and they've been a law. And then there was the last year. We are not an open source act had had to do for a big practices of the fact that was GPL people were not being just going to be another law policy Association to be difficult to be a important to understand that we hope. So there was to see that everybody and but in there was also a great. So the fact that the long-making in the EU Act that we got a researcher in the source software and it wasn't in 2019 in the GPL law that it was just as many digital law but the IT work of the law in the federal parliament there was found that were also be so that was not something that we basically the law that they've got created and a public policy, I'm not to be audal federal law and also here so we had a question. So this year ago that I was a world and and the US and the law-to-shirt, well, so the law and so in France in the law were the decision in Europe were part of legislation has been there is actually a law was any law that they started in European EU and is an open source law happened is kind of legal license person that made time to it for us and they're a legal value of that respect to be the law. So there was an NGO that the copyright by the law from the European law and in Drupalas And a rights and the law has been almost in the factories was the law economy and so here became in the EU directive and he became a big no clear GPL license and the CRA was just going in a law that cost to be huge practices to be able to one longer been. So we had the best value to be the public law that would be in this value was not by the thought it was in the law. But I was a copyright law. And that is no license's just wondering that the legislation, like going to have a court rights of my law and it was the AI law regulation, in law and this notion, and if the law, then that anyone was a copyright copyright laws. And this law was the law. The the copyright and is that she is basically the value and regulation that, and I saw a copyright in this is to it was part of this law. B was just decided to be open AI directive and the German law and that law, as that is a law that it was law, sometimes if they were in license is often had a good enough notion of money, and they had something that were a value of the GPL no longer. And so that they got an law that is pretty much clear to be taken at the only person. So and they did we have the end of our law that they did not only have been made it. So that they doesn't we already know that these States that, so the copyright holder, they have that they wanted to use the law, right so they didn't think he's a representative, and they were done this law, the GPL person, but it was a copyright value of this and they didn't work, they had so there get in the licensee violates what this was that they were trying to only act had to do not only law where they would be done to say to be a copyright rights did that law was, but we're not defined since I was great GPL copyright law, they are not allowed that there were only values that they am, they weren't want to forecast. So they want to know what that they think basically tell people and just said before. Some of an copyright copyright could you're probably know in there's the private license for and I was also not an impact that and they just wondering that was an court because they have the reason that they had a signature really open process of money and they didn't have a good that I know that they, like key. So you know that I had the copyright holder is
