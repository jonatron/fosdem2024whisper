 I am going before you're going to start about the next year. Some of our projects. We can say that we want to need to have to send the build the source code that we've seen what we have to get in our project we've been using it to get into our project around some people back into the front of the community. We've got a little bit of a long time to a few years. We'll do something as a very good project but we'll be going to be able to compile time as a lot of work on this stuff because we've been doing the community I have to focus why we go into our own people to get more, but we are going to have a little bit in the world we're going to build or at the university and we're going to get into people who have any of all right front end up and thank you very much everybody for very much everybody for coming back, thank us, a lot of people that we've been talking about me. We've got to having to do this. We've been working on this area where we've been doing the people know what we've got that is do was in a kind of a bit of a lot of the work in that the time in the first version of our community as a lot of these areas that the European Commission and we had in a lot of developers actually realized that we had a lot with open users for all on a lot of people of so we get a lot of people that they gave us and open source we would like a lot of a lot of people for almost focusing on the future in the last year we had a very much work on the community companies so that we had to avoid our teams, but we said we've been using our next couple of our community foundations and we did this place to deliver funding and we're going to give back and it so the project that they've got us a long time open source project in the point and we have been getting a couple of how long-shirt from the community people have been not a lot of products that we're a lot of proprietary year and they're very clear work. And we're saying and they're going to find out. And we've worked with us know the most of the current projects we have been doing that we're interested in 2021. And so they have been saying do is why we get up their best to say we're in the big product where we've had this little bit of the software we have they're talking about the majority of a few people that they do we're gonna talk from the talk about the product that we're what were doing is in the last year, very important to be about the world. And finally this is the first two years, the moment. Actually these tools are working group at the kind of the question. So you have a lot of the last one we've been working on the community is that have a bit of people who has a good room and so the project with the most open source community and the last thing we're doing these companies, but we think the university like to have been working on the fact that the first aspect of the knowledge in these are not to actually I think came back to present at this is that the whole big product about the community who did in and then we've been doing a company and we have been working on open source community and I thought I've been working on it was very often in the commission. When a little bit in the money to be very well in the work and they've been mentioned he had to keep the code and that I ended up to say that people that they were done in that you know all of an open source projects that they're all these organizations that very long that they've made all know that people who're looking at the software and they're doing them and quite a lot of the open source, but there's very interesting thing where the people just said that there's the moment. They're going to have been a lot of the right? I think that I know that's a lot of the world and they're going to keep that we're going to're going to talk. We're happy to talk, just going to be at the conversation of a few years in the community can share like I have been with the real co-source software engineer in the first year. I'm going to have a year. I also one year 20 years in a lot of a bit more stickers to talk of other people about the code and why he has a huge talk of course years ago for the world, but on your software software engineer had to be a year in here, right now. It seemed want to be able to be a long time to stay in the software and then trying to solve any talks and and you're going to review the community and you're going to get to be any thoughts on the open source software and the project that they're doing was a good and they're, but they're going to encourage everyone who have their product and they're all the work out and you know what we're going to, but they're going to get the work with the very early conference and they're going to talk about the European Commission is going to each and we've had some of the EU team who came up to sort of the product that we just got to get them, and've been kind of got an organization and just to the whole new topic. We're using society were going to help us to do that we know about all these organizations, are kind of these companies are not the European Commission on the work on the software and many people who have done and they have been having the world. Like if that I'm going to make the world of that the EU projects who can't do and the same thing to be this community, it? We're going to be great and we've got funding to have been doing this's going to accept the EU community, to have to try to solve the knowledge in the IT definition of the OPT Association, but we have been doing that the end of the DrupalEs and so we're going to make that we're going to make this is basically become an open source community liability in the beginning of the last year to be in 2009 and we got since we're doing it an Australian government Europe. That's so much so we'll be a lot of knowledge that we're using Drupal and we've heard about the legislation from the AI funding and we've got that have the national EU, which'd have been in the first decade in the company, and we can have been the world of the technology, which is, the world and we've been speaking of research standards and I'm I was going to last year of mine that was three years now that is going to be in the public world in Germany, which will be in the EU and I'm going to kind of the people that I think about the standards and we're going to talk from the first to do and I think that. But in open source community that's the European software was the last year at the Commission has just working on the EU economy and the first year. And then we do we had to be able to maintainer of this with Europe in the European Commission since 2018. And the first week. So we get started having a company was working on the copyright field of a copyright in terms of the fact that the negotiations will be very often has been also helped us have been part of how we also as far to make the time to people have to make our work in terms of our software is basically had a representative of what they could be open source software since I said that we have not have a lot of the most of money. And the last year. And now we've been focusing on the EU laws which are the commission in the principles, in Europe that the end of the problem. And the first thing we have was trying to be a copyright liability in open source government and said I decided to think I came to get into the same point to all had then the license that. And so many companies really am I've been a law and he had that was very good opportunity to kind of the code to look out in the same person was the tech that we have been doing a few thought that were not a lot of a good part of that had seen this was the market first talk is like that he was really want to think that in this is in the foundation and it was really's not even like an open source space to be about open source but I'm just wondering that I think I think I was asked a lot of the first that I was like I was mostly to be speaking and I that like I wanted to keep talking about trying to continue to do that, you who was wondering about us, but this technology. I said I'm going to see what I was good example and I was working a lot and I think there was an idea for me is that, and I was that's maybe I discovered that it in many people to get talking about open source software but I think you're all the people here I was what I'm coming, but I wanted to my colleagues around the big person who they're seeing that you can't know if they were out this and they're on the last year. They were not very often in the negotiations, I think the end. I was wondering. That was wondering, but I think that'd thought, but I was completely focusing on the open source community of these words, the moment was very famous. And before I'm sorry, we just wondering. It was released again, for those the first sort of the last year, I think the first point was the first thing into the most interesting is, which was that we had in the community. But we had to work at least yesterday, what I were a long time to do we were to have to do. And all the end of being done in CNC projects in the previous years that I was happening at the EU, but we needed to work on a nonprofit because we know, a time, but it was really, but for about quite well, but maybe we had to, but you know, and so I was there's more work on the first discussion about the foundation and something not very interesting because there were just many days. They are a lot more people trying to know what they were the future and is not there were just know, yeah, but in a clear, there and there, so the best big world was no, but they were these are also said, but right? So, but that you know, which we have a good. There were there was a lot of Blockly in our best for a lot of time from the things for those were a few things here because of things are the outcome. I think that's that's the way of code we had a very interesting thing that we can be for people. We did we can be the work well, which we want to find something about the code that we have a lot of the challenge of things we have really want to be a lot of that we have the library that the libraries for that are building a lot of our library of different communities like the vendors that we don't use cases, but we have had to get our product, we use cases, look for example what this software have in and so we talk, we're at the community project is really want to think it. We still want to be really want to have so many people that we're going to know why we're going to do we've got to make some people all going to do. So the people know I'm going to change these people that we'll be going to keep talking about is about the things. And I'm going to use here. We're going to collect the community because we're not going to do this curriculum, hey, like, we have a person who are going to have the project to be doing this is an open source community. It's going to go ahead and please get to talk and get some questions? So we have one of the question. We are our software developers. But and we're working on our projects. We're going to step to be able to be the community of the product. And we have a lot of the project going to work on how we're going to start to go out of a software, we're going to have to be just the open source in in in the government. So we're going to benefit for us to be going to be the day. We want to be a value of the open source world in this kind of the work at the years, of a really been been working on the process. We need to have this time to be able to be a software is to bring the world. And we're going to how you to open source. And a directive. And I'm just wondering how we want to move to be open source software? I'm going to some of people, we're going to maybe just going on their goals here for us of the world, so on it's the European Commission in the Commission, and we're going to get someone who will give it to the way to see it's the European Commission and European railway and they're gonna one of a company who said, but they're going to go down and to us the first of the European Commission and that may make it's the world. So obviously important thing in Germany like that's about that we going to make the world, okay. So that we've been some people who're going to be in different on the reason for EU regulation that. And so we have been co-bomb, what I mentioned, about the last year to be here we have a nice open source, a major one of course, but we've been working on the EU institutions, but for our organizations are here, which is kind of software, do not so on them we have a point if the third one day. In the European Commission, we have been creating public policy. And we're not use of the EU, we're going to be also have been discussed on the funding to be in the cost that everybody to emphasize that part of standards and said, to be the world, was. And of AI liability in that we have also used to use the software that they want to, product of the EU European Commission, that they have been started here that we were probably know. And I know, this year, we haven't have a lot of the UK, we did that they had to look at least the commission. And there were going to a member-off was the notion of the open source regulation that I mean this really need to come to create a huge impact of software. And so the first one of a different IT license and a question was a scientific institutions are
