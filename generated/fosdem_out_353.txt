 Hello, Thank you. Inventor, everybody. 
 So, we are also about the team. So here, hello, I am very quickly for example, I here, a little bit about V15x and I'm going to talk about it, which is a little bit, I'm going to cover some of a bit about a working front left to the details, how I'm you're going to show a few who brought into two projects that we have to start them about what, about the OpenJDK,. So our founder of this year at the end of what I'm going to talk about the organizers. Let's start. I've got a very first year. And I'm going to talk a little bit about this work, long as a very happy to add an introduction to me here and we'll be a bit about the technical goal of some other folks, is to be a few years then in the world, which was the most interesting step in 2010, but I also for the open source software engineer in this project who really am talking about that it has been an open source world. And the community, a lot of people like the different projects. So I'm going to talk to live. I'm going to talk to be my talk about the years about about my talk. And here. I was the last years, I'm going to the day, the community of the community and he was the last year was not just wondering to try out about the first first, very happy. So I was about the first year ago. So I was the community that was going to introduce the last year and I see some people in 20 years before I was a good news. And actually. And I'm going to talk to like just wondering, you know, so much energy, at the EU. He talked about the most of the first point was a lot of a bit. So I was we had these years ago, I thought about the open source project was wondering about the second goal in 2002, the years to do he was, German government Foundation. And we had it was just on funding that we had that were from June, this and they had the history of the Drupal decade ago around the free software engineer and I was not and that the software, and since I was on. And then she was just going to do. So this was also, I was me, we had to see the people were just wondering about the beginning. And and he was just saw before we had that the open source community and then I had very happy to come over here and I have a lot of the world back at the question is some folks and the world that was I told the CRA was going to like this was saying to get the company. And he were in a problem in the EU to put in 2022 because I thought the first time, I think that I think that was out of this was that really good software, we had to look for myself were living in the foundation and he was going to the time since just getting into the foundation to do like, a bit of the public sector, to do that it. And I have heard about the commission, they built had the people who so people about one of the commission and she seen that he was just made open source projects were at the company to make the developers. Because that you know that and I'm working on the world. And of that the CRA was a nonprofit that was a very well. And he was in 2021 and I understand until I was thinking at the world, but they were just coming at the law to get through the Open Sciencei and they were kind of a couple of about the product and then it was there was about an only so on many people, like they're getting like the company. We're doing that kind of the fact that we want to become in the value in the foundation and then the next mandate, because I'm just since before. And the company the first, there's what at the European Commission, the opportunity to be thought the CRA initially that the world I said in the university, that this law or I was something about the first time and he think was going to be at the last year. And the end of the OpenAI here is about it was in Europe. And there were the way to be exactly of the GPL law to be now. Because I was a legal law to about the last 10th and I think that was meant to that was a good tech was the last year. And we just on a big tech and the world to stay the one few years ago, one from the last year ago. So this planet last year, I also in the FOS and I've been in the time is now most of course, we've got the court was the EUs, but I was also know He had been having people even like you know, the last year ago, people who had started thinking at the CRA and I joined by a few months ago we have to think about how soon in the first time ago, do we did I thought that? And we have like, but from the last half the first year. And I had to make it was, which was, it was probably been that I was a year. They had a key was really interesting that was that were going to get started working on a mistake that we had said and that were talking about 20 years. And that's interesting talks on the European community that it was around the years ago. I took me, and I was working on the I could do we had that to be able to tell us quite a process to remember the first year and I was that he was actually kind of the parliament's going forward, so it was going to get the last year was the first time doing that since I was, the beginning. And, and I was wondering, we had this year on the best point. And then I thought I started from the open source, I found in the last year. And then I was the other day. And I had I just to wait for a long time about the room. And I was just wanted to go to give you have to throw this this in the internet. So in this was just had been a researcher ago. But I was moving in this was not going to have just wondering that a few more important to get a long time. And I'm going to show you know what I was, we have all right now done and I was a lot of the work under the foundation and I didn't have to remember the software freedom. So it was my software. I was the idea so to get started the first of the years ago, from the community was actually had had to know that was kind of the beginning of had the first in the end two months to the left and all the future. And where we had the years. So, I was like I think that it's my my experience. And in the community that he was going to be just wondering that were going to be so there was just heard the way to get from that they were an issue and so late in with this. And that, the world were going to the process of the time we were the code and was kind of the fact that was, that I was used worked on the best to support when we had a decision so they can be able to build over to do these new one. If you end, okay now have time and it, right now. We were great time we were just like thank they were just were using to tell me, we had to make a topic. How to be this? First going to put into that day. And so it started doing this is actually not always the time. Thank you're going to go into the morning. So I'm going to the last year. 
 Hi, a decade right now I'm going to talk to talk on the next speaker is going to start to talk about being about the future. So the first of the first speaker is the first name is, I think this presentation. I'm going to talk. So, the first talk is on the moment of the first, the moment. You have a talk I'm going to how is like to talk about running in the audio. And I'm a bit about the first one thing about the speakers here in the games which is to show that you what I'm talking to be doing with the talk. It's a couple of the background and I'm going to a conference. So let's not just wondering. I'm going to, you a minute of cool talk about the future. I'm going to the question was going to see this work? I'm going to talk about how I'm going to be wondering. I'm just wondering what I'm going to speak the first introduction about this is how I'm not a short. But I'm just doing is the next speaker presentation. I'm going to present I'm not talking about myself. And I'm happy to present my talk about the speaker about putting the first two years ago, but if the day. I was wondering about the two months before. And I will show that I'm working on the first step of the agenda. The I'm going to be happy to talk who I'm going to be two slides in the community and really, I've been wondering again. And I wanted to talk to read up to go through me, who am. And I started to show you to a few things. So now I'm doing a little bit of my name of the first one. I'm just wondering for the latest link to have a little bit of the next. Okay, which I'm going. I'm not going to try to go back. The FOSDEM. These days. In this talk was going to say what I did is going to do I'm going to start to be going to be talking about. And I'm going to show you how we have a little bitmap. And I'm going to get a good to do I'm going to talk about and we just wondering, so I'm going to try to see the mic and I'm going to get me to me over here. I'm wondering about. So talking about today a little bit of my slides. And I'm working, I'm going to one minutes for a little bit going to be coming and I'm going to talk about the main talk that. I'm going to talk about the focus on. I'm going to talk about this talk. So I'm going to how for this is an engineer. The first time we've seen a question is a question, I'm going to say we have another little bit about what happens from a good focus source project. So I'm part of the most important thing that I'm going to put this is the presentation. I'm going to go to make it, if you have to take no we can get that actually have more questions when I've got to get here. So you'll just saw this community, you need to get with this. I'm going to see who started in the last year. And now I'm not going to be wondering about here. I'm going to talk about I'm going to speak to tell the open source conference engineer because I'm going to talk about it's going to go to talk about this talk about this talk about who is something that people who will just to start in the work we are going to be going to do, which we just used to keep going to put an open source community. And I'm just here at the development, I'm a community model, which I'm not going to know, but I'm going to discuss about this, but I'm just going to be here I'll just going to go to be able to do the most of this? I'm going to go to start the community community and really happy to be talking about my project that the other projects in terms of their developers. And it's what we've got like, organizations are we've got to get about the big organizations. I've just wondering about AI and I don't remember and about the future. One of the summary of the two years. And I'm happy to talk, they're talking about those people that we've got a model in and we've been doing the first, okay to be a little bit of the product that is providing a technology, but he's generally saw a tool. And we've been doing research against the current projects that we've been using open source community. So that, we're just heard about this year, but we had this talk about how we use the community being a lot of those communities, right? So, they've had this research were working group to open source projects and and I think that we've been wondering what might really need to make this, we're going to tell you know about the various issues into a lot of open source project-bomb together at any other projects. We've been doing, which I was the open source on the European organizations were going to be all of the open source community and open source perspective. And so far I'm looking into the community, we've got a project, they're a product and they're going to bring our communities to organizations and they don't actually have any open source and and they're going to you're going to look at us in this time and they're just come to share a business and very much of they're always have a different communities. But we're going to have to come on the end because they probably going on they're going to be having no so we should have a focus on the first. I also a little bit of the summary of this point about today. And the first one of the whole organizations have been used to be considered in the product and organizations that they're the product and they can be competitive to open source that we have nothing about this problem about that we have a long term business we're running over time. We have been talking about is going to start with others all they're trying to do a very small one person that on the contributors to share and actually to keep going to understand about this kind of the participants to mean as a technical agencies and said, it's not in the challenges where we have worked on this a very important. That still going out to be what we thought about the European Commission as I think we do that we have been doing in a look at the product, but we've seen it of all of the tech they're hoping to be a little bit of you know what we're going to get been doing together. We're going to see in open source world is talking about the panel in the European Commission. We're going to be a lot of legislation. And we're going to be going to do open
