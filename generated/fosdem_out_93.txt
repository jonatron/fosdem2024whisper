 I'm just wondering or not wondering. I'm going to take this. And we're looking at the next year was an hour of Fidofana already need to be a very old version of New3 that sort of system. I'm not going to start to talk about the first more. And we're going to provide more power futures. We want to have the world. So we're going to do a long term we have a few months on power or less than a few examples that we have an open the moment. And we have the current value that we have an improvement in the day. And this is a long and this is done. And then we have to be one of the moment that we're gonna be great to do. And this is the good question. So we have an hour bit of a question. And the first is that we want to be the question is moving to our question? The question was. We need more about was there we need to have the question is the question was, a or less. And if you're going to have a question was, you want to be used to be in the community of the whole. And we have a look at this talk. You're going to say, which is the documentation on the world. And yeah, as I'm still using the first thing for the question is that. I'm going to show the question. It's the question. So I'm going to the open source project, long time for the question. So my goal of the community and the open source perspective. But I get in the community and I think it's like, and the rest of the market, and what I think, the digital management and being used for the long term that we want to have was on a new commission for the project. So you know the good question is I'm important about the idea of the years to look at this question, but not defined is that is the discussion in the PLD is that I guess it's the energy and there's going to really a couple of mine is the previous point of questions in the educational society was the European Commission and the same office of the EU to support and the world in France. And it means that we're the European Commission and also talked about the European Commission and our open source revenue to the world of the EU law liability. We have this is the EU Association and we also had this is huge project in our world. And second panel that the European Commission could be that is more in German government rights throughout the Drupal institutions as a national IT product then in law. And then I think we have a German field that I think the US and finally wanted to be able to have had a coalition of legislation in and we have, the nature of Rwanda, in this policy. So we really, as well, it was also as the first office is the Drupal but we know actually talked about it was really a lot of all about the world, the world of these were at the world and the PLD and he was still had a lawyer. And also been three years, many the last year, we did that we got almost the community, and so because the third time is also has been given for the same technology law and the product. And in our product and that we have got the main chance to be quite a bit of the European parliament is to need to get a small energy and well a license this idea. So as we're the success that we've seen when we've worked with a challenge in the government as well, we've shown at the last step of the time and the European Commission. So that we had a pivotal thing to look at Fast to have been recognized as a number of the year, in this year. So getting back to the day and now there was a week that there is the last year of the market. And we had to look at the country. So, we had from the European Commission and how big problem was some we made a lot of the commission and we didn't want to get to be doing an impact of the open source world that we are going to be on the German law team and that it was about to be aware of energy and we had that the new law in the legislation with a big companies to forecast of open source and then we have been maintaining on this year and he had funding and we have been to be the civil society and the law and they were taking down to have the EU society of the commission would be looking at the commission in law and we are going to influence this one of all had to do think of the rights as of the German law in the law and had before this was just know that we're coming to take into political States in a representative of the government and about. But we've done the UK government open source law because we were not have paid for law that software being interesting to be in the open source software. So that time, and our government has to know that's about the public society that was in the rights of the GPL. So I'm going to have been thought since a law. And then we thought that we heard of the German law and so we're a very good idea with provisions of that they're very often our product that I think the software in the current law and we are so the law and we get a lot of legislation in the directive government law for politicians. And then there are changing community, but free law, we're really have identified this law, that's all we had this law and they wanted to apply the fact that you to be made. And it's about the law law that for a directive because we have here decided to say as you can do this under German law, there is that they don't see that in and you know about a law. The copyright institutions are being in other law and then you see some time that we can get up the moment. And they are, the directive and the license sector and you know that would have changed there are aware of those rights and they have no point and that was only need to a sense that we can be a big thing that they have been found, they are a legislation they still there's the law of law and they have this infringement cost and they are now the policy was like license to do that were, the copyright. So they have companies in a law. It was possible, so much more copyright law and somebody about the license from the market first because they're not so that's a court they brought at the market and they were a German rights but they still good thing that the court does they are often the people they can have to actually have. And this actually be obvious licenses, we had to be the law, but we've got the law that they are the beginning because they're mostly the German political decision that is copyright law to free software mandatory law that they really, in the commission. The way. And then the commission is really don't matter, we want to be at the society that we say the fact that copyright directive as they have a copyright law no no decision they just know that only the law were doing that they were at the law? They could be in market policy were kind of the law. That was also good one of the copyright copyright holder to the law law that remains law and they weren't to act to stop the law. So they were a law and they are copyright license that open source companies had seen by the copyright rights legislation was affected for German law under the value. But I gave us right at this government European market act could not no that could actually kind of European law from the CRA violation to parliament to the decision and they can't have to that's mandatory sector to be needed, and the law and possibly and they've got the law in the decision. And they're the German companies. And what they haven't be able to stop the law that you think that these open GPL law is important to have an commission and they're done GPL law no longer a time. You can't have to make the copyright copyright directive for each solar rights to be, but I'm not, they don't know what only one effect and in the commission should be aware of the EU federal law that the data in software decision is the key thing that decision from the commission field that's one was that the big law is that I had by the Unitedas last two policy. Now, this point, the state was basically the commission and a law is actually the German market law in the EU law were the law that open source energy has said open source law in June, but you know the commission then is very important to the organizations and that's actually have the question that's the same law and the software funded by a copyright to have to think that know it there was the moment, but there's a copyright license of policy of the legal organizations in the public policy in the commission to the commission rights law or policy could be mandatory the only law and you know about the regulation. And they will be some commission of the history in the policies of copyright policy sector was the German rights that they had any copyright liability in from the fact that they were in the law and they did we had at the GPL and they were now only because they're like there's not just one point in September was something of the commission and they want to be the energy in the regulation perspective where they had the commission that he was going on the key in 2022 actually they had to think they have they were really only legal legal parliament at the companies are following us can't make cost gapas or a copyright as a policy spent the first lawas law. The law or organizations were forced to a this first country ever had a license sector and in law-s were you know that GPL market that there were the copyright directive and they were trained in commission. So they were an IT but they could have an AI needs to open source public government world were not at national and they are there were the moment and in the government elections and there were nothing copyright law that was the time. And that it was a legal and there was a year. And they was a copyright's a value to be a given that they had got the political law representative of legislation so they were really kind of Germany to get exactly that they had to contribute are open source foundation to the parliament and we had in a political and I think this year and they were so the law I've been a German sector with a, and he told the legislation. So they were a that was afraid too. It was supposed to be in the law now but i needed to be a copyright but we had the law and we were done that money that some years, all that we're just come from these and from a good question of it was the copyright policy, that had to be used to do was used in the people so they tried to use policy and they were the directive of the value of the work in the decision in the license, but also had a law and not this was made the court of law was not just the law and long work on 2020 as well in Europe because they had one of being there were thinking so and she was also a time that she's not by law and a copyright that was a value because people were almost just these years now were not seen 20 years. It's a long as the value of decision I had is a value of EU. I wasn't think the EU and this was one is a value of the law that was at the copyright value that he were essentially had in court and they had was made an law of the case of law and they were changed came into the US 20 million legislation were announced. They also shown two years, but we had had the right the world that they were trying to keep discussing in last five days. But it was three years ago. In 2020 and so this area they were quite difficult to say, the world, so we were really do the EU law, but they had a world to be aware of the US in the last year. Some of and that they were not need to be one thing in the world and then she was like we had a half year were worried about the law and that was given happened to have to put to keep sharing that money. The EU, but I've been wondering if they had to try to know what it. We've seen 10 years now I started a million people in the legal and they wanted to understand is there was like a German parties did that they were the court forces at the German last year, and you were a law. And one was a group we were successful in the law that was that now due to know that we've got to the model and wasn't started they've had so many money. First of this year actually that's just the US were made exactly. And I was in the US is what would say you know, how to share is like kind of a problem as far away going to work on the government rights of the Commission that the regulation and was trying to be to try to keep an educational court about the last idea was the regulation against the EU law, which was also an open source law and we have been discussed around and the law came in the German law so we get any GPL directive of people in the law, so long was the source software people to work we have at the US because we have been thinking to have to get to think in the market management sector and they can't have a different place to spread out of them and so they are open source software. So this fact that, we have to have the market in the problem that came from the licensee is doing this day and they're measuring those law that they are missing law and they were not aware of law. So GPL is open source law for the GPL law. This way to open source open source law law in this notion of the legislation that legislation is in an law in legislation to energy law law from law law and law of the law that was made a mandatory law license mandatory law sector law has just. And this rights and law law and they don't have the scope only decision saying that this court and not aware of the copyright rights and they were a license and there were not only. And this copyright directive because this meant that the license, said we said no we decided that they said we want to make was no benefit from law and we call those federal law and they want to do that they actually ask that GPL law and by law of the laws can be the only also been there is effectively kind of a law or standards so we call at the German law was only value that notion that could be used to think that point that means that it's going to have asked of the knowledge at that we've had to have open source world so when we can be able to be able to do this
