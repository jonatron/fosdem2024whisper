 everyone from the open source activity, we managed to deliver our open source society in a bit of a big open source projects. Everybody's going to happen to contribute. I'm going to the open source software. So yeah, the foundation in the PLD, I'm now on. That's our website. And, how do we ship in a big step. So, to look into the work, the US. Because that's going to make that is our next speaker, thank you. I'm going to talk about that for us. I started at the community and Let's see the first and I'm a very far. And I'm going to work on. And they are going to take in that, I'm going to have our community that we don't really interested in the open source community. And just because the world we're going to be going to get the community that we're going to be trying to be using the product-s of open source code around. The question was to be a big law, I've got here into the moment and we had a number of contributors who were here at the community and the community, we'll make a lot of people who're making that we're using in source software. And I mentioned that I've been these tools that we're talking about. So I can I don't tell that we're going to have a lot of open source, there, so we're going to make a lot of people, we're going to get an open source is a few various teams and that I'm going to start a lot of people and I'm presenting this world and we know what we're going to look at the time, the community and I think that I'm sorry, we've got as a couple of the people who're interested in the community and open source funding and they're going to be looking at the open source project and stuff to understand what they're going to know, will be the world. I've got these workshops of words,'re interested in what does. So just been been using that we're going to know, but we've pushed to look at the people to do. We have these kind of people who have done in the first time in various digital communities who also wanted to be a little bit more people to be a little bit more academic space work on the developers who are hoping that all of the world, and they're doing very important point there's going to have the team that you know, they're at that they're looking at these people can do not just do that. I'm going? Something like if you know, if people that they don't have to think, being a they have nothing can't know it's anything there think of the time to think that can do, but they're just be a matter. Do you're often like in the right? Yeah, someone, we're going to the most of it's do. Okay, you have to figure out that we have to continue for me the question here. Yeah, you know. But the question myself. I'm going to take a little bit of the question. I'm going to be going to work to be good people who's going to do the things because I will come on to come to say we're going to get some people going to us, we're going to be hitting the money to be going on how to stop with us doing coding, we're going back to get this, right? Why could we want to you're going to do that role and we're going, we'll consider the last world I'm going to get any questions, right. We're going to look like let's going to focus going to just talk about that's say that's going to do. Let's going to do about going to go here? I'll come down yet. Okay, we'll talk about it's go back to start to a bit about the people who's a lot of the last two people? Yeah, so often know that we're going to make people, if you know it's going to stay with him and we are going to be able to talk about that we are going to do something. We have already had one're going to work in a little bit of our project developers. We're going to make that's going to do and we're going to talk about this is an opportunity to be at the next one there. Thanks for two years? My name is a few years, at the third? I'm going to share the left. I'm going to do I'm going to talk to be trying to talk about putting a pleasure So long time back for a bit more people to introduce a good thing to make real talk about it a lot of discussion. We have been in your architecture. I'm a lot of course, I'm going to talk about? I'm going to talk about them and I'm going to be talking to be going to talk about the agenda for me? Hello, this and I'm going to talk about three minutes. I'm going to give you about this talk all the speakers and I'm excited about the next step is the first talk is going to the community in there's going to talk about the journey of the tech and how I'm going to introduce my talk about about the community and more about the one of legislation that there? I think it to have this topic for the maintenance and are the European Commission and we have started, but I'm going to it's going to talk about this part of this year in source community, if you know that you know I'm going to start in the EU Commission at some people present a warm welcome to think I'm going to bring it's going to get all going to the European Commission and the first of all the year was, the room who been discussing, I was. And we've been working on time in the PLD at the FOSTA. And I'm going to look at the European Commission to be responsible for the last year. And so I was the EU institutions of those European Commission's a few people that we spent about years and I've probably going to make it and we've been thinking to continue, so much of the EU Association for some of the technology. And we're going to the car. And he was that we had to like, they didn't have to be doing something. I'm just wanted to tell you to ask this whole point of a lot of the EU laws and we have all the EU we looked at least six years and so we were talking about actually saying what we know about that we were going to do and he was funding at this room to be doing, we're looking like an open source project, okay. And I've been using the last year. So I'm just talked about talking about technology? That's a lot of, what we've talked about the idea. And we had exactly what we have a lot about being the developers of getting a company in an end, the world, what we've heard about the time, but I said, I'm saying, I think, then the commission was I was the next year, he was having to've got to participate in the software in their open source in those standards and the years ago at the left side of that in the Commission were thinking of the European Union were really useful. And they got started an open source software in that they're doing and they were trying to do their business software. We were making our world, of them, and they are really know that they ended up, and they needed to have to have to start a commercial open source projects, but they was a good to use and they're not the rights the question. And unfortunately they're going to think it was to be on the area to have that they know, a huge discussion of the car. I think other people come back to the first of the community were already had some time, which was to get a whole person who went into that, but they had worked on the world. And since the community joined these slides, which I was the middle of the US that's what the regulation and how we have and we're going to keep the society. But also what the directive, only success of this was, how to be in the industry here and to make it. In fact that we've seen that a look forward-source law and we have been coming from us in the law and then talking about the CRA and we were trying to the parliament to do this new law directive in Europe that the commission was for the law was a directive and what company was happened before that the law, was about by my thought I've got the copyright was even just to be in a bit more law. It was about open source law but we couldn't know how the people are the panel and we can come on the law and we have been on the money and do they are the foundation of the civil business rights and to the open science and it was and they did I was not really not not looked like the world in the only and I think the first open source legislation we can do. And that a CRA really often we think, we have nothing to be used in the regulation, they have in the political law, like that we can let's not know. And they wanted to be in the regulation that they don't change. And we need to do software has to get the copyright policy group decision of legislation because they need to also have a value and they have to take the commission is really good open source software. So there are so I may be quite happy to make it's a license of the company under the law because they're the GPL law and they have been something and they want to be in a law and it has a copyright copyright law has no and they're important for law and they go to be open source question to the law that they're not have seen it in law in each citizen because it so when they would be the question. And that they're the value that the parliament which doesn't really matter in the copyright holder, I think that's the parliament are the car kept in the GPL law and we have been having was the fact is a clear law because they're not. So they have a law because they are they have the civil society, but they just a copyright money to have been the open source law could have been a law, right person and they are also as a law. Because they come around and they don't get photos as well. And they just some law for the whole legislation is the copyright public value that's the copyright law. So the law that means I said in the third law field because they could as a GPL law in the GPL copyright court I said a legislation directive because of GPL license that as long has had to license law of copyright GPL be ideal decision value of the court is actually for the court clause is in legislation and was the license that the software, which copyright, so, but just by law to a copyright copyright then part of my law, but it's going to the decision required that the license has could seem just buy copyright open source legislation. So that means that was the license are if you know that the copyright is a copyright law law and I was. They want to make value of the commission conditions did not one that it's kind of a long in copyright license and they give a GPL and it would happen on the law. So the copyright law was a same thing, a law, they're not always to matter of law. It has it. But the law law and in law, there's not sufficiently energy license value of copyright law and has been very the value of the decision to only part of the law license rights because they take value is a value of law law rights and they had to report into the act in the regulation, they want to copyright holder, of the energy, they had been invented by the first value by law has been incorporated was whether it which this value in that they have. It's totally a copyright the industry copyright law that is open source perspective between government used to be a GPL cost to legal copyright infringement and they don't even trust the decision that companies have made they just even at their time, you to have to get the good to be afraid that point, they are just work not have to be used and so they don't use that notion of magnitude of the clear consequences for the money that at the copyright legislation, the court said that may not the license that they not really have the policy at last thing, which is people are just the copyright law that means that point of, but they're trained. Because this license that I think it's less sense to like a value of the license. These one, you can really want to get the decision and they know about regulation that you know that's a court because they were you know exactly having an open source legal copyright in the world, so we're getting a lot of the law laws in the space of time we're talking about the person that is being a clear and we've shown the copyright holder in a violation has taken or they're seeing a given any perspective like license person to influence that they are the copyright law of the law but they've got asked the directive and they're just no problem. I think that the tech world, the energy and they've said, we say that they're not the public infringement law, of the commercial holder. That was just that just to say that I had a place and they have been free the law to be used to be done by law, but they're not the value, the act on the commission, it was in and they can be paid that you just in any open source law, which could be published in the commission that in there's just a law in the public copyright world and a law directive. The copyright law would by license copyright law have a and in copyright law has something for law because they were actually give those copyright was a copyright as part in making the first law would be the law from copyright thought from the fact he was something that they would like that is that they would be a law. I was not just a copyright law companies and German the third by license law which is not the GPL law law as if there, for license and they can be in a copyright, no court in fact we remember the copyright license wasn't use license law for a GPL because they don't a law that they're in the license open source license was in the German law. And you know so they were coming to open source and they haven't know the same standard law was a law. That was designed its copyright is true no matter of a problem. But not only, the market to need to do that they did. But they were really always aware and they had enough copyright licenses at this
