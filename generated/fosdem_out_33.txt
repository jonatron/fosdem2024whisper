Okay, we're going to help you. I was very welcome. So to be a question you're going to be trying to do work with a question. And, I'm going to share the OpenAI-bit. I was I'm going on it was wondering that was the first part of course, so the question was working on the name of the answer and I'm just found this because I was showing that was done. The presentation. So, I was already speak to get a question was here, they have this is just one of the question. So since there was about having a good thing in the beginning.

 Hello. So I'm wondering. Thank you. Let me. Thanks for this talk about this last year. My name a few minutes. It's going to that I'm going to talk today. Let's a few details about it's what we have? Okay, today. Okay, but first talk about this is we are going to talk about the microphone and a speaker you want to megs, the introduction of a talk about to talk to talk about this. So, one is where I've included this microphone to say I think about the talk about the one of the next talk I'm going to the best question is. And I'm not seeing the first one of the speakers. So I'm going to explain about this is we may be wondering how to talk about the open source project. Why would like this, why I would we are the introduction to take us? I'm just office. We have time to show you're here through the different questions? You can you a three three minutes, two years ago, two years ago. Because there in the beginning, we have one one. So we have to leave the next the tech. And just wondering. We've seen in the history of digital computing rooms as I'm going to give any point to start the end of the next speaker is the day. We're going to encourage me the first. We've seen my name was going to be showing the first two years ago, but we do we got into the slides. I'm really have already had to jump into the network from the power. And I was the panel. Over the knowledge to a bit of what I'm thinking about the satellite and that I'm just going to get the time. So, I'm going to be so I'm going to support for the last year ago next round of free software engineer was doing to be getting this. And the next year. The thank you saw the panel I was a good room to talk. My name is the Commission and I was the moment. Also not going to stop building of the world. So my research ecosystem of course as well the years later on what was very clear compared to keep from that the internet that he would think we were used an open from the world. I could say. I see here is already mentioned before to do we had to the room. And that I was kind of the real time. But I was very excited to see it on the world. And we have a little bit more about the first and the world, I was the one for the commission, how I was wondering before the first thing I was talking about the first year of the project was very long time was a lot more time. And I had a lot of years ago. I should be discussed, the world, that I always because I needed to stop and I am there's going to make sure that there are on the developer was a little bit of a number of this year, I think that I'm going to show you just wondering and that this year. I was wondering that I called In France, and I was wondering now. I was a little bit of the moment. And to be not at the world, I just I think it was wondering the panel was, especially a few people I was the point about just took a discussion where I would be able to go back to the two here came where we don't see the time 10 years ago. So there's the first half 2023 was a little little bit of the first year was a lot of the year in 1th and they were going to be around before most of them as good question, which was a year because someone in one of the end of the policy. And with the beginning of the year there were first, 50 years. And I got the last year. And and I guess I started to try to make a lot of the last year. So I'm going to do a little bit of one of me and I just wondering about this talk was the talk about was actually I was also wondering, so I was really got to be doing with a bit. And I came to just some plans to left and really thinking. And I was a very important presentation, but I had to add to just saying what I've heard a sort of the year, I was very excited to describe me, thank you know, but I was wondering, that I was a few of a few months ago and it was just wondering. And I was a couple of I was incredibly a few months in the time. But I had the work that was. So I was also I worked on the last year last year ago I was really excited to make that was wondering, that I think it was one year. But I had to get very, so I was even better than I was quite happy to have time to give you here because it was also the idea is very interesting to be fun to the way from the time. I was wondering, like I actually wondering what he had this, which was really with you know that, so I think that, okay, I had a couple of like I was saying, they were like that time we had to think we had to even a lot of free time. And now going to do not the next week, there was a couple of slides are those four years with more the European Commission had half and also a few laptops, like, the panel in the last year ago, from the next year, and our first, but I was the only working year ago the month ago. And there are the last year. So the first day today I think that we did we should be the talk at the very bad problem. And I think that I'm not, we have at least so I'm going on this year. First of the journey in this is based on the years to talk about the time for the last year ago. And I think if you have any of the future. And I haven't have the moment because you know, I think about about the slides. If you see the next slide was here's just wondering anyway. So we're going to have a power. I'm not very happy to start to, we speak to talk about the first of the challenges on the agenda and the meeting. The new talk is just three years and the world of the EU, but I have been working on the only one and at this talk is a digital European Commission. So the rights of the European Commission, it wasm, I'm in the EU and the European Commission. They have to be used at all in the European Commission will be the second and regulation. The general release was really open question was not in the European Commission who are a late and it would be a panel of software volunteer group. And the European Commission was going to bring real week, and so it was to be a long-profit would be also cost of a great, but the CRA has to have been to be a long time to be used to have to get left and the world for each main world. And so I actually at the way so we have a few years ago the companies that is not a few years ago, or two years ago I'm a good morning and the commission foundation going to be the world but I think that I'm going to be wondering for a lot of the big year ago. And in the end of the EU Commission, but these year ago, I'm going to be an open source world, I think I think we can we're going to be using projects and we also have people to be to talk about any. And it's already been the European European Commission and we want to see that. And that I've been thinking about companies involved in the first of people are in 2019, in Europe had been aware of the time I think that we're a democratic year. That was the last year. And but really great topic in France. So that there are getting and community, more than a very important really interesting for the fact that it is to the world, on that we've heard at the EUs there was the community of the world and that we have been in Open Source 3OS. So we came up in the Internet of the last year on the European Commission. It's EUs and the whole world, we had to work around the Commission and it was going to make a bit. So in the parliament I'd like the CRA and it's actually has been using from the knowledge from the EU law and we found a company, energy government tech. So, to the EU economy that we had the only step to do. We have been a really want to be the new year we have a community, we have and we have been to look at that the EU institutions in was a huge companies and we've been doing the European Commission has a lot of the only heard that this. So what I think about the IT, we want to do we've got this talk about the CRA in the funding were going to present to be very easy to be the German market and we've seen so much a good to be focusing on this case as a decade. And we have to see that we have, the parliament, so I think we probably had to take that we've been at the main organizations have our first year, we've had to do so we're all the law that was to have been the software in the law had been so far from the methodology from the PLD and in Europe, we have the European Commission at the possibility to work we know what we had the fact that talk about that we need to look at the tech world. We have the technology of the EU interoperability and companies in a research organizations and we
