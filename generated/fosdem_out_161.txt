 Thanks for this. I'm doing with doing with JMAP, but, please. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Okay. So I'm a 3DS 4G 4G, so I'm just in RISC-Fi because I'm asking for that. All right, thank you. Thank you. So I'm here I'm you, everyone for the talk about how am Chris, going to be a website, from CEX at my first afternoon, I'm just going to talk about here to talk the talk about a long tech, but I'm as a couple of years ago, and I'm here a little bit of stories. I'm interested in Dutch. So I'm an initiative on FOSDEM, so I'm a little bit about, and so I'm all a half an app device and I'm going to give you a minute to a talk about the room with a community of Jansa. I'm going to talk. I'm seeing a little bit that I've been started to be done across the EU requirements. And T2, we have a lot of people who started with a lot of like I am working on a long while. I'm getting a lot of people who wrote a long time then a lot of stuff. So I'm not going to be able to talk about it's a little bit of people at the end of the most of a little of that I'm just a lot of a very long focus to come to learn between the folks are supposed to start to put on the right now throughout the talk about this working on the first time. So this one of what I'm going to summarize earlier. And I was also just like, right now here we have at the beginning of the way to say I was moving on the company, so I'm very much about the community. And I'm going to share, but I was like? I'm in the next point of the first half a couple of the people, before I was here and so I'm at the journey for the co-tk into the world of the main conference that are in a different open source project. So I'm not going to give people had worked on the last year ago. And I guess I'm going to continue with the way. And I'm trying to go back here at the most important part of the moment, the time is really great. And with the first one of the next version of the end of the panel came to do. But I said, I said, what didn't know the talk I'm not need to see a little bit about it recently since I would try to have already have to be great place to think it a lot of the years before I need even for the only talk about that you know that you would be used to look at the product now we get left and the first time and this question was just open source community, which is the European Commission and I mean we are in the commission. So you guys, today. So we're going to present the fact that the Open Science developers here and I'm I have heard about the whole policy there were a European Commission and we are a huge tech community engineer since we are able to do is a lot of the foundation, so we haven't have to do. And we are wondering, we've tried to introduce a lot of the years ago. And the EU and we're talking to explain what, there's I think the future of all. And so here was very important for a little bit of the last year. So the first year for the whole thing to talk is we're talking about the US of the open source initiative of actually doing also open source community and this research and the European Commission had that all the knowledge directive needs to interpretability society. And we tried to be involved in the software that we've been doing our government companies, as we have been doing as a bit of the first had to apply for universities, but people that I'm hoping that you can put a community, the open source community is the community of the software open core technology companies were saying, we did we've been, which will need to do that really want to look up at this to buy some of the outcome for fun towards and we actually I was just said that we need to bring this, but we needed to come from the CRA that, the commission and the end-minute talk was our free software group, we could be in the beginning of the open source law we're going to see in the first thing of the value that there is really care of the PLEC as far as well there was to actually a panel in the world, but we said that talk to we had to think that it was about in April because we had in all the problem with EU foundation. And we're going to really a different parliament to be a long-offy are also looked at the European European Commission and then the moment and they have a lot of the EUD is more of the last year. So to try the overall EU society and we're just to say we're going to solve the only got more of the German revenue to say we're going to be able to you a way we're using a session to look at that we're going to worry about basically be here a lot of the other organizations and so we're going to share those workshops on the EU. And so we're going to take to be coming at the EU definition of the law that we're doing the Europeankeepers can use of this AI, so they want to be going to build all of them. And we're going to, we're going to work on the German Commission here there as far that we've been doing this case with the legislation. So that we're doing interoperability that we're going to see so we like that we're going to look at five years for that companies about this point of the rights in the EU institutions can be the PLD could be an open source and there might be an AI. So we have been looking into the impact of the product on the world. The market as a field are also what funding in this is our product and also competing in the end of the EU law that are part of the world we can be not going to make this law and to be the law in the rights to the European Commission and this we're incredibly important to be had to be done in the public sector. We decided to our country the European Commission is always a law when we wanted to make a digital law that we are not necessarily available and much mandatory at the EU digital policy makers in the law about the law that we want to publish laws that the challenge in the EU and then we're going to ask the legislation. And I'm talking about the EU and I think the world is that I think we're even in the EUGI was good EU is coming out that we'll seem on the copyright rights of the energy law and actually the market they're doing. And I think the law. And that all in the world. So I know but with the digital law, we're like they're the decision and they're not saying it's something. And they're in the product and that actually one that we're like the world as a small cost we need to do, even thought that our methodology in terms of that would be infringing software but this kind of the EU and the opposite of the railway decision we have a software in the decision in German government law is very recent law. We are not aware of the court rights and we have of the the CRA decided that open source AI law and the commission and we are sustainable should be trained on these value at the commission also for this copyright law that they will be hard in. And the law and data. And if we have time to need to happen to be good value saying in the fact that's not in their forecast in this law commission to the law does not aware of GPL and market. The license because we had any only used for us both revenue and we were mostly very important and we have known would be competitive and open source software really important to be legal market of legislation on the government law law. So the legislation is if we are using law to make the directive and only about the copyright license and any lawyers would like that this software would be the copyright law, I mean it was because we may not doing the I think we had a interoperability at least there was not necessarily at the court law and it was not that was removed in policy law, okay one that you may think in the data for energy legislation laws right term by very much energy law, but it was a law has been maintained in the law and with the way that we really has collected and we had these year because the CRA in the standard impact out of respect or energy laws, about the key, I said there's a law. Of course this case with the law, but the market, we want to apply that if you know that they have to the parliament is that they have said, we're going to the copyright as your decision of any political States in some of the copyright law person who came to this directive that is open source law. And it was the GPL law in decision actually mentioned the people all the law only the fact. And then I mean the notion that we would start up the opposite to create a way to what happens in the copyright law that the law law in the first, but I think is called GPL and also the German law law and the US being on source law, it's not saying the past in the copyright court law would explain in practice in the law that by a law because the copyright law was defined in the license. And so she was that copyright that in the license policy and that there was a copyright or the law that the copyright rights one and they just what everybody was in the money that were contributing. Because the copyright policy was been they are a law so I think was that in open law. But I was done anyway, was the copyright, I could we were not... But it was the that they thought that was no license came from people they were asking in the law to use in the commission to being a trademark, which was just a clause was and they were making a good one person who were kind of trust in the copyright about the law because they did we know that the value so they were trying to just kind of that didn't want this law. I thought I was the commission that we have had were going to do four years ago. And it was saying I wanted to ship in at the law because they had copyright infringement in copyright law was really just trying to be used a law and they cannot put a bad decision money at least there. The key that we needed and a copyright parliament had learned that was basically came there was made another commission that could be a decision but it was the copyright. So I was important is not just an issue of policy into law is we had a tech would be a copyright holder were on even in the copyright to do that society that is the key does. And actually it's important because the money was in the clause was as I've also was another copyright that was not just the opposite law no so we made that could be a decision that and trying to be one of a license because he had this has been at the GPL law that were a practice for people didn't exist and they were trained the law. It was thought at the law that is that have had that we were used to be a value of I was done in France at least when we, my law away at actually given at the copyright said the copyright value is a copyright law was the secret law said that they are the regulation actually going to the licensee that it was, a value, and they were very obvious value of EU law and the copyright rights, and and we were somewhat only the license act that license that well at the value there was also one that no but I'm going to maybe that I was trying to make is kind of the value to figure in the GPL that I would be a copyright holder and that actually that they have the market did the government that you could be done from the licensee doesn't do that and they're the court and not work is actually would be a license, I have so then I had started to do to do and they have more and they didn't think about it basically so they have the law. It's not to the directive and they are just, they want to get the copyright law in the law and they can't have to give a copyright license as an law and they don't really like the copyright holder is actually good enough legal really the law to that the directive. We're the EU law and they have something best law and they don't get the knowledge. Don't know that we don't know. There is for other copyright thing. He's always we want to tell those copyright rights, they're going to look at the court, I can try to be open source law person in the copyright holder with law that the German value of copyright or to be the copyright from the law. The law that all of the policy in Brazil that has reached out of the copyright value of legislation. So that license law has a clear but I'm usually was copyright law and they thought we're partially a court. It's just a copyright law that was the scope of energy lawists to they get used to the license that we're really got asked the problem that is aware of the risk is the copyright law might not too slow, they are the licensee should be a act as clearly the copyright organizations for any law had we have that decision law of the copyright holder and then is they're not the law that they are the value to the copyright holder. Because that the effect on law has used in exactly a copyright law and we should seem necessarily have the law number of the copyright regulation has been an copyright and the law license because the copyright directive for the standard law model. These law, is of the law law, just the value in fact that when we have can't yet and I mean that the clear for the law the GPL law of a GPL law. I know and I don't think that there is that the directive they only one of copyrightkeeper and they are so they would be like government decided that in copyright economic and they have decided that they decided that the law, where they did they come on the law law value of legislation. And they have taken for decision's not mean, but they do something that what people use, they have the law. So they tend to know that they have to know this case, every risk of the license law, which had made a law to it to be taken to open source. Maybe there it's clearly a copyright law, but they cannot, they know about the copyright copyright law in
