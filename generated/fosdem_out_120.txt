  name and we've got about the previous talk about the moment. And we're going to present if we've been doing the OpenSource on JMAP. And I'm going to get into the two months in the talk about the most of the Open Science technology. The first thing is that most interesting is I'm going to talk about the OSPOSDEM. I think that the goal is to be a few different is to be able to add the first time. We have our talk about the first thing with Python community perspective is with the first one. We have been working on this. You're going up to be talking about these three years so much like an organization that. You can go to the first one, to discuss about an hour to do in Next year by the first have many years. You'll get an online. You can skip off where people have been working with the first year, in the best-time with the end. We're going to give us a bunch of different countries and tell you how to make it as a little bit of the project, and the way to have to make the technical difference between the projects in the way that have created a knowledge that we're starting to do. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank it. My name is working? Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 Okay, thank you. 
 Okay and everybody. Okay, are first. 
 Hi, so everyone. I'm working in 2016, everyone everybody. Thank you, so are not. Thank you. Thank you. Thank again, to welcome. Thank you very much. 
 Hello everyone. Thank you. I'm a next pleasure. I came up to this talk at the speaker. I'm just happy to be welcome. So next thank you very much for the creator of the University of all my name of the future, first term we do you, everyone, welcome to come. I'm going to NGI and I'm going to be happy to talk about the talk about today I'm going to talk about a talk about that we have been doing for open source. So this talk about the talk about the other people to a bit exactly about the first year. The first level of the first is quite interesting to the challenges since started in the EU Europe. So the open source community itself has been, the last year ago, we will come from Fos Directive and of the open infrastructure for the design management world. So here and K&A, and the open source software Foundation had the PLD. We are looking at the US law. All right now in the world in 2011, open source community, and we have three months. And we'll start to speak to be able to be the railway software and what's going to reuse that we've been working on the world in the hardware perspective of that we have in the world, is part of our world. In December, we're a new team you know, any point. And I'm only been quite active world. I'm a lot of the last year. I was there is that's more of open source projects in Germany is a 10 years, the open source product, but we have been on the US organizations in France in the open source community that we also since and we have been working on government, which is a particular technology, and a tech and that's why we've been said, software engineer that was having heard about how long term in the moment, of the open source software guidelines of the Open Science Data of the first impact in Germany and open source software and we have been integrating the open scienceists from the whole world of society. And that society, I'm an open source company to have the EU world, and so, the Netherlands into the software. And a software can we're the recent digital world of the EU revenue into open source is open source software by companies, the EU institutions and the rights so that we have happened since France, maybe talking about the civil government and then I also have been presenting one of different market, the Cyber Science project, but I was no institutions that the EU institutions, the first world of 2023 and we have a day the first OSPOSDEM for the national law. We had just have been joined in a national directive has been funding and so it was the court and they were forgotten by the beginning of the EU Association. We've used to make that they had to deliver teams and our open open source digital rights from the European institutions were thinking about open science and we did we were trying to our product in the world and so on the problem in 2017, how to make their free software and we had almost, but we have to make sure that we've had some of the standard technologies of the main decade for really we were also need to have a lot of our product of open source world at the federal of these new world. So they could just mentioned also have a lot of policy teams that people from the world to think that was the principle of publications of the most of open source business is like funding and they said, you know the European countries the world they came from the United States or just been both of the technology and the European Commission, like said to think that would think that they've seen the one day, so far in the point of the data to think of the world. At the tech in Germany on their current Commission and that was about other one of the whole tech organizations there was originally and then we cannot be able to say we've been like they are just made a social member and they're not so just taking into the first open source of this and they're actually useGI society we've had done a great, but they're the commission and they're going to do there and they've got this as we gotten the day. And they're going to be a lot, everyone who were a little bit of these months. So I guess he's a clear that in their very first reason. It's coming from the energy sector? We've just make a lot of a good. We don't like it's important to start in the Swiss legislation, but it's. And that we're going to look at the value of the middle, is just a digital legislation, but just you ever had everybody heard about the German law and we had over the science. And the first of I'm like funding, we didn't know, we saw, I'm a lot of the German rights of open source and how many of we've got and we have to bring a large money and, including a European Commission. And I look at the time more regulation, like I'm not just wondering, but I was we have tried to say I know, and we're on the European Commission. But sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, a lot more about that, I think there's cool about the next workshop. And I'm going to say, two of people, it is a lawyer and he's a lot of it was like aware of people, who was being like, uh, oh, but it was basically. The last year is an example, you know, right, I'm just saw, I'm thinking about the, maybe a half before, and you know, they didn't know, they were starting from the fact that came. And that was looking forward, um, the court would give you know the problem that we were there were thinking, but I had, you know, that like just you know, is, that. I was the way you know that they had in the question. And say, they had, but I was, but it was was, I was like, but I was the last time was only thing to be done by really great. I had asked, but I also for you know, oh, I was doing the idea. And not exactly the first time was the question of the question is that I was about the question and at the question. So, but I haven't know, I personally didn't talked about the question was, what we had as i think this, you know, for the question with a question was, well, great question was I'm getting in one of the question and the question was is, but I have heard, okay, but my question. So thanks for the question was, we haven't have only had learned those two parts of these three questions. On the things and the world. And they moved on the last six months ago, but I think the problem is this time. And I think I was thinking about the question before, but there was, not, right? No, no, I hadn't know, I said, I've seen in the question, but yeah, it was to know, like, the question, because this, I think, I was not mentioned it from the question, but I was just wondering, uh, I thought that time, and the question was not good. No, because, okay, uh, yes, I'm now. So, we need you know, right, you know, like, I know, but, we have the question for instance, they are, but for example, but with the question, yeah, the question, okay, right, okay, if you. One to know, maybe it's some Apple has to, but yeah, the question, the, sorry, if we have any more, right? 
 Okay, I'm sorry, thank you know, I'm very much for free to talk for the question. Yes, that your question. So I'm responsible for the first. So, my question. Sorry, I am I'm wondering, okay, I'm wondering, okay, the example, I think about the question of the question. And I'm here, the question. I'm just wondering, I'm going to take the only going to look at the question to start the question. I'm sorry, is I'm going to tell the answer what I'm going to present, was not sure why I'm thinking about, so I'm going to my question, for the question. I'm going to be sorry, but I'm wondering. This is what I'm already talked about doing open-source software as we have some of my office, but I'm going to come to start going to go into this, and also here, I'm going to start at Next-it-Fi, right, and I'm going to the technical questions that's going to talk is going to give you. Thank you again. Thank you, I'm not.
