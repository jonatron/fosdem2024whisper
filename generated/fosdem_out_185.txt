 Let us talk about three. And this is why the architecture is happening in that we need to discuss these things that really is more important to think the like not that we are using these we also have a look at the community which is very important to make it the data we're going to collect the level of all of view is very important to set some data from us about the data and how we really keep going to talk a lot people who can we are thinking about this as you may have. We have a little thing that we already see the data that the data together and we have a lot of photos and so we have our data model we also have to our data gap about these those. We tell us what we are going to worry about how we have to the question about what we also have? Or by the challenges we also with how they have some challenges which are going to be quite work on our right because we are talking about software over here which are so we are going to be open source for people that is in our software software we are not that are going to be very important to look at what we are very interesting people out to look at the participants and we can go to think about what you're going to be aware that everyone to focus, right? Let's mostly very quickly but also what we are the code. It's talk that there are. There's something is a community. And we have an end people to think we have some looking at the product in the challenge to go into the question about the world and I'm going to give us to our first talk about where we have a software but the policy is the software that we have also had to be able to this really been the only in fact that we started to go through the rights and also came from the data. And to help us around the first place. We're of making sure what we had to feel at if you know about technology and how much detail. It was thinking about the time you know what you could we also build in here. The challenges involved in the fact that we have been doing we have a lot of one that we have is we have that we need to talk to be able to be done at the commission to make that the panel is just working on the first step of the first one for an open source license so a really do in the right and we have been going to be very important to be aware of the question and in the community and I have this talk about the time right now. And this is this at the parliament we were something good question was not going to have any of the beginning and the world. So I want to present to actually last year. I wanted to start this year I'm going to come into the next point was just wondering why we had to focus on the years ago and it was probably in the whole thing that was going to get out to focus on which is a day and say but for us that we were that we had us. So we had to be very well and in 2011 we were just going to present all about this and to discuss the end of this thought about like from the right we started doing a little bit about how we had our community in the open source community's like like this year and we had a number of open source projects and we are talking about our project we have the years of them and software and so we didn't need the world of civil society to be solved in 2018 and in a lot of companies who were part and there's going to have got no something that we need to talk about the Swiss institutions saying that there in open source and the commission and this happened that I was being used to be mandatory as well and there was trying to the commission who had been a year we have to bring and we were coming there which was also a company and he does. 
 So how to get this kind of our CRA to a company in the market and he was a lot of a huge term that market and helped on a lot of I think is starting to speak to ask you think he's working on to the day at the commission policy that the UK Association was I was actually so my presentation was the year here and he had a long while co-in Foundation was going to that was going to take into it was going to talk a tech in the day and he was to talk was I know what I had the first years. And I joined in 2019 and so open source community and the University of our community was basically with the Drupal and I did the open source community of June, these been with an first step of a room was a lot of the one of this was trying to give the technology of the people who had to the EU liability and I'm going to give it before he had to be wondering of legislation for a good group, and no legal economy and and people were going to be what was actually the first five years ago I was happy to be and the representative that was thinking to work at the main stories and his end of a year. And actually really we were at the law we started with a large tech workshops could be also have been in the moment because they had had heard a community who have been done open source companies and with the EU and I started at the future for the year. I was quite been doing so much to say earlier over and I know in the EU to think I think we had the question. You know what I think that we don't know the majority of the time on the process a huge one year, but this is important so on the first time I mean I'm sort of those years ago to have been a lot of a long term perspective and the main point of learning and there is to work on the world and like five years ago, so we had like a lot of that we did we were putting the last year in my work on the current Commission has been released for the most of people were the funding so that in a time to have been on the CRA that was not just aware of time and so I was a panel but we had no time to do not a bad from the first time you can't know the day and and many people and the point of us are much the project that we have been talking to know how you know what I think people that we have the best person think we've been writing the beginning of the product and how they are we have the source and the community and it was for the whole process of being developed community and they just had the last year and creating the most important thing and so by the decision's a lot of the license on all of people doing and they have kind of course the world and if you're just have, I've been thinking a great but they had to be in the right a way that you've talked to see that would be maybe there were at getting there any people just did that's the first of my first week but nobody had had to work, so the German commission that was just going on the European Commission was not so they said this year at a European Commission and they know what was a way more important thing and they end of going to have to think there was. My matter that a copyright the main thing was that it was, which was I think that was, the last year. Unfortunately that were actually got found part of the EU was the last year on google there was actually but that's a huge in the world that the first one and that is there was that was a good, but I said that was a bit more important to know when an industrial interoperability was the third to be just an American law, we did not think it was doing in 2018 because the act into terms of legislation in law and we had something that they were a commission and because we had a law to be a law in the law that it was to forecast of the policy at the law and then an American court of tech sector to just a value since the copyright has been on the law in hindsight just the law was the software sector to make. So that what I have just spent at the answer for one law was that this law, yeah, the German law that the question was first value of the copyright gap clause was a law. I would be the law because we have been involved on the person is you know to do I think that was a law was really worried about the legal innovation and even in terms of truth in the German law that company but it was an copyright open law actually had to the German law that there's why is a copyright rights and on copyright law. And the open source organizations of the law was also the standard law of a copyright law rights used enough to add the copyright law directive to GPL law under law and mandatory law and then GPL gatekeepers in copyright law was the regulation in the copyright law they didn't know and they have really have a key of law copyright law license said they wanted or a law legal policy they change as a law because they have value and they will be possible to be clear. I was value to train the GPL directive but it was the parliament said in US law has to, we talked about law in the licensee of the copyright infringement and yes, there was also got the I've had to work since they don't made any copyright law interoperability law and the law who was important were just to grow in copyright copyright law right no license should be able into the license or market conditions to be the national law so it is not the copyright law and the copyright and that the regulation and they should be a value of regulate license and they have they're in and a copyright he was a copyright is that. Because the law. But we are actually heard that's not just only a directive and he knew that it was it was very clear commission rights and they are allowed that Drupal directive we've been heard about. We've got to be happy to be a world about the licensee holder. So that we saw anyone know what they had to do with the only on. So they were asking the rights no, I didn't know about law. They're here. So and they said well that the court has had found in a European state of the world, the directive. And I've had a commission were there was saying that about GPL law because they have had a license has taken all these copyright parliament. Or the European European directive when the copyright law they are. We had this point of the value doesn't apply when this license has had were not been something called GPL law. The GPL but they had been had keys, and they were used to the law, there is another copyright law saying is maybe they were also the law directive so an legal law law in this laws that we're actually in a law, which they did not a directive and they were then they don't think they were they were on they were in copyright court issue of law and they did they were you know they move and they were they're wondering that they're not making it and they were just have much you get this not really small copyright law of a GPL and just to free law. So the GPL GPL GPL law to the license injunction in the commission as the UK GPL copyright law and the commission could get in laws were trying to these rights when they were there could affect a license keys that market and they were really knew these were a particular law to do came out we just had to do it. So we had a and they couldn't know this. So the copyright German law who were not open a this is basically didn't have a no copyright law, as license they didn't switch a civil license and in the copyright sense of funding to this law directive and they did we had a GPL and they don't have been been any law, so far didn't want to be the copyright value to be made or they were taking this GPL law law said what he was actually and he're going to be being able to regulate that we wanted to go from having these value and he's kind of an open US law has a directive. The fact in the law who did not been around the copyright law were a law that you know that was the German law which no law value of law actually one that was quite in those law or the law, are law in an law that the law might have made only three law then just had, a no cost in law that or even though they know, they didn't use copyright key, they consider the was not in a act keys. And then they had to open copyright termination of the market in companies made that they're not talked about legislation that a copyright, I think that they cannot only and they need to know what they had a license. So no no longer did might be any point we did not just to work for it's a license said that's kind of law or do I was the key law and so no sense for the policy and was a directive in copyright law, the commission is not to actually an parliament act in copyright in a practice, that copyright law GPL law of copyright that does at the law at the digital law agencies, the copyright law. The private competition law and they were required to legal law in legislation, by people do Mark said, but you know, what the copyright rights in the public market bodies that did they all when they come to be because I was used away. In the problem within that they were actually value the values as their law, this value would say, these legislation and it's good for the way that they mean, they just is a mistake is if that they do they didn't read the same of the law and they would be the copyright rights to law and they're still understand the copyright infringement do, of copyright mean I didn't think of that they were the person to solve value for copyright decision, it was not not there so on the IT that they did yes. Oh, so as I was wondering that the most interesting idea is it is what is that was that says they thought that they decided to have to keep in terms of those ones and then they did not have to like at the regulation and they mean it. But it said as the challenge, you know most of money's like bad in that the same way when they did is exactly the other ones are trained in the next room in copyright value of the rights act in a copyright conditions. We don't think this and they go we think we have a copyright sense of the fact that really close and we need to prevent money. So the legislation, I think we need to make close to be on maybe we are having to the idea the problem that we are good answer this is, but people in the only as well, well because in this is another question, and we now you have heard the same software, so after I think at least in the problem, right question that if they are in a time. Let's what each two
