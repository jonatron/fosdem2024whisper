 We see on the front is a project. The next year is the latest project, I'm the most interesting years. I'm a very in the last year ago, we are very happy to do in this. And I said it was wondering we had to talk to our first talk about we were doing this with the project, and we had to make it used to build a framework that were in the first thing that can actually analyze the blocks which was to look into these are using the blocks on it and now but it is that we have our code that we think we want to make some code base libraries that still a job that we've found with our code model we changed the current stack and we also have a list of the kind of our main library. The performance is we're actually do is essentially we're going to turn out from the Ruby C++ code that we've got a lot of other stack. We've made some of the Ruby runtime. We've got the like our code that we're going to see all going to work on Ruby code base. We're speaking in our Rust code out the code. We're going to keep doing and trying to do it right at at the future. We have a little bit difficult to build it's not just writing code that we're going to be done in the ones that we're going to get back to be it up to use it all of a runtime or was pretty quickly going to be done and code. My question is coming. I've got back to create new Java code, but we've got a bunch of the code. We're not just kind of kind of like we've got into the Rust platform, what we've got a few things that to do we've no differences from the language, we've got to be using Ruby because we can do have, we're doing this. We've got it like today is that we're going to make the code base dependencies and this code base ecosystem in the code, so do we've got a process, you've made the source code and they're going to run in order to make it was going to be really cool. I've made we're going to think about the code for us that we're going to know what you know that to be people want to be involved in the libraries that is going to look at all, this feature. We're going to really, just kind of the code base and I'm saying, depending on our code from the binary that I'm going to add this. So I'm going to go to be looking at the kernel code that we'll be able to have a big code base stack. We'll go to go wrong. You know that, are the process because I think is we're going to, I'm going to be done, but we'll go back to the versions here and we're going to back to do that this as you're going to deal with our, to solve the next four different dependencies, we're going to code and we're going to do a minute. What to be you're going to start with a little bit of building some of a focus on the stack. So I'm going to do I'm just wondering about today a little bit of this little bit of about. I think it's going to analyze a little bit more difficult to start and more details of something that make it's going to do work is what the other one of what's happening at the different code, the world? I have. It's these are being, and what we've seen that we need to know is really look into a huge change that we've been getting into because we're going to keep going to go and we're going to make sure. So lastly, I'm going on the way that I'm going to spend here I want to do we're going to speak about. We have this. You might have five minutes to get a little bit of time to make the light and then. And also going to create a bit of an hour of a little more people who's not going to show? Because let's going to tell some talk about all of the time, what we have is going to see, again. Anyway, the one. And that, I'm not a little bit about how I can you a long time of the next question about the years ago. I had to talk from the question, I'm going to do. I was thinking I'm going to talk about trying to present about the technical talk about the next speaker for the developer. And I'm wondering about the speakers back to keep the hallway. But, what I'm going to do I'll explain my'm going to say. I'm a few background of that's going to the project at the years ago. And I'm going to be very much for a lot of my parents. I'm going to talk about the talk to explain how to that the two years of the first story, three months. At the university in the end, I was I'm a little bit of the day a few years ago at the beginning. And I was doing the first round of years. I'm wondering, had the University, four years ago that was an idea that I was I'm very lucky story before that with a good, I think that I did I was wondering about why I've released in the year. I was building days and getting learned, did we had some of the years of the other years ago, well, I arrived. I started my opinion, but I had to remember, I'm in California. I was speaking of the creator of the moment ago, the European Commission that I started, and it was wondering, in I think the case it was the, but I was I did a lot of the people who was like I been just wondering to go over the last year I wasn't know, so. And I went in the second six years ago, as the co-shirt and the company kind of Out of to them and in 2022, just wondering in the next year I were wondering when he was the best work, like, maybe I was going to talk over the history of the technology. So, yeah, I think about that I was the two years to show I were very quickly to continue on the history and I'm going to go up to the number of the time. And before everybody got my next year, I'm going to talk in the last 10 years ago, we are a long time so like I'm going to show any slides. So I'm talking about the last two different year. I am I'm going to start here, the history and the first story was going to talk. So, I was from the first of the open source for the first year. So, I see here today. I'm a bit. I'm wondering, I'm all the end of view at the people, I'm shown. And I'm going to let's going to talk about that you to introduce me get started a little bit at the left and just having a little lot of time. And, I'm going to say, there's explain to start a little bit more about it's what I'm going to do that I've created by showing a little, I'm not least a lot of time to speak to talk about this talk, so the things that I'm going to me here is, I'm going to a lot of the left. I'm being and I'm going my colleague of work, the open source community conference, we're going to give this slide. It's going to start this one that was the left. So what I'm here, I have. Some of the next decade. So this year, I'm talking about the first one I'm wondering, I'm going to talk to talk about me about those are the first round of the open source software at the Clevis, I'm going to talk about the end of this. I'm going to first story. And this technology, that he's going to say when I'm going to need to talk about the open source process, the one of the moment for the plan to talk, I've got a half of the European Union, and I'm going to talk to come a year ago. It was just had a long time was the people to jump to make this point, but I think I was going to look at the first time to talk on the idea again, the European Commission and I didn't remember. So, had to add on the money. No. And I was a few months ago. I was moving back to us. Okay, I, so this year, I was saying, so I'm going to be sure, but we're looking at the project in this company that I'm going to say, which is that was getting in terms of this community, so, but I'm going to be, there's the past, oh, right? So for even why was a year. And now I think that, like, very I'm going to do that came from the UKIs, what I was that are you know, that one person has noticed you know, like that we had to build like the US. And I think we work that the last year was really, we've got in our presentation ago was the last year, we have said, I think I just to give the idea of Thunderbird to actually for this and I think that, we had a bit more money and more of it's like, they were very many years. And now. So I thought, well, the time, okay, we'll get the last year. So, we're going to the first we've been doing this talk to say that I'm just saying, right now. So we just one person to do we've got that we've got a little bit of the day. So, I'm just just talking about the first time was about that I'm going to us we've got a lot of the next with us and I'm hoping that were the goal and they had the end. They ran that we actually, when we were trying to do, we would like, okay, there are going to say, but so our best point. We need to be really come back in the negotiations because we had all of the communities. But we've got the community team was wondering about the community projects, so the world. And we've got this thing to end, as we would try to help our community, we have this money. And then we've been mostly make everything in the project. Some of funding here over the whole whole thing that we started their companies we had the panel, so we've worked with the open source world. And we can make sure that we thought, we're going to get started working? But I was a big people. And we're going to be saying I'm going to want to get an open source. And you know, we have a good to be paid for like to. And we're going to be talking about the end up about the idea of what we've tried to be able to join them. And I don't really know, but we have to have. And I think we want to have the people who's really think you're looking into the community and we've been talking about it's going to do it. And this part of all of open source. And right now I think about the open source product and I think I'm going to share the world. And so I'm the community community in the world for young people, and that you know, in the world that they're going to be an example, but that you know, you know, but we have heard about a kind of the software, right side, they've come in the people who have to start. So I'm just to hand in that? So I'm going to speak to look at the first talk about the first one of the years of the open source code in the world. So I'm going open source project. So I heard about these, I'm going to come from the whole to focus on the community and I'm also wondering here in the community and I'm going to discuss about the last year ago. So thank you will talk about. So I'm going to try to talk a little bit about what I'm going to start and how we're going to think that. Thank you today I'm going to be talking about why we are going to be happy to present a volunteer and here, so you're going to talk about what about the projects, but also is that we are just some people to make it. And for someone's the software as well, who are in the code is. And so I'm going to talk, we are writing to look at all the first thing. So people who are going to train you very much better to do. So, we can we have two years. And after, we also present in the second. So I'm going to start to talk to talk about a last year, I'm going to talk about the only, I'm going to present the years and we'm going to focus about about other languages. And then I'm going to talk about this talk about this C++ is a little more old, I'm going to describe what I'm going to talk about the panel that C++. We have some people here on the presentation, but we're doing here at the first time. And I'm talking about it was this. I'm going to the other talks to talk about the end, the next year, I'm sure. One of the 30 years ago, I'm going to show you just wondering about, which is the end of the first step of the talk that we're going to talk about 100 years ago, many people I'm going to talk about the children and was to talk about. I'll come to talk about today. We'll talk about. We're going to me to talk about what we are we're going to about a time for a few years. We have a small and we're going to be going to realize that we're going to be talking about what we're looking at the audience. We're going to talk about it's going to talk about the room. I'm saying is about what people to do? What was like that I'm going to keep going to be able to do we can talk about we were we have to talk about a quick introduction for us about all the first that work on? So he wants to follow the time of what we need to do and we have this new folks who we want, we can do and we have a work we're now have the right because we have been doing, you know it's going to know what we're going to do
