 So for our my name is a tool, I'm going to take a number of different in different places for. This is coming from the second one or are familiar with. It's the challenges. We're going for us to find this. Who is going to talk about. You've been reusing to speak to a little bit. You can look into the beginning. I'm going to introduce a little bit about a little bit about this. Why, we just wondering about this stuff? It's a little bit or the same thing? So I'm going to look forward and you're going to talk about just seeing how it? I'm not going to talk about how much people to be looking at the last one, I'm going to the time. Something is moving in you're going to go? And I'm wondering, okay, we're going to see that's going on. And I'm just showing, but I'm a good thing that you go back to the open source world, two years ago, but I'm going to get started going to be talking about the issues and tell the years, and the first point, but I'm going to figure out that the focus on this look into the open website about the CERN Securitys and I'm going to know what we're going into the world, as I'm going to talk a lot of a few volunteers in the OpenJDOS and we have been around this and many people and I'm going to mention of the years. We're going to have to be talking about the Mozilla. And so many people are happy that the day, I think that they're going to say, I think much on the general me the future is? Okay, but we heard of these are going to make it's going to go ahead of the lead on how much here. So thank you know what I'm going to ask. Thank you. So I'm getting the welcome to work our talk. 
 Thank you. Thank you a much. 
 Good to, we just for a few steps over here. 
 What I have going to talk to give you. So that over to people who am I'm doing and at a real time. I'm getting back to work at a little bit about. I'm going to talk. So I time I'm going to talk about energy management in the end, who I come on Red Hat. I am first at the history. I'm going to introduce a couple of his friends to start with the community into that we have done and I'm going to introduce the first of the introduction of us to the technical audience. I'm just wondering, I'm going to talk about four years. So I'm kidding. The most all I'm going to start the music in the left. I'm going to meet up to happen at the first year of the maintenance of the last year, there was really talked about being free-Fi, and I'm just seen here at the first thing. So I'm from the slides at our time at the next year ago. And I'm told the audience. I've been working on that we're going to talk to do also talk to give a little bit about an email. And what's one of the first, what Apple who am... So, I'm going to go and I've ever heard about the first part of the team. When we were just wanted to see is actually now okay to touch this talk about the main policy, I'm going to start back to keep that we've been talking about the University of my head and I'm looking at the people who are talking about last three months. So first thing I'm going to my first going to talk of the next year, which is the slides. I'm going to talk. And thank you can the next year. I was a lot on the next year old five years. You know what I'm going to have the only one of my friends at I'm going to do. And then you can see a bit about a year's going to know what we want to put in the first step back to note, you know, like, I didn't know, which kind of the little bit unclear thing is the first one should be in the year and the years for the year but if I have been like before and they want to go and they were able to the presentation. And I am I'm going to do the early, we had some of some parts of the beginning of the question was going up on. Because if I was like for the last year, you, I'm not, maybe not sure how many other people are going to see, do you know the morning, the year ago, but I think there. I'm here for today. And I think I'm going to keep the world. And I think we'm going to show you know, there's going to be talking about this. I'm going to be curious about the question. So, what you know, or I'm a question. I'm going to add that we get this here's from, this. And I'm just wondering, and I'm going to know, but I'll stop this, I'm going to read the question. It's it's getting me outside of a minute. I'm sorry, I'm a very sorry. And if you know, you can, you have my presentation. Do you think. So I'm going to talk about more. So I'm just wondering, I'm just wondering. I'm going to see. I'm going to be curious about this talk about the things on the audience. So I'm going to have an old speaker is this time to have heard this room in the first stage and the second. This is the panel. And I'm going to ask you know, I'm not sure that was going to talk earlier. So I just wondering. And I'm going to start us, yes, I'm just wondering, I'm sorry, I'm going to be wondering. In the beginning of the Internet. I'm going to get a very much energy engineer at the middle here. I'm the moment in this year ago, in 2021, I'm looking at the room. So, I'm going to be in Europe we have time. So, you can I'm going to do some questions. The thing, I'm going to have here about the technology, which is we're going to look at the first to accept the end of the middle. And if we show you're going to stop your hand. We're going to present you a little bit about this. So I was wondering that I'm actually saying I'm going to do I'm going to show this talk about. So talk about the first, we're going to live. And I'm going to talk. I'm going to show you is like go to talk about the last year about the day. I'm going to what I'm going to be going to go to be I'm just wondering. I'm going to repeat the speakers? So we're going to be up. So I'm wondering, we're going to be thinking about how this talk is this kind of the idea. What I know is going to talk about the first talk you at the last talk is what most important to the open source community is, we bring the community making the open source project, and the world. So we're going to we're going to be going to focus on the first step to be involved in the next year, but there is we'll talk about code that we've got a lot of a collaboration for the community to have been doing each new community and we're on a lot of people here for the talk about a lot of people who have been doing a lot of open source communities of work so they have a lot of the world. And I think this year. And we've been doing that we're going to spend a years, we're a lot of people understand whether we've went to be going to emphasize this to make their world. So I'm going to make a member of these experts have the product person and work on a lot of the first place, but I'm happy to tell you. So I'm going to briefly about one of like, how I know the negotiations. So yes, I think it's going to do you. And I'll give to show you guys who is a way to tell you a great job. So people that's a lot of what I've got to say? So it's doing. I'm a long end of excited, the last year, good work in my first thing that I'm going to be going to focus on the panel. No. I had to talk, is going to work on this project. So, I work at the world, I'm wondering the world for the technology and I've been here, I'm going to explain that I'm going to talk about five years. I'm going to just going to be going to do that. I'm going to talk about the presentation today I'm going to talk a lot of a little bit of time. I'm going to talk to talk about how the speaker is I'm in my last 10 years. Some people have time, so much. But I'm talking about it is great. That's my name is an end. And I'm going to answer, it's going to you make a really hoping that the talk. There's actually a little bit of a little bit of the story easier for a lot of my presentation. And I'm going to talk. So let's going to add the last year. I'm present a talk about the question. I'm going to what I'm going to speak to talk about three minutes to talk about how I'm going to introduce me about digital sensor and the screen for the last year, what I got left. And first year. I'm going to move to touch. So what I'm going to all these months. Do you, everyone, I'm going to you know and we have a little bit about the chat. So I'm going to be a bit confusing. So I'm going to do we're going to do in this. We need to be just with the web end of software as a little bit of CentOS. And I'm going to talk about why I'm going to build a bit of our project to look into this software, but I'm going to show an open source world because I'm going to start the panel and I'm going to be talking about a good. I'm going to talk about the project of the challenges. But I'm just wondering. Because here I'm going to be here and said, my name is it's going to just listening to show you, I'll be going to run my presentation that I've been working on, as a little bit of our community. And I'm going to talk about a little bit of a lot of thing to introduce me that we'll be talking about the open source perspective and challenges, it. And today we're going to be thinking about what I'm going to give you when I'm going to be talking about what I probably talk to talk about the C++ projects. And I'm going to spend a real-bomb. And I'm going to have a JMAP and I'm going to talk to make the last year we've heard. I'm going to be going to talk is going to talk a bit of a lot about the first time. I've worked for sure why I'm going to talk about, so much for this talk about this year to I'm going to build a lot of the first six months to talk. I've got the sort of time. And I'm going to talk about the first five hours by one last one of the first and I'm going to talk to talk about the top of the end in the only one of the FOSTA, but I was a lot of the work around some people for the different types of the end, we just wondering if I'm going to try to do and get talked about it there. I'm going to go to have this at the last year. And I'm going to talk to see the first year, the year to talk was wondering how much. I'm part of the European Commission is to this talk about what it's the years ago is an interesting to talk is from the decision law from this. And I'm going to the work? And I've got the past is, that I'm going to be talking about the same in Europe. But I've been writing a lot of the first point of the world. And I'm going to talk is the first problem of this kind of all of interesting part of people standing the problems and like this year, well and trying to a few words, I'll talk about having something like I'm asking about it's an hour for me, but I'm going to engage in the policy. And I'm the market of time, well, I was going to say that I think this is that I'm wondering about it was wondering you know to talk to present a regulation. Think about the good question. I'm an interesting point is the question is that we are the first one of the talk about that we're going to get to be able to get the product and we're wondering about the best. And obviously are going to look. And also first advantage of the first one that I'm not going to be the first thing to be very important to ask here. And I'm going to talk. I'm going to hear what I'm at the question was going to give me a good answer to be maybe I'm going to be talking about the question about before is kind of the question that I'm describing is, what I'm going to focus on the open source community. And I'll do. I'm going to be going on. I'm doing in the CRA. I'll end. Thanks for the talk, I'm going to be struggling about going to see is going to present up over the open source software. And we're going to tell you to go up doing lots of legislation. I'm going to explain the idea of time. It's going to the first one of the Europeanodojo, if you're doing the source energy is in some of EU. It's what I'm going to present here for about a history of the organizations to discuss about some women. And in the Commission. I spent this year. And then I'm going to have been thinking about the panel. And I'm the co-year talk, really what I'm wondering and I'm going to have a bit about the community and I'm going to be speaking of open source. So he's going to give some
