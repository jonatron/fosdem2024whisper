 Here is I am just talking about Al End today and I am I present for a brief, of the year. So I I first day about Jamban this talk about the first talk. We present at your last talk about 3G, for Code. So, here we are looking towards a very much for Green Software Foundation. So we have a year, we would like for this platform in the radio and today, this time, because we are here, which is going to try to talk about the Netherlands. I'm in this talk to talk about this year. I'm going to talk, well, this talk, so I'm here in a great talk about the main speaker in France in the morning, like we've been all about a talk about the last year open source world. We've been the beginning of OpenAI for the first of the European Commission, but initially the tech institutions using Open Scienceden Group and he's community. We have seen earlier, which is all this software from the OpenAPI standards. So let's a few months ago, what we've got started. So, we're at the year before I do we'm just about the main and we're curious about the first two years we talk and we're more of our first one of CentOS. So if we've been a lot of the open source community science across the OpenDesk and a lot on the maintenance of you're going to work on the tech software and the cloud world. We've been about the time. But last person here the idea of the CERN is one that we've got that we're going to get in the German Foundation had about the last year. So we're going to start with Project. I'm going to do that's going to talk about the last year to be on the year, who has heard of OpenJDK, in the EU Foundation in the goal of the time by Mozilla Foundation. Well, I was talking about the community. So we have some co-free. Security. And we're looking at Outreachy and here and so I'm very happy to talk about the end up about that's basically, that we're going to improve the PLD and what we're going to say that it's up, we're going to clean up to be a lot of us up to have been working on the future and Outem Data first of organizations like she was very good. And I am I think about the company in the EU projects and I'm going on their first of the last year we've been doing our community person. And today is there is an open source product and I had some years ago So I'm very open source community engineer at the community technology that you guys have been a year. I was a I've been over here to the European Commission of the world. And finally have been a lot of open source software and they were recognized by this the work was a long time. And then they've got to solve OpenDesk to do that they had to help and they've tried to influence the year. So we had a member to do that's the third party has been the railway as well and the commission that we use was going to work on the European Commission on national field. So we could actually have a challenge. So the ones we've been really had the EUD would happen in the UK and we have a lot of their own policy group. So most of the moment we have had a lot of people were all at a common open source services and the government strategy about the year before I want to create a lot of one of people there were trying to think people that came out I had a third parties and also've got in our lives and then in the way to find the world but they know what was built to do is actually build in the product that is currently in the parliament and the commission company built in fact that they know what we have about parliament to think this community to get a business planet as well trying to the commission point of the law first place as an end of the EU and we don't get in this panel that is as government activity and since 2020 that we're very well there's that we're a year and another CRA and we're already had to have it was being the European Commission and a European rights in 2011 and we just a lot of open source organization we have about women and the last year we've been to have a year. So we've been working now on ethics don't seen before the commission and then we have my value to try and we've been going to tell us to put from the previous year. We can imagine that we have done a lot of the moment as we also going to be able to be asking everything for the world of the commission and we have to have a bunch of the conversation and the directive in the software that was to become always got a lot of those copyright decision and we're looking for that you're both in a lot of the commission and maybe at the last year. We've had 20 years I need to do and we've been doing the least far and then had workshops or we needed them to work with the value from the whole but we had ever thought we had to actually trying to do and we have to create a different laws and we want to make the future and we have to have to act. Does we may be the law and we need to say we have some decisions for a we're just like the law that's a future they have a way to train because they're talking to think this other discussion. But we have the world so we do we can we don't do their success or any policies that we think about what we have the world we can have done or they're doing that's that to do we have with those at what they have some teams that we are not had photos right in a good to be competitive to make a problem and we would be able to have to get into open source and in the future and to go to look at that we want to this case and we're going to use three years if anybody doesn't want to go from the more than seven questions before we have to have in and he's happy to try to keep the audience here what the right we still and we are actually mentioned we have to have a question that we have is going to solve our current law had we have to call it from the beginning there any people is another question now and think it was in terms of the same time to try and we have heard about it and we can now thinking about what don't do for us who wants to work so so in a reason and we're going to continue to go to one of an interesting open source world but we use a little bit more questions here because we have any problem well some people we want to have some of a bit more questions like one two years and two years ago we have heard about the year or a half more question but the question was the question was the day was very tough so we said that we are in the question since we were a time if we saw that we have been talked about okay we have a question we had for our like I was that we had the people that we know okay but we are the question about our question the right before every year and the question we have seen the question but the big question was I'm like please, why I was to actually just wondering that we know that okay. Okay so we ran when we are the last year so now that we have been working on that for questions and the two years ago because we had to work on a lot of the moment and as a lot of weeks ago open source projects so now we needed the product on the work we need to make sure you to do so the world because the railway companies are we are and yeah yeah is always two months but I'm going to go more even more detail about the only there is important to touch on different activities that we are a more people I was that we have looked at the product and because we are the community so we have for the projects for the way to change is they are talking about the best we had the world so they are just have so like the future is the government law uh FFT we have the world and we are we going to become in the idea and we really hoping you know always have the world to actually have to go to offer more complex software but you to have a huge win the open source software in the software but you that you have to get there's called open source software that, and it's not a couple of just a lot of people to be a little bit of times so many people went into and a free place that they have been so they are there's right there's an's software in this stuff uh for this world that the act also a good idea for the most people were a bit of the world that was that you are you know there was a lot of the release something that like we have heard about in progress but like as a lot of success was also you feel like if you know more and they were like like a very important place and what we are what people who are hoping that we are okay like 100 days in the panel committee that you know for the panel and they were the moment um so uh they were involved we had these projects were in their first. So there was in a way of
