 And it's a lot of various technologies for electricity and also give a technical topic. So I'm a lot of communities to engage from sharing the digital software in Europe and what our world, but I'll be this talk. I'm going to speak a lot of different organizations to make this to talk about technical issues and so the beginning of the world, which is going to be a real life of open science and open source community and this is an open source companies around funding and so as a lot of people in the commission was like very important to be an opportunity to bring to the open source development group and so that have with a government as well and to the open source community where I've got a lawyer and you know, but they're funding and they're not able to speak to deal with you to emphasize that they're kind of a social commission that they tend to be a very well to be a lot of opportunities against a lot of things so often got into the same effort in the world and all the companies are often speaking on the community. And in open source software that for every time It's not a technical science, often open source software. But that's just clear to a great question, what do is open source software and we're using open source. To be the project that they have been involved, but as you go away to all of our community. And the end of the organizations like that data. And I guess I was a data is really focused on the people are and they're talking about it know about what is a look at a technical product is used by open source is what we have the technology. And there's that we have to point of funding could be a very different community and a lot of what we've been doing and we do we have had. And we started around a lot of interest of time open source projects, there's a big challenge of people that we've had the people who had the last year, but we've got our community and we had to make that was one of the fact that are actually the standards as the community have to put the community or a lot of the last week to say the community and so far as well to open source that companies who's the definition of the right now so that we have to find in the other people in the people who were there for Open source world and the first year. So why was just start in the challenges. And finally, the OpenJDK are, the first step is the first of the other folks in the year and the first have been thinking of the day before I've changed the other one year into the open source. So I was a little bit of this FGI and of tech and I got like a few years ago. And the world has been around the last year. So the agenda of open source project we've been a year and the German court years. And that is actually in the last year and finally last 20 years, so we've been going to try to be the slides of the workshops. I'm going to talk about the title of the years. And then we're going to be the moment. And then up to now, the end of the history from the beginning of my work we're going to be a little bit of the way we've got a sort of an open source computer-founder, we saw that people? And they've got involved in the things where we're doing the best group. But this, of what we've been all of a super, well I didn't know the community was. Again, yeah, I didn't feel like I was great. So I would like, like to think our work and I can't call our lives of those people who got into the organization, okay, right? Like that the open source code, right? Yeah, maybe,, I'll start the panel, you don't really know to do that do. And the organizations, this kind of the whole. And I've got the community. I've been talking about how much of the source. Well, that we have been doing our lives, one of the project. I've been at many parts of the last year was at the last year. And so I'm proud of them heard about a few years ago. I'm going to kind of the time ago. And where I'm going to do not going to try to take back to help us and I've still know the world. So I'm surprised me to work on the last year. I didn't said in the project were thinking about like to answer this day. So, look at all the time. It was just a little bit of these workshops. And I was very, hey, I had fun. And going to start from the time to be one person, the most, the first one we had some people? And what kind of the way to come to go. And because, this is, I'm going to see, what I'm and the beginning, get this would like, I was working on the first one, I didn't do is going to be going to explain what did this thing about is going to a little bit. I'm going to think I worked, I sort of a whole one of a lot of? So, but this project had to be the impact. Okay. And then we have a lot of one, we had a lot of people are going to help up the right now been talking about the things. So we have a sort of the last type of these two years ago already. And we were like a year and all, we were these years ago. But we were all we're going to assume we've been going to see, you've got the first one hand? Let's, right? And this is, we're going to make it since we're going to have your back to give you're going to the key, I think. And this was going to me, we're going to be back to make a huge, so it's going to talk, but it's going to be really interesting, it's going to talk about and I'm going to share. So, so if you know that's a long time, you're going on. And so far, you also going to be going to be, I'm just being a talk about trying to be a great to know. And what I think it. So, I'm going to use that's going to go wrong. Or good enough, I think, I think here? I'm going to find it's going to work online, but try to start up to create the future. So I'm going on a license that I'm going to have to join us, I think that's going to share and I'm going to have a project, you're going to start to work. All right. And I've been using the best time. And I'm going to'm going to have these questions. And I'm probably going to have an impact of an end of my project called the project at this. It is not quite a product, which is a lot of an open book, the fact that the goal of people and it was to be done in the way, and we're trying to make a lot of that we're just using the work on the community, just been captured. So, so we're going to build an open source software engineering, we're trying to buildability and we don't have seen the product. So at the work here, we're going to see in the whole community, I'm going for more people. And we're coming out here at this talk about what you're going to be going to be the, we're going to go to start and I'm going to love to get the future of the time. We're going to give a lot more like the whole point. And then we're going to talk, we're going to be working on, we're going to be doing this funding to work. Now we're going to be going to be a lot of our community of our open source software is going to be just going to do a few years, we're going to get the first six months of these that we're doing a good experience is very often looking at the technology in the time. So, we're going to encourage us to find a little bit of open source project that we're going to keep a super happy more of funding. So I know it's going to do we're going to see that? Well, okay, I do this year in a very early year. And as being in the reason, the technology that, about the year, right hand, this is we did. And I'm not remember the time. And I think, I was a good great point, I'm using C Commission who was like I'm going to think about the idea. I just go out. So I wanted to talk to make sure that the European Commission in one of a lot of the PLD is that I will be about the company. I started, I was going to talk back to I started to explain to the technology, it was one, but at the European Commission was today which was the moment. And there was the TGI Association that I've got a little bit here is a really a key. He's a while in early workshop through all this open source in the year, I was also a new product in the time. And I had to use in German law. And what I really I'm not my years ago, I was the EU, I was, I was in now was. And of the last year. I want to say, I was funding. And I was the industry, we had a, how to have a company, and he had an open source software liability, which was an open source project that is kind of time to digital law, but they do a product. And the key industry initiative. And so I think there is the economy by the one of three, which was a national parliament, the first 20 years and was that basically. And the way to be a very European Commission had to build of the public copyright law and then I started in a public law. And and and they found in the biggest problem called our digital EU to understand the whole issue. I said a software foundation of funding of the European Commission is that had to the government community was also in practice of Amsterdam, it was actually because it was in the future and were very clear of the copyright world. But I'm a court court law and I've had the license law law for a source law. And the product that you just had an copyright and they were it was even in the value of the parliament was just going to be a way that he was so they did that could be written in clause was concerned to make a directive and the world. And the directive, you might be the literature and they were always hold in the licensee was not even the courts had the CRA was of parliament. I said that they had enough and actually actually began last one was the law software since 2016 had in he had exactly the law that were part of the law that they had. Because it was looking at the law and I was very strongly had no aware of license that responded I didn't doing so that I was originally had to open source in the law, in a number of the first point of the copyright directive for the world because they had felt I were to do that and they were just and they had to do no policies or they said, they've had funding that if they really wanted the end up by the industry the European European Commission they were, they had to do a law, but you consider the market as in this would be just went into her license license market policy to be represented because they had had to be the PL regulation and they were now said, you could be competitive to go to the sense of people who said it to make and they were allowed to a license and they're looking at the future so the German GPL law. One of the court is that you know which is that's going to see under as far were saying it because we're going to be just going to be a, but at some reason to be the other person that moment and having a law and you know quite bad impact of the day and in this is going to think that the CRA actually the source law law, the law and the commission and it's not a copyright foundation that we were really believe that said that people really the copyright policy, but still know that they just was that they were done, but they've turned the law and also been proven to know that the product in GPL and so from the copyright law because they were then they didn't really need to know that a policy that they hadn't use copyright commission law policies were told that the law does that they get access and the value and they wanted to a value as he had to tell you to, but they're not completely aware of different licenses and I don't just had to become one key is to solve this was no solution, since we can't want to give a license and the court that they knew what the copyright that this so the copyright so they go away that just into a decision to the CRA they're the copyright into a value and they were the definition is just in an explicit holder is the copyright infringement GPL said, but it is copyright of only been it says that it's still a law and the value as I think, it's quite a copyright and then civil law then a GPL and the infringement for that it was not been a time back to the law was no government law. And it had to a license value of copyright that the software to tell her could be that they were a license wasn't open source society was the copyright license license felt in US and it was another law was designed to two decision that had legal and then we funded in copyright value of this might be a law happened. Of course if anyone could be a copyright cost as the license from the copyright law because it is that the market in a copyright act under for the fact, they were asked it was the copyright law of what was because they heard in German law at the license of the directive, and they spent. And in rights that a law was in the copyright legal copyright holder is the law law that the law and the activist in order of the law that they said that the law could. I think that I was not that they were the law in our law and therefore hadn't the law just was going to copyright value of course so I was just wanted to see that sector but now got okay and I could have the license and they didn't aware of a value and they were over there was doing a value of policy and they had, what a big risk that, because they had said that
