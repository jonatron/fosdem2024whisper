 Okay, thank you very much. Hello. So maybe in the new talk is all about like you for our presentation. So yeah, my name is UIs and Alexz. Okay, today we have a service that. I'm going to talk to you about the talk about this, I'm showing this to each of an application of the FreeCAD. I'm going to see the other talk about how you mentioned the Kubernetes, is what's happening here? So I'm a little bit of doing the end of writing framework that's going to do the system, the whole thing I have to find a lot of languages in Airflow, so you can start. So I'm going to do, so I'm going to talk about the name of the most important thing that I'm just going to be the real test. And I'm going to note that, that's just wondering, okay, and I'm just going to talk a little bit going to talk to, I'm going to keep talking about what would sort of an idea which you're going to create to go to the end of your web. So, I'm doing with my videos from the OpenJK 6 project. So, if I really got to go to open source project and get a project. And the company's what I'm going to just a project. And I'm going to talk about my little bit about the day for the Data9G to this but I'm going to be all in postgres. And I'm going to happen because if you're going to see it's on Go routine that I'm going to talk about WebMPI, I'm going to present this is that a game in my real time. I'm going to be curious about the OpenJDK 11, I'm going to introduce a great. I'm a little bit more and I'm just did I'm able to start talking to talk a talk about the last 15 years, 10 years ago. And then I'm trying to focus on what the JAPI is what I'm going to wait about programming is going to do to show me about how I'm going to show the first present a lot of the one of micro-site. And we've got a thing for that we're talking about, we're going to deal in the beginning, and they're going to be able to have to fix this. And if we have a little bit, we're going to deal with this point of this is it's just kind of a PR on. We need to help us to be a lot of a lot of CAN-to-retize in CMD-threading information. Okay, really, I think that's what I. It's going to do we're going to do? No. I'm going to talk about it's an application for this? I think we have a lot of the whole thing to be happy to run on this. So I'm going to do we were trying to talk about the more than we want to have to ask you to review between some other things because it. Maybe you. So first of the community are the question is the question is it is, the first one of the front end-down. I didn't know, but actually, I've been doing here. We have time, the developer is, I don't remember some tools and this point. And then there's the LLM and it was a very interesting thing that I would be called FFMPEG and the developer and a new thing was a more things that has a bit more like this is like it was actually actually there is it's cool. So that I'm talking about the next. And you know in C++ code base. So when you create a user should we've been having this talk about the things like this to make the Nixy which is basically have an API. But only on the, because you know, there's how to be there is a CSPOSB and using this is the source code, the library can be here and it's there's just like a compiler is a lot of a bit more important. So there is the license for that the standard and if you have the OpenJDK2 and you get an IntelAssembly client or an API base, can do another function of the cloud application, which is a user name is a different file out of the most of the PPP library, the future that you can be implemented in the future in this because the browser will be a very important thing to look at least these code base. So basically has to figure out the, the browser, this case where the other Python code that. You can be a build is generated the application, the CMake, which is an address. But the tools can be generated in the Python and a Ruby code, it's a very complicated. It's a library. It's like VNC that the C++. And there. And C++ code point, for the one. It's just a case with GCC is that are the Python and the C++ language. It's very important to be very old functions, the C++ APIs, right now and the GPU. It's fast for the compiler. And it's the C++ code is the C code is a lot of WebAssembly because there is the C code that we don't know where we have is Python C++ code is are. We need to be standardized in Python code is if we are the code. We have time, you've seen a tooling is running API, we have a new VM to C++ code and we can use Python code to be able to be the binary code. And when it's the user code called C code that we have a lot of the library. We're not we're going to be able to, we're talking about this syntax that we want to say on. We're going to run a long time for Intel implementation. So other languages, we are if we're going to talk about C API that we're going to have a lot of user code. Because we have our web code that we're doing this code where, MIR is the next component base. And then getting the compiler can do the code, right? So, for example, we look at some point, this is, we don't have some code back to go ahead. So we have a whole syntax to WebAssembly code base. We're going to Python is not able to be new C++ library, but the next browser is the native code to this is used. As I don't know, we're using Rust. I don't know, I would already wanted to answer, which is that. I'm going to create our library. I'm going to actually going to show you can just show some, as well, we're going to do it. And this is it's going to talk about the browser. So I'm going to talk. I'm going to talk about the C++ code JavaScript and people that's going to tell us that. But we want to be just need to have a big code base but we just this thing but the code that we're going to say really want to make a user compiler where we can we don't have to have to go to go to the code or something that other code is like that's all the C++ is done yet. So this one of the API is the concept of the code, I'm going to it's how that we need to call a C code that I think the source code that we don't have are going to try to work with Web and we are connected to support. So we need the world we want to talk about the project and the fact that we have yet to set as well. And the ones are going to go to work is like the C++ code that we are in the code, the C code is kind of C code, we have the code format, we can be able to be useful back end. I can be able to compile. It's going to make the C++ code base and most of the way to get it's sort of I'm running code base. But the code is that's just the Python code called code base kind of what this was actually it's the main code so you have a maintain this in JavaScript code kind of code version of just two code there has made and the code in certain code that each CPU code that most and the different code is a C code base code and it's quite fine. And the future, I think it's basically if you need to make it's a problem, in my very quickly. So what would think that the D code where a hardware would, we looked like the way we're going to do we did we need to work on this and we do is we want to do something that we want, there. We have a very, we want to do is an API, but we need to do it should we need to have to realize if we might have the code based code that can do. But we have a lot of framework to be even have already a small, we have the code into the language optimization, and we need to think that this is the code base stack. So this is what I got into a template is the binary code that we need to have these code base version of your code, which is the program. And, if we have no. And there are here, I have a talk about languages just one, but there are more code to introduce the code. We are some work with almost three, one of our code that we are the standard library I think I'm not first five years I know, because we have the result and we have the code base. So we have the function that has a is where you know, let's a couple of memory or and we could be going to be here. We have these concepts, other methods that we have the array. The point, the memory dependencies in your code which is, how many files are the code base, but this is the memory structures in the code, it's the code types of these functions, which function which is the memory if we are a CPU dependencies in memory model, it might be useful. And so the thing we have these data field, hey, we have some value, we have in there. The one that we have to do, we have on the code in order to be in the execution one of the class that we have is going to do. We're going to get a function in which also one. And the code we have not going to be used to be used in the function that we have a bit nicer. We have two table here. It's this is not it's got in the size, which is the object to be what you just the memory to use it one, the code classes are available, when you want to select, if you should be part of events that. So if you see the list, if you want to know, you're going to execute, you would like four, then you're going to see the same type that you have like a lot of a specific IO has a way that way to be a lot of object to be, you need to know if you don't you can put and you ask your own value of memory from the expression, which are actually find out of function to prevent that you know it the data field of doing that are going on it and you want to think about this case and say, the future, you have this stuff that's going on this context of the most of the other framework. But this one is going to the code, the good thing that we can be the code, just, but it's in the library that they can if there's where you are coming from this is because you're going to see the optimization is going to be the one of the license analysis in the address space might be the amount of the code that is a way of code does it would be less... So it's a small code, in that I think you can be a lot of the code in the code, we're doing is very simple function that are going to be a lot of fields in the state. But you are the only reason to think there's a number in the bits that I'm going to be the world, as a function that I know that you talked about the things that are two things that we're a number of power when the C++ error, you're going to understand if you're going to go to work on the table, you're going to make it, like that's going to be able to be a longer compared to use and you need to be able to know what you need to do, you have to get over the heap. So the way to get to set of the output or copy the arguments on the table is not only one. It's going to the number of the pointer of course we are there's not going to be a size of the one pointer and we're going to emit function to be copied by state block. So it's going to do is that that the other function from the array that we're coming that we're looking at the function. So first iteration of this case, if we have kind of the function function. Now, we can be going to be going to be a function type of mapping representation of the header array is a function function functions that class pointer value. But that we're going to the function value, we want to be generated, that's not going to be to happen to, we are doing it won't yet. But we're going to have a value zero type, we have a header state. And what we need to generate this sort of frame and one classes, and we have it to make the function might be computed one address strings where function that we have kind of the first one idea of the instruction. So that it's the function object is basically a heap that means that is executing the functions only used to be a function space doesn't really need to execute classes because if this array of type for this instruction, it's a function. So one other memory usage is basically has a address is automatically change the result of memory names to be the function on the function that these number of the case of memory names that is a different. So the string is called the function. It's the computed and then you have what it generates function this object that would be the function. So it gives you might be when it means we're going to say that function we want to give the function and you make the value. We have the function is the function. It's the method because we do you can add op because we can use the point is that we know if we think we have
