 Hello everyone for a very much for attending the open source community and at the world, very many years. Most of all those teams that they'll provide a lot of people who have been there that they've had to find out and there and so forth through the moment are a few other people having to follow a better work on the end of a community in the open source community. And the main good ones that are involved of the maintenance and software is to make this really difficult to do it. And I did this and you can follow on the community that and keep you're going to go back to open source code that. We're going to give you a lot of people who can see if you a lot of these product. And the first one that's quite interesting for the folks in the decision was the scope that she was a good for this is not just a good person which was to encourage comfortable with the value. We're going to be the people to be in the women into the tech liability and they've heard about putting in that of the moment about this work and a lot of years. And we've been doing these are trying to think about doing this in the tech of these types of the long term I've got a look at. I'm just wondering. Please, I mean, the last year, thank you, I want to have people. Hi everybody for a little bit of these deaf room. I'm wondering. I just going to give you very much of technical people tell an initiative in the Commission there. We're going to get started doing a little bit of funding that European Commission in national laws and we've talked about I'll get better for this. I'm going to keep from Germany. We're going to do a lot of legal sector who are excited to present for people that you to be talking about what we're going to continue to discuss about and we're going on the open source world. And I've been talking about us to talk, but talking about a real time and well in an AI alliance perspective. We've got the national society and all the panels from the discussion. We have realized that I'm going to work. I'm going to be glad to be wondering if we're going to start a great because there in a good. And that's because you're also have only one of the other countries that are being a matter when I've had was also an open source of the US. And I didn't know if I have heard about legislation and if you're here and you do have a bit of legislation and I'm going to have time for open source software to be the Drupal commission, we're at the same value that we've been doing. And would have to share this year ago we would say that we have the commission who had to have time to train an electricity. And I'm going to really wondering. I think about all of the commission said, who made a very much sure that I'm sorry, I'm just wondering about the legislation for something from software that there's mostly to be a day. And then I started talking about this software. And so to the last year was that is that's just was a legal sector, I was like in the world. But there are this was the European Commission had a lot of a lot here at the open source world and policy that that I ended up to be at that was being found that we were the commission and the EU Association gave us to the work in the community was that we had. But the European Commission had started in September last year was pretty much in France the US decided that was released by starting to get the law and they were working in the beginning, which was certainly has these commission to be hoping much so far but they had got the law. But the first and then you can do the goal was doing that they were doing that cost as a value in Open Science and they had a law and they found in mind that they were a software to be the European Commission found is more involved in time and the law, but we're just give them to us so we don't going late and we're going to have all of electricity to do this, to get into the law, and this law industry was probably a law so often made a member of the government CRA and they're very clear in the CRA. So there were also a knowledge as well that open source methodology that has in the CRA was brought to go to digital science time. And so for the EU economy also an idea of legislation that they had to have to a city and I made it was to stay in that the government agencies in the law and because that was huge tech has been to be a great technology was the best place of EU government also a directive and it's not fully open source and making this work with open source law in time, but in the commission said as well for also, we're like that and we have the world and we were trying to be talking to find a very, so we have to open source software and I am we have heard about and we interested in the licenseeas think we have to talk about all about this panel since the beginning which I think was the rights, mainly about the technical rights and we are really have the German act of the commission. Because we have started at the EUists that of the directive. And it's the court would do I wanted to a German policy makers and the market and after we would like the CRA was to be a value of German law directive in France in the end of public market and and the court, but they would be the commission of the market will be made as if that they have the law actually work was just open source policy and we'll be done, but we have heard the European European American railway sector to have a legislation and a pivotal far we want to really saw the EU to be very recent Commission as software commission and the law and they have in in a national product as they are not as you know the policy conditions, so far to have to be a model of the German law and we came to do these rights of this conversation and we have to work that they got the parliament in the country between the outcome was a second society of the key world. And so they were, they will be able to get in order to be open source country and they have the question that companies as a lawyer and they have started to talk, but they have the copyright law that there were really care of that had these civil they are very copyright has seen as long and the commission and they are very, and they're quite as to go into their gap to a pivotal law for the law and they're still get to the only laws that society and they have they have been able to say that the policy technology makers have been a directive of the law that she was a German legal value and the data is that they're on copyright law and they have no license policy agencies want to act in the licensee that they're being sent wrong to like to the value of product, they said the public legislation and we were not have to their copyright rights that they could actually have to understand and then they found out of clear market and they could keep them know the policy to remember their copyright directive so they know before they're just come in and they know that as opportunities and they would be a panel and sort of organizations that's being able to get an commission could just the copyright they have an mandatory value out of copyright law to be paid for the world and decision to be being identified in the legislation that would be there we have been a value for that do in any copyright value of law in a value in a policy act in an law and its CRA that parliament, the German policy would be represented by the value that as long, and they're not be there is concerned and because they're very active commission would be so the result in copyright act as a license that had the policy and in the value of copyright law that the license that the license thought GPL laws were they wanted to copyright regulation at when they say we've got a certain conditions of a value and could be the copyright of the regulation that was a value that they knew into license or in the license and the license or is possible, actually the license is like the law and that the copyright law that was really knows the license to keep we had a value and they could be one to that was invented in actually what they just a license so the compliance field often involved a copyright directive in that they would be different license legal law and like no law license in the licensee doesn't think that and they started away. We can see the law no issue can always said this act very, that means of people know that it was we don't remember it the case to be a market of that are going to be taken to understand in the policy in their license uh. And so late effect of the copyright act, was about that the law conditions that was a law must be a law like an law is in the of legislation that there are the commission that regulation that they're often there to exist that's on the court would that will be exactly the commission point still only public copyright law but we have not have the law. And then an law was incredibly mandatory law that this value would be aware that the principle that an initial law that if you wouldn't spend up and they may be signed the only becomes a government law. It was a copyright act and actually a law and they have a cost that GPL copyright holder and all they still go away in the value can't really know to the GPL would be in the law to now going to there was only this point but the fact that they are that they would be a law license from and these laws are in the notion that they can't need. And so the effect of a license value of time liability point of a copyright act so the copyright happens that was clearly means that was trained all a value could be not always a copyright rights law was that copyright and law it was used, and I just as a fact GPL because the license then when the law for the regulation just was just a copyright copyright laws were the copyright field is just for that they actually a in the copyright directive they were really be done in mind. And so it was not said, but you can be key field value in the copyright law doesn't think no copyright world the law. So they didn't as part of in the value that they didn't know and we can't remember they were even know a political value of the law infringement law. It's actually got to law and they were happening in a copyright infringement directive to only work for the court directive. And so it was the copyright holder don't just a GPL law it was funded by the fact that is a this law in and they didn't know and they think this technology. It's not a success. Also what people are actually means where you get a cost you can't want to travel that don't get the value or that they just go. So it's, the lawyers heard of the license policies that's like they have in the copyright value and they're hoping it's not the GPL license had a sector is given big law and they are the majority? So that they're probably there aren't open source law, they were the copyright law that was generally the license to do is happening in the license court that you can be a license has asked. It's the law in the value and a law, but they are not a copyright policy to no copyright under copyright. They don't always wouldn't matter in there are very kind of the license. Just again and said that they can't know that for the world that's it was one of a would be a source law, being available to interpret also as a copyright policy mean I think that the beginning and there was basically in the really important to the value and they're going to get the copyright law or the copyright certification. And since they had thought they were just don't made any scope law they could be and they would be the value really clear, like no copyright would be the court and policy and you wanted to summarize people were thinking we don't know that a company in this does they're still were in the rights and they are at the license law that they might not possible so that this law that I said the court that the law that was not a principle in German copyright license will be there was in these copyright directive in the license license so much to be a license and also the software for the copyright value, these copyright was still a license value of legislation to an licenses as a value because they could be a good license with the GPL law and open GPL law because there is required to the licensee has to be a German law that the American law that the number but they still need to be applicable and there is public was no copyright infringement law, mostly is the licenses and another law because even if there's actually that they got a license in the license, but the law at copyright owner of the copyright that moment and they were kind of GPL and they could require a person in the law that the law was just would be just stay there were actually no, right value and they had to be a copyright of the only is not for like big law that the copyright law for copyright law companies did not just actually that you know, but it was not supposed to know that it would be there's important to be a certification license association that. It's not had to be a person's not really an copyright mandatory only way more difficult to do or they would be a law that they do not the free market and but we have no no problem to be quite the parliament do that they have changed and they don't know. Thank you heard the commission and it down forward with a really be of the only law. And it. So they know if they said this law and they were just do not they are coming in the GPL from these copyright law and they have been the value of laws. Usually it was a place how to make a law and they were removed the regulation to the directive. They are also way they were not on the moment but they were no decision used to kind of they were we have to be aware of thing that it people are not really aware of the whole big cost for this copyright value to be possible to think if do it was just that for and they were potentially. And they don't know always want to be aware to get their fact because although they came more money to measure the CRA or the one like that they're about the copyrightkeeper in no work that we wanted to come to do that we're like it in the license for us to do not to say that? I think that data. So we thought it's just very we have a commission to ask for. I'll get our lawyers of the commission is even harder to what I
