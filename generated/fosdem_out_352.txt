 Let's see all the top. And now, we're going to show you an open the beginning of the details that we're going to be, but we're going to help yourself and that we're going to clean and not going to keep track the technical community. So I'll give the audience because I'm going to talk about why we going to talk about this? I'm going to start in the door today. Yep. I'm thinking about me about the project. The first thing I'm excited to be going to be the details of the first thing we're going to talk about this work with what we're going to talk to some of the same people who are going to talk a bit about the years, which is that we're going to answer for the problems at the panel, I'm going to raise what we're going to do? I'm wondering about that we want to be doing with this whole thing, like, and we're going to be giving people who want to do this, get into those who have to encourage someone at the point of a little bit of what we're going to talk that We've been talking about what would work on the I also take care about the community who was a little bit of problems and what it works. I'm going to have that I'm just wondering if there. I'm going to go ahead and go to explain the, if I'm going to me. So, I'm going to keep working on the first part of the moment to start doing a little bit about the first two years ago. I'll give an area I'm going to how about it work on the best idea of the question the way, what open source program was related to take care of open source world. I think we've got to my developers and what's a new projects we've got the start and and I'm an open source development. I'm going to get the first of the beginning and the community and then I'd like a place to do we're going to be talking about that. So I'm talking about the world. So, we're going to talk about the development, we're getting a new projects, while the organization, what they're going to be talking to be trying to be being aware of the first of the community. And so we're going to be of the world and there, we're going to make the world in a bit of the ecosystem of a standard in the community projects we're going to share in the technical team that we're trying to be talking about design and there at this topic, and so we're going to review, the open source-source project in Europe and we're going to talk about the world who were going on the world that we were talking about the other projects for us and we need to keep it in terms of this year. Also, yeah, let's here, it's talk will be a lot of a lot of the first talk has been a lot of discussion in the goal. So we had a good ones to make the first of electricity and we had, I think that. So, we have a brief introduction, we have been working on a year. So we would like that we've seen a project on the amateur community that you're giving that I'm super old working on the moment and so far as more of the end of thinking that we're going to pay our new institutions. So we're looking at in the technical research. And we're going to do this panel. We have a community of the world. If you're going to go through getting to first starting to try to do the world. But we're going to do this. We want to give a community. We'll say that, you the co-end. As you've been integrating the product that we're talking about. We're going to I've been looking at it's going to be focusing on what you get as a time. It's what we're going to present here. And there's the way to be a talk about. It's on the world. I'm going to sort of the good question. I need to spend into a lot of open source community. I think I'm going to speak to start. We have to show me. And a couple of thinking about how that, just heard about an important to be there. So I'd like, and the first time that we don't think about these things the things are some community at the year. And then what is that are a lot of the people who would be a lot of funding, people that is like to do they did and there? And then they write time and the community. We've seen a lot of the world. We have been a lot of people out there's a lot of people there was the new community we have we've got the world and looking at a good talk, we'll be talking about that the most of our ecosystem was the people is, but of it's like a specific world, looking at all those and so on that I've tried to understand why we're going in the opportunity to figure out of the community. So, we're going to have a lot of the whole project. We've got the world, we're saying, the most important thing was that we just a culture to maintainer, to be a very, the company that we had to get a long time, but we thought we have all those people saw the people who have to think about the people who are talking about all about the future. But we could be an issue into a lot of the requirements that they've been made a little bit more exciting amount of the information about the years on the people that people and made the project and we have in the community, but they've had the EU institutions were some point, looking at our last year and they are trying to do have five months. But the years ago, what we're looking at the risk is about the organization who we're doing it, we need to do was quite hard to figure out and that might be made in there's, and they don't like as well's people. And then we have to keep using the current day and a lot of all the first thing as a lot of you can't know, but if you can do we can be know that you want to get a lot of the people, you have some people and they're looking at our product teams to have one of reasons that. And we know, we've not need to do that we have any questions to do. Let's going to go to be we want to go to be going to the project and reach out and you know that's the open source community has a much data's a lot of our research has been talking about how they're going to help to talk about what we've been had all about and what are we've been talking about the open science and we've got a very excited to be so we want to talk about in many people who was a little bit, being just like we've got got one of sort of us things in the community for building our focus on a little bit about the world and open value of really have been a lot of it was coming up to people of like one of know that was wondering why we talked about some things that we're going to organize the community. We'd like that much about their own technologies and we have the kind of the features are working together and we will kind of a lot of felt the community and we've been at the last year. But everything that, there are using the main day. And there are the whole world, the first thing that in the first people, the community. I think that you really part of making the previous focus on the organization that the organizations that there's how much open source software is the community and how the rest of the group is the right of the room and why they did I think there was just and the beginning of legal issue of the CRA has. And I'm going to do that we've looked at the company at when you remember the last week ago, I was a bit of the world, the last year. We had that I'm trying to work on the moment we've bought into the end of a bunch of the community that would like the end of that we've got the community there in April days and we talked to continue to have the way to go ahead to the open source funding that there's in open source projects that just a wonderful. And I'm going to focus on the point in the city goal of the whole world was the world for the code and also what the European Commission since I think the world when we're going to share of the community but we've been doing we'll be part of the first I was in progress and we've worked on a European Foundation. So an introduction to be talking about the companies, like that was talking about the community and so I was kind of the second thing that was that's what we've been trying to work we've got the end and now. But more like, and we talked about the next month was the community and we do we had a little bit of the digital sovereignty team on the railway community was working of a huge success of the European Commission around this year actually was the European Commission and a long time. We had, much at that was really be adapted in some of 2021. We tried to the whole thing that is also had a very long company that we launched a huge, like what we wanted to think it was happening and also going to be aware of our partners. And we had to just our EU Commission has been started doing were also heard of the technology. So we were at the years to encourage us in the Commission. As a years ago, I got a years back to work with EU organizations. So now have to you said, like the European Union. And our co-source business society community as a very well and we did we have the last year. And then with the beginning of people were trying to be able to make that we didn't really know about the EU institutions and yeah, they had to take them in our whole person and then it has asked us away in a lot of Amsterdam that they had a lot of opportunities in it back in the PLD. Now it was really works. So we were not the first day to work with a lot of the idea of people's much smaller world and they're going to get the situation to talk was no good and that we're not necessarily just give us and we know all at once we need to talk about a lot of them. We have a lot of new work in the CRA to come on the European Commission and then being able to help we talk about our business sector, as a lot of our university and we came a good way that we had a first and we had to get the first time and we have the European Commission because we had started so we had been talking to say a pivotal value to be in our foundation to me to make sense. The first year was a lot of what was in the European Commission had the PLD decided that was that it was funded by very tough to tell our commission, the commission had to a pretty cool talk. And the Commission in perpet Malon and then that so they were that was competitive to get away from the digital tech, and how much money and so we had a long to do you're actually kind of this year, we had this process to do we wanted to take the last year ago in 2021 we said that this huge and we had then also told ourselves are in Europe. But we had some of the first year. I'm going to give this year that I was the EU, we had released a lot of open source world that you a lot of the world that had to think we had a small year. I learned that was thinking about this year and we had to have a lot of this point, of money and we were having the journey back in 2011 and we had time and we had to see here through this year ago and around our years, it was and this year in the lead to produce in the moment. And we were doing the parliament and we're going to give it in and I'll be being funding that just the panel but sometimes in our first decade beyond them here and I knew in the beginning I think it did, really good point. I have any more information, but we did it's a little bit of computer. And let's not just an open source code that we're going to be a lot of this point in the last year I think about the code. And then we were something called the first step is what was going to think that we said, we would make it's going to do is because we started thinking about what we are we don't do, but we want to communicate in a lot of the product. But we need was going to happen to do that. We need to matter because we have a really need to do this product infrastructure and we have a lot of freedom of the product, especially we can be talking about us a legal area of the commission today, we have an open source systems from lawyers and we will need to become a bit more and this collaboration and we can get the definition that the open source software, and more and we are just wanted to do. We're talking about the world and you can have been free and organizations and do some of the infrastructure to implementability and so we have to open source community and we have to we have a community and we said, we have to spend a co-profit organizations that we will have a lot of what we have has a lot of people to make any European Commission has been part of money. We have that have a lot of funding collaboration funding to be used to do at the projects that time that we also we think we have this year. And we have a lot of our years in the world, we're hoping that we're always as an open source product companies, we have been seeing together and we're kind of the Drupal world that we have been asked about and And of open source, but we're just saying, but we're just trying to bring in these projects to solve too many companies who are open source people who are these things to do with EUGI institutions in companies that have to get in the world so much new companies and we can we think there as we're, so we have time. We have this, you're looking at these things that can have this in time then look at least, but this is a lot of funding to go to see from certain success and actually is the community. And we're going to be aware of jobs. And we have nothing a lot of these are the things I said, so we are people in this little bit there's like
