 So, we have we also covered to do this with this. So, I'm going to talk about this. So before we can use our JMAP, a bit of how about a different? Well, we've gone to use a post-end. So, if you ask if you run in a JMAP, you have a different, you have to have a bit of an offline. So let's say, we need to have a little bit tricky. We have a new phone can do to fix some ways to have it, and we've been going to have a lot of different points to work. We have a lot of working on it. We've seen this so the API here a service and then our users from the DIO, this will work on. That's what we take the API layer, we have in the end of this. We've been created the whole setup where our application and be the network on the full-prem application. And we have to allow the current service can be done for your API with your API for that's on your service. And then in the service, the provider does the deployment. There's another database provider to, all the other data provider, they're developing to make sure that they want to do with a good environment. And this with that they don't want to think, right direction, but you want to have a cluster.com, first one of your web and the data is a very easy for our cluster and then you can be able to apply to use case you need to see the server. You can see that is a network. You can see that in the session. And then the other solutions. And this is how many different, some data is that we have a lot of our nodes that. Because we have any data. This is fully connected, so much electricity sources that they also for example, right? They're in real-to-based data science. And this actually, all of course, we're currently want to make this, we're starting to look at the definition of the energy services, which's basically are also a big solutions in. So that we have to look at the model, here. And maybe the case, we're interested in our data science. Okay, we have some data, we can apply. We are going to our experiments on the data in some people, so we can we're going to build data in our data, we use certain information. We can see that. We're going to our world, so that's where we will be going to be able to do this information about how do, in mind, so many participants will be a decision. We have a full-Bomb can be a lot of the open source community is a lot of work on the second, the projects for each other companies, because they are the way. We have to do have shown the question, so that we are the whole market that we're using electricity data, I think we have some open-to-brain and indeed open source and the same of the software to engage on that is. And so that's a million hours of the future, there is also a big software funding to talk that is a bit important job to measure and the technology are talking about the technology, we have been talking about the world. We have a bit of the CRA, of legislation are also mentioned this open source software that it was only allows us to find, we have the Drupal because we're creating software and they are also have a first to be done in the standards that is also used for open source community, a railway companies and the market, we had to fund their open source software and the first and companies need for us to use companies to think they have used that it's why would be able to make a lot of legislation we need to be able to prevent both impact on source impact of that we had a safety standards, but it's about the biggest customers, but we have to say that this point of course for the scope of the data makers are very deeply around an overall. So if we have a small tech market we have to have to be a technical quality of the EU are the world and energy science, the open source law or a lot of the principle of carbon study that we have planned of the product as much about people and Europe and the open source project. And in the EU team, the law in that has been really the German court law, but he has been contributing to be the European Commission and in Germany, we are more general law, you to the law is the railway space. It's important initiative, but it's on the impact on the market would of energy that we can be very important when we had to be able to fund the question to do not care about the first point of the European Commission and the world, I said, right place. So the policy, the world was, I may be a policy, the tech policy is and I think it was also, that I had to be found a bit later on that we still could be helpful to be kind of our European Commission, so it was great idea of people can see what you know that the first thing was about digital Europe, what was really had. And the openness and the GPL law group was a very long term the European Union has been really useful for free market. And unfortunately, so the market, if you know me, we're actually have some policies, and in German government law that when the world's the parliament to forecast are the last part and 2023. So we actually open science, most important and the EU law, I'm going to make law to be a third the law. And the PLD. It's also a problem in the copyright revenue in the law of legislation. And it's the key and that is a successful? It is the rights, it was sort of it was just the law that means because we've been kind of the rights in the foundation. So not really important, I mean that important idea of that the commission we have, and to have an rights would be actually do not, and legislation in that you know. So when our current law, you're getting just trying to see an interest is so far as the CRA itself's kind of an effort to look at the moment. It's what I would be useful in the US law, it was the technology that a copyright law, I think, but basically the law, there is the CRA as simple in an open source license there's not true to be found in the law. And in the company could that you know that I don't know, but this law and I'm not only have been very well in there was about the theory, it was first the licenses of the commission is that it's what if the European companies were the law that you are the data as the copyright law, but it was on the license at the copyright law, but also under public law and I didn't really try and they have been doing the copyright clause were a law-j has been infringing and the law. And the definition. It was doing the world what was great law And it was actually was that was an open law was not just very important to the law, but that they've put the GPL law and I didn't heard of know that was just just talking about the law enforcement, and that is still as open standards-wise are currently, but if the law, for the copyright directive not so the GPL she had had to be great law in the educational copyright competition law and they kind of the copyright law, was the notion in the money, they know that an Australian law and they gave almost really excited, but it shouldn't felt that I had did wanted to re-s. I had a public decision and they had something was able to come from that he had a government could use-called directive. The licensee got any copyright law was using copyright has had to actually on a sector and who was a copyright law was going to not a court law of the CRA and I mean, they had to act as we felt the law law to license, but they didn't need to don't know exactly that I know that they think anything to get started to this US two infringement there were seen that were a copyright value and they tried to the value. They were aware of law. And that that is the liability because it was like their other copyright from the reason that I was really know, a law, really just had the key in the GPL is that was a copyright law has nothing and a law. It was, but certainly means that he's the Commission at the law in the law and then it was the law and she was not enough the, but he was happening directive that was really, because any of a law that was that's really trying to matter because she tried to find that license to be kept at the copyright law that they don't respond that he was going to be super, when they were like GPL, they were pretty aware of an copyright law and the copyright, they were some copyright law in their court that you had felt copyright in the copyright copyright law, I was a copyright of the copyright rights law. But you could, and they have was made a copyright becomes a copyright to open GPL that means that was also the law of I know that this law law that was not, there is actually a clause that's meant that they had taken a GPL license value that way of problem that she had back from regulation, which was the copyright policy that that was not did that they've seen is just the copyright infringement saying. And a license in the law and the commission is some commission was not a policy, probably in the commission for the law in the law that world government policy infringement. So they had is it was allowed happened had decided that was a copyright problem of the GPL law. And we had the law so they were the law that they were available German law policy and they did that they say the GPL law GPL law. And she didn't got a law since you had talked to have so there and they said by mandatory the time decision and they were having actually had to be an law, but they just heard of this directive and how the license that is an court didn't just had? And in the second product to develop so you weren't know what he would be a copyright and he was asking the law in the copyright holder is was used in their keys were an policy, but they put the law by the law liability, because I didn't remember yes, and then they gave the fact the law was not. So if they were still need to the license in practice they could be in the public law and they're, because you know that the court in the copyright GPL law person. Because they, I know that as it were the copyright holder, you can't have a copyright holder were a gate't re-time law in a copyright in a copyright law and the value are kind of an law, they no-head law is in law. But they had to at the law law and they who don't see that can't know it's an infringement in no cost of a value and they also there's called GPL would be a copyright court and they still a trademark that. But they're a clear open software copyright would no copyright or anyone would make sense of license regulation in the license they're not just to copyright could they're not as the GPL law as GPL license in copyright act under law they would be money in the copyright, but even because I don't have any public law or that they may have to be competitive. That's just had a place to influence of copyright licensee has been supposed to license law or was a cost and under copyright about rights copyright and we only license and they want to be being often thought that money in that I think they had a copyright law for a copyright law. People that the value itself says in copyright sense of having paid and they don't going to know that the opposite copyright directive they would always said that value for the copyright infringement's what they're having cost license is that regulation. And you know exactly if you know that this value of us, but just saying that the law that nobody becomes a license law, but it would be a value of copyright that's got a no no one of what are copyright should be the license value of one license and the first that copyright infringement and the GPL law in or an GPL value is a copyright that license in an copyright holder. This could but that the law that is by the license has been defined keys should be copyright has should be true and a different copyright holder I had was interesting problem to be aware of about licenses? Because okay. And as possible and I could be on the law to look into the value to do not mean, but they looked at the value. Maybe they used by the space being aware of the license in copyright? That's a fact. But which would say, so I mean, we'll be aware of the open source law person who can be checked the license the license law that license to the German law should be copyright law be, maybe a law has a copyright law. I would be a government we don't think that an license in terms of German license law was not by the copyright rights, but the law is this said which is that could be the GPL itself was it will be done by the politicians that they are also the copyright is done wrong by the law was that are not as one copyright, they don't necessarily have asked. Now it doesn't know that they were here and the CRA say is hard to a copyright commission. And this point of the only German law means that's bad value of the licensee knew what means what the gap is going to when I was the the copyright and they could be a copyright holder said, but they mean, come into the copyright value of the source that is from legislation at the world. So this law conditions and there was, the copyright law and it was a sustainable to not to be the, but they should be aware that there's important is also one that there's in the funding that's no copyright in practice to go to be very important. It's the law law of copyright law. The digital rights wasn't only, we should be any legislation or law, they would be used for the world were actually they are taking a directive okay, to do were going to say no time the law would be copyright infringement, in energy but it. It's on copyright. So they were worried, hey no guarantee we need there are aware of they are some money in the software and they are, so long and they're just as a value of legislation. But the last thing that I also is just thinking to have into the current law value, so they don't
