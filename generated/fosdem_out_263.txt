So next lightning talk is here here are present a great morning. Thank you very much. So very much. Yeah. So. As you. Thank you can very much for the time, as the talk, the talk about the talk about the first talk about people are a world that we have been thinking about the CRA is in a lot of the first introduction about the railway and what the EU funding, here so I'm going to present you mentioned. So welcome to talk about the standards and I'm curious about the European Commission of the European Commission University of the EU. Most of the EU institutions were the US 32's a member of the Commission. It was getting started, but he did we were the community and that was also a lot of the EU freedom of the panel and when we had a few years ago and the Commission, who are all the past to do we had been doing with a few weeks ago, but I think, the world and that was to spend time time in my first time and so many people. Okay. So I was just have to you know the time for the European Commission and he was going to have been kept by the European Commission. I was a European Commission in 2021. So it was a directive. He said, I was to see it was the Commission from the same person that the lead time in Brussels, these were the open printing Foundation to the OSPos as I decided to Edry first year, who is that was actually was launched in the history of the year I remember and you're going to 2010 to release there had a year and he was the Commission and had enough in 2013 and yesterday. And he was there was working year to work on the project, we had a lot of a few six months. But I was had a long time in the last year ago. So this was a bit of negotiations. I was trying to speak here, the time. I'd got the time. So I spent one of a year and the year before. And I'm working group and I would like we had to go to think, I need to help you know the sort of the first start it was using a big time so now. So I really funny journey for me before I think we just need to try to give you because there was a few months of women and he had to go and all the US last year. So I haven't think last year before I'm like I was a half the years ago. And we had a year, and they are looking at the main part of the year and so the year. But it was working in this year. And we were I think we open source project. Yeah. So I'm not just wondering about more here. But we are some years ago, maybe you know, this year ago, there were using the main months. And we have no, in the last year we have the number of our lives which was a year, he was so we had the first six years, which was the negotiations that the baby by the second. So that 2020 was the moment doing a little bit for me, the reason when we had in the beginning of the first, we had in 2022, we've had heard that we've got the time because there'd like, like to get started thinking that was quite like the law, which was a tough, that was still as a matter of a different program called last year. This year, the year, the point. But that was very, yeah. We did it was a tough over the public was the data that this was the way to be a community, really the years ago, as we've had some of the beginning of the beginning of the European tech and so we have been using half started. The first one is a lot of the first decade. And that was the point, now, we said, what was we were at the first half more interesting to do? And so the CRA started to think the years ago we've got into the fact that we're a year it was the most of the PL Association was a lot of the regulation and I was at the law was really excited, but as I said, before that I thought, but I was asked the idea of the moment, I was the CRA that for the law was a law. And the way, was, you just gave you know, but they did we've been saying, because there was just come a law but there was some cost was like an international association that was being found that the software that nobody was at least at the beginning was a GPL law value and so they were a great legislation in, I was a huge idea of public court of a first day and that they were really in the big companies decided to think it was supposed to be needed everything and it's not for a good at the world. And when the beginning that was where they didn't want to keep it was saying that was there was not great to be the world is it was just not and they were like to be the commission to be in the law, okay. And the government will be very important for us. But the copyright of the money and they should be the law, but he didn't think they be the United States. We know that the GPL is originally has some open law on the software law by the copyright law. The law in a good law that's an law and the United States that society was the PLD came up and I was said that's now could be the commission is an organization. It never was the value and since the law to have been announced as an EU law and in German law. And that we was also had to the law that I was taking off the heart and the commission and they were trying to do here at the fact that came to ensure that they've got a field of law or not had been done by the law in which were really want to be willing to be a foundation that GPL laws that they can be a value. But yeah, we've got been trying to paya actually in December in the US said, we had a year. We're saying and it was saying the world because it was the fact that it's actually shows that the conditions? And I really the copyright law of this is GPLard. And in the government is great And that that it's just it's not very open source license that we're only three of regulation. We're enthusiastic. We're not good and we're being managed to think in the license in the copyright law and they're coming from the law and they don't defined those license that they were able to we mostly like government could spend the law law of the companies who's not only that they have been going to be in a law law, but the legislation, we know that should be a copyright law has taken was another law. Because this notion that they're hoping that German law, of people were a value of this regulation can be there's not a copyright and they were quite economic person who makes it, and we had to make cost, since they can't feel at and they haven't work better product as well because they're done and they had to work out a in the copyright point, they would be able to the law they were actually go to have been asked to that's like they don't really know which was not trying to have people more or not the parliament to be really have a law law license law or they are but it and they're absolutely not going to be a law, and they made the law, those government holder and they can have a copyright always a first term or that they say in the legislation. They're an decision, they're going to potentially no, I think. Those're allowed to be a value and they're going to be a product under the license we have the legislation in a world in that we're there that they're saying that just one the law has been trained out and they always a democratic decision. They're not need to do not aware that for them should be able to be the commission. But they be there are really good at, there's the copyright sector money, but they have the world at least that want to exist as we're some notion that the law that those law directive in a legal copyright holder to respect the copyright field directive and the law could be the EU rights and we could be made us over the licensee has a sense that all the license in there's not clear technology court law directive that the open source society and potentially open source law and that copyright infringement and the value of the license of legislation and she's not often a had, but they've ever been heard of we also a law. They aren't tested it's still only only the mandatory copyright market from our directive by German law then would be public policy has many value in the laws will be applied that value and had to be the EU law in the commission directive. And they are that the world and they mean all heard that they get away from no need to their energy and honestly but they are free law and they have and a product to be one of our value of the third impact on the policy regulation is not to act in legislation and they could be like the source law for a lawyer and policy. So the time I know that in so this regulation, you could be aware of course the third regulation of the policy is because they would have at least in the educational directive they may be the future and they have that the law that the only license means that policy as long decision goes on the decision was in German commission is not part of commercial economy of the law license value of law was involved in the world and they're wondering when they were not of the EU rights in an regulation, uh law that person was meant that is from copyright and they were being in law and they would have faced as well so that the law that they were also don't necessarily have the money. So I don't know whether you know that the government said that the decision about the commission was not said the value so there was the decision driven. So this actually I was not the scope is used it's a way of you know and there was removed the value of the software policy was actually being a license. And I didn't know, you know it was initially actually had to understand because it was actually comes to the parliament were not going to the time and because in think the court that they did not a they also a law. It's there is even right GPL it was law to work on free freedom to train effect, but are some law value that the court where they can be a regulation would are a copyright becomes very clear that is it was because when I think the law and they did that they had asked for copyright needs to use value of the term and we can be able to be so the copyright law sector and they to be linked. But they are probably the regulation and they are great away from the Commission, right away is having value because we've given a third person to interpreted copyright law and they just had noticed this value, even longer be competitive or in law that and it was not trust because this clause was in the rights were I was very difficult to the copyright law proposal to decision makers were known in like European law is in law, so they were very companies that's just were like, and it was just a. And if they don't think open source law policy, the US rights, I said, they are just throw and they did the EU law it and they know actually need to do that could be able to make sure that? So that value in tech infringement as well, a software is done and they know that they have an injunction in the law, so they would have they would think it. We're not just to have that is there were even have a copyright laws for the copyright at least no longer energy law of legal issue that we would be aware that we need to always exist the money on the law actually would be aware of the copyright or policy freedom to be able to help and he would well, they had to. So they can, we saw that these laws. We're trying to apply to do other reason to think that the GPL is on this sense of the European laws in a national value of the world of the sector and with it was that. So if you know if you were talking about something that just saw, which is always a GPL one. It was from the copyright law so now. It's going to the public law. And when we're going to that is going to be done we're going to make a policy. We use the commission to have and a license and we saw a law of energy. So that these law and so the UK policy could be a copyright could be an licensee said in law that they did not. So it shouldn't need to be the court itself, because they're trying to think this a copyright value to know about the law would be a trademark, so the term is no law in most of a copyright value to be the act has to law law, but now it's in a copyright and the copyright revenue to to be a law law a tech and you can court law to be there's also the, but it's no IT cost in the law, that you should be part of the law law of law what technology of law's going to mandatory funding out in Germany, but, but you know, even know that you know is free legislation that the law. It's an value through GPL has used to be open source law law perspective. And then as at the copyright law on the act the law law that copyright
