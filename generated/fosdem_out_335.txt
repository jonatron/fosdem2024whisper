 Okay. You see. Again, it was a little bit of a bit more than Wi-Fi, open source, a job that's called Exain. It's a good architecture. So the main point of this is the main idea of the first work. We're going to be using a web browser. And we get a minute for our friends how you keep doing we actually see the new plugins to the browser in the browser. And they're going to come back to be part of the browser. And then we have a full browser. So it's something like that is actually a Python. And that is it's a minute of what they're going to be able to create code. And also a whole thing that we're going to build or pull request that. First of our web browser and the browser. And then people share your code. So it's the other building. And that's going to get an technical problem to be very straightforward. And I think that the first point in the code. And what we have to start doing we're going to end, or trying to do. And the right hand. So we're going to start an emulator. And if you're going to start to figure out where you start up. And everything that. So we're going to do everything. We just in the web and I'm sending them. I'm going to show you're just going to introduce us this presentation that the browser, because that we come to make a developer talk we just saying how much time? And if you can go ahead to the end up a different rooms in the media, the web browser, they're going to your browser. And right. Probably. It's an end, right now. It's a web. So I felt before I'm going to discuss about it's going to be to talk a community. Or any things that. So the data? Great. Yeah, I'm going to be there. It's a lot of a lot of things that we're talking to sort of applications. So what you're like it's the web UI about the WebAssembly and I'm going to make everything here. So these tools are people who are doing here to be focusing on the end-friendly. And that we are the project manager of the web projects that open source support for the maintenance. So in the folks, I'm going to be really well. We are talking about the end. So our front end, the first part of the projects that I'm going to talk about GitHub in the digital science. So we are the staff in the open source website. And I'm not sure that? There's part is an open source and the project, I'm not sure that there's a little bit of the ones that they are the community. And I'm going to talk at the community that I'm going to do a few months ago, we're thinking about the Go at the community and I would like in the day most volunteers that. But I think I was a seat and I love, so I'm Daniel open source in the world. I'm working on open source projects with the community of the community has been at the end of the world. I think about what I'm going to joinflow, but I'm a lot of the beginning. I'm going to be the beginning of my talk about the first and I'm making the real community is the world, I am going to talk about the most important and one is the challenges in 2019. I was to be interested today the world that in the talk at the community. So what I'm a bit about the social conference between this. So I'm the very much of the second thing, I saw that I'm talking about that I'm happy to what I'm in the beginning of the first three and I'm going to give you today to think we had this week in the other people're going to do is going to explain what we're going to us a long world of the most important to talk to work in the world. And of this is we're going to come to be a little bit to finish the world to work that was in the challenges of the end of the most open source community because we had already at. And we have a quick. We have to do have like I mean that we could have time and we had a lot of the right now we have been talking about the ideas to come from the first of the top of freedom to our society and the question. And I think we're much forward the very happy to ask one I think that are we've been asking about the idea about the time and to me about and also like I think we've been doing for the EU. And we have this question was wondering about the last year before I think that this is open source community, to be an open source project, for any people and open source community working on the good question of the world in the community have about the product because he is for the community and we have no, we've been using the reason that is it's going to grow into the last big companies are starting to make this source project and they're going to kind of the first of the product are going to be involved into the government but they will be able to be, so much the parliament to have to be the legislation and these organizations and the first of researchers, when we're going to go a co-source project. Like we've got from OpenDesk and we're some of our society and they're hoping that they're going to get a lot of open source community has been a very useful knowledge of people who can like a really know that go ahead of these people who have often the people we're not have some of information that they know that they're going to be coming in the second thing we're being done people who's like two months. But we've got our community, is not going to have been to talk about the time and we've been in the most open source project so we've got a big product science to contribute on a lot of the software in the world. And we've got to those like that we have lots of these open source projects that we can see that come to start with their time of people to think about the world of what is the communities that could point we're in the world. So there's what we can we know about that the market, we've got a question. There's called Open ScienceNet people who had because they've got a good thing, so they're using a lot of a lot into the world and at a lot of years, but they have made that if we've been have to get started and we don't have a little bit of companies and we've seen think that we have a huge impact on and so they have a lot of open source code that the knowledge in the impact in the community has been the challenges of communities on these organizations that we've been in Germany who have seen as companies that we want to dojo we're not want to work on this really see some contributors to know about the projects around this initiative. And we have a couple of the last year. And that we've got the CERN's around this, right? We also the first in this year, we had a lot of this And our project was announced that we had been doing is a C funding as you've seen a lot of people can we have a very much money in the company, but we've got this new team going to have always been a community of a product open source community, and have a great team in a lot of the other communities that we also been doing this. And we got a bunch of people did this involved in the product as I just could have to build on their own communities that they are a lot of public sector. So we're going to make our people on the best software at the right and we have like we're working at like free software under German CRA. We have the big practices for the world. So we have to talk about that's over here. We want to get a culture of the same thing from our people. We have had a talk a lot of the world we've got to co-t. And the long to be, we're going to follow up to dojia, but we've got a large world, and we're going to encourage you're going to kind of time to get into our software as a great big companies that we're at the world, which we're going to communicate with these community that we've been looking at the world of our CRA, engage on and that is going to work on. And they're going to have an goal of the day. It's we're going to help our goal. So we're looking into our software, we're going to talk about the companies. And we're going to our solutions, so we have do want to organize the issues. We have this we're going to come on and improve the product. And we're going to do a lot of money to do this is the principles of people to be a place that we're going to keep looking for that we're going on the data at our community to follow over at the AI open source software. And where we are we're going to start creating a very often looking at the end we're making our open source projects that we're going to introduce it into this particular product and the product, we'd be looking in our AI and at the world. And we're going to recognize our community, we're in open source community, and we're going to start to come from the world. So even keep going to be the first one that helped us we're going to do for this. And if we have a survey, which we're going to be like co-legize and you know, who's going to do this. And we're going to talk to see why I'm going to talk about, we're from the notion of the commission here if you still doing this gap. I'd be wondering what we're going to find it's going to do we're going to look at the world and we're going to do, you're going to bring our photos and you're going to engage with the most of the first step to be able to make this money out of the time. So your community's going to do not always said we're going to be a story of the end of the future. And we're going to show people out that we're going to be first person to keep going to go through to the panel to be talking about the EU people to continue and stuff just have to talk about what I think about the open source development, very important to be open? But please give you very important to us a great discussion here for us to try to make open source conference of all the area and who are not. Also in the process, but the last questions. So we have heard about the focus on the European Commission in the product work on the world. And I think of the first point is a huge product of how we are we have done it had to ask on a lot of legislation from free software and looking at the impact on the law from the developers who was a more important point were to make a very often so we have a product. We had a lot of a great one point of our community which was very good and also one that we wanted to think about how open source projects in a lot of a bunch of revenue in the world and we have this little bit interesting I think I have a lot and the foundation of people coming to have been asking the tech in software and we will always want to know and last year and a seat and also talked about the world that one of a couple of them is a bit and the world, but yeah, well a couple of time and I'll have been a lot of months ago and they are the space of people. And there are here have been a few people who have been a majority of people to be here on the last year. So I have to do the OpenStreetA Security economy of the main ones that we've been doing this project called the code and we've heard about the world. We do I'm going to join us and make sure I'm going to make a web projects. We have been going to talk to talk about our agenda of a good companies. And I'm curious about people. And I'm going to talk about why I'm going to talk about what we've got to be talking about me to you because the first introduction to do is about the community we want to talk about the community and we have just said we have to make our community and our community and will be ready to be able to have to talk about the big data that to bring the next projects and a very often the researchers are doing a very good community projects. And I don't going to get time. So I'm going to you know that you heard our people that the company work was very specific project. And I think what we've been going to do is going to find a collaboration for the world. And so much more power of the year, just talking about, I was just the work at the collaboration, I'm going to get to know at the world. So next time, we're going to go to talk about the digital community. You're going to the good idea to have to be speaking of the world. So we're going to talk about this panel, from our last year here it's like, good companies, like to you know, but now. So, okay, we're a few months, I think I've been in the agenda. I think I'm going to end of the last year ago. And of the beginning of a talk was that we were about the world. And I think I was talking about the whole team would like, we're a great community. And that we're very well on the very, I'm going to share as we ever started a couple of a new community, the last seven years ago. And so do this thing that are all the world. It was the world. I'm going to make a group of people are just wondering, you know what we have, you have, but we have a very often want to start doing like, we know about a lot of what was going to do? So this, we have these opportunities as kind of people, we're having a lot of, we're doing as a lot of, we're talking about something that. And what we're coming from a lot of them who are here. So, I was just heard about it was speaking at the community and just wondering what is we were looking at the CRA. And as we wanted to give us like, I think, and I'm
