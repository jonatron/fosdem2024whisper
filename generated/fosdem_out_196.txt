 Here we have a little bit more about it in it. This is the open source software and the future is a lot of things where can implement it. It's just a link to the right issue in 2019, but of what we spend an idea of the future and the idea is that when it's in the code base perspective that's going to keep it and the sort of need to get into it on that. If you do that? Because this is a function that is kind of the function. But it works. You can't give you a number of values that you a string table in the first of the pointer to calculate the table. The objects, in the return the value is that it does the function so you need to do that you have to change this lock it in that. Or you didn't run for the table. But this same line is a read as a JSON function as it is a list. And so it's just sometimes it is this. Here's that does it, I'm going to start the thing. So this is the class, the mark might have to enable for example. If you just write a function. It's really not readable if you're going to be a stack. Because it's going to actually put this method in a function into the stack, you a kind of what I'm really well, I'm going to write actually have events using the frame. I'm going to match the pattern. I'm going to look at a function. So I'm going to show you're going to take a look at least two, the value of a state. And I'm going to handle some point in this talk, what I'm thinking about is I'm going to have an error array of the output thing I'm wondering and I'm going to give me a number of the objects lock file and you an array of header function will be interesting, but it doesn't, so in Nambo, the array does a reference. And then you see to code. You can see on the event. You can now you can see the next thing that the register that was creating a way. It's what's just the IO. And if you're doing is going to do we're going to look what I'll be doing that. It's going to add the value of the input point that we're going to another function. So how many attributes, it's going to put in the size of our object to a number and everything that we have to be the value called a register to keep the function. It's our function because the instruction in a function, I have to read on this state code, in two types, four, which is right? I could be, and here and the LLVM point. So what I'm going to show if you because I'm wondering, I didn't know, that you would like, the type. We have a thread doesn't have to see when this first this is nothing I'm going to use cases of you can say kind of the function to change from the code. And then I have it. So I don't really weird that is a loop in Go's not just just going to read, I didn't know, it was going to start building a B zero because I'm going to look like, but I was going to be going to do I'm going to look at the arguments, you're going to present. And so I'm going to happen to show each time to get a couple of the pattern. So I'm going to get in the first one, I'm going to be going to go back to I'm a bit. And I'm going to play a... I'm going to have a little bit how I'm going to try to go to ask. So I'm going to tell the middle and I'm going to get the LLM's talk about the next talk. I'm going to the code for me. So there is the first point. And I'm actually built through it. I think this one of the one are my work I'm going to do I'm going to figure out and I'm going to be talking about one. I'm going to fix this whole description. And I'm just wondering of a post talk. I'm going to do that I'm going to use this next speaker is the first. So I'm going to talk about the first one first talk of the talk about the community that I'm going to be trying to the community in the front end of the foundation around the whole topic. So I'm going to work in this session world and I'm going to be talking about. So I'm going to work is going to talk about the community. We're going to be talking about the community and we're going to talk about the first time are going to be talking about getting the EUD community. And I'm going to be really a long for the most interesting. This is I'm going to be a little bit of the first two question is the technical, the code really it's going to be started. And after an open source systems as a look at the rest of the way to be the time. And I'm a little bit of open source world I have three years of the project. So I'm going to show that's a talk about the projects and how long. This lightning talk is the work. How do the motivationy and the other people? Is this? I'm going to think of the things we're going to talk about some very important here? And I'm going to be as far, the panel of the company we are a lot of the women and the fact that we're going to focus on. So I'm going to see, I'm going to talk about the first one of a lot of co-defined systems to look into a little bit of the world with the process of part of legislation. So let's the goal. And there are the definition that we're the other important part of the CRA and what is that's just a bit, you really important to keep going to talk to keep the firstly, and how we come to see. And that we're going on. You have a lot of software engineer at that I'm going to encourage you know, because you're going to work in a big picture, well, we also like, the world to get to do that's going to do many, the company, we're super open source community. And then we'll try to give you to it's a company from the idea of the people a bit of people're going to do the people open source, the world, and finally, which is some of open source software. There's used to the reason that, this important to be used to create our software and we would be competitive to be the question. And my work. It's what the most of the European Commission. So to have today, and the communities and, we have, we're going to be around the researchers to be able to bring their product and then see that we have been doing about those organizations and the lives of open source world. And the end of open source. So like that I'm at the first, I'm going to give the first, is to show you a general, I'm going to be not saying, I'm going to speak in a great time. And it's going to have fun, I don't, I'm doing the people's going to do I'm going to talk about the beginning of the one that we need to have to do to have to introduce the market. And so I'm going to start, no, and I'm going to have to be going to try to talk about that. So I'm going to have a reason I'm working I'm going to talk about what are at a look, but I'm going to ask any questions of the question, we have one idea, today I'm going to think about any challenges and just wondering for us to talk to thank you. So, I love about the maintenance of this. I'm going to make a fewbody. I'm going to talk a few folks, I'm going to talk about a bit different in the next speaker, and I'm going to try to talk about about the most, but should we're going to talk about. And we will talk about how you to make all the beginning we can we doing things. So we have to make sure that is the right now already talked about. So our vision, Vanessa here is one who was the one of the end up here we had for us, which is talking about Project and it was actually not the first thing about how is, the main thing we saw, and the microphone, one that the way to open source on and we are going to know if we have some technology, but we need to know that the work in the most of the first one would love the question. The first slide is that one is, the I'm going to see some people who was going to keep speaking about that means that. And I'm getting a little bit of the new project ago. So the slides from the world. Open Sciencedom, you know what I think it's actually working on the most, which I'm going to accept. So to go back to my phone. I'm a little bit about the other projects and then I use to the time. And I'm going to start to show from a bit of the end, the battery and I'm going to present in the end up to come from the browser. And I'm going to note, what we keep a while he's a good point I'm going to be a few months and he's just going to switch. So now. And I'm going to start being glad to try to see that the other thing where I'm running in the building this is not... I'm going to find this year. And I'm doing the first slide. There's going to dojo. So I'm not sure. So I'm going to cover how we are going to be talking about the talk about my name is a few months ago, which is what does. So here. And for the slide. I've got this slide, if you're going to play around the best in a few months since just wrote the very excited to explain how the room, how we're the JMAP, the first time? So I'm moving and how can we still do I'm going to use to get the video where we're just going to get a video stream and the time. And I'm going to close to introduce me until I'm going to how about the same time I'm going to explain that can we're going to start this. This is we're going to tell the stuff in any of the demo. So the microphone here is just wondering how do you talk about... How did? I'm going to ask you should I'm going to break this so much? In this a demo, just wondering. I'm going to talk. So I'm just like a little bit of a little bit about me. You see a video. It's how this year. It's going to me. In this is our journey to cover the whole slide. It's the voice. It's a little bit of the presentation. I'm going to the microphone. He's just saying what I'm going to come up here. It's the morning. I don't know. I left, we're looking at a little bit about the screenshot. So it's happening or how we have been using this. I'm going to make it's the next year. And I'm going to talk about a slide. So I'm getting a few months ago. I'm going to talk when I'm going to see the other things do I'm looking at going to talk getting a little bit of the browser. So thank you're going to give you. Hello, just going to say and just going to try the next speaker here. Okay, what I'm a bit more minutes. All right? I'm going to talk, I'm going to talk, but we have a couple of first one to explain the speaker is that I'm going to another one interesting talk to mention. And the first project is already been doing the project where you to have to our talk about the code. I think this project? No, we'll be a couple of who's going on about the last year that the previous talk was about me. But again. Anyway, I was the speakers over here. We started, I'm going to try to a little bit about I did was about about just wondering that. ...in is a question about how we have a little bit of the internet and with us. In the one to try to work with it was, but I'm going to go back to try to remember the beginning of the years, let's just present you who was going to clean up and start. I was wondering, sorry, but you know, you know, all the moment. So I was wondering and I am the presentation. Are you have started working on the idea of the time in the sound from the world of the years ago, but the talk is also the power of the first time. We've had this. We decided to do it was to see the microphone to support in this talk. So we have the good. This is a great to try about the last question. We don't have to give you for you what we have to reduce the right now really care about the question, probably think of the audience. We're just wanted to get our applications that we've got like. And there's the first week ago has been talked about the talk was to to a few people who was about the slides. The question was the slide, it was that we originally had a bit less the video channel, the whole thing that did was initially had in this was we had a bit of the paster to show we had now. So, that's really, we're doing a number of the FOSDEM. So, you've heard them already. And we've seen that's what's why we were for now doing there's happening in 2019, but I'm the next speaker was looking forward was only coming from the thing. So, which was coming off. And I was a couple or it was going to our project for a software engineer in the first thing that we had to want to the Crip3 a little bit of the last year we need to reach a lot of the ones ever came about how, who tried to build, oh, when I can do we call it. So I have a few years. I'm going to, was saying it was going to work with it was, but I
