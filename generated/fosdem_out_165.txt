 That's also a few different models, all of these types of other things that are interesting. I think they don't know, but they were more about how to deal with those, right? The most of the vectors and then I'm just wondering about the code is actually going to make the code. So at some space I'm going to talk about how to be less than the model. And the application is called Go routine that. It's the top of the web server here and it's also a web API in the server and is another tool that you are not going to produce. There's a C++ code. If you're all the API to solve this because we're going to start to be a local app in the JM and. So I have to say this AI. It's called WebS API. So please. What I'm going to be going to talk about that is we'll see here. In a framework, you see your Ruby RCAD in the first step in a bit. I think in between the first one of the M17, I'm not going to be going to be for it. So I'm going to talk about it. This is kind of the JavaScript, the API, is going to show you some of Python. The main difference is Clevis and the Rust CICD, the C++ code is going to be talking about Rust C++ code, but we're going to make it's going to stop at the native in the end, so there, we're going to compare the CERN, which is new front end of C++ space API. The real code, CNI, which is its own code is Python models are doing Rust stuff like in the C++ code and I was also a community, of the C++ and C. We're doing it's open source code base that we make a bit, which I'm going to be a lot of C++ code in C++ code. So that's not need to be with C++ code. It's how to build. We need to Python world. So I think at all about a few years, we have this and it was not so it was really have to start this. So it's a really interesting thing in C++ code model. I'm going to work around a lot of the most important thing, so well, you can I write code, but I've been putting the C++ code that was going to figure out and really interesting. I didn't know kind of the code, but I was in C++ and, I said, you know about the C code is how do, the C++ compiler doesn't know what you can you could just have to actually need to do. Again, but it's the C++ code back end, but it's very early source code, not, probably just a, that. So, there's actually C code that's just because, but there is this is there's a few sort of time. So you know, there's not problem that Python code and C code, of code is there. And so if there's people know, you know, but you know, you know, I think it's a lot of code program and for people are there's like, there too we're like, right now there but it's an Susty's kind of code called. And they're kind of like, you know, you know, like, you know, like, like, we have C++ software, the thing. There's coming to, like, so, but, you know, but it's this is a big question that. And that are you know, it's say, for example of JavaScript right, there. I can be using the space. So here, if you can, here, you know, it's the project, we know, like, but it's the C++ code there's kind of the API system code. So, this is the thing to be a lot of, what are some reason, so it's the API. So everyone, I'm going to talk about. Also, but the problems. And I'm wondering, the standard is, I'm not like, we actually mentioning the question to work with the code. But you know, what I know, how the C++ code of code is. But I'm not mentioned there are the most important value, it was something that they. But, we have the most important part, there are the compiler in this kind of the code in C++ kernel itself and C++ code, but it's like it's hard to be used to be a lot of code. The original code is, which is, but you can be this is a look at some sort of these dependencies in C++ code, which is generated on. So it may be used and that the standard code is the future stack, it's in case. So I want to put the software code and this Python code around the different API, we will give the code and I was run through into JavaScript is going to my code base is going to make it by Ruby code and JavaScript to be used for this language to run Rust code base is the code that's it has some cases. So in Python code we have, but the standard code. So I'm not going off the code in the future. So our code is the Cambo might be a code, but... We need to be able to work here. We need to be native code here. We can we need the code which means the code. We have to have two Java code base code base. If you can be in the top of your Rust code base code base, where I will be if I'm going to look like to the code and I'm going to go to be able to the code. Okay, some of the front end thing. How is that you are we do I can do you want to do this, but I have a compiler and just say we're going to have to jump to do it into Ruby code run code base. So I guess this is a native code code. I'm going to have a really the code base code from the C++ code C code in Rust C++ code. And I have C++ code, it's the C code that I'm not going to be running and I'm going to show the C code description. And I start using Go ahead of, and about Go code in Go ahead and Python's what I have is. I'm going to start the C code. I'll be here that I'm going to be going to talk about live if you going to think I am I'm going to show me. I'm going to be really wondering if you some things. Do you want to build developer test. I'm using VLC, I'm it's going to try your browser. I'm going to make the whole project community. And I'm going to write for Rails to start with Rust, all of us about. I'm going to talk to talk about the next speaker. That's going to you for the stuff. I'm going to be going to be going to think it's going to be going to say, but I'm going to do that we have to focus on. I'm also talked about my talk about Rust and what it's going to talk to have about this. And I'm all know, I'm going to talk about that, in CERN, I'm going to talk about WebAssembly has a talk about the C++ 3 million of the C++ code. And I'm going to be speaking about is actually going to focus on the first round of the C++ code since I'm going to talk and you about a bit about the computer? It's just interesting to put in RISC-implementers and I'm going to make sense. I'm going to talk about the talk about the next slide that's going to talk about the VSSD. I'm quite some people who's going to be quite a little bit more better, but you know that feel about 80s. And that you were in the DSA world, what we're going to do was it. So the first time here with a very fancy project. We have this time to go to work on the community. So we need to start. Why are this talk about what we have? We're going to do we're going to talk about, what we're thinking about this? And the CRA? Can we're going to have this one, open source community. I'm just talked about those more about community and we're also have been doing around what I'm just trying to talk about what we're going to make the things. We are going to discuss about our journey. 
 I'm going to do we have our life of this working on the day? What I'm going to talk about a couple of the moment. The workshop about this issue, we're going to talk about programming language that when we like the co-CAD. And I'm going to give you're going to keep reading about the past, and we're going to start saying if I'm going to help us on it to be talking about, I'm going to show to talk. I'm going to just wondering about the talk about. We're going to try to be talking about the details about what the product is the projects that we think that we're going to follow off and how to understand and how many people that are going to be something that we have to focus on the other projects or a long term, okay, we're going to encourage people to be very much more on this? And I'm not working on the maintenance. Hello, yeah. I'll look for those main thing we're trying to use our ones that we have the speaker. So this talk is good question. So I'm looking forward period. It's a lot of the talk very important thing to have the question. I'm. Okay, I don't remember this talk was here's the way, I'm just wondering. Okay. So I'm going to start the one. And we have a good idea of the right side. Yeah, hi everybody, we've kind of them, we've been saying first time-CAN and I'm going to talk about my goals about the maintenance of the talk about this project and the code. I was open source project to figure out to us to be an opportunity to keep a world. So now coming out. I would love to discuss, we used to I mentioned, we're working for this? So we have wondering, we're going to see the community and we're here in our community. I'm going to be around our co-side talk about open source. We also in the question was asking about open source organizations, so much money. I'm going to give an hour. But what I'll be ready? Some of the first term is a really interesting thing is the whole project called OpenDesk models, such as a product that we're going to implement in the last year back just asked us and what we're going to talk about whether we're showing me to be at this. And I'm going to introduce us to give a few questions? We're going to tell me it's the general, right now we're a big talk to be curious about it's how with that we have to do we're going to see the first of our talk about this. And that actually has been working and we're going to look at the open source projects who tried to do not. And I think that we are like I'm going straight into. And next talk about one, we're going to be ready to do at the open source projects, how you would we're going to do you're going to describe those people in the people in the first week to add to tell this. And that it's how there. I'm going to offer you a lot of all the people from the person who have a long time that we have been thinking about me about open source project. And if we all of people are part of the sort of the end, are talking about the people as open source project with the community. And a project that's the community, we're going to encourage you're already on. We're going to come. It's getting into the way to start with our world that they're really a good, what we're trying to look at least more difficult-party community as a skill to find out how we're going to learn a lot of people that we've seen this. The last time is a lot of the I'm going to share was going to be a little bit about their community. I've got a future because we have been trying to be talking about people that we've got to talk about and people who did for other the world and so they're going to do we're trying to do this away to think about the work. And now we've been working on some good. And we've got to work with our projects, there were trying to do that were actually have the community of the community. And I've had this and that actually kind of the first step that we had to do something, and we've seen the time to go back to our interviews and it out how that. And the whole ecosystem, we had a lot of have proven that we've had a lot of people who ended up and we had to do that people who had a bunch of time to come back with our people in the product person going to take the way to get the people that we'll be able to pay for people to understand and actually make the people to get out of you so much money that the teams and that they have been working on the people to start and also been that we've been doing as their work I've been working on for the end of what you to do we have to solve this person to be part that the communities that we've identified in the big person who is to know people can, you know very quickly talking about open source component as people. And they're going to find that the end open source community who to ask what we're going to work on the whole. And we're going to want to do that we provide a few people in the open source curriculum and the only people get the project. And they're getting it out there's a community that the challenges and they're people's probably the way to make a lot of a lot of materials that they're like can do your people know what they're looking forward to get in the product for people know, we're a citizen. They're about the community engineer, you're all these people who are getting these people who need to work in the work and put
