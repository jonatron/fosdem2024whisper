 Yeah, I'm seeing on. So everybody for my session. Thank you. Thanks. And everyone. So, thank you. Hello, I am the next talk about the room by this talk, the world, we am the room. Thank we from the first time to start working on github. Hi we needed to talk in a talk at home stuff here. 
 Welcome, welcome everyone. Hello. I have to about the microphone for our panel. So we have Hi everyone. My name is about the first we talk is an Astro. We tested in the room. I'm a JSC. And thank you very much for me at the first time. I'm wondering up. I'm happy to talk about it. So I am we have time to be a few examples of you the speakers. Have you very popular engineer at the EuropeanOSSTEM, we are coming to talk about in the dev room. And I managed to start doing our home. So and I'm going to Brussels, the University of the MD Strategy-D. Okay, let's going to start to talk and thank you a little bit of Europe. Also. Okay. I'm mistaken, I'm wondering about 40%. And so we're going to talk about the last talk about doing the EU folks. So I'm going to a minute. We have our panel, in the next question was about this morning today, is the future. We are getting some questions. We're talking about our institutions for the moment. Data Commons. Any questions, we still have their time, we go to talk about the slides, but that's the previous talk today we can we have some next speaker there. And we can we have learned about the first speaker we can talk about it? We have the morning to have the people who are the talk about the European Commission at our IT is the year ago. If we did a little bit of all the Netherlands, I wanted to talk. I actually talking about the last year, we also for very talking about the first year, I think which was about this talk, but I ended up 100 years of the CEO of the best thing that we had to talk. And I was kind of the first let's a few years ago, sorry, we had to go and I'm going to the European Commission in France. So I'm wondering. And I did we started our work with our presentation. And this case we have a last year ago. So for the last year I'm going to talk about the European Commission, we've got to be asked a year at the European Commission and we had to know this year. Also. And I think we have been working on the open source engineer since the last year at the first year, now I think the year, Mike started playing in 2021 until the past year. I didn't think this year. So that point of the year were in the stage and that we were around in this slide, she got released an open source project we were integrating an open source project. And we had to ship a day three years, that's a years ago. Every year we had a long time and this year, a second way that I was useful people in Italy since we thought, I got been doing this year to be a bit more recent year, I think I've was not excited about it's a look at some time. I work, I was making a lot of you know the last year ago we've been at the last step and we had been announced the years ago, and we had to look a few year for the last year but I've been out in 2019, and I do this year, we had a lot of the world I invented it was just tried to plug into the year, and now not a lot of years ago. And we've been doing so we had a lot of year. We also, I just went at the staff, so we had a lot of people and we found out of people we have had in then did the community. And long time we had a little bit of time we talked about each year ago, we'd like we created it, but Andrew a few folks and I'm full time we have a day of the camera in the most of the market, we had over to talk was able to the community engineer at 2023, but that and I thought about the years ago that you said there was wondering about the community that we had the community and so we've got a lot of the community and we were open source company talking about it was just a very happy with the digital 3, as well, and it was actually it. So I was the big thing and in the big tech and they were going to be the last year was happening in 2020 at the company, oh, I got a little bit of the law there's what was a good thing and was that's the panel. Because I haven't know what we have that I think the previous talk was doing is that was to do is actually been a lot of time to come from the last year. It's a copyright of me. And if I said, I was not have been wondering, we're, they thought I was a good time to live at that working in a lot of a lot of fun to have, well, but it, yeah, it's not really a perfect they did have a, but in the second year. We was saying, I haven't know the internet of the things. I was really think that was actually the GPL. So first of the next step of the case, but I've got to tell me, the idea and I'd like, like to that was before we were, we want to build, okay, like, I think, but I'm all the beginning, yeah, we've discovered a couple of the community and I don't know, I mean, just worked in the software engineer at least, like a little bit of people. And then I haven't have a little bit of a few years ago, and I knew that after 2023, the open source software projects were usually told me. So I was because I was going to do I said that was going to show me about, I'm just wondering, so I think, yeah, I'm just going to try to be a little bit about it was, okay, but these, I was great and I said, but I was just wondering, I was about the first time and I was to'm just wondering, but I'm going to see, I'm going to talk, but I'm just wondering, but the talk about what I'm going to talk about the question I'm going to talk about doing here. A few questions at the open,
