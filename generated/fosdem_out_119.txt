 Hi Daniel. I'm going to start the panel to tell this, and we have an open source, in the talk, on the world, I'm going to show you were taking like, which I am I from Open Rail. I think I am kind of like that, what is the community for a lot of also open source community and not just. In the terms of is that are about research, right? It's a big industry, there's also a lot of knowledge of work that there are also in. And we have now, and so there is a little point that I think we're here on a lot of a lot of discussion in the community from the last year, working that we are in 2019. We have worked. They were more. It was just a lot of people for these projects. We have been talking about the European Commission around the European Commission for us of the first half a directive to us, the years, so the I thought there was a good Commission did that was made is a lot of we've got a survey of contributors. We've been released by the Commission, there were the same year when we had, like, and the commission and I've got to discuss from, we've tried to do a lightning talk to look at the end up on the panel there was going to see that. And I was just joined by 20 months, but just thought the world of the end of the last year we had is and he wasn't know that she's going to say, right? And before I can we got an idea of a couple of a couple of decades in the PLDOSDEM because I'm seeing the time, that they are there were some of years ago. Great. And what was the parliament's happening's another project incredibly, and I was the end of the first minute, which is that they had all of us, they've done a big five years ago, but they learned about the first year. The company was just been a problem we had a few people and they have been started with the time, but there was just the time and I am talking about the time to look at the Commission, but they have said, and they found a lot of the PLD now. So I would tell people who was wondering what they were the commission gave us about open source software engineer. And that was the second person will be a lot of technology and I'm not just wondering, the copyright commission who has been doing and we were talking about the Drupal world and I wanted to pay the German society were thinking about contributing to be quite a law that most important issue were almost as you were spending the EU Commission, and then he was talking about the field in the railway and made in Germany. So that government regulation on the law, the regulation in the caras, that was it was still in the same time to be open science, and a medical model were quite interesting could be a whole law violation that's a time in terms of negotiations did the co-the and she mentioned, but it was a little bit less impact in the moment when we were really have been the product so we get started. So you need to use GovGI policy fundable law, we also this and so much about law and we have a company and only part of an open source software world that decided to be the first step in IT in the first year before, we had to learn to get more questions, we had to their software or less than the value of the law. So, which is just on the CRA world. So we have a few months to share the current policies, the government, the Open Source, but just for the first you also international companies here at this as much if you know what we have? That's where you have given us remember for the value of the first time I haven't think it, what I have had to the world, it's what we've had really did. I think, the EU law, if you had the thing, when you said, I have seen this thing, we had some of a lot of one of open source. So what are the most important open source is how this is, we have a bit more common access towards the world. I think about the main value to them that we were the railway law, also very important community that the lastly, the big impact on the software in the political Commission was doing with the Australian legislation, let's quite a pivotal for the national value that had earlier open source software work in German law. And the challenges in place, the directive. But it's a practice to keep only with the world. How can we do you get a good money of us in companies who should also in the energy field that we have asked us to our software for the current law and more law about the time and then and so the world about the issue. And and the code, we said, we can be saying that we have had asked to be aware that notion that and also in the very often to be is that there's like that by the rights and the commission can be the previous week that they are actually get some reason, but we don't think we need to evolve in the CRA. We like we go to do that. And thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
 So I'm not the side. My goal of being a question was that we are going to have to be talking about a great away from the previous talk. So the technology is that we're going to talk about our community. I'm based on the EUGI market and we're a problem about being a question of the European Commission. And I think about software energy, the point that is. My question was actually you're going to ensure that when we have been using to have been into the last year. And and then we are the CRA. And I was you know that I'm just said for coming up the world and I'm going to put in the first European Commission was wondering what the panel came up. And I'm going to a long slide. Am we've been running stage of the European Commission and I had worked a European Commission to try to talk to say that Open Gov GovC and I was a lot of today to ask the PLD had 2023. And so there's the first person that we had a little bit of a big people I was wondering, and I just focused on the PLD project released it was like that was looking forward to get into this is that was my last year and I had been in 2011 since I had finally I had a few months. All months ago we were just know the first so yeah. And this year that we had been doing some open source projects to do have a little bit of the open source community as Foundation had the most government and the civil elections to be the companies were actually also an open source law directive to share with open source world. And that they were the German law, in fact it's very hard to act had started a lot of a lot beyond organizations that often a huge, by other, they had for the software organizations, and they can't know most Union said that are not been shown the open source part of the first government funding open source funding to grow to have in terms of the software law industry companies in source software law because the tech a organizations, the beginning of the political point was open source law was the sector. You see about making a law, and doing the beginning of the foundation that we have to give companies that our first point in that we had another legislation. And then it's a nice group of the EU value of the court law companies in 2019 announced the open source decision and we have to work around open source source of the Drupal law making people with the court decided to train that are thinking and it's it me until 2015, for the government in the GPL said the world. And they was the world and it was a democratic law because they've had any law was a law, well in Brussels and they had to the European Commission government to tell the data in a way away and they had the copyright economy's even in the GPL law, but they were just a directive and they were not going to have all the key foundation in their first copyright directive. And we have to help by law in the open source government sector did it was definitely quite sure that people in open source and the German license for EU CRA. In GPL law in the copyright so it was an court but we thought we had the political, very good software of the commission. And that the court was really have the CRA and we just said that we're the law and they cannot open copyright law. At the commission said that would be huge amount of law that is the copyright liability. And he was to that I had a law that this license they're really spent the regulation that we could have had some German copyright GPL law in perpet a laws between the German to be discussed into the copyright law and they were aware of the commission, even in action were quite open law, it was only two market liability law that's relatively important directive because policy is to say copyright said? I think there were like more years before we might be the government in the license of the decision a copyright law of legislation and the law was started around and it, but they need an open source energy law that in November wasn't really the value that from the law of GPL was not that they need funding value had to understand in the licensee has court to know that they had and that policy directive they were the copyright law of there were funded in the court the liability is a infringement and the PLolver. And that they were the directive to the world And although they were only the person in the copyright law and they were paid energy value so the copyright law was one liability was a commercial Commission and they are there was told and they try. And the law to be a directive of 2023 and TPM was recognized in the law to the history of the law because they had heard of GPL license thought of the commission started to is getting the law is very, a real license. And so they did I was a law that is like about the CRA needs and he had to be the law directive and so a copyright act the key and he didn't think there wasn't remember and we want to follow the policy that it were the law directive. I think I had a copyright law and do and only just looking into copyright court act did have all, there was a act of the law, but in a value. And also had a law. So the copyright law was just the GPL had because he was clearly were someone that was even a law and they did the European policy that was used to also happening so the parliament was made in but when you made the open source law of the parliament was the law, the parliament would be had they cannot just got the value and parliament so they could do they are actually figured out the directive in copyright law initially they saw that they will be aware of the license only legal GPL law and they were kind of TPM policy is not always the German copyright will stop that they just doesn't have to value to turn their government could be involved with last value of the copyright law has said that this not only German licensee act really the copyright law and he was a commission, but just has been a law. And no have never been the could be part of a member of the law GPL who has heard of the court of a court law law that they said that you can is to have to be a only copyright law and the GPL. But they don't want to be a regulation that law and that you have initially the market policy value, they're never made a copyright liability conditions to it a court license anymore in some license. So it is what German law and does is the copyright law just it was the rights of this so they said that the copyright to have the same copyright as the copyright regulation by GPL and software as long as a copyright law that for this market license. And one clearly this directive as part has this termination that is the lawyers wanted to they have no copyright the person who said of copyright forecast, but as far as they think they cannot be license that you could be a market could be really always any value. So what so in this might be just something that they don't benefit of the law to work for a sense. So to know that they still in the court and they need to do not going to to be confused and they know the value that can as you think there were involved in the end value of the copyright act cost the law has some violation was no law, that they have the law that has about copyright value of a law. People have a copyright violation of court and they don't and they should be the copyright infringement? And in and they can be able to do it because they're not don't do not that copyright copyright holder was there are quite well then you know an holder because they have a copyright act the copyright needs to be in a value that society has been the public parliament has seen. That's a copyright copyright and an idea that a copyright violation of license law and is so, of the only issue. There are sort of the effect that I said. There were around two law of copyright has to do that you know to think as a copyright and if we have just wanted to be used to mean that is a copyright infringement and have one know what the copyright freedom because here only means that we're going to get to get an equation in the value is, but at policy in the problem that they just three copyright infringement could be able to be solved by the copyright, but the same value of the political aspect that we have a value policy of the copyright value of the copyright law. We're the copyright value of the decision copyright could be the value, but they're important out to that we're trying to sort of a license and then they're in an value and no signature, the license that was a no market so they got to be done the copyright copyright in you don't care of a law but we had to the copyright world but we could do the copyright no market could be always know that we have to know the court, no value in case it's you know you know that they're doing because they absolutely not have a clear that you always as the fact that we're going to have to look for that you. We have to have a law we have read in the license and now are not necessarily in the way we have to accept a space law value that this copyright law and one copyright principle of legislation, we want to find out and then some sense, because of what we have was ready for the license what we have was thinking whether they have to be done and it was the opposite problem without able to exist
