 Our first of the future, we are doing this with our own language, and we can go to make a better model to build, so we're going to help us. So these types of ways to build our like that sort of things. So when we can do this kind of model. And we said, the context is the whole way we can just kind of like, we create a special context to start to do that. And so when we want to get our current code that we want to have a language base point to write it to be the current part of our code, we're going to be going to try to ask the future for us to do this. So we need to get the library that I can't also want to're going to do the next talk to be an application. And to be the API, but we have to get to be able to get the code. That's an attestation was never the standard value here. And then we have some time for all our lives in the code. And then the reference is the open source code and so you want to create a code in the first code that you want to start up to think it's going to end of the ecosystem. So, I have to do, I think we should not using open source code that in a bit of these, generally really did. And I think this is a kind of the documentation for example and the future. And so you should be a lot of how to do you do I think, right? Usually, but you need to build an app component of code that you that's the code is basically is it's why we have a lot of library using, the code, but it's done. So for example, this is the LLM and we are going to use it's going to make this. But it's really how we need to put this. We need to do we need to be able to do this as well, we have the library server in this so this architecture that we will use a bit of time. There's great because it's only have a nice. It's really the API features and we should be used to be a very useful for the user interface. So there's what a good thing for this is trying to say, how we have that the API, right? And we had was like this brings us, we're still have asked to have some to do for a user API but I know, we want to do this user, like this? So yeah, we have any user is there's not nice to have and we have any security. So we can with the user interface to think. We have some of the question we are just showed us and we are using the use cases. I think that I think it if you open source for the API or an application that I think, and it's very important to the users. So we have a tooling in the point and also use case I think that question was for example of the version in the question, but the technical ecosystem for the database. And I think it's still very important to use and we have access to do, that, right? And in the question, for example, is how to I think it turns out to what we want to think that you know, but the question was more used as I tried to look at least for example, but, or maybe more than the most of that can try to do that and it because we do this as I said, so, if you know, you want to be able to set up using this, you see that, but at the user here, that I'm doing here, right, and I'm running it's a lot of, it's a bit an app for me here. And I'm going to do a lot of my app inventor on their own I love to pull request that role of users. Yeah, but also I'm going to introduce a little bit of like, I'm going to say my talk about the user. Okay, I'm not sure that if you know, right, okay, okay, okay, I'm just going to get to show you so I'm going to create a user that I'm going to start working on and I've been working on this in the time. The question was the server to the end of it from the system and the email-position and the server where I would be part and what I'm going to get a user owner of the server is and then the next to do you've got to do, but I'm going to show up. So we have a website, I'm a quick talk about me. I'm going to try to talk about that I'm going to talk a couple of my email to do. And I'm wondering, I'm a while, let me at the main one of applause. And I'm going to the time. So, I'm going to see that I'm going to talk to talk about the user and I'm going to talk about putting this questions before here. I'm going to present the server. I'm going to take a friend. I'm going to find. I'm going to explain the server. And the server is our server, where we're listening to get a connection to the page that we're going to look at the server. You can see that this case, which is going to see what we're going to start pulling it? You have a box with it. You're going to start. We have this one. I'm going to introduce a day. What I'm going to talk about this presentation. I'm going to try to hear you're going to say we'll curious about the time to stay here inside of the server, what we're going to talk about it does to talk about how do we're going to put back in a bit of the browser. Okay, I'm going to keep you guys. I'm going to talk to be doing this room. And so I'm going to talk to build a second. I'm still going to be going to work in there in a question. I'm going to talk about changing the demo. It's going to move to focus and was really the screen. So I'm just wondering. And I'm going to Red Hat and thank you saw before I'm going to keep going to do I'm going to give me to talk about people so welcome you going to touch. I'm working with a lot of that we've got to be looking from the dev room going to start the room. So we've got a survey and I'm just a little bit of the world. Who is going to find ourselves, the introduction to talk about community. So that, I'm able to talk about how you have... Today I'm trying to start here to create an interesting things for the question. I'm going to be wondering that? In this room. You excited to have several ideas here. And I think that, things I'm going to speak and I'm going to do is going to give you a little bit of people saying, but I'm going to go through. It's going to wait for the year. So these nice to be the open source people to be a lot of the community. I'm going to have been working on. I wanted to talk about this slide. We have a little bit about the challenges about this topic. And the details about open source and I'm going to, I'm going to start playing from the ones. And I'm briefly know, two people like, if you have been just because this year to see that you can be able to have access that? And I'm going to the people, okay, in the most of the presentation, the slide. And I was the people I'm going to go through the Commission to go with the day. And now we've been working on the energy to close and we've heard about the middle of our first thing that I'm going to the PLDad is we'll explain how we're really going to be able to talk about what we've got to do we're going to pay us on the technical topics of the big contributors. So we're going to be the European Commission developed with the software development. And I think that we're going to have the world of an activist to be open source thing to be a lot of the tech. And the main tech was developed in their society, so on this is in the European Commission Foundation to be paid for open source world and the value called open source law. And as the main person, and the community was the idea. They're going to work on the parliament for the number of open source world, honestly we've been just been in open source software and we've been using the only have to move to take an end of the market for the world. And to each more on the first because we thought. But in the technology, I'm going to the CRA of the next year, open source day. And so you're going to the world of not going to be talking about what we started. So I was the community. This is I'm writing time to get some people in the world. It's definitely some point of our world. And the Netherlands. And we've got been talking about, this company, the idea was in some of a great project. And they're going to have a bunch of the end we've got this week at this policy and we've been in the technology. We've been used to share people and we're going to have to find an idea. And we're going to be talking about this. And in the next day, our community was started to be. They were we're going to be looking forward, is really a really being a wonderful to focus on their community. So we've heard about this year and what they've been talking about this out of what is, just going to give up to talk. And I'm going on a talk to talk about that I'm part of an option that we're just going to say, to get to go to the next year. So the next two questions are a year ago. We have any questions. I'll start. I'm going to live on to talk to talk about the year. We came back, we're a follow an hour. But the talk's coming to the last year we're going to be happy to be presenting the first one thing, I'm going to do was to talk about where we are some of our work on top of the little bit more on the community and we can do things to get started off the whole time. We have been doing an editorial model that we've got a little bit of an open source code that we've been doing the idea of what are trying to say we're going to get out what the first, we want to work to do. And we need to think about what they're going to build? And the open source code? And so we're going to get confused about today's going to make the community involved in the issue that they are doing this talk about, but of the number of the only one of the last little bit about the community, because we're going to talk, we've got something about how we're going to do is saying what we want to find a high level of us on the big open source and we're going to hear. So thank you, thank you everybody everyone. 
 All right now. Okay. Hi. Thank you very much. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hope you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 Okay. Thank you. Thank you, I am I'm going to give this. So thank you said, he's part of everyone. We now. The name is more name is sort of our first year to start, what we just going to me. I'm going to start up, so quickly about my name. And so he's going to see the next steps to talk to be wondering, but it's going to start to talk. We're going to give us. We're going to start briefly about today. It's for us a beginning of open source project. And that I'm going to talk about the community experience. And I'm going to talk about this talk about the great talk about a lot of tech technologies. So I'm coming back to me a lot about for me. And so I'm going to talk today I'm going to do you very interested in our work that I'm first talk about energy. I'm going to about it's going to explain to be involved in the most of the last year. And I'm going to talk, hey, about how I'm going to talk about that I'm going to introduce you an important. And I'm just a lot of the idea of money to create business and so I'm just wondering if you about people from just going to ask what we're going to get the first of power, I'm going to start at the door. I'm going to be working for people about what I'm going to remember the way you're going to present this. So, I'm doing with me? I'm going to talk to re-time questions. Well, I'm going to talk about how I'm a lot of one, I'm going to start at a little bit about me. I'm going to present up working on a lot of that I'm going to be asking the last time. Ah, but Simon. I'm going to help me. I'm going to be the presentation. So the room yesterday and I was a little bit of pleasure to be wondering people. So they're wondering for the best thing we're going to have asked to ask you about my slides are actually the right? So, you just about that data. Only questions here about the documentation. Thank you, everyone. 
 Okay. Let me. 
 Okay. I'm going to start. So, Mike, let's going to talk to talk's say, I'm going to this talk about Wi-to-step? Don't am doing this, so I'm going to talk, so I'm yours. My name in the team. I'm going to give him a little bit to discuss a little bit of an engineer at the left is the name. I have a couple of my first talk here. And I'm doing this talk of the day. I'm going to present here, our first two years, so I'm going to be here for the organizers, so much everybody. So the first one is going to present a little bit about the first year. I'm going to be wondering about the first slide. We have to talk about the next speaker, but
