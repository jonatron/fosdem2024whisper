 Okay. Okay. The rest of the first talk was to my first example, we also hit add the main idea to get a little bit what I want to discuss with that. So if we're going to call to talk a phone, we see that I'm going to get a bit later. So, this is kind of a post about the power power. This is the more interesting, this I'm running. I can take what we are going to introduce here. I'm going to remember a little bit about the slides and later. So this is what I'm going to get over. Okay, so many people, so I'm just going to talk about the talk, so I'm going to show me about this. One of the time I'm going to stop I'm going to talk about this.

 Hello. Thank you very much. I'm going to be speaking, I'm hoping that, I'm going to talk, so, everyone. So, thanks to talk, so very happy to your speaker's going to talk about a little bit about our CEO. So the presentation. Thank you guys, the microphone of the talk a day, from the presentation. So I'm going to present two months, two years ago. I'm going to my presentation. I'm going to go to talk about the 3DS. CLC here. So I'm going to talk about this year from going to introduce you so I'm working on and I'm going to present up doing, now. Please introduce our name a world. And so it's very popular software engineer on software engineering projects and I'm going to talk about the European federal state, we're, we're going to help us and just about the PLD is getting a story. But I'm sure that I'm like just welcome. And now it's going to talk about the whole year. Let's going to WebV Foundation, the European Commission. And one of the first of the current policy. But we are we're, on the data is our society was public grid. And we have the end to be a project for a public public sector. That's what we're going to talk about the technology from the rest of the beginning of the EU that they were also talked about talking about this year, which is yours. So we are all about having to our technology, my technology. So if you're talking about that I don't quite a lot of the EU world. And one years ago, I'm going to give you very excited to talk about what I'm based on. So it's great-time project and we have been talking about sustainability that. So we need to talk about open society, I don't want to what we're trying to tell another question about how we are seeing the details of the EU institutions and the first time was very often talking about those scientific things in a gap between doing that we have we're interested in this, because we're trying to be very important in our users. So it's the thing we also like open source projects that's how many European Commission came from the EU institutions. So it's the first years ago. That is that's the Commission, is the world of a moment we did we are. So, these are going to talk about the open source world. So we were going to see what we really important to talk about the software. And since the market. So we see. And then we are now have to talk about the infrastructure. We have already invited the satellite. We have done the moment for the European Commission staff. We've ever saw our world. We had a point since so in Europe we have a few months to throw into a thousand engineers that we have had we're we've got their open source software in there and they also another day and we've been working with Mozilla ecosystem and I'm the end of the EU organizations are a big society and the funding and finally have been in France, we kind of the co-source community group that we've used to stop that the developers were the European Commission in June, we found in the world to continue to try to get the first time and we are also know. So we also the Commission and we have, what we're going to talk about the European Commission open technology and in 2016 when you know who are going to be in a really trying to avoid this in the CRA, and our focus on the idea, German countries. They have a lot of the technology company. And there were also a number of communities that the fact that we're to be in our lives. And of projects, there's the first time and the world of the co-one, the software engineer and the United States to this foundation and the Swiss society was the government organizations. And they think about what we were, we had a good law as a discussion for the European Commission have was just two years, and they had to get a European world, but they have to solve the open source and the organization in 2023, but they were a lot of 2020 and they can't have a lot of efforts then you can't get the panel they're able to see in our mission of time and even worse than the Drupal and had to take a lot of the world to be competitive towards a huge value that people and we changed the commission that have more European Commission and they had also not for each year. So this the one-to-out and I was the European Commission and and a lot of the directive and as young software on the big point of free society in US and just will be an open standards. And so we have a big community so you know the European Commission in the second country because the European Commission had a lot of the foundation to be made in London of legislation as not only the product. And a railway institutions are in a lot of revenue and Europe and so I think there are in the GPL law organizations that in Germany and they were no, but we had an end directive of the law to be able to the US terms of free world and were first activity in a good Commission. And the year, there were one Association of the last year of the market revenue we had the EU government law and the court of the second elections in the national world last I was a year. And so they had five years, more but they had this point that was going to achieve the CRA in the only one day of the EU to have in many reasons ago as a few stories of the current, I am also released since 2019 and what have had one of civil society and I started with funding and the directive was just answered to be able to be engaged in here about the PLD Association and then the technology called law. And then started to be done with the EU and I said, the first law in the court law. And I'm actually said two copyright institutions are around that are that were very proud of COVID and moved to forecast that happened in the tech, the economy. It was a license law of OpenGI society for the CRA foundation work in law that law that was an open source law with more civil law by the product. Maybe I'm going to legislation since I could not just to get rid of a law. So I'm going to be a pivotal idea that you haven't have time to the copyright and what is actually were a law. And we were the copyright decision engaged in the copyright law. That was to know that we released for five years ago, I was something I think, we've got a law and with the only court of a European Commission and it was still been done only an copyrightkeepers who had, but also heard of this is, mostly a society and it's well-violence of a GPL. I have that we've said that at a piece of 20 years ago in terms of copyright law. And since 2020, all the rights should be a GPL had to rights that they said, or not quite important and having that was really hard for the parliament and they're going on the organizations at thought that policy and a law in open source law law actually has heard of and companies and he kind of a copyright had released was that could be open source law to be able to be in just the law. And I have to put time. So I'm not from the last year last year I've been the fact that it was a long was just the time in the commercial of a law that actually I didn't been kept the cost of the number of the third the value here, they got into an act, but you know that this in the law that the copyright was done was I was originally had, so in the license was kind to just the courts about the copyright law. I said, were had an open source law in the case that was a, so I thought it was that in the end, which was the first person was made because this value of the commission that she had as they had only had had been since it was in German law was to actually very copyright so you don't not have there were a huge. And it had to train the copyright policy, but also had heard about the copyright law actually came out there was a copyright law itself has copyright makers I was the license the law because the directive, the law that he can have no of the commission in the open street, that actually do. They understand the gate said in the court lawas don't know they were aware of their law, but they were actually know the GPL and I said, but they had thought I was a really understood in the license. But they were at the value that was a law. And the commission was I mean I was the only very good thing, they were done then they look at this law, they were only the law perspective, they just wondering when she said, you're done the license needs to actually done this direction of the copyright were really decided to be the copyright in the license a license copyright was the copyright infringement of the US. They was only license and said to be not, everything was not only a liability until just done so still there were quite a gateigets in the law that the risk of law and they were from the license agencies being copyright value in GPL GPL was made GPL as you shouldn't the legislation they had, but I couldn't be in the license and it was intended to the copyright holder? It had quite far that they had, and it was not only the copyright, yeah, and we had the value of course it and a no license and I didn't remember the that just not always before at the question and they were they had any end a court value of that know that they were the law would be a copyright in would be on a copyright clause that I'm just asked people could be able to convince a value of an law and it they were an ad clause well there to take what happened because they had a value of the copyright law did he got the decision value. They didn't think any license is in the license that didn't really like being a copyright was the only. The copyright value of the scope of a license the policies were a matter the same issue of the license is actually didn't seen that in a value itself was the copyright copyright value that and just makes that was not that at the value of the notion that is as law that we have no. So a and there was not a law and they come at the third person and in really, they had is still a copyright act that the copyright in the license as positive value from the license that they did not required to the first value and they didn't just have a gap and the value value from that they always was great part that nobody had has a situation that was there was just just an issue so you had actually made and they did it was a way to be available in. And in the law has heard basically the license that was the GPL law we had the law that every sentence that was that they had all the license decision was absolutely law as well. But we had the AI, in a license as we can no copyright value to make the open source people were supposed to the license, but we could be afraid to be a value of society. And the value to have to be a case if they didn't, you think it comes to be aware of the fact that that they're aware of the nature in the law and they have to send is actually that they know that they know really the value, when you know what they know, they say that they can be the decision in the GPL but they have trained as that they were doing a value of value. They had, maybe we had to know, and they're not necessarily aware that they have spent good place and they would you know it to be a trademark, but they were very bad companies working because they are people, for the world, they would help us to be very soon. And they can't think that they want to start to buy time to work for some money and they're not that they think we're not very quickly in the world for me to really helpful that they have to speak and they aren't care of the risk in the things. They look at least they have a second one. And there are still some agreement that they just a lot of the big point but it's good person as well, but there's not very much at least that they're more important for us want to share because there and so far that will be as a lot of awareness of the people who has been seeing like kind of trust that they have never use and don't really need been trained into a product that because they are a lot of time that they will say is to be a lot of concept of open source software as much easier to be very interesting we've just to be able to have some of experts to do like but they're looking at the long time. Or it may not everybody. It's why you, should not the one in the license a lot of the software that the market coming from the law Act and being the rights in the licensee doesn't make this. And in France is the moment to the moment for the term as well. So the Commission would we're going
