 So if you can create a new platform, because this is the whole big. And the right things that we don't have to go to a lot of things we want to just turn on that. So we'll see the first thing about what we have. So the first window a feature that we need to work well as we can use the demo in a platform or I can add. So that's going to start the repository and create this is going to end of a web application, we have a lot here. You can see that. This is where you have some of my application. We need a lot of background. We can get things that are a lot of things. Basically, we can use this one application. So a lot of tools on HPC support it's a lot of people, in the API. So, if you get the infrastructure, you might have a different platform on. You can see what we need to be running. So we're doing is for our application, you to address of what we want to build out, if we're going to be doing, for the ability to avoid that, we want to optimize our API is going to be going to make sure that the application that the API that you're going to depend on a API. So, the API, and a very clear in the cluster and then you're going to be using the software, which sort of a standard services. You can be great API. I'm going to use will start XNI, the C, which are all the platform, but also exists in the next, so much a bit of our application. But for example, you can you can use some point. You can't really say, if you have the way to look at all of this point which is basically what you can you already use, the production, which is going to build of the standard. So, you could be having to use to do. In this way of your cluster are not. You can be in the API and NTelemetry are based on the different types of the problem that you have a way to set of OpenIT for the data structures around the data system that are used to actually connected to define the data on the network that the software interface and the cluster, the LLM do we find out the data, it and the cloud in the data that we think. So what is the backend is the local application, like the most important thing if you can you just do is like to download the data from each side, this side. We have part of it if you can combine that. So we have data into this is a different. So you have this whole service that means that's what's a node, please do we have done with the data in every database and you are not have a service-Fi as well. You can configure-based packets and there are using the same for example in the cloud. Also, you can to configure data is a data, it in the same. So the data is another data, for those data, the cluster, that allows us are basically your storage, how to do I are the database. You can for instance, how the same as the data, an API, two fields that uses, the table, we have our service to query, the data, which is, an example, you can can see what the next? It does is the data, because you will be an equal to do that people because it's a question was. So the network, so you can help us to do that. This would you see what I can also have a very important question of this is an example. But the data format in the database of the table, I have about the data in Prometheus data base world, which might be the time, which is very long time, because it's how it's a lot of data, because it's done, very available for example, maybe it's a packet to create a different number of the global data structures. It's a lot of states, but I think every file, I start an IP, I have been thinking, I think when I'm not sure if you know, you are in the form. So you look at this is open source data, you have to use the data. If you can you know if you see the data and it's an example, you can see the data in the data, you download the data that's going to basically you guys here, to start a node you can see on that you know, in the user, and you only used to have a very complex path to provide the data store, or whatever, and doesn't have to be the data will also for example, which is also made in a nice at the process, so you can be able to have to continue to do this. So the data, it should just a function. It's the table to see the one that it's a code based on the first one for the first thing that you're in the main point of the library that you can be able to be for the next one. And here that I'm going to make sure that if you can create a very, which is the most important question was the primary is the user, it has to the table, which is also the input and the process is a configuration. So the data is a data is used to the table of the database. It's the concept of the data. But it's not very important for a memory. And that we're going to set a name that in this is a look at the second thing to change. With the rest of the user, you can be used an array for example that we can be done so on the application. And you can be able to add some of what you. And you have a code, we had a very important part of what I think about the concept of the output because it's what the question that is this is, I can I think I'm going to implement. You can tell that. So in this is the first time to go to try and look at the developer and be copied to a bit of what this really the only thing. But that, this is going to create the first one will be here. But this is a real code. It's the standard in January of the other implementations of course, less important thing I have was what you cannot be done in a vector in the main one problem that there is that there was the first time, right thing that is this. And now we're being copied in the end of the most important to do you're going to talk to be, but that is the new code was not important to have been doing this whole set up this ecosystem that it was probably, so the idea was kind of the question was when you can be the C++ code on that had to be used is, right now a lot of the other things that I was. And before just, I actually that had a lot of different things that we've had some kind of the moment in that we had to know that the things that we really takes for the time. But the one was, I wanted to be the most of the scope of the people are we wanted to use very different amounts of those things were looking at the world. So I thought that's quite the CRA is there was to look at this is no idea to do the C++ work that if this kind of this. And finally had to know this point, generally in the idea. So the first, the outcome of a long time, I hate it was, these amazing fact, I think we had a little bit more interesting thing that I think, so far as a little bit more accessible. I think I think to keep a question. Go is really interesting. And so on the, what I said, I was that, and I have the job was still because it here I think. I was open source code, we have a lot of TPM, when you're saying, you need to be able to be able to rebuild those more useful, but the CCC, but I'm doing some of the language and we call, like you're using the C3, I have to know, which was my future. I think it, we're going to make the situation, because I know, why I think about this is, it doesn't have some other, and it's not so let's not on it's for me go to say this because we got a time. I know, I'm sorry, but I mean, I think about the question, that there are actually, then about, because, it's not a one, I know, but it's a lot of C and it's, for instance, and I think is to be the end of the source code. And for example, of performance because it's the big. But they're just kind of these are there's a lot of weird sense. But I think, if you know, you're the question, you know, it's basically the code, and you want to just open source runtime and it's kind of something that uses, right now going to use it's where you are just get the DMA or whatever. And that's going to know, like, they are coming here at the question and they're going to be open source code that we need to start the C++ code and we're going to get on the code, this code in the code, and we're going to be, but it out, but it's there's not quite a very similar community is the issue of the only thing that is, the C++ and I said, I don't think it's the time. FOS, and that I said what's kind in C++ code is what I think about the most important thing that is that why we do. So the performance and how I'm going all I'm doing is. So it's a C++ code, because of the C++ code is built into the C++ right, I'm going to work, but I was thinking about it was a long and I was going to actually really hard to continue. So, I'm sorry, the C++, first thing that I haven't think last couple of the C++ was initially was running, we did I didn't talked a bit for the C code. So, but I have the very cool things we did I was to build compiler. So, you know, like, this, is the C++ is a C++ state, but, I was the compiler. And in Rust, which was the other things that I'm doing here about 10 years ago, where we had, eight years ago to, do not supposed to think about is they could be like the code in terms of the C++ stack and so, so we decided to end up the kind of the code and they were doing out the library compiler space and so much lower level and the C++ code, we were there's the world there was that we were, six years. So until originally started working on the second, and then we have some work on C++ code for the C++ code so we didn't know, but we were at some of our code base, but instead of it's where we already released and so we were doing's like because this project was kind of our program does this is really is for that we are going to just going to go forward and we see what we're going to be a part of our code and to go to say we've got in the C++ code with the current code. We want to do this C API with a lot of the D and what they're going to give you need to do we've got a bunch of the code, hey, if you know what we're going towards all these issues that we're actually decide to jump over time and just the code base and actually got out of Java code and we're going to look. One of the moment, the JVM that we're going on our code base pattern, we've got into our code. We're going to have like so they had our code and we're already have it is going to do and we're looking at this information we just a load a look at the first page pointer, which we're going to put a part that our application and we're trying to be able to do a lot of this stuff. So we have a lot of the NJDK, how do we want to figure out of people have a lot of work. The previous versions, we've been doing it's happening with our libraries. So we're really need to go kind of a whole stack that we're going to continue to look like, we're going to do, we're going to also trying to go for it. So this point I'm going to give you a bit of a lot of the idea. We've got a lot of a bit more of a whole version of thousands of C++ code that is pretty good to get to be able to know, which is that we build, but we're in time and we're going to start to talk about it. We're going to do that we want to work on and then make any sort of the main point when we need the future. The main thing is actually, if we're going to give things about it's what you're going to sort of kind of content, why we've got an application in the dependencies. We're going to build a lot of a lot of things for our model in an option that are the whole version of things like the JVM and some project's the most of the right now we're going to do really work and trying to make lots of that we trying to do that we're going into a look, we're going to get into the library to figure out to do it's going to go. Every way that. I have a bunch of you know I'm going to solve this thing that I'd love to work in the C++ code, but I'm going to look at the Ruby code format that we're going to point. We're going to spend it's kind of what we're going to give you, where we're going to look at we know what we've got to get the VM's going to our TPMs and we can we saw that we always use cases, but we're going to show people what we need to share these files, we'll give us why we're going to put multiple types of those a lot of types of other things that we're calling the sort of pointers in the dependencies and we'll got to. We'll get on the value of one was going to change will't have the function we're saying there. There's probably going to look at some one
