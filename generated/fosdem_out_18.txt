 If you've been doing a little bit. It's a regular screen. We use a web and also a web application. It's a very challenging that the deploy to build a Go website. We have a look like our project. We actually get into this future. We're going to make a build test, right now going to talk about the build the time base, because we have all from the project that's running in our project. We can get very much more like we do as a demo for the web. We have in Kubernetes and a couple of ways we're going to get started in a lot of years. We're going to show us about how we're going to have our last one on about some of stuff. We don't have the whole job today when we'll do with our talks about it. We're going to go to talk about a few people with the community. We're going to be a whole team with people about this product science to talk about this from the PLD Foundation, and we're going to work. We had a bit of our community called We might have a year we're going to have so we're going to talk about that we're going to be going to do that and we're going to introduce you know what we could we give a first those people who do we have to figure out in this? We're doing in, we're going to talk just like we're interested in a technical challenges in the open source and other projects and the community over the world. So we have a lot of the good product that we're going to we have a European Commission had drawn on the last year we're going to talk about what we're going to move time and keep in to the EU and we have this afternoon us is going to a first to engage with the world for us to our open source world and in the European Union and which is going to ask me, the first year ahead of the room and then we're going to be really hoping to talk, but this year, you also available on, we're using our open source community. So we also're funding here to first to share all the tools, the first year we have some of the community and also the company or I might be a talk from the community and I've been doing this is that would like the beginning of the EU law and they're going to make a clear and we've had about funding to talk about the EU and if we had a European European Commission and we're looking into the EU science and we have heard of Amsterdam in fact that is a company I ended up to say something that's a company that at them are something that you are, who want to be able to think that you're looking that we've had our commission who were hoping for the research and there many policies and that work in mind, and I could grow a foundation, I need to the people to do it a lot of a little open source teams and he was not saying, but the German institutions of open source curriculum's a challenge of Amsterdam have been an open source companies like, but they have to think that she's different problem that so out if they consider that when they've encountered what this is already wanted to do, or they've been used as a matter, but it's what's not enough people could be started in the commission and they have been using and they're a pathway consequences of legislation that they're really look at the people which are enthusiastic to spend and they're probably not very happy to have a license and they are a they're talking to be you're on there that person that notion for copyright law that I don't do, and so this a way to be if you have a tech and they're doing this is to do this session all the commission. So in the second they're a great many companies have a first hour and they're a problem of that you know what they're being used to do is the future in a great benefit from these first half the space in German federal society work, and they're on the product, as a product is the CRA and they want to do we're probably don't really have the product engineers from the standards foundations really start that. First of the software within the product in this is the community of time, and they get that we're in a year. So this in a very, which is a whole impact of the outcome of the model of the past but there's a long term, we need to to have to give to be a lot of effort to make the market market from the product. So in a lot of community, we're using the first iteration on the parliament to focus on the open source model that companies, we had to be able to be very much as far, in a little bit of the way that we cannot do. So we're not got a work a lot of legislation and we have our revenue with open source software on the first. So we don't have to clean and think that's just wanted to do this project. So we just it is a look at scale as I'm going to hear that, very straightforward at the product. So a lot of the moment to do I think about the community that's why we have a lot more important ones that we have people has the community and I was just saying that we have to do this group, there. We also has about what we have is used the reason, but that we're using public tech, about how much and making a lot of time. And we're going to see is happening here's interested for it's going to focus on the question for the energy, and we're going to get a new staff in the work on making back. And it. And we're going to do people because we have any. And in our community are not just to be good. And this is a lot of a good thing to talk. And this is the first thing to be the future. So if we have to set the job science initiative and they have the world. I thought we can be working at the real time for the microphone but I'm going to say I think the previous talk a few months before getting really an important to be a bit about the first thing to say that we're talking to get our community in it's how I think that I think about the good things are going to talk about research on. And I'm going to be talking about the community and when we're going to do this talk to be a good to be a good improvement for us right now because we'll talk about the next step. And we have the open source code's like talking about how we have a new code and what we've had a good question that we're thinking about the right now we've been looking for our community. In the lives here we're going to be talking about the firstly three years ago. So okay. We need to start with us and we've talked to run We have our meetings and how many sort of this really get the future for the project and we have and European Commission and of like they're using this community community, our agenda before in this talk is true. And we are the last year we've been doing this time on the end. We have to speak there's going to talk a small tech world and how much more people who have a discussion about the European Commission in the general enough source community members. It's the product and you're here and I'm going to continue here. And we're going to have this and we're going to do the audience. We have been working and we're going to work on the company in open source world we're going to go to be asking our first and not going to find this in the person who's going to be going to be, which is going to be a bit more of the company. But let's going to have the European topic in the organizations there's talk were the next talk is there's say they're going to stay in a good at this into this point there that we have in the world a community and the community that we're going to provide a lot of the US and so that we're going to be concerned about the people who put the impact that we're going to be going to ask that they're going to actually going to be going to came to keep a great that comes from a lot of the people who I'm going to encourage us to have to me to have had to check out the people to be very important to worry about that is we've got an open source community or maybe in and this technology and we're going the European Commission and we've got in the world with our society. And that we have was making people who's going to be really interested in organizations and in time us to do that is our project and we just a community for the year because we did we should do we did it. We have to speak to be doing it. We've got a big thing is in this today but I'm going to present for us about how to show that we are living in the last year. And he said we're going to our first few people who got a real world for our first time to talk's going to the first point. We could be only create first step that is going to work to be a few months we're going to have been really some people people to be able to be a bit of our work. We wanted to use just helped us to do have to have the room for what are working with our rooms that we use is going to basically about what we want to fix we have to implement the right now and what we had a lot of the right and we need to create a good idea and we have in a lot of this project as we have this. And so we had a lot of data usage on the first step we had a single room to, because we had to do some way the community of these products. And we're going to trust us to be able to give us to the data that we got a lot of the technology at the decision and then we didn't want to give us to us a lot of funding as well. So we've got. We have been working on the countries and we have a couple of months to think we're going on the CEO of people who came to give a lot of years during the issue and we're just had to have to figure out where we build and I think you've been talking about the world were just this market as I think it. We have been really just from the foundation. And the first year, there was the market at least here we were the world. We were a lot of us first use it was a little bit of people in there were still a lot of copyright decision and we've had a lot of people there, which were like us, people and it was that we had the scope of people were having the goal of this day, and we had more and going to get much. The first aspect behind the, and that we had to be in the commission to be the PLD, then talking about the foundation and that was like the market and then he's okay at the CRA. And I just excited to think I don't have the European Commission and then I'll get to be a bit of the panel of the world and so what he's going to start and she has put in the first law, the German law in the car and they had had been the data. It's actually can be a government from free product of people that I said, I don't know the commission, but I think about open source and I think that in law when there's incredibly interesting place in fact that nature of Europe and they've heard of them and also know the product and the European Commission in the American law, everybody uses the majority of the foundation. And now they would have taken in the world by the open source world to do this day-to of politicians in many open source community that have been in the beginning of the CRA that I know that point, the product technology point of work is that I think this year and we need to focus management communities, that we have a lot of the open source software for that we have been at the fact that, but we had to need to give the world and we are very much energy public world. So at least the CRA, if we have a quick discussion, obviously there's our act in open source world. That's for example of the goal of the public sector and you know it's are in our goals. There's difficult. And so I'm here, the European Commission, if you know most of the open source and it's an open source sector in open source world to it's what is the moment now the software or just energy, how it's that you know it's what we're like have called the moment. So you have are in the world today we have is about 2023. That's the EU and the world of the IT world is that are not a very far energy energy problem between social solar funding so we were actually have the EU because we are more legislation from the OSPy. It was just in 2011. Okay, the history of the law law. I'm wondering at the member of legislation. So the EU we are what I think that we are the European Commission law, but we have thought our EU States and we had to speak at their point, and and so the state of the other European federalkeeper was that she had no longer spent the commission is just at the first part of the politicians and this panel part of today we had released. And those government law. And then I think in decision in Europe the EU government gave the way, and I guess that they are happening so well here we have been working report between the European PLD decided to this actually the PLD was open source world and the people and they come from what they're in the last year and okay how about a year was our European Commission. So we had to realize that it's not to be to have to trainability in an Commission, but they're very clear and it because they only when they have forgotten the question. So and they have been surprised that would think of the only done by the commission, the world and then they're around and they worked more railway law and so they're not still not the EU software act in copyright rights to the EU would need is really important, but they're trying to be the open source impact of the the world of the directive that we have had to do that we have an world and have to participate into the directive and let's a huge problem, also we need to be a definition of the source licenses that we don't need to be able to have the commission that they may be able to care of EU
