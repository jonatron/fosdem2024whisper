Thank you because we have a half the Fos to introduce the first, and I'm going to the OpenJDK and I here. My name. So today as I'm going to talk about the first round of the presentation. That's talk. I'm very talking about a little bit of you 
 I have a bit about its own web Energy developer. And I'm glad. I am I'll get a year. I am also asked to talk about the first part. What I first talk is my talk to the first one of the next talk of the talk is Kodojo that I'll just to I'm going to the University to be a bit about HGI, which is the 3D Initiative. And I'm also a little bit about today is that I'm going to talk about FEDI. And I'm going to present a pleasure to talk a year. As I'm happy to talk about this presentation, a minute at the first year we've just go to talk about YIF3 to talk about running the European Parliament, which is about this year to about the technology and we have a few countries in terms of the beginning of this year that we have a month and as a small community. We have been talking about a lot of a good project in a lot of the world to have to work for the International OpenJDK, very important one of the year of the Swiss Commission and I told me about this talk about using the CyberH 17 ago I was also open source in German Europe. And this year to speak about the University of our release between the year. And I'm currently in France. And when I've been working in the end and one we'll talk about June 2023, I'm happy about the last year at 6's the open source year on the day at the last year, and I'm a year ago, which is, we'll talk about the year later, which is the European Commission and I also some point in our first and I'm going to talk about the years ago you for the world, so I'm thinking about the main goal of what you today was to talk about the open source software and how open source code is going to actually work and the first one of a very quickly time that I'm just talking about the first time. So we are the world. We are about the community and we are not for free software and this talk about the first half years from the fact that I'm trying to try to speak about the beginning of the University of the world and how to say that we are the years of his experiences and some of the University of the I'm exactly the CRA has a decade. And yeah, Mike is a couple of the first year, I spent years for the biggest focus on the world and the end world? So I also from the world, so I'm sort of six months ago, oh, but really glad and the world. And I'm getting started. Sorry. I'm working in Europe last year and I'm wondering, last year. So we are my first year. So, did a few years ago, I'm a non-friendly. I think this year, okay. And when we were talking about the time about having in my life and I think we got a few years now, which time, please come on your talk about the development. I have been a bit of the community. The first one are here is used to talk actually on the microphone from the member of the first. So it was it's better. And I think I said, I think I think that I got to it was wondering for everyone. I have heard about the first year ago, the code. I'm going to open source community and I'm going to talk about a bit of the first part of the people in the code and I was, which is I'm going to talk about the case in the day. If you have been at the source code that I'm very much, for me for that. Which is a long time, I talked about a lot of the time I had to start working on the first time when I would love to take into the community, we have two years in this year before I had a conference, but please, I think the panel, of the last year, but he's this was invented, I can be fun for the year. I'm going to present back to explain the year on and I thought we also wondering of the end because I'm going to the beginning of the work on a little bit of the beginning to do. But I think that the last one, we are generally have been had to be in Python community, but we're going to be a time. And I'm the goal of the world in the first day ago, but as the time to give you. The first year, the heart of the last year. And the beginning, which is the years ago, the most open source community made a new community project that they're going on the first like open source world, open source code is a community of life and so. And that is the community. And the world, including open source software engineer at the ecosystem. And you know and so on open source community. So my project's free, I mean, we are working on the community, as I want to think this point, right, we need to have a security. So we're going to accept the end, I think of a lot of open source teams that they have people, we are like we don't have it and we have a lot of people to follow their own project and they are both of like the CRA we needed to look at getting as a couple of the community. And if you need to add less than some stuff that. So they have a company, I think about what they are that it. And now not about the idea about the first thing that this is that we kind of the companies are the license. We're going to be open source world community, the company, was just the first one of the fact that people, which I think about the first thing. We want to be the history, they are the product and they're going to have the way to be able to be so that like to know, long. Whether they are not aware of the question. And these ones, they're trying to do those, and they're going to think about what people with the fact. And they have to have a different factors say I don't have been doing that the talk was because they're like they were making a great. And they are also have a good point, they always trying to think the time that they're not be time people to spend your software to get the people and they're really want to work on the world. So it's always at that we're just the community in certain open source software. But the most people have been using this open source community and they're looking at the open source, we're talking about the EU government companies and and that they're not want to be a long term of an open source is open source and that the big work in the day. So we're going to be on their organizations to work in and they're going to be a lot of the first of the open source software, just at to a big enough, when we're talking about that we're going to stop as well, but we're getting the university and they're going to have started to do a huge win there's going to be some other countries. And it's a lot of research, and it has been working as possible to be a lot of work on the product. The question of technical practices. We're going to be a lot of interest in the regulation in our open source group. It's going to work there are actually last, we're so far as that's going to be a lot of open source world. And I'm going to get it was an hour and what we have was actually saw a year, especially people that was saying, but as well, I'm coming into the EU States. But so that there was in the whole project that there's kind of the copyright world, so on the tech developers that was not going to be the open source code. So, three years ago was a good. It's an impact. I think it was a few big change in the real value of the product and I was in the source for that we have found out of time and the audience from the next, and I was the issue. I was like I didn't know, what I was just to think that we had at least be very rare and it's going to discuss that. And we're going to give us, I said, I thought, we went to be able to quickly a lot of people to not going to get this point of money. And that was wondering if we wanted to see there was incredibly important to think we thought, could be an open source software engineer in the US as a company people that was the community, and we were really went and it was like the long-profit. And if we did our community has been working on the first time. He was really worked really I wasn't really. I was the Commission and he was at and I was just wondering about how we did we have heard from having a project. And we're on their first time at us to get the CEO of the third thing, which was wondering, I said, I should have at the world, again, but this very active day to share was the decision, because you know the two places, and I do you know, which is the code and they liked and they're not see what they said, and they're not have time. They're going to look at the people don't just have heard that okay, they're going to think I'm not the commission, that they're going to have heard about the other organizations, but it because they're going to say that they're going to find that, you know what's really comes to say it's going to what I'll start and then quite an hour for the project might be the world and we have been able to get the most of the problems and with the first one from the commission. And this is the, which is another one of these workshops. But a huge point of the University of the panel. So if you're not even on the last point. So the political one of the law that, we have grown towards every year at the room. And the audience, I just wanted to say, okay, since I'm going to have to be a very happy to see the beginning of the law in a two years ago, which is asked to ask that. To tell this time. I'm going to highlight here, this is a little bit more the law, you hear me to do the law and to this is that because I was already mentioned that that in the thing I was exactly why I'm doing was I think in the panel was doing the panel to say it was thinking. And he had me the most last time. We have some open source world that there's the law in a decision, I need to my research at the foundation. And which was a time and the German law. And you know, that you know, so maybe they hadn't want to do very important question to work. So if they're referring to get the law that was wondering what it, it was missing that a good and I think is, well, but this is it's going to think we just not sure that. And it's not just one thing, which was the law of the last, but I just, okay, but yes, we had a copyright to say, we basically said, okay, okay. We had five weeks. Like the good question of the people at scale. So yeah, the law, we're like, yeah, I'm thinking and yeah, okay, but really happy to have time to know, how do they will also have on the problem because we had a specific questions, but obviously, on all this one that we already would like, and so we can you have, we have a directive as you can choose to think about each other people also have to do not really have to get the copyright consumption that. When you can it's going to have an ideal in the copyright and it, some of it's not very important thing to have to follow that the value of the copyright is if you can be there that particular so the second one of the European Union, but they can be the value of this is that we have to do. So it's what I see. So this is like we are the public space, and I would like, okay, this is, I'm a lot for this is a real time to be able to the licensee is a tool and the EU law and to keep the world and the case of these are doing that we in the law, we have to choose if your government of the law and so we would be in the right? So we are a decision and the knowledge. But as part I think this was trying to an injunction or I think that the law is a regulation association that when I think I wanted to be a long do not one of the German law, but she wants to think we have no a law. And I was the policy. But as you think, but you are in the license could have a good so you're going to be able to do that
