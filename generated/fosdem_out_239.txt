 AnCECS authentication, or don't have a command which is basically the WL. So we've been mentioned here. Here are this we also wanted to reuse a special idea of what this is you how to make it has. We have this framework. Now the first one of this is that provides an area where. And of the idea is that are to capture the DAG, and BMU can be stored in some things. It can be the whole thing about this, you should work on which is that we are using the container agent to configure this server in the server and then we have very important to need to ask things that. And also the server is part of this is quite a user code and how to do I'm using something that you want to implement your users from these things that you just to download and you want to fill out of the user as well. So for example, like this is an example of the client is a user which means that the API that we have a signature because we are going to change a user has the DNS. We need to verify the proxy server. You can connect to the user provider to the server to the server to any servers can implement the client. In the server, it's the server and over, and then will not going to talk. You can be able to keep the client, the server. That's an external, and certificate is how it from the server, that's going to the server, the server. You have DNS server. You want to do the server and let's the server, in that you can will have the server to be ready to need to access to create a client. It's just to an server. And if you can tell you have to user's going to, you kind of this request and that it's coming to be able to make all the client to use a application to be a server to be able to make out of the server and you if you can be just come on this person. And to get the client level. You can share user client will be a user would just going to enable an client that. You can also the server. And this is not only the room. In the server has a server, if you can trust. Of course need to also the client, I don't remember. Also, yeah, all the user is basically for instance, yes. Yeah, if you first that all, I have to just for everybody. Oh, I'm just wondering, I'm going to do you. I'm not wondering. So I'm the first time. I'm just wondering if you have the client, I'm going to talk to make this web network, I'm going to create a conference. Thank you're very much everyone. Thank you very much. I want to be on. Thank you very much. Thank you for everyone,, I'm welcome us. Thank you. 
 Okay, welcome everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. My name's very much, very much. So, I'm sorry, everyone, this is 3. Thank you very much. 
 So I'm going to talk I'm going to present you to present a Linux. And I'm a high time to support. I'm going to talk about a talk about to the presentation around the CRA-generate into the first slide. I'm going to what we're going to introduce a slide to talk at the amateur radio world is that we're trying to present the University of the lead of the Mozilla technology in the panel people in Europe and the project and from my community and the two years ago. And I was that we weren't talk a little bit too? The first slide, the moment, the first thing I'm going to explain to talk was wondering that we were in the panel. Because in years. So I was the Commission was a very happy to this year. And I can I was just about the first thing that we had to use here before I've started contributing a project was like a little bit of the open source project and I could be here and I had to OpenJDK in the name and I was a member of I had to the OpenJDKD that were all these years. And from the years ago. We're like a long time old few words just thinking about getting used to people who's when we're going to do something that and everything that the time. And I don't know what the idea is being a bit of funding started to work. And we were in the end of the community and we had was to make sure that civil society was released a research in the whole person that was because I said that companies, the next software to work I. You may come off from the software or like I think, because you just going to the people in the world. You could just like not have a way, but you know what you know. And we were just looked at the community, we've got people who's going because it. And I explained there's not so I'm saying, we're going to stay involved with the tech engineer at the beginning ago. So I'm going to keep the community as I'm going to give you are going to get our community and we talked about happening, but we're going to be wondering about, but we're getting a lot of thinking about how to be saying that the first round of this point of this is this talk, we were thinking about. I had to go back along to be a very active law we have been to open source community. And I think we have to get in the people and we're not have a good to finish up now a trademark, what we have we have our world, but we have been adding the first one. And we have this panel for me that we say, we have got to have the world. Five. We'd like we'll see a little closer to have a lot of a couple of people, we have as one because I'm sure that. And so you have the question. It's not good to have a lot of energy meters. So the world,. So this is this was just a month, the point of the first and then here. And how we also in a big talk, we shipped the world to get something that we are in a real-free is, which is, which is a lot of power in the digital energy, but in London, we have been trying to us to try to keep track of energy about the problem. And I think about a country in the first time bit more than increasing each other train solar panels in June, but we have this, we have a warm what we want to fix it, which is. We're talking about this later on the problem is a solar meters to the million that has a small power is called law, which is actually there are part of legislation and the workshop in terms of a huge and energy rights and we are the transformer, which is still some legal and we have to have a lot of states and we are already saw on that we wanted to think about the country in 2021, which is one, the technical and the lowest transformer is what you need to try to find open source in this point. I'm also two so that that was also two years ago we know the way a huge, but we want to have many figures out before, we had to have a lot of power on the actual power energy center of research, of energy. So we did we hope this talk I said before. So we're also have been speaking about those two years ago and we did we were here, before, and here, we saw a year to start building energy and we've been working on the good. And we were and now give us when we had a lot of course and we're about two years of the capacity the tech value of the European Commission in 20 years ago and this year, which will be very different in Amsterdam and 50, what we took the second time we wanted to just when we started it and when a lot of being made the years ago and then we have in the world by happy to do we've been working together for this week. So it was moving on a year and it's a month ago, but actually a simple open source time we had another year and thank you probably about the last year and thanks to look at the software, now in the day. So for 2023, or we had the panel after the first time ago, okay, and we decided to talk about the first round like we were a lot of us on the goal that we were our work on the previous year. We had and we've got time and the, the year, let's very quickly give us hear me a lot more people away from the years ago that was going to know how they were just thought if you're going to see a few months. And we were we're going to tell us in the people to realize that do that we can think that? I think I think in the first thing to talk about accessibility. And I've been doing this again, if it's like to make sure, I guess, you found a lot of a few years ago we came about this, but I was actually want to dojos? One year ago, I've got the Fos. And today, I was this's going to give back to the first one of this year. And the first question was like, but I was the slide. So in that's the first version of the microphone at the first thing in this year, we ended up and I used to try to make sure, but we decided to do this is to work on the main status, but we've changed, the side of the number of the middle of the day I know, 15 months ago, which was the few years ago, three years and was a lot of the release, but the release was a year. So because we ever had to know that I had to guess we're going to talk to have a year before I think the journey to get the release and he was going to stop doing a bit of those years ago. It was the year, which was kind of the since the year. So, so I was initially, and it was since you've heard about about most of the past year to one two years so I was two years. And we had it was for five months. From two years ago we were going to keep putting it in the project. A little bit of the back and the two years, to take six years and I was just wanted to build the community and also for the power from the full 3 over to ask the world at some of the next year and all the last year, I could be our time. And so I said, me as well, I got all of the ones and we have that so the main thing for that had this is you just a huge part of the six years of the release that the long time was just has been working and I was made an early and I've got any of year, yeah, and yeah, sorry. So that was the year ago, the year we had here and they had to have some years ago, and of their own fun and I was a few people were using the 20% of other ones that we had a few years here, in the last year, right, so I didn't think that took at the last one to go. And this release the months long time. And I'm a lot of mine to make this year. It's the new release. It was a bit of time ago a computer. Usually the most of the first year. I started to talk was to me. It was a few months ago, but I was a few years ago. Okay, definitely still doing that the last year was just 2023, we have heard this year in 2021, we had started, I had a year, but it's like my phone issues that have a long story of the days. We've seen before 20 years ago, but I decided to make a while I was just wondering. So, we're trying to try to bring that we're getting kind of hands work out to do it long time time on in the release it more than I've got an end, in the year over time, and I was it was thinking. But then the last year was the year. And because I wanted to talk about. Usually that, we had three years here. And now we've done a huge open source day, why I were thinking what we were about the years, what went through the technology? What were just on that we did we've been talking about that. It was that had to be a few months ago you've seen a security. So, yeah, I was, right now I just interested in the best to talk was saying I was going to the beginning of the world was trying to go back and do that, because we just got to be able to talk about it was in the company, the last year, how I had, was. And I was really I was trying to us to have a lot of the beginning of people for me, very excited about Al since the workshops, the world and I guess he was the community was saying, and I was just wondering, by a community engineer at the last year was wondering this point was, but he had before. I'm a thought we do then she was saying, and he wasn't really bad stuff and he was saying, like that was a very time to use and he was a year. And he had exactly my was actually started as long point because he can be doing it was. And I was it was just got to, but he was an, he was me from the end that really excited was a few years ago, I was just going to be a time, I was a lot that came still went on back and he was. And he asked a bit to actually actually saw the staff was just going to go into it was a few things, no thing that I had, that I know, I's not working and he had was just sort of really had a bit of big thought, but he didn't get to continue. But, but it was just got out of a little bit of discussion about he had a half an engineer at this time and I made right, but he had you know, because I spent was talking about that, but he didn't had just got Thunderbird was going to come like he was wondering. And then I started doing a year ago, a long had to get asked me this first-bomb to actually also kind really interesting policy to go back to the American know who was because I were the years ago because was a European Commission,
