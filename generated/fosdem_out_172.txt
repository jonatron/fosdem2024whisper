 Hello. I'm a little bit of a few things about the ones which are available in the world. So let's get out what are you. We're going to ask what we have is to use this stuff that also great to do about this and why we think this is like this to be very important to think about the integration. But we can look for the question is as you might be low as you get back in the ones you don't work on the developers that some people should have a future for people and the question was when we would have a lot of types of people to keep the time to be open source in the community to do in a bit more in the code as a lot more details on the first one is the idea the right thing because you're interested in it's at the community and everything does it still the free and it's done but we have a lot of people don't want to be so to find out for us so we are doing the question does not want to do how we do any people actually get the whole year we're going to ask the time to be actually able to be a lot of weeks and we're using I'm going to tell you how much the question that we're going to stay in the one was I think it up interested in the right the time later in the things that's possible right is that can we need to look at this it and things like i think it's definitely I'm good thing but I'm going to happen because I think that yeah I'm seeing it's an error is because no, for me because I'm using TPM that it's another question if we take the question I've been doing is there but I'm working with the actual code in the right side we're going to come to have just using that time and put in the standard in the system right and a long is just saw that's one. Yes, we have the right now the question here is that we can be used in the one of the question that we're going to do it's going to work if you're going to do it's really important to try to think we want to need to go back to the question is that we've been using it was actually that you're using the source. And if you see this talk about the question about the good about the question I'm a question we know but we work we have one of a huge idea to have heard what you talked to do about. And yeah there that we're using it's where the question talk on this like a question about actually to be done because there are we are there we're not so that the last year last year now like before we're getting the good thing on. It's a year and we set up with the things and they were there are using this and they are much but they produce in mind that you know where they are not just for every time out of it is the people need to have time to implement the time and they are the community together in that you always work there are not just a good people that they are the open source technology and there's so we have like a nice to we're doing that we have a year and it can do it we can be used to use it and that is it's easy to be able to do and then there's a whole talk for a lot of the community community between the idea of the open source projects and yeah that we can do we try to take a little bit of a little bit of you the community and we need to get a lot of contributions and we want to help us to have to think we need to be thinking about people who are in the people in our community engineers who need to have a good for the product and I think it has been working on the full of the people really would say who has a different open source community and we need to find ways to read the other people why they want to make a good and i think that really the right now you know I also I mean it so we got a lot of like that the community that they're also been looking at the software and but I'm not think I think it's not so that have the last one, but we need to think it's the world so we're there's less like a great to be in open source, so in level of the community was there are people I think we had the community companies that I think we want to talk when they are maintaining the product supply or funding in the code is that they are trying to think that society, which is the decision, but of companies are not at European law and there's not that the level of legislation that they are like I need to look at how people. So that that's the CRA that we are doing that are on the beginning of the only with the OSPOS initiative should be a product, but they're mainly not saying and what they're in the product, and that all of the fact, I think we do we use the organization that people of all of the things that we are trying to have were very well and so we are not have heard about what they guys have is the participants with the European organizations to come together and we can understand what they need to make sure that they have to have to have a good, right now doing the EU institutions that they're aware of companies and in the first way that you understand the EU companies, the world, the PLD, the PLD, but as far we're the world to have got at the commission, but we are the end-party projects related to be able to open source Commission in which way to pay open source product and we were now that we need to do a railway and the European Commission are in Europe and. And one last year we have to do funding, okay, we talked about a group and then from 2018, we're at the EU sovereignty and we'll get the commission and so we've got in Brussels. So a half a few years now we're on the last year ago. However, we have a lot of the open telemetry and they will be an open source CRA and they have a lot of open source code to make code and even higher level now the new software open source code in Europe at the moment so welcome to and also to see the world. So those institutions we also have the European Commission was our European railway revenue and this talk is the EU railway Commission as we also one of the OSPEC is also have been a year ago that it was used to highlight about the government and he has changed this panel, but he used for the goal of the European Commission that was to see with EU world in 2019 we've had in Europe. And he mentioned before, we came for the one of 3G and we had to do a bit more railway. The second day, I'm going to do at the end of the first day. And last year, thank you so far. I mentioned, I've tested a lot of it was to talk about to the European Commission, but that I said before that that like three months, four years ago it was also the left time in the very briefly was a few years ago we had to talk a couple of funding in this were and so on that people I don't know how we had to be and that we got to really even in the year to be the United States in 2011, because it was also has had there were mainly the commission had had paid to be done in 2011 and this was so at the railway sector in 2019 earlier in the European law over the European Commission and will be a young we had to pay at least the time and the German federal European Commission, the PLD and the city released the EU EuropeanOSS technology itself was a law. And we started from the European Union and many European Commission in 2019 and the EU from June and the Commission in 2011 and the world was open for the last year. And the past is that were wondering, I'm going to the parliament was to have been forgotten by 20ilingual law. And we had a few years earlier and and since we had the EU Commission industry was a public world. And then the IT law, of CRA that we were on funding to have decided to be a directive with the Commission. And they have to have very aware of the law who decided to be the EU Commission and which was something good in that's a commercial technology was really important to do to have to be on the law. And as important to have to actually the German law. And all from the commission policy with the market. And for a software to support in this sector. And for the EU laws and I'm I think we saw before we had a European Commission at the Commission the GPL. And I didn't have ever had a good parts of the years into Europe law that was a long, but should not the CRA or open source software and since they don't even to the free law, yeah, we have been talking about the commission would know, we had also want to stop, I should not going to do to be in the two source software developed this law that would be a law. So that the standard law, there is not this thought, but the EU sector could be copyright and the copyright policy. It's okay, they wanted to do has would have a regulation. But it's the legislation to have the infringement law, but it has always about the law in open was, the commission cannot be a European way. So that I said that the German law was required by the European court law in that means that the law there was released said, we have time to get it was a law, and the PLD to any law, the commission was able to provide even as Cyber Liability in the European commission, but it was very likely the same law law at the German rights that we also were as the knowledge that is the sense by law, we've got an organizations into the regulation, but on law in the technology, it was copyright clause in the world. Now, but now and the one of terms of the world that decided to have was said, so there was and there are the license can have heard of the copyright? And it was this piece of the licensee had this was a law and actually that it was, and I that there were the rights that we know, and they are people are like for us said, so far as the law, we wanted to realize that the directive to work on the CRA and and we can't care that it was the law developed and they want to use the German act on the copyright was the UK field in a copyright law in the law, but then they had started to give we wanted to their copyright sector and we had a German law and it was used it was developed, but was done because for us software and would recognize the big. I said, I was the license law. And of a license of the copyright law that's available under the copyright law rights directive was an best companies, the EU law were competitive was the CRA did 15 years in the licensee law. And could was the only it was one law, the time was completely injunction that was a law, we also in June was very good space that the EU forecast were to end of law in the public legal law and the, like a law and that they was a law. So I didn't remember what there was the TPM Alliance is that was the EUECU. Sorry, in a law that was on the law in the law for copyright law, I made an only be so there was not so it. In thought the first law is something that open source law and OpenAI was the methodology in the law directive the policy that was just was asked in the German law and the EU policy and the law and then the society of the GPL rights, of the law of that means under the law, the law does there was an value that had we had. And then to actually had in the gatekeeper of this regulation because it asked the GPL is more parliament will be said, like law and I was a national directive that open source law there is a cilingual laws in the software but I think I think I mean, the law in Switzerland and that the CRA was the GPL was the law that's like there was also one point, they could was completely closed law for law was a law and but there was the law and liability, and the copyright law so for the copyright rights law. And the licensee is our GPL, not in the fact it was just GPL States that they do not only were told at the so we also and this point but they were actually there were very, and the commission came out the state of uh, including public democratic gap didn't want to do they don't even know that no no government? Yeah, so and he had to have the CRA and they have been had one part of the world in the CRA and a copyright field law that there were had some federal law clause. I could be not think really much the copyright infringement. She were a European court last year and it was the open group to make in the copyright law in the copyright felt is clearly not a GPL law, but GPL, right this was the policy of the law doesn't mean what copyright copyright and the GPL law that the directive was the source software court. So it was the copyright law happens on license law, and that the conditions were that he's an GPL that an copyright when the third thing was required to law of an American copyright people work before that, not really actually going on companies to have to be, but they had to understand that they were in the court since just have heard at the law and the copyright laws, I was not sure that the commission, but then it's really a mandatory law and the US policy was to be used sometimes not only of more often are going to be found really important to be afraid that there didn't some sort of the market used in in the CRA because they need to see it came out and they have had about legislation law. But we added to be able to keep free value of the right there was done by the law, they told the copyright in software but it was a in this citizen that was just one decision that was released and it was going to do that law or a copyright law, and we had no knowledge and well, I just had this was no. So that when I think it was a license it was not perfect to be a policy was there was going to actually good place to show any government would a public law was in a was the EU is the legal law and maybe we could be part of law we have that last group and that he was supposed to be there so I'm going on the legislation and I had this case of the most people were last year ago. So the software has happened to
