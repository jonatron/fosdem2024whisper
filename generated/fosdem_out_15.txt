 Okay. We just tried to start to find the title today. Everybody is in a company. We can see this. It's a big one that we're going to get a list of people with the funding and keep the whole bunch of projects just as a lot of people. There are all of people and so many people like that. There's some people are many ways to build things. You've got some people who get a lot of people who have to do in the people from the last week, which I have a company for a community that they're using the projects. And then he was saying, I don't know, there a bunch of people have the project with it. So I can see, when you want to go into the community. I'm fixing. But just wondering if you want to help with like, I think I'm going to show you better to go to ask for people to. All what the first thing. Let's speak about the project. I think about the talk. The first one I am I about those deaf room as I'm curious about you. I'm looking at your engineer. I'm just wondering, I'm going to look at the moment, but I'm a two of a good organization that I'm wondering that I'm going to do at all the company that I'm going to talk was going to be a little bit more about. And I'm just wondering about why I'm going to look over time to present in a lot of a little bit a bit about a little bit of a few months of features and the other people actually there were interested in the ones which is a standard that we went into a lot of a few weeks is really interesting and like a lot of things that are the source community have to open source community. So the knowledge that we have been like to do we wanted to participate at the last one of the ones that. So the time we had a lot of the panel is the time to show like a few users where you the end time to be nice point and we have. And we need to make it's one person are many companies so these users kind of you can be connected to have a lot more of people's a lot of people that and do there's going to do. There's been a lot of people, the community that they also important for people have a very large model code base models. And then there are all the people to be a lot of them in a lot of work on it's been involved there's more more and also a question. And now and okay you can be kind of things like many people of different types of like many people open source people that you know about when I think this is like there came up and said what's something that, the ones that's a lot of the fact that you're in the language code and all know that in the models are very important to have this is that they have in the ones that they need to think and they don't really have these people, they have an organization but they're like you know what they should be a little bit less in the challenges that's the way and they are like and there's the organizations that these ones that work know, but we are often there stuff like those people who they can see right? Maybe they're going to do're going to get the first a person will be happening so much thoughts on money here and how they want to realize like the people and that we want to work with people to have to know all of the roles, right group who're going to work, that and they're going to meet between those people. So we're going on those to figure out what you know where you know that we're talking about what's kind of the people are looking forward and what we're going to open source code, right they're going to see that over a kind of, we are not going to be a lot of thought about it's going to do. I'm going to focus on the last one, we're going to be at a really interesting ones that I'm going to know what you know in the first step, but also know all these things, but it's what you know, right? And I'm going to start talking about the answer that was creating their data model in, the right? That's up, right? I'm going to make sure. But unless you know, they're going to work on. And so there's the details here's for example there's time to look at a lot of the presentation, there, we're doing a good API, if we can't know, if you know, you're having open source, so you're going to know, look at the first time, we're going to put in a bit of the end of our code, they're looking at our, we're sort of the source code. These things that we're going to make sure that we're going to have, like, when you know about some people are interested in the license point came out of our community managers, which is the future and what come from the context. Because we are, you know about the people are going to go into this time in, who were just excited to be very quickly. I think about the community should be thinking about how this? So have's going to say, because we have a half of the goal of our work in the community and the project, right? Well, there are, you. It's more in this was going to start to be there are like no, from the community, but by the work at least, you know that's a huge work with their data, right now we saw in the community. And I think I'm hoping that is the right? And we have asked for the world. Yeah, we are on the idea that the community we just one. We are really have different issues to ask any point. We just the requirements, so we have we've ever don't start our community over the, we are thinking about now going to worry about what we have a big teams, we've got it. But the second room is going to be very important to move one step to that we've got a living in the community community, you know, like we did, why they have heard about the world, and they see that's one to say we started the people for the world. And and the way to allow us to switch to try to look at them to go on how we need to make the open source developer, but we have to discuss about the world. We want to follow two people in the people, they want to make a bit about the commission, what the secondCloud. If you're on here, we're going to make the time to talk about the panel. But first time that are going to give me to go into the way that the room time. So I'm going to go to do we're going to say that is who will give us an end up. I'm going to just wondering about the other people that we will focus on the participants up to talk about like a little bit more about the other side, we're and we're going to say I'm going to be wondering what we're looking at the room, which let's going to talk to be a little bit of the ones that in a European Commission and the community, but this thing we're so if you're going to keep what was going to just going to give us together and how we're doing actually being shipping-source innovation of the panel, why we're really hope we have a member of our open source community that you're going to have to influence the whole job. Now I'm going to figure out of a few years ago, what is an hour of an IT to be a huge impact of the best practices for the culture of that we're going to be the world to give? And I think that I'm going to make a good to be the society would about what I'm going to you. I'm not trying to find a little bit of the way to talk to focus on a warm work and we're going to talk about the people who will be excited about how, but we think it. And we're trying to be having a good to do have you need to have skills to work on the community. But that. And I think they're going to have, you's over the CRA will be many volunteers, and they are these stakeholders and they have a nonprofit organizations to say this community scientists, right? So let's a little bit more important to the day. And I mean, yeah, if you might say, I think that most of why we can we have to do you're saying that. So, come up to go ahead of what I think about the slide? I also be on our society who know that we think the question. We have in the people in France and we're talking about that we have, we will tell you too difficult to think about using our science. So that we've been doing is a question. Sorry? So I'm not the first-to-option of most important thing of our question was a question. I started there's the world, the PLI and their mission? So you know what the question was to have done so on the last year and we had is that we've got in all these who came up and I had a lot of the time. Network. So I've been doing the last year ago and I thought that we started using June, and I'm going to find out and the world there's the most actively at the world at once the first year ago that we done in the last year. But you were talking about five years of the fact that the time was we were there. And that we started a question's what the, but we have. We built a bit about an open source project that we were a great problem on the beginning of the point between the D Foundation and it was to focus I'm just had to put a good and they worked around a lot of a large company who was more of companies, we had a long time opportunity to the first one and the rest of my first year ago. The first year we decided to have a time to talk was wondering about the rest of the most of the one to have been around this year. And I'm this year was that's really a few people can be good morning to just about a lot of mine who found funding work on the presentation was in these years ago which was a small community that they were the world. So the first to do we had the open source project. And then in this is a little bit easier to keep a lot of open source law and what was at the last year. We were about this year, the years ago. It was the EU Act that I had a small year. It took his program member of an open source perspective was a community we had to be started to be made a month ago and being spent to be a large day and the success were the people on government and they are there were also a very clear project and tried to, because by another day and I was an hour and on the EUN. There was wondering to be a whole market that was also a mistake of time to be careful of conduct, but a little little bit more policy to the same value of power to get left. So there's a number of a research in terms of years ago, and there were a commercial policy was a long they had to find the German law, right. So it was a question of law, the court that should be clear to a commercial product related to have a lot of a study when it's important thing that they were being a common is that this is a project and the EU organizations and the whole standard law and many standards and they want to put a lot of these things there is really hard to create a huge region of energy footprint of open source world. So there's a real world of science. So the fact that's also the world. And we know, we want to think three months. And now we have a few weeks of these two things that's like that they are good people who are too much and they have all good to be in there we have companies doing this and the European Commission can have been started and they have about the community and they would be a company to the parliament from the software and they're not work on the world in free time so they're trying to open source project to learn about the European Commission and we have the ones that the commission, the last question and they took off the commission and that we have to make sure that our public world. So that we started and we have been mentioned, we've been thinking about the first one of the European Commission and the technology. We have been able to have to figure out of the commission. But the European laws are coming to think but there are about I said about the impact of all the parliament in our impact of organizations and they, we have a power policy impact was like global CRA and we're in the market to be a European Commission, the world and we have a global IT team or the commission, we've been thinking about our world to be able to be able to pay the product where we joined to get people, which is giving and was part of and they've been in Europe. Everything was asked about Drupal we could be great to be a big law. So that we've been having a law to say that we already decided to solve their standards And they had actually went to know that we've had here out of a year. I guess so much the open source communities is an open source society. And so we've been had to know that we had in the world of the company. And then in 2021 in this civil society since I think we were able to discuss about the companies that this project. And we have took a month. We will start and we've done 10 times as I was the source team on the market, but we had to make open source software community. So even for our public sector and we've had to get back down around their society agency. And it was no, so I think actually started a real world I think we had had the first person. And they've been surprised that the UK law was a number of what we had been going to the EU agencies didn't know what was we need to be the way to have. And these policies don't exist in the problem for us are coming from the last year we have been thinking that our software you're trying to do with the EU law of the law, and actually going to have had had to apply to be in another law and then we had a little bit important and we're not only a clear that person and we
