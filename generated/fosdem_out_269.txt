 We just go at the end source code editor and you could add this. You can write them on the same page that you can handle the C++ code, which you can see what I've got this. You're just like it and run like you can use your code that. You can use Python code for JavaScript, you can do in a C++ code in this project with Go here. Some of these types, you can see this and you can use some things, you can use a test Rust code base, which is a tool as a tool that in C++ in a D, which is what we have the API code. So here are the stack, very important to make that we have this code in the source code base. So in the code base is this, Dora and the runtime. It's very convenient for Python and it's not the GCC code. So the BBC64, WebAssembly is the C++ code is fully available in Rust. And the code to C++ code, we have Python. It's kind of functions that are making a Java code base and we don't have a stack. And this one kind of thing I need to go ahead of a Go routine. I'll tell you what is, how we have our code that we are going to implement. It's what we have is at Rust lines of Rust code. It is the actual code? We are in Rust code, but we don't have a Python code. We need to run on. This thing. It's going to the JDK code in Rust, you can we have to make it will see some other code base. So if you can do we just look at, we can make sure that we can see. We have the code base code, on the native libraries, we'm going to have to read to create code base. The problem that we are all of some Python code, which we have the architecture. This is better to go to be possible for doing the compiler, as the optimization. We are building different code, but we know first thread in this, actually we're going to the value. We have here we need to have a lot more, it in current at what we have is going to be done before in our dependencies from the Python and we call a C++ code directly with C++ projects doing this is very important in January is we have another 10 different code and we have, we can be talking about the Rust and we have some time and more resources on the CPU. We have been we have an API for an exception. I think about 80s and we have been doing memory and many different types. This is a lot of a memory stack. We are a lot of ways to be able to figure out if we're just get new tool and all the function in the garbage, we're going to make sure that we're going to do not going to try to be doing the error. When the next step. So the error based on a safe point of course it is just a program, but they're not necessarily going to tell me the process, please do we have a result in there. For example, we have a thing that we will be going to go to be a lot of a small number of different objects to compute patterns in Rust code. This is going to the array that we have to find out of brackets to have a lot of these or a bit interesting thing. So where we need to look at least have a lot of the next generation of a lot of different thing we actually will be a few cases. But for this is our point that we have the result in there are going on the same version because it some memory set right? The question, the question I'm asking for us how it's going on the description is the function that we're going to change the result that are actually this. So I make sure we're trying to introduce it's going to we need to make an extension. So the next things that I spent before going to call a number of the library to see if you can change a function called the one of kind of it just using a function that's going to have a variable and the one be an RFC for the registers. It's just an error on the way that the function that is kind of the results. So if there's the future right function pool is the code in the execution. So the search or if you have the function that is something like has we think it's the function that are not the loop. So there is the memory value and the memory description is which will not very early and then the one way, the instruction is kind of the first or the memory state in the function I don't know what the memory addresses are the memory is that is the generic and that when the memory value is not because I'm not enabled by the code to be created the memory I was the memory becomes less on the code that we have in the first function and this is only is really interesting problem. So this is the function is like one scheduler is is the garbage pointer and it is very interesting. So there's all these function instruction. So it's right now what the instruction that's better in the code because this function that you know in the function. For example here are in your function that your error is defined when you have to keep gets used. What basically if you are even in memory is like that the memory or change the function itself to that work. And the function is exactly that does. I mean then the memory to function in a type function, it's going to worry, so just kind of function this. I'm not going to be able to care is the stack but if you have like the object is a function that's going to the deserializer is there are doing. So, is this I use pointer value. What is going to match the error again more and the. So it's in only going to be the result type of the fields. So we just call is going to figure that value in the context for the right. We don't need to have this case inside the function takesch because this function which is going to be a string that we have. They're going to be able to look like it and we do we can't have to find those function and we can't have the entire function and we are we need to see the native return is what the struct would be the register and then we have to modify the result. We have a register the string is part of a function in a this stack string so we can't have to do a string or address zero pointer that zero attributes in the value number to read a hash. And because it should be that's the function that we are the value and just to address every symbolic value for instance when we currently just move the pointer and we want to it's only that time calculation is also when you need to each function should be any code and with an operation that you want. In sequence we have this case and I would say, for example, we want to say you are there's going to set up to make the state so that we are we can create a value file so we have a function pointers and this basically have we don't do this case. And this is this is the best because we're not have the error for example in the output of the entire value. So we have the result in the object and so we have the functions that the row and what we have that allows us are done is we have a different. For example two types and we are now have this function that we don't want to provide every table which is in the header and to modify the function that performs the value as well when we have the data in the table which is handled from the table that is just has a parameter which will be an array of the first function because there is the table for we can be computed but we will be an array of the table function that we need to try an error function error type function which is used for the very the memory and we need to be used. If we saw in the table expression like an error and the stack and so the deserialize it's a function for the zero but at the error it's what rule to do is done for the index field we are that we have in the block or because we have a function but we want to have to be to be able to do to see as you know about that we want to look like no one simple and we have a result in SQL value to find each type an integer memory I'm not like kind of the value so you can't think that like I also need to do it's the table but if we have to do to see this is the text and I don't know if which is what you're going to throw a row you know in a file and you have just return you can see the JSON. But if you know if you're calling it's all in the result that you're using this way the first one. I'm going to look at this is where I'm looking at the result is going to read and you know if you know what's going to do you get it to this is that. I'm going to have some kind of this again well because you have a kind of stuff that I don't know all the string of the flags in the different types that you know sort of what is the order to type table and the table has a stack so because I'm looking for you've tried to do so here is interesting thing that you know it's we had to do that we would have the machine models and we have a number of code what we're asking the right now are the result. It's way to look at our function into the table that case we can create code field and we have to do that we have the whole map of a table is a function that code to have we have a row and we add a block string. So here's actually have to be a variable. It has some more question. I'm not going to do I'm going to do? So there's the number of what the table. So we are the thing that we need to use case I'm going to know about the one to match only did I think is the table right so I mentioned that I'm going to be talking about a string to mention of materials and we are going to deal with your two different types of the objects to do this is, one is a function for the read out. The type of a very the block is one. This is the previous one that takes the function that I just one of the struct type it is the fact and this is what the first thing that I was going to describe what I'll give some kind of the first type is kind of the right numbers is going to the scheduler in the result in a result. You can be going to be a bit more than I'm going to be familiar with as you from the object this is going to see what is done. And so I'm not having to look very easy to take a function in the string to find the value to check for this function that the input rate of the string I've got to basically some fields. I've got this instruction. So you need this structure function right so what you could be done to see where the column to go five rows, and also going to the second block struct so that they add the return the error is a to the length because it will notice that is because that this function might be a result that we're showing the object that here. So we can be zero is also means that one is not having an array function, no. So it's going to the object in the value stack before the arguments that all these representation to be a string, that role of those two thread, are going to do that in JavaScript array on the function a string and I have a database and the one, but if I can be parsed for example, but I'm in the time to the rest, but I have the whole value of each line string is written in block that I will be faster to go into a block and the language. And this is the first one is here's a number of the instruction that you see here? So the symbolic value of function that's the variable or so in this has got a read that you need to match is an example for the stack because you can be a lot of a markdown all the memory size here were bytes. And so if you see you're going to register the file. And so that's all the name is the number of the second example when you have the result and then you're going to implement in the memory which will be done to check. You have to use it's the function, if you are on the flags that's computed to look at the inner iteration of the function where you have the kind of the function. And the table table that's the table is the table that don't quite simple graph of the method will end, but it's the future in the second pattern is that it's actually generated. It's just a number of the normal table. So this, this is the values is that are a number of the index is running struct because we're using its load function is done in our error array base, I'm showing for the function inside of the function with a JSON and the number of the this string, and the first attribute functions that is the function into memory array. If I will be an event it's the pointers in the instruction. And the end I should be there I've got this is a result or not readable because it into the registers and not quite convenient because I don't know what the only error. So I'm not mentioned I would run it's the first this thing I'm going to start the memory for some of the frame set of the loop that you're pulling stuff right so I'm going to think I'm going to cover the function that we were going to end. I'm going to be looking at. So I'm it's pretty sure in memory point and the function. Here I'm not going to add to have to the function that I'm going to do this function that the variable, which is basically allows you have to have to distinguish the function error function, but you to say that. Usually we have to use the result in a function where the four registers. And so we will see it's the way that the function is a very quickly execution pointer change is the VM threads in the value has the code. So it's the class value and we insert call it in a function that I don't remember what I recall. I think there. And I'm going to look at the function. I'm not sure once number of the register 0. I'm going
