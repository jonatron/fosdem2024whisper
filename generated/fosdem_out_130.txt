 Hello, hello everybody for students. 
 We have a great job that. We want to go through or be here. And we have our first talk that we are going to be able to work. So what we are going to be our name in English is our name of the project that I'm going to try to go back to about this back to my talk is a little bit about how we try to get an app into what we have to a post an app gateway. And then we've been doing this issue that we're going to look for us over about it. And I'm going to start talking about like the last year as an email to start looking from the bot is to get into stuff. And I'm going to do that? What was going to be talking about the speakers? And I'm going to talk about how can you have to do you want to use two in the company that you're going into the user to get an open source for a user who will ask me to ask that some people that you this is a lot of the person who have the content of people who want to get in the rest of the panel. And thank you very much everybody. And thank you having to speak to share the first from a few years to, I'm sorry, thank you. So thank you everybody to share that open source software and I'm looking for coming to see here. So I'm a little bit of a little bit of a little bit about the end up, moving into the main person that I'm going through when I'm going to talk for people see here to talk about the open source community engineer, that are going to start to be building them, I'd like our second thing. So the web group is that this talk's going to talk to talk. Some of the software in the community. I think what I think we have a little bit more than a little bit of all the open source projects that I don't heard about the open source community that may be talking about this project. So what I think I'm going to I is going to talk about the world of the last year, I'm going to think of the main people are going to keep the code as I'm going to talk about an open source projects, an one of the company and I'm just like the project and I started doing the open source project. So the code is what you, right. So in the community started a lot of this is the time, how they want to organize. I'm curious to do I'm just wondering, but I'm going to look at the community. First of it was in mind, but I'm seeing a little bit of two years to see that the people all of them that they're going over time. In this talk to stop this I'm going to talk is the last year. So I think he asked to talk more other main examples. I'm going to talk about a warm'm going to my talk when they have a couple of I'm going to do that he has been just wondering, very interested in the last day. I'm going to make a couple of people who only're going to talk about the people who who have time for. So I've been looking at the little bit is a little bit about the years. What is getting involved and the team. We've been on the year. But it's a bit of like I think we've been working on the community, I've had a lot of the community of companies. And I'm looking at that was the community. And I'm going to talk I'm going to learn about I don't happy to do that it? Because I've really want to start with us doing the last lovely point of that they're going to build and I said, right, and so this talk was a little bit of the WordPress and they've been also the last year. And I've got to introduce a number of what about the first point where things I've got a little bit of people that, and I'll talk, we have a couple of people. And we've been working on our things. We have had heard here and I'm going to say I'm going to ask this. I've got to talk I'm sure that we're like, so I'm a couple of people who is one of people who want to do need to know what people who have to deal doing it? I'm going to go. Okay, but I'm going to hand. One here's going to be interested in just wondering that's out, sorry, I know, thank you know how I'm ready? I'm the question in the question. And I'm going to be wondering if I'm going to be on this talk to explain this day, but I'm going to have this point. So I'm going to happen. And I'm going to go to be a very much for this is actually, you also going to be done. I mean, time for that we're going to have a question to do it. I don't think we're going to know. And I'm going to talk about the open source and I should we're thinking about it's going to try to talk about what's going to ask that he's going here and this is going to be very good one of the open source and now made that I'm going to ask that. So, everybody can we're going to do. So the question is it is sort of this open source conference in CBA, I'm going to present it. I'm open source community and so. I'm wondering. I'm going to give people. Are you a little thing. We are going to start doing? No. But good? That's one of this talk to show you a talk about the panel. It's Chris, but we're going to our community, we're looking for our development project. It's community with open source. We're going to explain to do that the foundation of the community and I'm working on the project and we're going to talk about a good thing that we're starting have as well, we're going to start to speak some of people to be in the people. So for us will also started to kind of these people. And I was I'm going to keep going to talk for very good I'm working on the audience to briefly about what we're going to us. So the beginning of the beginning of the last year and the reasons are from the middle to do is when this talk about the people, there was in the money, the end of the first thing, the digital transport, this as the software policy, yeah, I don't think we've been reading that they'll start with the community. I'm going to talk earlier on some day, we see it. We're going to do we're going to try and I think this. I'm actually heard, I'm looking at the people here to be wondering. We're going to be going to just going to talk about the future of the time. Let's going to take a presentation, and I think we're going to do to talk about the big talk about earlier in the product open source software organization for people that they're interested in the impact of the market and I think our project and this organizations that we're the world where we're going to basically going to do need to be going to have a lot of open source perspective. It's going to start to actually going to have a little bit more people who are just from a good community project that we're a few people who ever have been looking for a good way to say about the technology and how we're coming into that we're just also trying to give a really a lot of people who's who really the project. It's going to make the open source projects that we're going to have a software. The tech has been contributing to make this curriculum that the software that we have been providing people who comes back and then from like we work called OpenJDK. I'd like, first session, you know there. So I think I'm like that's a little bit to Konzter. It's open source community that's a project at the other people have also there's really thought. I'm going to give you know how I've been doing people to say, I would love to ask. I'm the last year to show you for a bit of the conference. I think that I'm going to talk about the past of Open Science and I'm wondering about the project. And I'm a little bit of OpenJDK Association has been in the project that I'm going to share their open source and I'm going to be hoping to be talking about how to and the most of OpenSource project that the project in the project, that I'm not really happy. But there were talking about open source community and I'm not going to the world, I have tried to be wondering if I'm one of the community. I'm wondering what the product? So who I think we have been doing is all of a project on open source project. We're going to have the software to finish in a project that we have been doing on the world. We have learned we have a big product on the community for a lot of technology, so they are like we have been working on our open source software but they're talking to talk about this software or maybe we decided to use their project. So we are present now there are going to talk about the US and so much more people a question was working on the project of the community. I was wondering. And I've talked about the project since the UK system world that we'll be part of the most of the foundation, which is a lot of the tech were some of a few different companies who had, right now. I was also heard about the open source software and the last year. So let me a couple of the case, the new community is the world of those that it was the last couple of the open source software and there were to discuss about hardware development field. And we were a more open source foundation that we had been into the moment that we had a lot of companies and the world between our society by the first hand is. We started to do have a little bit of the market because there was when we could we had in the years of the knowledge that's the knowledge over the discussion and so many companies were seeing were like that were actually the EU Act that started in the other Commission out there were the world. So we were a very going to make open source community because they were a lot of the first day time was able to achieve came to make a good time old days in German law was in German law that people think they had been in the future because the end of the time to think that people are in the copyright and the years time that the community market so there were used to be had to say that were much more early commission and in that time they didn't care of the CRA together and they were in the political law in a person was a lot of the government sector. And of a lot of companies are very important time, but to the rights. So as we just about the point of a very recent level of a great thing on the directive at the field and in both European Commission law law years ago did we moved into the copyright conditions, well but this industry by an law and in decision in the law was open source, they didn't actually changed in the business license in the regulation and we can't know what European Commission has in open source law and the political parties that the law, the German railway companies are the data and trying to be paid for the science model that they're the public law and they will always found a German directive of the European European Commission under London and that's software and they were very likely for the technology the digital rights and in decision and that had any term at least, and we've seen in the court companies. And we have a third aspect of the world was two years and the PLD is a rights's what they're the EU Commission and it was able to that we're just to get to participate in their countries and they're taken to make the policy from one of our European world at the CRA for people by the law and they're thinking that the last week and they're not only the panel, but they're going to be a second thing that people. And you're changing a great to be paid to do for our open source parties, in the software and they have enough of the European Commission that I will be understood because I think the car. So the parliament were the end of the liability person at the person who's why they're looking into the EU act of they're not any government institutions and they're going to work on the CRA and they go to open collaboration and they know about legislation did well even about parliament and they will be aware of the decision interoperability law that she was not necessarily in a CRA and they're allowed to to ship been represented under what they're a practice and they would be aware of open source citizen may be engaged until they want to think there and they don't get to decide to be the commission and they'd got to look at the time they're going to think they're going to be clear that, and they should be like they have any people wouldn't're going to make sure that you're gonna be paid, can't change any value and be able to influence the problem. And there was the license, the same way that license would be an open source law. Maybe that we do that our value to do is to also something that need to make it's what they want to share the license and good space here. And so the GPL law and we're the court in France at the court was very first legislation, which you know this time as far as we have a big a licensing. And we know like we're looking and we're going to try to take care about this law that. And the GPL foundation think when we're building a great term, as a legal field in another issue that we get the first you have an public law of saying and over the license and the fact that means that open source law was a copyright as of it's really an court they have just a law in the rights that society because they've also said that they are going to be quite much as the government. It's gonna be from the law. So they're going to do so about copyright value of the law has just have a GPL this issue to be, which is the German law infringement in the commission of law, they have heard of the city like we have one person that may have any of things. Because they always had to know a first cost will encourage the EU licensee's
