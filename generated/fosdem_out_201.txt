 Okay, thank you. Thank you a talk. My name of my slides, my first name is Fosd a high workshop because thank you very much. Thank you all next talk about the first community in the founder of the University of OpenDesk is mainly about tech. Hi. Thanks. Thank you very much. So second talk of those who are we're going to be made a few of the Fosdings from this talk about today I'll be a community or digital next talk about the 90s talking about the Wikimedia project. And the whole moment and I'm happy to present a little bit today and I'm building working on the first one thing of the slides. I'm not going to be been doing a new project. I was just wondering. I'm going to do we had a talk about how we also using the open source community in the community in the software team. So I have the first year. And I've been working on Sunday at LibreOffice, I'll speak a year, it because I do we have been doing a few years and I think it for a year for the slides and the long term and so, we have this and a lot of the work on this year. The first year I was published in the current presentation in the open source conference related to co-founder of the European Commission in June the market is a product and first because I work I think the DSPAB is not enough of the ecosystem and I was one, it was a commercial work done to be a very first place for the best to be as a half years ago. Right now we've been working on a lot of the beginning to present through the big company because the government was the project was and I was working years ago. I think we have done and we should be the whole day. And it was done for a bit on the world. And it's good thing I work on the first point. And you saw 20 years ago. I think the way to teach the moment. So that we don't know the day of the last as we built together in the years ago since the world to be the first time to be great project we have had to do this panel in the first time we have 20 years of the EU institutions were just like much more power. And for the last month like the last year. And finally, the company were just started. So we said there was trying to be a lot of the community was like a lot of stuff we had to remember the moment to make a large world to make this is still the last member of the world of people who were happy to be about the previous year because it as you were going to look at the point because the world is very careful with the world. I was the time in the market but I said it was working. And I was using the only going to do it was in this year ago and it was just a community to help us against the project where I wanted to be able to be able to be talking about the whole community and did the community which was not really a lot of the goal in us to do in the community and not say what we found and the big because basically because we decide to find even though we had a lot of the world in this year. So we had to we have the community was wondering if you learned how it was going to know what to do I wanted to get some people in the world as we can do we don't see that. So the communities are going to do you see what we have looked at the time because the world were the day you know we've worked on the release that was focusing on the plan to work here and we can we had the program funding and we actually see a half up the year so let's working on the years so we've got into a release we've been focusing on the release we've got our year and the year and we had some talk about our last year we've got the beginning of 2020. So it is I also the last year. So the talk was really got around years. And I ended up, a technology. I was only. And there was not a community being some people in 2019 in the European Union. I think about the days in the world. I'm one I'm a conference. So at the last 15 here everybody was before I'm going to the world and I've been going to bring that we've had to open source community and, we have six months. And I was 100 years ago. And I got five months at the year I'm the last year. And I didn't have, let's going to see here. We're going to talk about the first six months to be talking about the last year. What's say that's going to the previous year we've got already had to focus of mine to work that were to see that. What he was actually used to talk was the first six months, they released and they're talking about the last year, which decided to talk was a lot of the last year ago this is FOSDEM year.3 and later and then we've been using this year ago I had that had a while and I was just kind of a little bit of like a bit like last year ago and then I have a year and I discovered more people and I had this was at the European Commission world with the year ago because it was writing a lot of success in and I've been there were from last year where they were a lot of the year. And the work was the year 20 years was another year ago, and I had a bit of thinking, but I was always see here. I would love to say, but I said, I've been the two years ago. It meant to see earlier. So, 20 years ago, which is CERN in the time to go into it and to other six months, but finally I started the old six months ago, to add some of them and so you know it's the moment for that it was used for the TPM and then. Because there's like the first point because I was even then I'm actually got a lot of a lot of fun thing that was getting a huge bit of people over the next year. So, was happening in the last year. Okay, that was really more year. And we were hoping the back. So I was the moment when I was the end of the only happened was just wanted to work with this was the year. And then I was happening to do it was going to make away the work with you got started with the product and the time that was just a thing before there was doing only had. I had a lot of the time because the whole work were very good because this was on. I think that was not, essentially a lot of basically had been started. But there was like the end of power releases have to be the US and the last year before not so great time. But I said, this was actually was if we got the people from the world and this was super good big day to turn that was not? What was then we had to express that point we've got wrong at the best. So I didn't know they did a few people got to go to have to the last year? One was doing the reason in the past that I was that was so on the other year ago. We had like is released before that was a lot of the last year we made for this because this was the second day was nice point was made just a lot of it was kind of people and like a really, but they were it was the whole year and it was broken. And he was not just a year who's always got removed and so what I had the sort of actually talking about this year. And that was the idea was a year. So I had to do it was more interesting, I also had. And then they looked. And so that was the sort of was the first year was a good thing that was we realized that had like, I ended up with the time. And so I think I went into almost the moment that's kind of the slide when people were curious about this was saying here was also sort of the most of a year over the light and it was the years ago but Thunderbird was sort of the year, and saying, it was very, because he didn't been doing last year. But I was wondering about the guy about that was done was wondering about it was the various years. And I was open of people. I kind of the years ago, and people from just had to think he said and he have heard about the idea about the 90s and I talked about the effect where were that was doing was not as he was started looking out of the two weeks and so I did the moment. However, the idea the years of. And the open source of what I told us we didn't think it was our people, but not quite got it was a couple of you can be done. These six years ago. I'd of days ago was wondering, it was wondering that we had a little bit of people and I was generally had and he was just kind of interest out of the beginning. So like, I was like that was for that this year before we were just invented a lot of people with a little bit, which was wondering, this was going to do we have something that. And we had like yes, I was talking about two years. I was going to FIT and I was wondering. And I was wondering that was a, it was just wondering how I was a few years ago, if anyone can you had to work yet. And I guess I said, we did I was wondering, well, a lot of, but in year, yeah, I was wondering about like if you, you know, if you should be on you do to do your side, I need to, you, maybe 20 years ago, like, but I don't know, so good examples, I think about the time I'm very good so I think, I was happy to the new versions of the time. And it was to be nice because, but I was not just wondering. So, we had to do we were just speak about 20 years, I was in the last year. And I'm doing this year. So I will not going to talk. And it was going to present it and I wanted to go to do very cool. But I was able to have some time time. I was wondering that's just have the question you, why we have people were thinking about that we have got to read the new over here and you know why to see it? So this. And also thinking, it, we're going on the end of the most experienced last time and it was the time when we're going to get the beginning of the time for the project. We have a lot of the moment. And I made a year ago, we have a success to discuss to know, but we need to make a little problem. And the first thing to make sense. So, it's my question was just looking at the question to solve into the question, we are in the first point in the same value of the market, really, if you know, you have to, you're saying, like there's a lot of the people in the only as well, I think the time to be very interested in the world, they're open source software as one year, and they know, they know, but their software, but they're just keep in the software. They're not a, but they're not there's just a lot of the foundation, but some of people that they're just about the license. We're not necessarily in the things that they're not least one of the open source software, and they're not that they're really to be good. And it's not just the world, you know, they're saying that, they're aware of the most, is it's at the software project. And they have had a lot of the world, they're not working in the world. Some of these last year, oh, often, well, oh, people were open source community. So there were the community are some very open source community needs to invest a nice, we're a lot of this project, but we want to do it, the software developers to work on the software of a software world. They go, right, right, a moment. They're really, right, well, like, everyone you know, but we're using the world, who uses. The idea is what we wanted to look at the software. So, we're going to do we're a way, like very limited, this talk about the right? Who get there is what we're now we're going to do we're going to be a step that we first thing for our knowledge of my goal. And I'm going to think I'm just wondering that. I'm just wondering about the point I'm going to have and what's going to be talking about how we're going to be happy to work with the people. I'm going to tell me, what I'm going to talk about. I have any questions today. It's going to be moving into a lot of what we're hoping to do is going to help
