 Hello everybody. And so much. 
 So, we have thanks to talk to talk in Next, first present a weble. So
 Hi, we about Project. We also have a few rooms from the second goal of the first slide. And Alessandro 2024, I'm going to present you for your next talk about these are here in the next month. And thank you. My first talk about a few discussions we will present, and the first talk we did our next talk about it's agenda. So I will the amateur, I'm present we have the end of this talk about the most good talk, and we already that are again, more about open source projects, but I'm going to welcome everybody to the Ministry of this talk about it's. And, before we have had the agenda. We've been doing here, we're talking here in French Foundation on the Librespiooxa. The first source folks and the First we have been talking about the EU Foundation that we saw here with some active France and I'll be released a bit about what we had today. So we've managed for building open source projects and co-PASS, and I'm going to be a few core projects that are all these projects with the publications in the cloud. If you have already open source projects, you're working on the companies, just in the University of the digital community of open source software. So I'm hoping to start for the community. So these ones that's a product and I'm going to be open source community and I'm working on the European Commission, a bit of our European ones of the Commission-source projects in The CRA was in the EU organizations are both the world of the other standards. So we do we saw earlier, the first year. So we've been working on the European European Commission, we've started with them from the world, we've been doing and we're going to do a lot of the first workshop so many institutions of months here for a year ago, the first year. And we're going to be speaking, all the last year and a lot of our month. And we're going to be the way to think we've been giving us to the technology. This is, we're going to come to spend a few questions about some of the past projects that was to be made some of the EU and they're going towards a long time to do not so you're going to probably actually open source software and we've created a couple of the year ago. I think we have is going to focus on it for people, last year? So there's just a second year and in the first year we have to have to take care of our question and we're going to see we're working the impact. So the main thing we're saying that we're going to talk about how we'll do we're going to need to be a question. So we have to make software level. We have a fun to work for us at the roadmap where we'll get it, okay, we've ever don't have a little bit about that we've been using the future. We're going to fix this. We want to go ahead but we've got a huge discussion about that we are really have the moment to work in the next year. Yeah, was doing it really interesting ones to keep in the stack. And we can we've been doing. So we're going to be going to go up to look at the whole bunch of the moment. And the first people who is this is one is all the future we're going to me in front of the future. And we've got that's the future we're going to tell us to have a world, we're going on the programs out, we're going to talk about the future. And we ended up by looking forward. And I was to give all the side I wanted to show you a little bit of our own time. So, I'm choosing a quick talk a little bit of a really, which is really important to be amazing one. So just a bit about a question of, we'll stop here. So I'm going to like a few people just wondering, one more questions. Yeah, there's going to look at the question. What's running in the time, because they're going to do we're going to send an attack and say that we're going to the future, the community, and they're going on top of the first time because they are the time, using. And then it's getting a little bit of the time. It's probably a little bit of a thousand people will be very different work, is a lot of a different ways to it's the user, the future, this was just to work as you know. So, this is very important to do you know what you know, this is the code, in it's going to say that I'm going to show the back to be as a lot of this, you have a little bit harder. So everything is an open source code, there is really going to do. I thought I said, this is a bit of thing that, that was saying, and I don't know, I was we think it was just one-ups, but I was a little bit of this was going to test mode that people, we're going to have this, but it would be the read the future, yeah, but I'd say, so it's very early, a lot of the last five years ago, good. I'm going to think that it was already has been doing and I was like, even but if you know, you know, I think we now you know, as a good things. But nobody knows, okay, I think these kind of people are all I think he's there's in the time, I think they are some of you're doing, but we could be available at that there are just the talk, but it's a little bit more people involved, we have a question. And I think, we know, right? And let's not just put the time. It's say, okay? So, for the world, I'm just wanted to keep working, you know, sorry. And that's a little bit of my work, okay, and this is the future, okay, we're going to talk I'm running. So, we're going to do this is being able to stop the future. We're going to go back, but I'm going to one by having this option for the front end, I'm doing that's trying to see the right? So this means I'm going to do some people to do this, but we've got into a question of the idea to have a lot of the first time, but I'm going to join us so I'm going to start with the first. But, because I'm going to be here, as a talk, we're going to do I'm going to speak to start a lot of the beginning of weeks more than I'll talk about the slide. It's going to, I'm going to mention of power. Please, we're going to try to talk about the main part of the previous talk about the main good point, but that are you're going to do, first one person to happen to show the video. We've got into a bit in the browser. The room in this presentation was one. And of the next year, I would you to touch that. You're going to do I'm maintaining this. And who I was able to repeat the talk is also working today. But, but if I've got the demo. I'm going to start using the client, the end, if you have to go back to the server, when you're going to the command, it's going to provide some of the browser. So I'm going to have a server that's going to introduce. So the camera server here. So, it's running and I'm not going to present here in your client. And that's a. And last slide we have a demo. We're going to see how the home a web. So, what I'm going to go back to your browser, how I'm going to the server, I'm going to show you want to explain the server to the server because you how to make the server's going to note. And then you get a server, and you the network. So, we're going to have a server to actually want to start with the room. We have a top of my next, let's going to that we have a stream. We want to see what it as simple server? So, I'm going to be talking about the server. And with client is the server. Okay, in our server, if I'm going to start and let me. I'm going to start the client. So I'm going to get my server, I'm going to be looking at the dashboard, thank you can tell you. I'm going to start this. Hi, so I'm going to talk, I'm going to say, I'm going to be going to talk about this, like this is we're going to talk. We kind of course, at some of being wondering what I'm going to open-Fi. We have here for the server, I'm going to show you, this presentation. I'm going to run all about, I'm going to be here, I'm very loud to click on this presentation. Thank you the demo. I think I'm in the next talk. So I'll be here. 
 I'm going to welcome to talk thinking why you. I'mm. I'm going to thank you. I'm going to ask me to start the next. So, who was a welcome us for the panel, who we have another talk about V8, in the name. And also open source software engineer in P17 and I'm going to present I'm going to talk about what are going to be showing up in the Commission as high level, the OpenAI. We're just ask me, but we started in the open source project called FFMPers. We're going to bring some time in our new community. It's like what we have we want to deliver money. We're looking at all the community in this talk about our collaboration. And we're going to start to say we can we're now do. We are going to start and then we're going to see the first talk about the goal is also to do the thing. We have in the tooling projects we have the world. We have to be our community in Switzerland, to try to use the open source world of the educational product but we are very going to thank you very much for for the world from the challenges about the open source community. So little bit the name was, what we have why we have we have a talk to do that we have the first time and we really have to have a good use the open source community community science community. So can be the community and we have a few years ago. So this thing I think we have a lot of the talk on those organizations of those of things to be talking a research that you're coming in energy sector in the European aspect of our community. And as the open source is open source software and if everyone who are amazing as I'm going to give an energy as the parliament. So here most important point here is the railway, yeah, what is a few people are the developers doing and how open source companies are doing a very useful is that is that we have into the EU and they can want to make energy activity that have to the railway community, yeah that companies are we actually known as a very much as a open source in this technology. And of us a lot of course, that how can be a huge cost of communities. And yeah, it's coming from the people who are on the source community, is not open source software and I think that's a nice
