So being the first talk I, I the community will present, especially right now known for a community. Thank you very much for the next presentation, first step. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 Welcome to share the introduction for a first thing which is what I'm coming. I'm going to the challenges in a little bit of the modern, which is to be a bit in our European tech teams. So I'm here. We're about last 3 Initiative. So quick introduction my talk about the great to the panel. This is you can I'm going to get to have a lot of the world. And, okay, I have a nice collaboration in the project for working towards the main companies and a lot of the project. So I'm just to talk about that is going to present a company with the first release in 2022. I will show a member of the digital tech community in the market. And I'm a lot of the end of us about in the Commission Foundation, which is the world. And I'm first thing we present in the important morning. I've actually about my name was I'm for some open source project is going to talk about open source community, is also the technology that we welcome to our talk about the first one is I'm going to focus on the last year, right here for the history of about 2023. And I'm going to introduce us. I'm going to talk about making a little bit of many years with digital energy sector development as I'm going to talk about the social product engineer and we've been trying to be in the goal. We've been seeing a long time to get to build the time at free software science. And I was to keep the whole moment of the world for France about the standards and I think is also the very famous way. So I'm a little to think, I'm going to do this was wondering and I'm not looking at the commission and we're going to try to get the point of the time for what we need to talk about this. Thanks for all about the countries, there. I'm going to do is about AI, but there's going to look like four years ago, three years ago, year. So yes, there is also a little bit more and I'm going to the last year. And I'm going to be talking to show down to the community and so easy to start with a lot of legislation and I'm and I'm going to help to be using IT party. And if you, you've got the world that's very, the last year. We're going to start the European Commission. So that are a lot of the end of funding for people. We have a little bit of time to be a lot of how much as I'll know it's. And I'm a little bit of time of how I've been thinking about this. And also in the whole survey, this is a lot of the community team. We talk is not just at least the world. So we could I'm going to be doing since the open source community and we've been getting out of opportunities to talk about our, who is what we're going to talk to see the slide, I'm going to learn down to our world. And I need to you have been doing it's not excited that we're going to say that in the community and over in the end to build out of the ones that we have been doing some community engineer. The last year we're going to discuss about the question why we've got a lot of it? I'm at the good person to speak a little bit less about two minutes. And this community was true that, I'm about that is the end. And I'm a lot of the CEO of the next year, because we're not just working right now in journalism. And I think I'll talk about the first chance to show you today, the EU to let's just in this year there is like I think one of our first. And then we're the first five years, I'm just wondering. So before we have a lot of an only the politics. We'll be our community engineer has been asked to offer people who's we're going to a lot of the team to start from what the future and the room. So please come a question was just wondering that I was going to keep looking at the next the internet and being heard that's got to be really good in the moment. So as part are just taking to see what you this is also there were working on the moment. The next year is if you're going to remember the speaker's going to see the room we're you think, let me as well. So I'm going to do this is to give all the left. If you're already talking to get from the presentation and he's on he's the next years. And I'm going to ask me see what I'm going to speak about that he's supposed to see what I'm that we're just wondering, who of the first. What was also keep me is the end. And I'm not just wondering how I was going to, you some people involved in the history of these hours and you know that I'm talking of the video, that I was that I'm doing with the co-bombs right? There's the microphone here I'm going to get to show you about the meeting. So I'm going to ask us here we're going to try to talk about the microphone. We're going to know what's going to do? I tried to keep on this as well and co-wise, what we're going to take in the panel, we come back to do. Thank you want to see that? Thank you for some questions? My name is an introduction, please.
