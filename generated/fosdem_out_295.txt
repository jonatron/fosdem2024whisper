 So here to show back in a new project. So this is the way that the data is a lot of different types of languages we have when you build some other plugins and the only things like that, you call and that's kind of the tools that have built into the code that you can make sure if you have any tool in the functions. So, like for example, you can imagine you can we have a lot to do this with different files. And you have a lot of different types of different types of different types of functions, which are of methods in your dependencies that it has. And then you can do use the first. You have those has a memory and you usually have to have to implement your application for a bit of code base. You can just create it. So you can have this. And it's not fine. Now, we run into the first one of the standard API is going to be super quick. You can now generate a single function that a Python code that has a bunch of libraries and then don't want to have to do the memory that with a string and then be called an error from the API in Bazel can do this. The code is a lot of code is going to be used to be part of the code and the result. And I think about the Clevis is not that when this version of the same and the library. So it's going to stop the end, we want to call the compiler description of the context and we need the problem. So we need to try to have here that. Letate in a C++ code with a new library and you want to get the other libraries that we wanted to do something that the Mambo. So the C++ code. So we just a thing to continue with, we have a very common compiler. We also have some of Rust code base library that are we have and we can say, our tools to see the native code does not able to provide a code as a simplified state that could be the code in the library. We need to implement the interpreter memory library. It's basically based on the actual code. You know that we can be using the Rust C code. That's part of the code and Rust and the C code base, the Rust code and C interface between BFC, which is a C++ code. And there's the compiler is a compiler compiler which is, it's available on very important in Ruby code. And this program will be done for example that. So in the Ruby and I'm going to start? And I'm going to run C++, I'm wondering, yal. And that I'm going to mention it's going to JavaScript code base, C code was run Python front state for C++ code out. So the LTO, is the same code was used for the C++ code, but this code is the library and it's not very interesting code and the C code. So it's a bit more is the idea. So if you might be the C++ is the next code code size of the language, you can use C code or C++ code we know that we're using Rust code, and we know, we have, just talked about JavaScript. So that's there's what I'm just a long time for Intel code, we need to use using. It's all the version and we have in. I mean, C code, we are building and C code ecosystem. Before I think the most important thing I'm not going to think we need, a C++ code. So I'm going to be about it's the whole thing. It's the main code as part of the Java functions that we have seen earlier. I should be much know, it's doing the standard and the community here and we need to get exactly the C++ code into Rust code in C code. So these C++ code for the code for example for C compiler is, is the code and C to think. So the code code is more, we have to use C++ code to look into C info base and C++ code functions. So if we're essentially first part of back and we're here our code inside Java classes and they are doing it is one binary to this we need to make it, yada and we're going to make it's going to be able to go ahead and that we're going to make the thing for that we need to show all of the code. So we are we are using one is going to run this. They might we need the talk about saying, but you're going to start adding it's going to say, it's a bit of the C code that a very important moment because we're going to be able to be executed for our code. So what we're going to do is when we're writing code, like, we're talking about the code, I've got all our code and to think it's where we're going to take the compiler. So the current code base was kind of the Python code is the code base, we're going to work in C++ code base is kind of stack, to make code base, right? So, like, some of the build code model. Well, like, I'm not going to have some C++ code at the C++ code and Python code interpreter now I'm going to code. And so it's going to do we'm going to be going to be going to start five years at the code. So what Ruby, we are we're going to work. So we need to talk to make a Java code from this should make Python code code, we need to create JavaScript code base that we will be doing with JavaScript code base code and we're going to open source code. We need to work a Python code base code is a function. We have a lot of JavaScript applications. And if we're looking at creating code, they're going to run for example, we use cases, we're going to look back to have the code base code error code base libraries or something. And we're going to need to build code base, we need to do something about it and we're going to take the C++ code to work, and it. But you know, we're looking into the user code is that's all the compiler. So, we're trying to the Rust code and why we're looking at something what we have we're writing into Ruby code, right, when you're going to provide a class by doing, we want to be linked API that need to a runtime. And it's very easy like this library to do we scale, but possibly going to happen. And the simplest implementation we want to support, we're going to do this is going to make an error library, the things, for this is the code for us are as it, but we're all of go off and try it works, but it's what we want to look like this is our library? And we want to do is that? So, well, the Python code is basically sort of it's already. It's what it's the code. It's built for the C code. So, for the beginning, I don't know, it's a most important, we're using Java compiler, but I said that we just using GCC. And we have that the code in C code is really really slow to work in Ruby code, we're using to run on Ruby, we have GCC is a C code just a Ruby version as JavaScript is something that Ruby code analysis. Yeah, one that, there's really are a code. So if you can be there's happening in the code. And because the GCC, okay? Okay, there's it's the Ruby It's a Ruby code. It's a framework in Go, which is the Rust code, it gives you can be implemented. And it's kind of work on Java compiler, but it's kind of a C++ code and Rust code, it's not just a Rust. But as I did it's part of a Python, we have a C code code in Python code. But, but it's really a Ruby code code. And in the Ruby was very, you see, but it's a Ruby Ruby code that comes from Ruby code, in C code. So this, this extension is just a Ruby, the Python. And the, I'm done and I'm just showing here, I'm just wondering, and I'm going to make, I'm not being Ruby Ruby code, I'm going to see. And we're going to run here, I'm not going to be doing this Ruby should be going to talk about Ruby code, but it's going to the current code. I thought, you know the RubyScript and I'm going to be running libraries. But I've got a Rust code. I'm going to say, you know, I'm going to run that this to do this was doing Web code out, you know, and then the code in the code stack, and I'm going to talk about how do. And you know, and I'm going to build. So, and we're just using Ruby Rust code source framework. And the description of NJAR, they're going for this is going to follow up to look at the CPL. They're just add the same code. Or you it's going to use WebAssembly can go back In C code. And if you can see that is the project that you're going to the function that the C++ code. So you can use V3 which is stored on the back in my user space. There's the C++ code. And for Rust code, but it's a plugin for this code. It's a C5, the whole job. So you're going to see and this, the Python code. I've got the C++ work and I've got to be the language library that I've to provide one. So we're going to compareable. So this is the first one application has for this case, right? Some people who have you're going to be waiting for that you, a C++ code that we're going to be a program. I'm going to be using pattern of this is going to happen in the Ruby code that we've put it here on for GCC functions. It's a, but if the code and you're trying to talk if you're going to build Java does a Ruby to build functions. And this directory them out. So this is the Java library for all we're looking into the C code and then we're going to do the C code. And now going to have a code that's going to be going to I'm going to do this problem. So C++ code is kind of Ruby code code. So it's the top of the C code, is a C code running. So I'm going to create function pool for each time to be if you just two types of these functions that are only one code base or whatever? I have privileges in this program. So that are in this code where you're going to be good. If the code, the Ruby. The function line code is not going to be a stack which has the code. You can be what the main function. And you're going to basically go to need to the functions are the instruction is going to do. And as the function are the function functions. It's state and you need to go more complex code which is the function I've got it. So the code description is the the code pool which is a string and the method. You can be a type of a function and the right. You can be the array of this. You can be an array where do the type it on the object function that object of code. It's where function names or in for you can be talking about. You can run C and then do with the code, you can see, so that's here is running some read in current function, and if you can just kind of zero, I can run, and add things that go to that. So the function is the most important part of the function is that I just the next version in, the Ruby stack. So I'm, the Ruby code is an array. And if is that is there is Ruby is the string in the function, you're going to be a Java. So in the M function function itself is going to make it will see it's called dash from the C function and there's just state with code or BTR is no C code at R. And last one function. So, there's just this. So I'm not a function that. So it's what I'm not using function, I'm not about you mentioned the thing I've got a C object. The function. I'm doing. And this case, I'm going to hit me. So this case, the idea that I need to speak? We're going to show the D library that if you the things that the code has. So I'm working will have some interesting points because a VM, J UID 6, which is now is called C and is this is this case something I'm going to the K3 called VM and that Go right? We're going to explain. And then I'm going to start going to have a C code. It's going to give you about the CPU. So this is like, we have some instruction. There's going to have to talk about here. So, that's the first one is it's it's R3 that we're written in Gpack directly in the function and V4's kind of those three bits that the function that was where you have is really define in the stack. And the question is also is going to that I'm going to be here. So if it's a bit of lines, I started. So that I was one of the one. I'm going to figure out of these steps. I'm using this is done a bit of what is the code and we continue there. I had that's going to go to explain that we have. Because I guess about is going to show the idea and I've got into my own function that the function is running and there to make it's a file itself. We're going to say if you can go in certain objects that we're going to the flags, because of Java Ruby request is going to be our function that we have to implement the API and say, the world kind of the function that's the library. And then we are going to do that I'm going to get the object, meaning that, yep, it's the object stack that's a value that the, we've got, we're going to make this object. You
