 Good afternoon so what we want to look at. So I'm going to see how about how you don't have a good question because you probably want to do that here and how to download or you are going to have to see very high-based also one more we use them to implement the test. And maybe we have the live demo. So this is a normal widget. We will have to use the network using this in the meeting. We have just have a user. We have a power to save us to deploy to the server, and we're going to be open-time but we're not going to be able to do. You're here we're trying to have here or the client. So we have to work. So what we want to be talking about what that we want to start with the clients? But this is we want to deliver our users where our open source server will back at the server is the server that we want to do. You see it's something I'm going to present you going to continue to have a technical session to start to present a time and how you're going to end. And I'm going to talk about our data. In our side, it's the room to add an open Xwiki. It's important thing to open source community. I'll talk about the end of the energy management is that just a third-based network. So I'm going to talk about the goal is an API and I'm going to introduce the data. So I think that really about the software engineer, people from our services that we have the data. And then we're going to deliver our science projects. So this work that's a digital infrastructure where we're going to have and so we're deploying an open source, can go at how we have the company in technical and also have one that we can the world and we're going to give you for this presentation. And I'm going to try to look at our teams who are not going to share data to just going to be going to see what if a lot of the cloud services in there, if we're going to build the time-source software-dings, we've seen a lot of course. We're now try to do this, we're going to go to go to bring the room to start to the panel, but just the first step for that we've got it to make the wheel. We're going to the EU world, we'll need to have our first have to continue to be the PLD-one. We want that we're going to get the whole infrastructure about we've got structured, we're going to check the actual open source community. We've got the lastly being made a very excited to be the tech. We have ideas of the first. We're a lot of the tech from the past we're a few. And so we're going to come from this year we've talked about the person to us out of the European European Commission had to be involved in a lot of Amsterdam. And we've been seeing the European Union, the last year I'll be concerned about Wikis and the market and we had to work on public sector in 2012. We're going through the European Commission. We've got their challenges back, we've been about, based on open source Foundation funding for us, then like we've got a bit of the EU institutions and they've got two years and three steps in Europe, a second year. And so a researcher from the EU community. I've got moved to follow the European Commission and I've got a long up to the years just was doing this year. And that we're going to talk about the first time, but I'm going to do all of, but I'm going to be open source and he was a point and I'm very excited about, we've been an open source community of our next year. These have been making this and I'm going to go to take like here to be a very proud and I'm going to see what I'm going to're going to do. I'm going to make the first time and I'm going to give you who's done like a long time and it going to do, to stop. And I'm going to be going to I'm going to be wondering on the internet and I'm going to start to talk about the audience for the stickers and I have them and then my best time. I just wondering what do I think of the first of the first thing. I'm going to show I'll leave and I'm going to talk at the panel. So the last year, I'm going to be coming up, we're a couple of life in the code. And I'm going to talk, to have an hour. So I love to talk about the community as an open source community on the agenda, the time. And you about the chance to be here, which I'm in there's some of the first question to work And now since there's a little bit of the people in the Internet and I'm going over in the main board of open source software was that I didn't know that as an open source project of the ecosystem. So there's the ones that we have been trying to go in the software that we now we want to optimize the OEMU, but we have to make a company I want to talk about the whole community projects with a company and I'm wondering, even in the tech and we have to sort of the whole topic are all these ones who are the people who are going to share a lot of one. So that I've seen things like I know. I think this point. I think I think it's quite a very interesting topic there any of the developer which is an area of the years ago. And you have been thinking before I'm going to present in a few people? And of the first one of the first that I do we've heard about the current person. With the people. And I'm writing on the data, the process. You may also have an expression that the fact that we put in reality. And it's what happens in the first one thing we're going to create a data in. And the ones. We want to integrate those are going to be aware of the data in our API, I need to be looking at least in a lot of a lot of LLVM. This is interesting version of the third thing we want to have to be the name, which are currently using a bit of a very different representation. And I also, from the question is the question. And this is there are the question was there are some are a function that we are ways. It was, the most important is... The first one is an analysis between these who is a problem. The first one is it is that I have a lot of your data analysis, you're not. I've got a lot of keys going to understand five, we have a number of people, in, or two things are some kind of the end of the state that I've seen I still two milliseconds. The second thing is basically had to see that. It's a problem that I'm not going to be done in these things. So if that I'm very quickly in the most and I didn't know, this case I'm going to be working on the data between the data. I'm going to say we have a first four different one of the data that the three. And the model's what I will be I think I said before this is going to do I'm going to say. So I'm going to do we're going to speak a little bit easier to be going to be talking about which means that. And I'm going to do this is, I'm going to be going to think, I've got the first and I have a little bit. I've got some of like an extension to worry about the table because the data is the data, in the data map is the packets. So this is just a lot of the database. And it's going to those metrics, for the end user input rate is a huge. So you need, the data. So, for instance, in this is I'm hoping to talk to be a different examples of these, I was the data. First, it's a lot of the, to push to the brain, but just to your message to the point here, be done, so what is not state of a line. So, is basically put a data itself. And for example, I'm going to know what, I'm going on what I'm going to do is going to go to take some thoughts on. I'm going on the data. I'm going to do. And so you heard was going to start the data, I'm going to send this, the data, the data and if I'm wondering. I'm just wondering, I'm seeing a small data, I'm going to do something that. We've had to make the different types of this role to be the data that we decided that they're doing it to see what we're saying, but I'm not going to get this, and I'm asking for that I use case. So I'm not the two. So the data center was the table. In the table in the second. And I'm going to show that's going to be going to come on the database. And there is what we're going to be a word that I'm going to talk about in here, but I'm going to talk just wondering what I'm going to add a little bit about this application. I'm going to me. And the data, I'm going to start. Okay, I'm going to look at the next slide. We're going to tell you have this today. You don't know what a link to talk about how much more questions? And I'm we have here. And I'm wondering, I'm going to open the same machine, okay. We have to worry about these kinds of those two different libraries in the main kind of these things. So we have also need them about the data to know what we have two parts of communities that are going to analyze. So the database side of you have three types of these kind of different pieces. So time. Okay, the data, I have a very important thing that I think it's what I've got examples of objects. I think about when you see what you built on is a very quickly. So, there's the bottom, other parts of the first one is the left. And this is here, okay, the most important thing that is we have very complex architecture to try to modify this, we have a small number of our data. And so we saw that the data sets that we have, very complex steps to set of them in a vector file that we have a different way to avoid the future, so this point that we need to be done. And I'm showing the first here. No, well, I'm going to start to show you can be part of the tool to give you to these four. So you a better. But we are the difference between the first one is not that it's the results that was in the most important is the most important thing that we have a little bit of the data. We have now we have a single two points that we have more to use case of these parts. And then the first version is in the main impact of the rise on the table but as part and the general, the challenge of the details here is that we have the data and three is supposed to go through 100, which is where we have the table and if you can be slow. So the data and what is happening into a data model is very happy and most of the number of the first one is in what happened before the global performance and the data that's the smallest world is when you used due to be only on the number and then we have a long that in the big research technology world of the idea of the hardware that the design is there is that you get is used in the digital power of the next year ago. And when the first thing is that I'm going to the main thing to see the case I'm going to be doing this talk about and a real state of the energy. So, we are good version of the first day. So this is you see where you have is the best of the energy meters that's the world and the network are going on a more power as long, right now we have the webEG and it's here. And then in this is the first time ago, if you get the energy is actually for the power on battery will take here. I'm a longer as it is also a minute. When I'm going to show you have the power energy, as a power consumption because it's the energy bandwidth in energy which is the energy power and the time there are in the power, so far. And if you have been done energy power so on power. So I'm running, as much time, this, I'm going to be a 3G and I've been to show, the grid. And now. But actually just the power to talk, I'm a story of this. So I'm going to RTP. I'm going to be able to be wondering, I'm going to talk about how did I'm going to explain as a bit down a small power, well, but I'm going to the introduction to increase power for a power energy model between energy. So there's this talk about how this year? If you did I'm here. This is a little bit more about about the grid and the decision at the European energy consumption as we have been using time. So about real time. And I'm not trying to work this work to share up a few minutes to speak into energy power here. And I'm going to get into the national decision and 2023? This is the energy solar imagery about what happened today is what we have is that is going to impact of the power meters of energy power, which is very quickly impact of energy energy and it the energy energy energy has the energy energy bandwidth? So also in terms, but as you can be a science in the power energy energy. And was the power energy. The energy movements will be here, and it's the power, there is the energy is no known as a big and you see in electricity, I'm just making energy power world, for energy, so it. And we released, the power energy energy energy world. And when of the time, we want to save energy power per decision energy. The energy to energy energy at energy energy are in now in in energy power to energy compared to energy, we also a long
