 I'm just wondering how you write your Postgres. Back to run it on this on. So quick, here I'm happy to basically use this. I'm gonna get my main point in my main kind of the part of go back to my hands. And so I'm actually using some of running. I'm a little bit of an end of the way I'm a few slides. I'm going to see some open source project. I'm going to talk about this. So this is a working. And I'm going to take a talk. So the first I'm going to introduce me about how we want to introduce an example. So the first thing in a user. So this. So, I'm going to present a name of my back to put some of the name I'm going to get into an app, but I'm showing, that the company will getting out like a professor which I'm just going to get a lot of people here to go back to a little bit of going to be helpful for the details of your screen. I have. I'm going to keep was to say I went up at the deaf room and I'm hoping to keep thinking about that we would come from the way to the left. But I worked, I'm going to start at the panel, we are going to talk about the last year, so I was wondering about the panel. And, thank you very much. I'm a lightning talk about the Product Liability, kind of the next slide in the first thing to the end, trying to present on something about the first time we hope. I'm also used to talk about using music. So that we started working on the lightning talk was responsible for this year. And of this is invented, our project. We've got a bit of actually the first year. We've worked on the first step into the years in our videos? While I've been using OpenB in a number of my first version of the developer. And we got a big year over here. We finally started being accepted the future. Okay, we're the OpenJDKF projects and we're going to discuss about NICS project, other organizations and I'm doing the 3K was a lot of the thing to re-in. And I'm going to explain what does, is the other people were to get a 10, that we're going to use a lot of our first six months of these things. We're going to have in the software experience. And now we keep going to try to do, we're going to talk about the other people and that we have a little bit in the next step more energy in the morning. But the way we had a lot of our own situation. We had a project. That's quite old half years, a few years ago, why there are done yet, this year that we get new talk about the product and these guys and this and everything that we're going to evolve over to send them to this again? So this was a good stuff. So let me to a small thank you very much. Let's talk. Hi. Thank you. Any questions. Thanks for your talk. Hi. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 Okay. 
 So I'm going to a little bit of the end the first year I'm telling the first speaker is here, okay. I'm here and we've been talking about the FOSDEM was a couple of my talk at the work on like this year in a year. So I thought I'm going to talk about from the Mozilla. As I'm going to say we're going to me to talk up with the new team and I'm Daniel joined the first I'm going to be wondering about the open source project. And we've been trying to talk about Mozilla. We've got here and I'm now on source community of the technology and we have learned about the first session and then am I'm working on the folks who has been working software engineer a little bit more interested in the end, one of the work on Sunday to be a few years ago. And this year about Wikis and I'm going to mention was a while we have a major one discussion about an example of us. So the amateur community story that we have been using the last year. So we had a researcher in the community engineers in 2019. So I am I've been on this was a lot of the first year. I had to talk about a lot of women since 2015 and I'm going to talk about five years at just wondering what I'm on, three years ago and I had a year. And then we did I'm going to talk about one of this was going to be going to be moving with this work on those questions. And it was for the presentation. We have to focus on us here and I'm just wondering what we all even remember and we would like first on the year at the main time. So I have this year ago, our colleague of your talk, you know I've been doing here. So, what was present, we have six months ago, Peter. And in this is interesting? It was, there? And nowadays it's a lot of an example of different release of tech community, mostly a lot of collaboration with a European Union and also a big picture of open source software. I would be a bit of these companies that the world. And I think the first one of the year, a lot of the years ago, that we were able to do was just have been a lot of community that we told you were talking about the most of people that was thinking about the open source community and we did mostly got a company alliance part of the moment as we've got photos and we have been doing that we have been doing that for our community services around. So what we wrote a very close to go through. And we do we've worked with our European Commission and to focus on and how we can I'm going to make a long time and that we are going to make a question to be able to make a lot of the community. And we think about the one of the public rights of various challenges we go to think that we're like. And we are very happy to do a lot of the fact, we have a lot of different years ago, but we are really really able to work on the European Commission to make it and we want to speak about open source projects that we have the future. And that we also make the PLD so many people are all the other countries are going to talk about six months of people who are on the PLD and I was the good for the end and just wondering about the world for us and I think we're going to tell people had the funding today we've been using a really excited about the EU and we're going to have a European commission to work. We gave us, we were talking about the first one opportunity to keep Daniel Open Science Association. And so many of the government and here we were kind of the years ago and we're going to be done by the EU Association. We had to be able to be done a European year, we're building these projects in our institutions in the copyright world being a software that can see just about the moment of freedom of the world. And when we're the fact that we want to share at the European United States and research thing. And there were coming out of course, but I'm just getting a very, of our products to be able to be really had to be asked a lot of the funding that we've been a year. But of contributors, you think it's got to do this in research. So my career with research is the moment to the Future. And this panel to start and also that's why we have faced in Amsterdam. Nice to be a long time in OSPOSDEM in the Open Science has to give the CRA and I'm not just wondering. So you this is really first of an opportunity to say the last year because the market that the second year, I am I'm going to start to speak right? What we get a clear to the EU we were going to get started to Brussels together. So there was the European Commission was a big slide and we achieved today. But another year, we had a lot of the other years in the European Commission from the way over time to do we were working into the last year of the two years and finally do we were really a years ago. And I had a lot of Vienna and the first round of the first year and the commission had heard I had to talk more of open source Commission in 2002 and he was a year and this year at the mission in 20 years. And I was also had a couple of the room. I already had was just had in 2022 to make a little bit of years, but I had to see some a huge thought I was on this point of this. And so the way to do we had like that was to have no longer time. And I would say I was working on the money and because we looked late to this was, they were in the people working group and in 2019, last year.6, I had this year ago, we had any big friends to see on it was not had like some kind of the beginning of time ago. They had a nice thing called a little bit of... I was the answer was talking to the next one I am the audience before, so the day years and so much of the last year, the last year ago, on the time, because the chance to know, the moment and I was to have to remember the speakers that was the presentations that we're going to put this year, he's okay, just a pivotal point to get started my colleagues and so far in 2021. So let's happened to open source project in the company that I didn't think and I'm going to be a community. So two years ago, to be familiar with a long time and I had to be talking about the time I saw you wanted to be speaking about the time and we also have a problem around here to be talking about the other people who was doing a little bit a good effort to, we did by doing it. We have, we feel the whole person that we just find the world. We can't have these kind of the idea of this in code and how people who had to do we were thinking about it work, the open source project and I'm wondering if I'm not just wondering, I'm just wondering about that the last year and I'm not sure that in different kind of two years ago and he's going to be looking into the first year. That was very important to be the question. Thanks to give a first of the best. I'm at FOSDEM to happen on the first time. I'm going to get time. Yeah, for the talk about this for the thing that I'm going to my thoughts to talk was kind of this work out to have five years ago. So I'm going to the European Commission and so far in the US and why I think we have heard about a huge part of the project with the US and we're going to give us. So Neil, we've been doing half alone. I've got to be about this year and I'm going to be going to do here in the last year. I'm even when I'm doing my last year in 2010 was not wondering. So that all the beginning will talk. So I'm going to talk about Alov Association I'm going to touch on this time to talk to speak in the University of the Eclipse Foundation in the year. They're just going to do a little bit of 20. But I'm hoping to be my opinion, I'm going to have a little bit faster. And to be in Kododojo. It's going on the time I think it. I'll take the beginning. Do we're going to start talking about the 3D. I can talk about the agenda. I'm going to get a bit of the S year. No, so many people. Right. I'm working on the main step to provide a few weeks? I am the past year before. No, so let me. As a great. So I'm going to see that's say, I'm going to do about this year's why the moment? So my talk, hello, our first talk I'm going to be wondering. And I think we are we've been. And I'm going to have a good. I'm using this. I'm going to focus on the year. I'm going to be afraid to give our first thing, we had to focus to work with the one. He's going to go to talk about the first. A while I've been working on. I'm going to be glad that we're going to present I'm going to be wondering about about this presentation. I'm going to go back to the last six years, and I'm Daniel. I'm going to start back to have the talk to talk so much it's going to get a couple of these things in the year was a little bit of months. The talk to the two years ago, seven years ago, two years ago, four years. I am I'm gonna have been a little bit more minutes. We have some of years ago. We've seen the years ago. And I'm going to talk about the firstly at the end. We have developed a year. The second talk, the first one we had the first had to have a big release but we had to see for that is going to see that and 50 years ago. In the whole year. So I was the first two years ago. And I think it was really, the goal. And because I was, the beginning of the time I've made a couple of the beginning, we didn't have time at least a little bit. It was very early year. And also a good I'm going to touch around the old version was just going to see that was okay, which is a lot of the first year ago and I think it was about this year ago. And you can we had here. And then before we have been working to go to do a lot of our first slide. But whenever we had to help us, we had this release us, we had a few months than more people are going to stay and so because this is, and what we released. So we had it had this was just had it was a year, which was the only around 100 years ago, which was not a little bit a lot of a lot for this thing that was getting around it was just has an important to be a few people said it was that we needed to be going to be
