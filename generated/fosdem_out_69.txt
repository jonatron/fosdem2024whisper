 I'm going to explain the first one. And I'm going to introduce a live start with a quick demo. So, we have a single bit of the left is what I'm going to do is going to join the chat. And finally, quick talk about the GitHub repository with that I'm going to go through in the CERN that we're going to talk about what we have. So I'm going to tell you about how about the AI community community. I'm going to give you a lot of knowledge for us the CERN? This is a blog about AI science, this in the International Alian and the moment, which is a project. So, to start to do that this particular models. The first idea is, the most interesting part of the most of the first one is I'm looking at the time to know. I'm going to talk about the social university who are running with our knowledge on this. And next talk to the day as an overview of all you can do. So thank you. 
 Hello everybody for everyone. I'm going to talk about it to name is called C&A. I'm not sure it at one of Airflow, she's a live in the first talk this is called VT, and it's actually for I'm also a great about open source and I'm a microservices that I'm just going to talk about the real-based project called Digital 2022, which is a very far at the first of the first couple of our work since I'm a bit of the Future project of the year ago. And the last year of the year ago and the University of my paper, the Jodojo. And I've received a few months ago I'm going to come to work about today, California and I'm going to talk from the first half about tech Association, and about who's going to like a really involved for the world. And I'm going to talk about about to thank you. One of women. Our introduction to be with the year. My name is the beginning of all the European Commission because we tried to make a half a good talk of the community management community. And I was the beginning of the first goal of the first thing the best technical tech projects are at the first day in the largest world is to share is going to be also going to be happy to be very widely living in the funding, the beginning of energy administration who was called his next year? I'm going to know what we gave me and we were using the first time to be able to get in the main challenge to our project that we are dealing with our project. And we know if the second thing that we're going to present in the people to have an hour of our member of our goal of Open Science will be a seat and we will be open source software so much as the internet, but was wondering. Because we want to present the other companies who had a big focus on the world and the third time to be more than the history and they have been a full the railway in the community and also really interesting point. And as well as a little bit of the world of the last year we started by the project. And we also creating the same time so much as the last aspect and since the Cyber Science or a new product system has never been created in the software and then not just the EU and the government was represented and the source and it was the fact that open source community was a lot of legislation in the EU and the foundation. And so on the commission have been a software community in the past the community in a data industry had a lot of the law. And then in progress as a lot of these companies and they're in terms of the CRA in the current law of open source community, the German law. So in 2022. The world and the commission has spent some of the government world. And this fact in the civil law and is actually in it was actually, the third EU and it was a European law or a law industry problem was in a long time or not really like in German law and I probably a regulation and a copyright rights law because because they were giving to a copyright and if it came on them and potentially was just working to kind of us a copyright law that would be a law under Europe and they was in the government rights of legislation and they have been the legislation here. So they actually for the rights and they were involved in the directive and they don't have money and they were, I came through the European value that were really, the copyright value of energy organizations and I was really didn't have at the copyright law who were that people were aware of the CRA, all one I was in the economy to be in like that they have had to ask like is much when a law. And that's going to look at the fact this one of that the commission did in this is that basically act by there was a good-profit and this point. There's not a law. And then you see like an law and the civil policy happens if I can have. It's the law. We had many commission directive and on the GPL I'm getting there was a law and all the directive to be quite a GPL law of the UK organizations that they could have said not understood for the third year of people and they wanted to have to be able to be any copyright. There's like the commission was a copyright in the law of copyright rights legal law because they wasn't work of that because we had this part of law, that they will be paid to be a law law in law had both open court law and they also in and they have really care of them to think they want to be able to need to put in their rights of legislation that they are the other law, but they're talking about any conditions that they're not so they're going to be in the license and does this case the copyright law. And to be a law law and as you're actually know it's not as far as much. It's really an open law. So there's a long time to be aware if anyone who's a problem that's a little bit more political laws as they are now can be a law and they have a law for electricity law, you know that you know that they also know that doesn't have in the market at the amount of the law or not only thing to be open source market of society. And because that's an law value of it's just is that they want to each political aspect of the copyright law conditions in the open as it's the world of the law that the decision. Which gap in the value in an open source, but they don't want to follow and they're trying to be very often a volunteer would say no way or whatever legislation so that? I would be great question was an open source law as some German law because I need the EU companies have two gap and the only because they've seen this means as far a copyright violation or GPL law that they've taken a law and the law would be copyright that there's that the law or open source law. And they have this law interoperability and they don't have a fact that and the copyright holder needs to be as possible that's kind of that they're not so in the value. That's the GPL law and the law right of law that it's also where they're the key because they would you to be at least to open product that point of the term for us of the law for energy sector, such a copyright under a real problem that they shouldn't know because we don't really have it's about license data regulation because they have the result in the policy value in that and they're just know that the law they're going to their law and they're not only using copyright value and that they are not going to have a private court law. They're just the copyright thought that we can actually then people that the copyright rights that is the law's also don't necessarily have that too very clearly there's not a law can't have to it's only a GPL cannot be kind of law in legislation that could be in the, but it that has been aware of copyright value, they are in terms of copyright holder has made been a license and they have a long fact that a directive but there's not it's no problem in the copyright commission are still this court law. They are the tech. And I know it's a copyright, which they're in the market doesn't a copyright when they can be a law that the policies are not by EU directive of the law's the GPL license mean that they mean that they will be said someone who are right person that they even heard there's the laws that in the value value that you need to this directive and they have been given the question, which society has been any mandatory license for this the best. That's a scope in the value and the moment, that the current law law in the licensee value of copyright in the GPL law. And if you need to switch is very important for it's not yet needed to be just put to, long term a law and is to find it's about only a copyright law in the court directive, I don't even know as they don't seem to follow one of that as you know that we want to be the law saying that they only not a money. But these law, you know the value you know the one person cannot have no matter, this regulation and the copyright act of the law act law, there is was legal law in order to the success as you know, on the question that copyright copyright law law they should be honest or that the law model in the fact, but the law would be the problem of this act would be more important to that that we also be in the only because they're not value and the values that they're using copyright from money, they're much as good to software. At the CRA and they know that they're not, and not always be clear question of electricity that notion of the license did I think that when you know it's not the problem to give you know that they've was going to report in the parliament and they just taking a very much time, the money in the world of the market. So they're like the politicians a question that they have to solve in the law liability and they're going to be able to do it away, but it's actually the time to actually the first six of the effect of people that they're trying to impact of the outcome, they're not just in this. They know the value member of the directive said that information because we know what they have the first value as we produce the regulation are going into government at the best value of these law that they're not perfect way that there is going on the current copyright law in civil law no of law and I found you need to know to get into this commission and they're going on that they're the government but you know right problem that person was the world. And so there was very important practice, of the world to the court rights as well so that I think definitely talked about the European European Commission found this problem of the copyright and did. So that we have the railway law that we always be a public group that was kind of I was a scope of materials that are in the first parties in a German law that point of a European copyright holder to know a process on there was just the value of software license that work that they made the term we had been asked to do that was saying that we had a GPL but they were the value so I have the the product that they started with the law-profit court law and they were something good way they were got to find something that and I thought at the court directive in and as we had our policy to work so at the beginning and now but we to give back so well I had to the reason that the commission was like um it was to the market that was a small or an open source software and we were in practice to be a question and to and was there were even a policy to be a sense of the point that I didn't a decision so we are two years and yes so you had to need the moment to be a lot of you get it was in the free companies before we have to have time to help in open source and the commission to be done the way and we kind of funding and have been working on the open source and they wanted to be in this and they had to get a lot of the first of people were in the first I didn't need to make that may not so it has been quite a lot of a lot of the policy and after in a so they've got started this week really, I thought it was the end of this whole person who was designed later and they are going to get some people went away to look at the open source planet and it and I wanted to find this certification that the foundation I was like I had a political idea is the I had a time to be going to find the ones. And so they made a good idea that is that was we had a very important thing that we can be talking about what we were often the space and had a little bit of the things we have like to be hard to get went into a lot of a big thing that were just been a long term of people were doing with the one of legislation because they have no big tech so yeah so we took us have started having the actual legislation and we've been also want to have always did we had to work to be able to talk about one and and I picked in the source software in the CRA and have this model on the EU and the parliament is so also kind of the best and the technology and we've been going to write as a huge so we've been doing the commission since they had a open source technology and then you actually had worked on google was that for almost also been a huge idea of the challenge of a product that we had a foundation that was to be used to be to be fully open and they are there were we had done very important but we had another European Commission was allowed to have the policy and have been to be sure that are really somewhat paid for that we've had a few moments, but we've been finding a lot of the regulation and we have to have been a lot of new government laws that they're just been a whole good workshop to express the majority of the European Commission and you could be removed and they were moving and very clear and we have this in a real company here a lot of the Commission who are a long market in the last year before we were invited to have another government workshops and we have done on those policies and we are writing our open source project at the funding that in this point but they were going to do not our way uh but they didn't
