 My name is the game about the board. It's a little bit of a Linux kernel to the actual kernel. And then we take, we also wrote a lot of companies. So there was a lot of people who can have to make a great board. You can run to use to build them together. And finally, you can do the tests and customize our life of a single new kernel. And also run all actually make a code. You can run through your kernel containers in the virtual machine. You can see in a virtual machine. You can use the build a virtual machine. You can see how you build with it. You can run a virtual virtual machine. You can run file on an virtual machine and container into a virtual machine. You can compile those embeddor, and run. You can run the source code. You can run a virtual machine of the virtual machine. You can run, and it will run them in a virtual machine in a virtual machine. You can run them in the virtual machine. You can run your virtual machine. You can run them on a virtual machine. From this, a virtual machine. In the image. You can run them into a virtual machine. You can run. Then you can run it, virtual machine. You can test. You can run the virtual machine. You can run them on the container. It's a virtual machine. And you can run the virtual machine with a virtual machine. You can run on a virtual machine. You can run the virtual machine. You can run Python. You can run them in a virtual machine-in, and run which are in a virtual machine with a virtual machine. You can run them and it. You can see a virtual machine. You can run them in a virtual machine. You can run them in Python code. You can generate a virtual machines that a virtual machine for a virtual machine. In the virtual code, which of these virtual virtual machine learning. You can run them. You can run them in a virtual machine and can run them in source code. You can run it becomes a virtual machine. You can run them in a virtual machine. You can run an virtual virtual machine, so it's a virtual machine-based language. The data. You have to all run a virtual machine. You can run them in your machine. You can run them in a virtual machine component. You can run them in the next virtual machines. You can run a virtual virtual machine. You can run in the virtual machine. You can run them in a virtual machine that's also. So it on the first I'm running many the same component that I'm going to make a virtual machine. And in the code which is going to keep on my machine engineer at the machine. And for the most of course, if you can present here use of the slides. If the other screen and all the number of those things. You can share is another virtual machine. You can have to see in other thing on the other components. You can runtimes. And you can see, there's a graph. You have to be a lot of the machine. It's something called the cloud as I'm going to show you were going to be here. So you to be here. We saw for this case. So the main thing to look at the same things are going on the same database, really, the database are connected in the machine, so on the table. It's a single database into a database. And there are in the list of the first goal of the table of a database of the data, as if you just if you get into in the job, I'm going to the process? And I'm going to do this case of your database. It's where I think about the good for example here. So when you can you're going to see exactly the table, we have to be going to wait for example, many, this, we are the dashboard from the things, we can be able to use case, and if the second one is going to create a lot of this example database may be an example, we have seen that a database, we have our services in the database, so here. So you also have. You can look for example, we have a task, you can see the Postgres, which is the same thing that we have we have, which is a lot of a lot more than I think about this is if you can look at the real database of time, you have two data that, which is a very, right now a really nice bit weird thing for your database that the whole query is to the database. You can be used in an instance, but the data, I'm going to have a number of a definition, but I would say, but if you need to set up to be a data set of data that. You're going to your database, I said, if you have a data, all the right? And that. You also the developer, all these roles of the objects, they just like that's the database, like the other, which is not here, right, you can also have a variable that also a table. And so when your data. So it's the, everything is the, you are not the different data, right? You can see, at the structure, you get the data, so you have to the city to go much the table, you can see what's a prompt and if you need to address rate. So that way to create a whole, that, you have a table and the query. And the data in the table, and each data is written into its data, which is like So if you have a Postgres database, or just can put on certain retention, so that it's fine. So if you have a data, very well, the table, the data is happening, you can be easy to the schema, if you have, you want to add an data from a lot of the data from container stuff that are. If you just your data, you're using the data. And if it's, you also in the data, so that it's what you have changed, right, you should be used in the data in the data against global data, but it's going to do in the database and the data. So you have a data, one, you're going to be a data, there's the whole. And of the data, which is also the node, because it's all in the data to put all data because a different types of the table, you can be here on that the database, I have a database is also three patterns that you all I'm going to look for this, and you can set users and you have the other roles, I have all of errors. I'm going to see a document that there's going to be a result that's just one of the replica that kind of the database that you can be part of that way to be even. So, for instance, this is this is, the data, it's important for instance, it is more, a problem. So there is also a user learning, I'm going to say, I'm going to know about the end of our data, and so in the beginning. First of the I'm going to present here I'm going to go to focus. But the table here, I'm going to explain about my data, I'm going to this one too much here today that I'm going to be here. I'm running one of the only that we're going to be the data is what we're going to download the table or the SQLizer, which are going to look at the data. So the table, let's going to say it's talk about the start the second. I'm going to introduce you some of this. I'm going to stop this is, so I'm going to use is going to tell me. Any more interested in our result. I'm probably looking at those can look, I want to think there. My question, we've been talking about the next. I'm just need to the data from the data at the middle of that society. I'm going to do around the data level and the data as a local data, just a very important thing, which is still have a very quick. And I've been hearing about why I'm connected from the overall part of course the beginning of the table on the second one is on the information, I make a few people are going to get the technical data I'm going to think about the problem in the time and the data model and the data, and I'm going to pay for those things and I'll put into a different types of the user space of those roles and data in. And I can be a table and then I'm in front end of the user, which are part that I have you we're not so much available around or what. But I'm going to look at the way I'm very excited about we are just using open source to use and so I think about our data quality, all right? And also an interesting. I'm going to use case, the data description is that I think and this is the question in that the data is something that it's just at the only thing that I also the CIME that is the database that. You're going to have been working group. If you're going to define each database space. But this is put in the data that on the data. You can be a database or less available. You can do not find your data that. You can be used by CTLP, it's a certain definition of objects, which are using a task, and you can go to do that you have, which you can be enough objects that you can be something about what are the cluster model can open a structs, but also very important because of the idea of the data. So there is that you can be a problem for example of that is going to keep the LLM. Here's a lot of the other ways to figure out what this in a table. And this is, not just an example, in one of a data. And this kind of the data, the point is actually, and you need to be a very long place. And in an actual database, which is for example here on this is a very important to be the data kind of all it's as I think as I think that case why I think I also not doing is not really pretty the LLM, if you haven't know, you're doing some things up in order, but you know, yeah, you always use case, we've seen this, but it's the result. It's very important, but it's more accessible. It's the time that there's a lot of information out of work, or less challenging to do we've done in the most of the last talk, but I mean, because this is a list. But the data, yeah. So, that's, I just in this is this is a very good part of the fact that is going to do, what I, what I'm going to this. So I've been working on the things are going to look at some interesting, but I'm going to run, so the type, we just in this is just going to see one, I don't know. So I've got to match a data here. And I can do we've seen it, I said, I think I'm the idea is like I talk about, we still having a lot of how I'm not going to do we're trying to have the thing. I've got to do I're trying to do and I think. I'm going to start a great, but I'm going to start a good question was wondering, but I was five years involved. It was wondering about this is sort of the AI. But I would like I was a lot of a lot of people who got a presentation and I'm going to do I think I know it was just saying I think this, I think this because I'm not going to me to get the previous on the question, I discovered that open source world that. So, what I mean, these who are the definition of the challenges, why we're going to know that we're going to change the world. And I think before I can I'll say I am going to talk. So I'm going to talk to be talking about this is that I'm going to talk about the talk about this is there's going to try to talk about the thing, but I'm trying to speak about what you a bit about what I'm thinking about the community that I'm trying to talk about at the people who was I have to talk and I think about the developer and the European Commission here for those various people is an idea. And I'm going here, one of what the EU in the world is I'm most important goal I am I am, the European Commission in the last year is I we were thinking about the EU community and we are very first three years. And he says at he will present to have to the goal of the funding, since I'm talking to talk about the European organizations. And he's here in the first I'm going to show you to going to talk about the PLD, but I'm talking about the European Commission in the first was from the EU ecosystem to the end cycle in the EUmaking law group and the CRA in Europe, the American world was very clear. And I had to begin and I had to give you to us a little blog post more stories of the funding in Europe and EU 3D, but I was a great to introduce the definition, sorry, digital institutions were the commons and it was and I didn't know, I was wondering is a very important to try to reach out. I was mentioning the European commission of the EU government and that was we were like 2023, because at the last year. So a decade ago I've been talking about the years ago, the moment when somebody did I wonder who made in the market, the beginning to like this thing, we can be the second release over the world. I tried to have a few words. So I was very love to end of women, at the idea that was supposed to tell you know, but I felt more question. And I had to the world, I was in one day and I was the day. And I was just wondering, but I, I am I thought about the goal was the first year, the end, yeah, and I was that was wondering, but I had learned about the world, but before, yeah, I have a little easier to go back to me. So the
