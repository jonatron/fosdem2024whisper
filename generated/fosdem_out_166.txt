 Hello, I'm looking to happen, I'm already wondering, so, we have to say this is the first version. Here, we have a bit of the design. We already have the start with our three, three is this year. You can use the other things that can share the application called our IDP and you can see that we can talk about our stuff at the 3DS. And then we also saw earlier where we can't do this other we can see that, but also want to see in our infrastructure. And we have a specific to introduce a community. We've been working on our digital service. We don't, so Mambo, we do some of the ONC that we have a little bit of a new services and DNCICE. And we have a very important for us. We've used to the first one of the other one that we have the library for the S5. So we're using Nix. We have the OpenJDK, native library, which is going to create an organization that means in a Openbombs of Open Science. And there is another name that we want, the most of the SaaRTT module that you have the OAuth protocol that are our DNS service, which is where we have a service API that we have the end of the cloud and all the cloud would be able to specify the product. And I'm going to enable radio. You should be the hardware DAGs that we're going to use the infrastructure. We have to do we're using the S&A are as the open source in the product. We have to allow the future to overcome the one open source software and we want to build the DMA. So those more and so we want to implement existing infrastructure. So here the open source web standards at the browser is to be able to access to build and so open-of level and we want to provide that we have in our container to provide several people that we have to develop the project and infrastructure to make sure that we want to be involved in order to avoid interoperability and they don't like to build with existing administration so that our community needs to build our projects or software and you want to ship this is that is an open infrastructure, the infrastructure that we are running on the problem. So in the EUD, we have today we want to maintainer today. We have plenty of some open source future of our features that are very, but this is there's important to also the open source software, for energy and a bit of the good work in the EU and it's also provide as the open source world and do that allows us who has been using, which are very important to look into infrastructure and the EU software can be done over and there and we will be able to ship in the first of the most important to provide and based on the way to integrate. So like to open source code, that's a big activity is that many of course we don't think there to look at the product about this country, the co-one Foundation, funding that they need. And all of course and that we don't need to get that the day a knowledge and just focusing on, all the only thing in terms of the panel. In Europe and we have a lot of security in June 2020, not just a little bit of funding to make sure that the last year for us. But here I've been talking about the question at this in France here at the best practices to actually that's going to open source projects. And to have been doing us and you see of our last year. So it is a lot and I hadn't have it. I'm going to talk about France. I also about me to mention of the beginning. So what are you like trying to talk about how can you're thinking about the slide at the end of the last decade of the end the moment. Each one of the first talk is the world, the first presentation. And the question I'm going to start. I'm going to talk that I'm gonna the German European Commission back to have been mentioned that the world here are from the European Commission and the code is the policy. So I am not going to be the last year. And I will go to fix the time we're going to talk about the Commission. And then in the challenges, I'm a bit about the educational engineer, let me for the first round of this talk of course, the way I'm not speaking before that I just going to talk about the world and we're the German technology to. And of the first one of the moment, had what we said, we had a half of the first few years ago, the one. And so far of the world. And I'm going to see. So how we had to go look at a little bit about where we have a talk about our talk about the world that I'm going to the rest of the important to do this. And the most of the ones that we have been talking about the last year. So, I was going to do I want to show people to go to be a lot of a lot of work in order to be very quickly. I'm going to be a sort of what we had to get the year, is the year. But I was that I was the good. So I was saying I had to'm probably wondering, because we had said, I was the point at the first one. It was this year ago. And in the very excited was just thinking to just very happy to see about two words, ten years ago. I was released around and the general, and one of this is in the beginning of the challenges that was like the impact in the energy sector. And so we would like we had a decision, and I had to do something that and the German law under the day, the law. And I know, Mike was wondering me at the one year ago, at that was here. And I was to try to think, okay, so I was good thing, I was the company is I was very much enough because it was a thousand euros and it was a more and before I had after that was a big time, but he started. I said last year. And I was about 100, everybody had some people started wondering why I just one is the left, a question. I was, you know, I thought I was wondering that really wondering if I had asked him, I wanted to think I had a well because I didn't know, but I was someone from a, but I had to be paid to make sense. And since he was basically trying to think it was I got a good thing from the end, and she had a researcher had to make a European Commission, and he was I was that, they had a more of the reason, who did I was not always not in the court. It was talking to it was very important to somebody was that everybody was saying, so that if you're currently I was wondering. And they did, like I was making a project, but he was a years ago too many of you know, and I was wondering, what I was not said, I was just wondering, he was just wondering, for the way new project that I started doing and I'm still just wondering because I'm going to speak, yes, I'm not sure I've been wondering about the best know what about here. I'm at the presentation. And I'm just wondering, I'm based and I'm a year. I'm sure that I've seen the end of the question was just going to make this... I was I'm a question. I just just wondering. I'll, I'm going to speak the question at my question. I'm concerned about the talk. I'm going to be going to people excited that. Yeah, I'm going to quickly, I've probably was always wondering about this open source software engineer I've got trying to keep working I'm going to start seeing me. I'm a lot of what's going to know, you know, right now for us, but I'm going to get involved, don't at the important thing, uh, I'm the next few years, more than I'm going to show you that we have heard about doing this initiative. And I'm going to talk about it's going to find this is the first time I'm going to have a couple of the last one of people had an hour and how can see that the folks from companies have been using their time and there so we have to work, they've only looking like this one of our system. We're going to look at the problem at that I'm going to do. So let me, questions. I'm going to speak to talk, okay, great question about to your, a better about a little bit, we're going to share this, but we're going on, we're giving a room to try to open source communities and thank you on to a couple of our project and we're doing open source and I'm going to get confused. That's going to keep go away. Today I'm going to the way to do it to be a little bit of you, but not going to be in this is that is going to be fully the community. But we talk is going to be talking here like we're going on a lot of talk about some funding for the the time and how we're going to contribute to talk about why it's on a lot of time. So last year, a huge company is thinking of community that I had to say, and we're going to start to be a kind of people who are going to come to review their community from the project as well have you know, right now have, because you're not things that. And on this is true. But what the people like that you know, this is the first of people were going to think, we've been done, we've got this is actually happening, people when a small community, I'm able to sort of like they know, whether you know, you know, you can't know, this, well, I need to speak about them a bit of a little bit of a lot of people for me, and I said, so many people and how can think you know, but you know, right? So I'm trying to do it's going to do it's there's going to, what I think about how do we want to do we want to be going to be part and know, but I want to try to talk about. So the like we've got to do we'll... So we'll think you know, we've got the one of the things are going to find the tools that, what they're have been talking about the communities, we're looking at the same side, but that they have been looking at these things that's going to do we've got the whole thing at the end-to-to-bomb, we sort of those things I've got the reason we had to build out that they're going to kind of figuring out on par and we've been getting an amazing people to consider a lot of someone who have a little bit of some, we have a list of people. And so we have to ask to do. So doing this kind of the examples of a lot of someone who was one. It was a lot of an issue of things in the first we've got like. I thought what was just came on the good thing. It was going to do we had had the way, but we had no, so you were writing this was that I got a back to get to... I have the reason. That was, just a lot of a lot of problems that we tend to the thing, do is, how we've got to do I mean, we saw? So some, we just about going to do I think of that we had the project that we've been doing a few people who were using with the NICS and they could do we're working on the way. And we're actually want to go right doing that people that, we're going to look at the community, we do we're going to do doing the last couple of there. And we'll share the last year. And we should work in that we're going to have heard about our projects that were trying to give us open source world. And that. And we were going to have a lot of work done a very quickly feature that we're going to realize that is that go to finish and we have our website than we have a lot of us, so there wouldn't think I'm not all the last year. And so, we can be talking about our team and I've been working on our project on the future that the talk, we have. So we have I have done in the end of the challenges going to be able to be the world. No, I'm going to talk about it's how is going to happen, my question. We're going to talk about the people who may have to ask the first interesting. And I'm going to make it's going to make in a much yet. I'm going to be thinking about the last year. I'm just wondering. I'm going to talk about the first. You'll talk about the challenges in the next talk was related to the first year we had the best idea of the way to people are they ask up by the world that the world be for you're going to get the open source and all of the problem is that we had to know, we probably come back to start helping up in here here, we have the talk about the years. We're around the world in the idea of the people that they wanted to discuss about it. So that we have been used to do you are we have a lot of the world. And in the future. And it's why we're going to do we are being here and talking about getting a low energy. So why we're happy to figure out to what we are talking about our perspective about our requirements? And if we would like this important for us are measuring the people to be using the first one of the community. When we have a little bit more people to be at all the European important to have been asking you just one day. And if you can, which is actually have to focus on our code. So the software is a lot of our lives of the government services were the new community and long time, the world was quite important to open source software in the project we had to see that we're really want to go into the ones that we have a lot of a community community. But this is this regulation in different world of power. And how the open source software is
