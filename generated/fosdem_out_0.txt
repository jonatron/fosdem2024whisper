 Okay. Thank you. 
 And we have a lot of all in that. So we have a micro bit of a little bit of data and an example of a test, which has been completely different. And that's why the very good chance to be a few examples that we have heard about the models that essentially what we have with the database that it is going to be able to create a different types of objects. On the size of the problem with this thing. And on the same role we don't want to bring a table. And this process that we have a bunch of kind of a first way to prevent this like a certain point we reuse. We have a certain number of different role to the business field that you're going to, but if you're at a little bit of how the other types of variables that the result has the value that you can see inside of, how you can see, a value of looks like the function that variable that actually has to read in there. If you be one, you're just going to do it into a way to get this table so you're going to speak about this kind of sort of say, which is the second field that the number of rows and a type of code that kind of a number of concept of code, you don't want to have to take on the table, but you know about these objects. You can't know that you know that's a nice when you're going through a role, you need to read on the types to make sure that. So you're going to use the other types and you know if you know how you want to do you're using the table. You can create a number of data here, you know, you know what they're getting information about the variables you know. You can say, this is what you're on the type of how the database. It's what, you don't have to say, when you're doing is usually have this, you know, for the table that's not in a simple query, where you're going to see why we're just have an array that is the time, but that's in a table. So the dashboard would be a result that you're going to read that if you're pretty bad, that context look at the rows. Okay, you can're going to analyze the file, you want to see, I'm just put the number of the page, right now I have the value for the query, like an instance, just one that. And the table, at my query can be like this set the arguments and we're going to start from the description. And the if you're going to be the result. And let's the other what I'm going to be going to show a prompt that user, right, right, I'm going to look yourself in one, and I'm going to start the first just wondering the opposite and I'm going to say, that's going to get the string and I say the table, right, but I'm hoping to ask you're going to parse the output an input slash any function that the back to select two code that this is going to the value of the object that were going to one. That's the end, but it's kind of the migration between the value. And the other thing that we can be able to go into the table to the future, we're allowed us that, we can think we're talking about our method. We want to go out if we want it and we're going to be from the main value and we're going to join, but we have to push some other things, we're using, but we're looking like an instrument itself, we would like the code for the API for the way to read out to use. You can get the stack the stack and when we want to actually create the stack. That's a result in our dependencies to make our code and so you want to just the code, we don't have to know that. Okay, I'm going to do an object and if you are the API where we're going to do we do it but it to do it's going to figure out that we want to implement it going to work into another because we want to implement a API-based developers that in the API that we need to be able to be the API. We could be able to end-Fi and we want to do those to implement this stuff about this is the network is going to support. We're going to expose the developers to query. And if we want to take the application, we built the application, we have a single image itself. And we need to have to work on the API. I keep the API and we have the API in the user and the API. You can be a build the API that the API to do we have to enable at the C++ code in, but we need to use case, in this product. So okay. Every time for the OpenTelemetry itself. You can be. And the Q&I and if you can you want to have the open API, you're doing that if you can use to have a service. And VMs and in multiple SNCIX state up and you have been using the scope. You should not using all the NICS is basically what they're doing is where you can you have some other languages that as you can do is going to do. To be executed on, which is a vector API that works in the DAG that you very important thing that you need to use a future, for the question, but what's what we have is it and what we want to have, you're doing? Obviously, what do is happening and this as you have is doing. What are we want the problem in open source code. And if you can you're going to be able to do is having to talk about the first if you need to deal with this. My question was very important to get this kind of a lot of the most important to be great question about the ones. The question is this is the answer is that the state and what about the interface is actually state and if you know how to know about the most important that we need to make as a different technologies that's the DAGs there's available. And the question is the other one things that the fact that you don't want to be a good, you get a situation because the answer is the question is in the question was in the question is that the first but this is the question, the question where your question to the question is. I think that only for the question, the question, in the question. And the question is, only the question is right thing I think it is in this question in the question before not only one of the question. I think the question of this question. I'm I mentioned or something that but then don't think, but just works going to look at this question? So in these five milliseconds. It's not the question, but this is the question is not just because I can we have any questions when we have a question but I think I think I think this question. You have any people on this question. We is great question but the question and I think I can there were people that time that people are you think the security. This is that? I think about it's the question that I think the more of the question was very important, and they have a little bit of the question. And that is if we have I think about this? And I think we're talking about all the, yeah, we want to have some of these are talking about those folks that have to get to keep track the results of the output that that we have seen the actual. You need to read and so we have the first two are basically are the question. So we need to do have to set up on the important to have to use cases and we have three-ups but we have five years on the ones that we want to have to tell that happen for example for a lot of what they have is very much. So first question is really we said I think we've had to happen to introduce our nice question here so this first question as a question. And I'm going to explain if you who don't think about whether and please have an next point a question. So this is that the question. So it was supposed to talk I'm going to be like a developer experience, but it was, I'm interesting idea in the question in the question. So this question is it's the interesting thing we are related to talk about the world and how long as you are going to you are going into the most of saying like what we have? And I'm talking about the community about the world, really know, we had to say we know what we can. So the community and we actually are going to help us see on the right now we have a little bit less than 50 years ago to have 100 years ago. So the world, I think it's kind of that we have to talk about 10 years ago. Now, five years ago, three years,000 years ago. So the German software and in the only one of the European European Commission and said, we have a few years ago, the court in terms of the German market so cool thing to have a long term on what we were creating some of those national software as a lot of the market work with the law and this law of our licenses and we would be a research from the standard but we've heard about law, since I was even the organizations that we're about the rights and then there was very important to be an open source software as you know what we're the market of the open source under the scope I think in open source software European Commission, they've been this year after the German democratic company is the major German, the license as I've had seen in the decision that are more open source and and they're a long as product that a really well that they really important. And we're trying to make the world, we're a good thing to do with open source culture and so the commission on the overall in the digital law that's about the EU funding and. And that they're going forward to be very small law was so they're actually trying to be a directive in the European Commission, but you're to do also at the commission. So they came from German law to be a lot of the PL And these copyright rights and they're here our product was a European directive as big decision in free software and but we've been doing an open source law, it was thinking the policy in was a big law was a long, but to have really important open source world. And we've been about these society. And there were in 2018, but we have got answered the German law was just with open market liability between Kod Commission called the fact in the first source law at the commission law by the first was the parliament so to copyright commission here. Their law or GPL directive, which was I took to invest into law by the license law, was a value of law. And that law, and so they actually also are actually have like a copyright open source software at the license of the product who's a law in software. And they started said that GPL law and they have also don't really know the government law directive and in the fact is actually the license is, but it was there be used in Norway that with the law, if I was in the energy open source copyright law, when I've been at the law law and then after the GPL was not only in 2012 was still the law or they had a commission because I saw that they can move to say I was actually thought that, no copyright said, as a law and it was actually from that happens to the law and you then they actually find government law, and a license and a government law. So they were doing copyright infringement would be a law you know, of democracy under the license that was a law as in the foundation of law to take over the law license value of copyright and software as open law and I was all the copyright copyright law made until she just asked the licensee always seen to a copyright law, although this law, they are at every law. The GPL, in open license would not open policy, they have copyright thought the court of regulation. It's long. How to no a legal law law. What only but it's not the law directive law is I did you can the law law economy because you know so we had it away from the GPL, it actually had a key. And we got before they had the license, he liked an rights only law policy. And I had a German law, of copyright group. So it was initially this's not legal law, so they were the idea for this is said the policy, the government model was the copyright license law who was considered by copyright directive by law, I was taken to court and the open license, uh matter what I got in the copyright law was, actually that he was the law that is actually just asked a really taken at a money I was not going to always as the law. And so you know. I have heard here. The GPL because we were an court law States with they have a free law, they understand is important. And in law that, you know, so they were already only they were about copyright infringement and license and they were the government value and they were also made even in a longer at was only two court law, but other tragedy of an open law and they thought, but they were people will be aware of the CRA, well, the license in the copyright from law that they was in the German law then now were. The license. When they was meant that the license that the law. And again, they would be done towards the copyright to solve this policy and the directive in companies doesn't want to think that the copyright infringement decision I think he said there happened the government is the European copyright copyright would be 20% of policy at the politicians that I know that has had that were quite, but, but that way to be important to get away in a German and they had to be a time and they don't have a copyright commission and they were given people would say that I would be very excited to do they could be, but they would be in the other rights to know that they also be open copyright law. But it would be the license would give care a copyright law would be a commission would be much energy value of the value to clear to do could be able to to have care of the court and that doesn't know that the result is to give their copyright would of the law of the copyright in the law's really well, the only so that I
