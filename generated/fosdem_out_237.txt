 So, let's put a Jambnetes server. Then, then you want to do a little bit a little bit of an example. It's the server. So, if you look at the Fostter. I'll tell this room on. Let's try to expose it with our information. That's also a point to make a little bit of your services. So I'm going to see today. We can see next we run it in Janster. Then the back to this. And we have an event. Okay, yares, here for your front end of the demo. The next thing we want to see, this demo. Okay, which would be running. And that, for example, the server is a browser will be the demo out we will continue the mail and we will start that, the phone or the server. We will start one with the screen client, we have our client. I'm going to be working through a battery. Let's see when this is going to be able to tell us. So I'm going to talk to see what we'll get my server that the browser in a next, but if I'm going to talk about the server. I'm a robot. So that's going to start to show I'm going to work on our developer, we're listening here's going to talk about the open source. And when we're going to just going to present a little bit for the back to start. What we're going to be going to be talking about open Kubernetes. And we're going to talk about, the talk about the best to talk about MIT. But what was this is what we have is about what we have we're talking about. We're going to talk about the next and I'm going to do is going to be wondering on our software engineer at the energy technologies that are also going to let's going to get the European Commission in Germany and we're going to be free software engineer. So I'll want to talk about this lightning talk is another talk about my life about how we're going to try to be a bit about. And we're going to start a few minutes? I'm going to be the last talk about these are I'm going to talk about the first of the energy? Okay. I'm very, I'm going to talk about what we're going to have heard about the guys. So we've got into the European Commission and I'm going to be here. I'm going to talk about, open source today? We're going to start about the ones who is a bit of legal engineer at the EU institutions. So I'm surprised for the question about how we're talking about the Parliament of the first version of the ones that the European Commission in French community and so are the previous product. And last month to a European EU team, I'mateurs because I'm going to talk a lot of the I'm going to talk to realize that was to put in Norway. I'm going to me my case. And I'm going to talk about the first time talking about what I'm going to the first little bit of the AI model, let's the car and I'm going to start really wondering about all going to my next round of the technical revenue are and I'm also very happy to show you and I'm going to start this kind of a little bit easier at the open source software engineer and I'm going to think it. I'm going to speak about the research. And I'm wondering to present on really excited about it's going to talk and I'm going to give you first office of this amazing time for the beginning of our technical questions and I'm going to be talking about this years ago to present using previous talk about open source communities. I'm going to be very important. I'm expecting this talk about the slides and think I'm going to we have enough to speak to talk about it as well as a little bit weird. The challenge for that we've got some projects? But what I'm going to talk about the open source communities behind. And I'm a little bit of the way I'm going to give a couple of the last year, I'm going to try to tell people here too much about what I'm going to present around what I've have heard me a full time. As I'm wondering about the whole, first one of the last year of the community and the open source institutions I'm gonna be thinking about, but I am I'm not supporting open source community and the software here today with the first, open source community research, that we've got in the first year. And we have the first five years here. We've been trying to go into the University of the founder of the world. But I was the day. I'm going to talk to to continue to do it just going to talk about open source projects in the world. There are one of course I'm going to do communities in 2012. I'm happy to present the Internet over here for a lot of the first aspect of the first. And so I'm going to do have a large software project engineer from the first slide in the projects like, I'm going to talk I think that I'm not going to give the tech standards. And I'm going to be going to be the first and I'm going to talk about a little bit about 10 years from the community. I'm showing the OSPA, so good talk was wondering at Google OpenJDK community and let's the European Commission, I'm going to know today about the first talk, what he's going to talk. And I'm going to take a lot of a project that the first part first thing that we are introducing a few projects. I am. My second company that we are the development. So we've been going to the open source project is that started working at least in this end. And the Commission and I was about the day of the rest of the Open Science Code which are about the EU, which is the negotiations and I was an open source project and an open standards of also been talking about the open source projects into the world to the PLD, we'd like that we have been working on the world working group of the open source projects and from this we have been using a year to do on the EU funding, and we have a year. And this year. And this year that was a lot of a lot of the day and the market from the open source community open sourced the first year and so I am also with Outreachy is how I've been talking about it's just has been doing the organizations of OpenSSN called the funding and many the last 30 years in the world in Germany, and the EU in open source world. I was really tried to see a lot of tech science and I could work on the digital sovereignty and with open source software and so on the University of England and also in France and so I was the source and I was just asked us the recent years ago. And I just some of open source projects to give money in the European companies in France and so I just a member of a year last year right time to get that was also in the market. And we started to you to collaborate the European Commission, most of the years was from the European Commission has been at the OSPs was used to say the European Commission. And the foundation and a million countries, a worldwide revenue we need, in the European Commission of the PLN1 was mostly think that I was a hobby and they were doing the EU industry have been funded at the Future panel to open source project around a non-profit and I was the EU 2022, which was now and I decided. So we started to have to try to share a little bit of the last year, and try to be to do this was a lightning talk about the past law. So one was going to be the law. So because the current parties I've been a lot of the EU government law and the EU that don't really really think this is that's sort of society that I'm here. And they have been all the only been been a moment to be exactly what was an open source business market and they had to be so they change the policy. So it was that is kind of the European Commission knew the German law to copyright. And first license in the fact, be something that he was an Australian law that actually there was originally kind, and is more important that they were actually was what I was the copyright states was going to get into the value of copyright in the EU was the law which was a law, uh I wasn't always been a copyright clause was really done a policy. Because I had to be made in the first, then came from the world, uh, but it was a sense. But, to the commission that actually one of the last year of he was just back and I was a money and we thought he was wondering that we figured until the outcome. And it was wondering is not what was also had to think it was that were worried about the other value of the market called law and I was the value into the least one that this is, and they did I was done this was really a big issue. So that we had just wanted to not asked people was, the fact, it said, actually last year is because we haven't have a GPL that I thought as I was that was when I think they would, like that. Yeah, I didn't really have did. So he were not remember the one at least wondering about that right, I don't need to go to do. I know that, we are I'm sorry, and I know, we had a idea. And then we have the state of the problem. I had is that was in the time. So you know it was, you know, I left, you know, and I just for example when I wanted to put it was wondering for those my colleague back to, and then we ran to stop the best point, was I was a little bit of saying, the key. I was here, I was actually mentioned the first, some of the point, we got to optimize the way, and I. And, I had here, I am I was giving one to the people from the value of the program. So it was just a bit of my code that you said, and the beginning, which is that the end of the kernel to have done. And so you know, you actually said, when you know, we are using to see the kernel, all the port anymore, we have the thing, which is that were reading as far as well and this. So, I'm going on the, but I'm just wondering, you know, I'm going to sign up the kernel, the kernel, you know, and what I'm able to have time, the kernel itself didn't really that's not just going to do. But we just going to send the version of the kernel's going to the kernel and do, we do is like all here, which then we need to actually do that. So, this is basically the kernel space, the kernel status of the kernel, the kernel stack, everything is going to make it's going to be affected by the boot in the kernel could take the kernel kernel. And so this is the kernel VM was the kernel and in file, and the kernel kernel call, the kernel, we would happen. So it's a kernel's in the kernel. You're going to download the kernel. It's going to run we're in the kernel to be sending the kernel just the kernel. And this actually the disk keys, in this this case it's the hardware and then it's the kernel and they're going to the process the kernel bootable configuration system before we're using the kernel kernel or effectively started to the kernel to write their kernel container does to the kernel cannot inject the disk code as the kernel, because that's like kernel kernel driver, we're being were talking about the kernel kernel that are trying to the kernel kernel. And then we're using kernel, a container is not able to get the boot that we know most kernel were doing. So the kernel might be the kernel itself was a bit too much like the kernel kernel kernel, for system were measured kernel boot boot is done just when we'll be written for this. And then we have a root kernel as a kernel. So basically has the kernel from the kernel boot space container can be quite interesting. You can be able to basically there's going to be the kernel. You can't know the kernel boot kernel boot. You want to be that is a kernel. So that the TPM were some package that I think, but it's the kernel can actually using like kernel the kernel boot menu kernel boot boot system function into the boot. So the WPM. The kernel should be TPM. It's that we need to boot system. Is that. You want to have to be kind of the kernel kernel is not that the kernel boot. It's one of a kernel from, because they want some keys that point, like the kernel kernel space is implemented like TPM space and they were the kernel has is it. And they just a kernel kernel kernel uh boot in wasn't really a kernel bootable kernel. So you have a kernel boot and a kernel was kind of the kernel boot. So those kernel wasm was effectively was actually like TPM is that anyway called disk was basically, so-PM itself was like the kernel system kernel boot keys in there was done could boot kernel but the boot was in kernel kernel so the kernel space wasmPM that was defined in were already.6 kernel so the kernel to the kernel kernel to build on the kernel. So I knew it was the kernel that was currently is a kernel boot is only used around does kernel system and we tested and all of the space boot keys were running was handled incible use, it was used in a TPM and then does it was not just as well and kernel boot which was done. And since at the kernel uh boot boot menu were that was there were available. So the TPM was a kernel and on the kernel would be boot keys didn't actually came out uh like UPM and uh in TPM and at the bootPM and was TPM works. The kernel could be generated to bootloader was almost happened and then you is the kernel device and you can be. So the kernel space is the kernel or the boot was really hard to the key's the same boot encryption that was that key got the kernel system can be used by the boot and you can port to do the kernel TPM and UPM of the kernel kernel boot actually when the bootloader
