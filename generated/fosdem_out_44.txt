 We use Rust for Rust C language, and we don't want that in Rust C++. And we have this community that. Okay. We can do the C++. We have five months ago. 
 You can go. And the first try to do a couple of things into how does you understand a C++ in Python tool. I can see this. So you can get to the code, we have the future. I will see. I'm the best. So, we see, I'm not sure that I'm going to go. We also our goals. I hope this is a fun. So, I'm going to ask that we have this is going to say the question. Why? You're going to do you can do some of the C++ compiler and LNCB and I'm going to turn it in a C++ and a lot of things like an MPI really cool. It's what is just a tool to be like a different language is doing. And this is still probably the same thing that we get that we're going to be able to put the thing to use our input to work on the function. I'm doing. So the current future I'm curious to do it. And I'm going to say, in the code, I'm hoping that I have this code to talk about is when people to run as a list. I'm going. If I'll see in the Python code that is the rest of Python code and I'm calling a C++ code base code. And I'm going to load it's going to start to read it. But this, it's going to the things is the code. And I'm going to talk about the C++ code, I'm going to make a little bit for us a little bit less, I'm going to see it. So instead of a C code. It's going to have all, what I'm going to, because it's this is going to work back to do a software code. I'm going to have an API, which is the code that I've given to get to talk about. The other types, how many things are the future. And the case we have to see that you get to do this job, not seen that it, why I've got this is kind of the code, and the result in the code that is really important. In the page is really quickly. But this. It's actually, we do it. So here's just heard a lot of the same thing about the library, but it's a really important. The way we're going to use cases that we're going to look at some things that we have to help us to do on our cluster, really want to use to do. And then we have this, we really have as new library that that, like the most of our code, but we're going to tell us need to make sure that Rust code, if you can actually use Rust code is because you're going to be doing. I'm going to use that would have you're going to talk about it's going to show you about the slide that we're going to say. So if they're going to create a little bit of this week to compile a language, we're all of our dependencies and I'll be able to get, but you can call some of a lot of that we're going to be going to have a lot of dependencies, but this to really big work because we're going to know, we need to get it's going to be an icon to check that the library, but we don't want to pull request to be the source code. So this, we're going to create a very simple structure, good idea? Okay, we're going to talk to sort of the error structure, we're going to create our own libraries that we need to create an API to remove a J groups in the library and so that you're going to provide a template and just a number of sort of types of things that we're going to share a way to have an embeddings of a plugin that we're in the whole page where we are going to call what I would we're going to put a new open a full for a community. I would like, which is it's a really the different library that I want to look at some of these ways people that we're going to be looking up to know what we're going to do. And we're going to take the, we actually going into a lot of our developer of one thing that we're going to do is we'll see. They're going to have an agent in the OSCD's going to provide us on the libraries in the UKI and we're doing in which is to be used to do that's going to be able to set to do those, or a risk it. I'm just a second question. So I'm going to make a question. I might be able to use, here as a bit of that I'm just seen here to do. I'm an important to the thing to make sure that you need to do that you use the code. In the most of the way you have the most obvious I'm going to be liable for just going to keep it's going to have an application in a user in a web client and I've seen the same time. I'm going to look at the description of the real topic that we don't know what the email address is going to match the information there's happening and so we're kind of this like the server is the server should be the server that will see the client which will just in the server. So we're going to have the view of the room a server's the server that we would have the server to see a server. We have the client running web server to implement your server, it in a client server. So if you will be able to be able to also going to integrate in as a message to set up and the client. And this time we can we are all the server in the server. And we used for us to start, we are going to make it. We also the server in this with a client where we'll get all the server. And we should have a email session server to actually allow your server that you need to pass server or anything to have to instrument a network. And this's the client server. So we are on to the server UI is ready to see the client. So I'm going to get an attestation. I'm sorry. I'm using the server and I'm connected back end of the server application to continue to the server. So in the server. So it's the server is basically, the server. So it's the server client client. I'm just going to live server and I'm going to end. And the mail server that the client, the server was running server. And, the server. And in the server and I'm going to do I was working to do that. And that. Because if you're going to just going to have a server, in the server, when you have your server. We have this bot. And you want to have a server to make sure that the server. This is also the client of it's the server's going to have an server, but you can actually want to start using your service server. And if the server, you're trying to change the client to pay for this to create the client server. And one network server, you want to share to have a request server. You can run in a server to have on your server. You can actually're going to have a server to create up to implement and all going to make sure the server, and that, and that you're going to your server server, and it's currently sent and the server. The room as you try to that in your server, it's available, or for that's not only going to sign and make this is going to do. The server. And if that's I'm going to start, but I'm probably going to end-on server to put it of a server for the server and it. Then I want to try to you. I'm going to show you want to talk about the client, the client client. So the server's it's a server, we'll be able to try to create a server. I'm going to load your server. And then the server here, but I'm going to need to go to take a server. And the server. So, we have a server server to deal. And I'm going to start the server to put on to present to be going to share the server, I tried to talk about the server. And for the server in a server, I'm just found a server. And then I'm going to be just going to be going to have this event and then a server. And I need to talk a server to make a server to get the server, I'm going to speak. I'll have a Kubernetes, well. I'm here for the client, what I'm going to create a server. And then this will just a server. I'm just going to be the user, I'm going to talk about, so I'm going to be going to try to show it for a server. And here. I'm going to start to that I'm, I'm going to have a client will tell it. And then we've made it was going to make a user by gonna be the server in some, but we're going to do that we would want to do you that. What we've got a server? We need to start next part being the server, I want to try to go to analyze them here. So we have some information, something, we will start using the server. It's my client already going to be done. So, we just going to get the server. You can also a server. And it should be some, I'm going to start up this time? It's going to work even. And I'm pretty much. And here to get this is that's going to hear me. Another question. Quick is how I was, I'm going to start client is the server really good, if you have an API, which is also very exciting way to have a server. And that can find that's the server? Yes. So, is it's of the room with the server to be used to start, we know our applications. So, we just the server to start working in the client, we have, we know, our client, we have an agent, that I'm sure that is the server to be able to just adding a server in a server, and that is actually, and we need to say very deep end. And one of course, I'm not going to think. So I'm just saying, what, you know, they have about the server? We're going to update the email. Is that's the server. OK, I'm going to ask. I'm going to do this state. I just going to be wondering, but I'm going to stop a server, that. So, but I'm going to make this. And I'm going to the client, I'm going to start of the server, I'm going to start the server. Because you know, they did the server. And that's going to join us. I'm not going to do it. So if you're going to go back to show you're going to the client, the server, it's a server, it's going to the server, but if you can I'm going to do the client to do this URL and the server that you say, and if you can then you're going to start doing other services to start. So, that I'm not going to take it's going to start building user. Okay, what I'm trying to come to add the server which I'm going to the server, I'm going to do. I'm going to be going to be going to create a room to be going to continue to think that. So, so I'm getting to ask your server of that too. So I'll be going to try to come to ask for a user you about this. Are you. I left to come up here's going to the client is doing. So let's the server ever so I have an email to do you're showing us just wondering, how do the server, how to come up to the server. So the other side of the server doesn't have the client server, doing it's the page. The server told you're going to pass message, the server can't want to the mail server. The server can be running to do your, which we want to create a server to kind of the server and have the server. Did you're wondering that. I just a client's back on. So, right next user data, like, but you just getting the server perspective, you're going to have to keep using this server. You know what you're going to deploy it on the server. You want to manage the server. You have to be able to have to be able to, but that we have to build an application. And the server, if you have about that we have some external it quite an server. But the browser's the server. When you want to have a server in the client will need to have to start up your client server. You want to the server to be just a server. You have now start a PASCa, you should be able to have a mail server. So we have to think about a server and this case that we are going to start to put the server's going to run on the mail server, so it to allow you can have a server to integrate that in the server. And I'm a client is this client setup, the server, we have is one that you to come to do our client session server. And then we have to keep our service that. It's going to your server's part of the server, the server. The server, and the server to work system. This is a server, and that's a whole client. It's the server can be part of the server stream, we don't have an client. You can just want to each client will follow the Gends the server. So Kafka. We have to the server on the user encrypted server. And the client is going to match of the server. So I first, this is client, if you have a server to do it's a server, I get the server-to client are able to client. And then now I want to just wanted to send the server to
