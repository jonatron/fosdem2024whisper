I'm running. How to talk? And thank you could you. I think the last year in the University of April JSSDth. And so I'm going to talk that we'll be talking about this to the first one we've got a project. But we've seen that we're going to have a few years ago to actually going to be just looking at the beginning of the goal. And I want to talk about how you hear me do you hear what I'm working and what our talk about the question on a little bit of the talk about the year. I'm going to ask the European Commission's going to be going to have been to talk about three years. We've been looking forward to talk about how it? You know that I'm just in the last three years ago and so we have before you know here, which is a little bit of research. There was a thing that I'm not going to talk about the first talk about the first year was wondering. There's a year, but I see very popular number of the University of women and he's what we have talking about the AI from the University of the European Commission doing we got actually have to us some of people who had tried to introduce those standards on the last year, so on the first one of all the panel and the panel. So I've seen before we have a panel of the US and I'm going to start in the Future and I'm talking about digital society that in this year. These two years ago, there was a project was an open source community and people who said that was really be able to go and it on and the open source and he's a bit weird person and give a year and they've got and they were on this year and they had a long time to have realized that they're going to do that was looking at the panel and they're going to be going to be a lot of the first of open source code in English the product driven. I got to come up trying to be enthusiastic about the time to get any point of this. So we've got a couple of this. And I'm going to give you to the last year and I'm going to show you a little bit of years ago. We have an open source in the left to start from English. Then we are going to give the open source projects who have a challenge in these workshops. And then we can share the moment. And there's left to have heard about the open source projects in the first step. And after we have an open source code team who will go through the first year. We have been doing the Commission. We have. We're thinking about 20 years ago. We have a couple of challenges and there and a lot of people who we've got a really like five weeks ago is a tech Act and the first time. And that our first step of the slides are the first person. And I've been the year. So it was asking when we could, the time, you have been using the Drupal here that was a member of the first six months to start to give us again heard of the world. And this thing I would be in the law. It will be as well. He knows it's the beginning of the first question. It was trying to share. And this was to build. We're going to start working on the third person is a very important part of the project that we've got a lot of the project. We have been doing the people and we're going to have the software in a great thing. And we need to have a project from the software. So it was, in a good practices, I've got a long time to take over and then was really just to show some people and. Okay. I'm going to look up there were in open source project. And as well, yeah, I was the open source project and a lot of view from the open source and the software. So what the technical that's the end source project is the world is that we want to develop only in the software, we're not messing with the product to share software, and we will give the software funding. So I'm going to keep the software working group. So the open source is the first part of a really about other community and any software engineer and we have done that said that was a big part of what we are the product and of the real-based software are going to be in free software has been, the open source community, and of the third month. Okay, okay. I'm quite important to talk online for the time. So today. I'm going to all these stories of these big product projects in the end, we're going to be able to talk about our railway and community of the world. So right now I'm going to talk about the world, I'm going to help this presentation too much about the tech society, so we're going to present in open source software, in the world. And I'm gonna be a huge, so talking about the first chance to go to do a few years ago, what we have is I'm going to see this to talk we have, two years here, I'm going to do.
