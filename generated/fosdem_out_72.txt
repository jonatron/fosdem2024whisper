 Hello, in the DQCDDD and that you have to say the UNIX, I said it's fast to use the way of that you have to use a lot of similar to the data. So LM library and a very common line which is where the data so the data. And then you keep using access to the tasks in parallel API to the cluster. It's very important. You can see the data model of how you you are doing this, which is going to be very complicated. This is another first place which is like where you have this presentation. You have the open source you have user federation in the data. You have some of the other rooms. You can see, it's also going as a description, the one, and also a data to use. You can be used for most different requests, which are a certain data. You can just create the same definition of the data. You can can be different resources that are fine. You don't use our data and then that has a table in some other details. So it's a very low level model, you have to have the primary level. So you define the data is a different. You can have as in this. The In the order to put the database of course, you're like a type of a row. You can be the user. So we're going to understand our data in the data part of these data is the query models. And I mentioned, how I would it's, you can be there's very easy to use a bit more tricky. And here I think here. So I have to use that I'm only have a very happy to create a project that. So it's a service to the data. I'm going on a user has to give a database. So this is in a result in the storage. So on top of the data between the table, the latency, I used for example. It's the data, it's just going to describe where you a look at the table that I'm going to say I'm going to say, I'm going to do this point of service back to present. So this at the data, the data. And I'm going to be trying to say, I'm going to start by a post is going to do it. I'm going to show you trying to do that at this. But you with the other ways that the data and I'm going to keep with this and to be the data science server. And this. And I'm going to be going to be very quickly on our data. Can you can do everything in the data. But I have a little bit more data, I'll be a question, I'm going to select in particular data for the data with this table, I'm here. And I'll just wondering, I'm going to take great for this, so I'm going to give me a good details of some type of the talk to try to work in the data and I'm going to do is going to show you a very quickly about how it up to start sending this. So I'm going to the data to have that I'm going to be to start to be going to play the data. So I'm going to be going to have to figure out of the rules and the database. What I think what I'm going to give you are going to try to work together and do? The word of course, if you, you have an API in the same data is going to do you can play on your data into the code to the data and you want to search for the data from the data. So it's the text, the data in this is just the impact of how the data, right link to this is going to it has been used to the data centers, well, and the data, which is called. So the data in the data, can use, when you can do it will deploy it works. So, you can also want to, the data, because you know, the data, the data, we can be part of the data, the data at the table. And so that's a data on the network is the data. So it's the data. So this is the data can really interesting to our users, there. So what is what I'm actually put there is happening in all over side, the data in the states to the table. And a table of the data. It's what we've got in the data, which is, but if you know this data, when you're going to draw an data is the data. What we're we're going to have this data on this is what they're going to keep calling the access from the one of what do. I'm going to the back to what we're going to the data in, which is the data that we're going to say, right? What we're going to find what we're going to be one of the energy? What's going to do we're going to do is going to collect the things from these pieces. In this table, even in our data part of the model, or the data. And how they are we tend to use case, but I don't know where I need to tell the good data, we need to look at the picture. We're going to be going to see what we're going to have this if you're going to look into a bunch of the first one that the API that. And I mean that I'm going to be done in the information, right? Because we're going to say. And then I'm looking at the data on the data. And we have an interesting thing to do is that? Where kind of the data are I think here for a method. So we have an alert and we have a very quickly difference between that, we're looking for that result, and we have, this particular a small one of LLMs. I'm going to do a better and NGI project. And so we're going to use when we will want to join the deserialize them so don't get a sort of a lot of a very quickly question. So we're going to try to have to we're going to compare the data to implement the models, we can make as open-ons, but we get that we need to do this. That's a lot of it and to say we're just trying to get it is okay, we're doing this. And we're going to have a lot of what we're going to look into the right now happening at our data in the data and the data in our data type of the data and not only the beginning of your data center of that we come from our data. But we're going to the data might seem to talk about how we can we can be a lot of data. We have a little bit more part of energy consumption. We're going to think about how we want to do that we're going to know the data from the inputs and the first step that, we can be that they're going to get rid of the session. So the point here are it's the data is going to start with an issue. Let's about going to try to find this time to put in or other day to work on actually. So we're going to start the last year. There's going to get a lot of the AI in cities data that we were a few examples of those things we're going to be on the world of the legislation of these systems as part of the context of this way we're being able to go through the important. So we're going to the whole code base product, the, we've got it's going to enhance in our mission that. And we're going to be done to go into a whole sort of the AI, this because the way to show us and it's going to be it should be so to be so open source community can be so here very important to go into better and we'll just a lot of time-Fi. So that's a lot of people can be a time to be done by using research of time and so I think about the CRA for a work in the whole part of research, and they're not going to describe that the people who's going to do that. So yeah. Do you have some talks in the biggest companies have any of the most people, which do we, okay, really interesting ideas that we are really have only part of the world. So let's the world, well, all the question was that we're just have started to know and the community is that we've been got to discuss that. Yeah, like I've been working on the big focus group of the world, we have had a lot of this year on the software. And I've been from the world and he didn't have started with, but I was a bit of the years ago we came out to that, our work we're getting the product to meet's where we'd like, get a really like I've got. So, I'm going to talk about the first time I understand the product and I'll talk was a lot of the way to speak about the new companies. And I think we have been talking about 10 years ago. And in the decision, the idea here were I've got to about the end. So I think, I was really think, I didn't just talked about how we ended up here at the idea of the beginning of open source software engineers were the open source software, they've really know, but but they were made over time like in a few months ago. And they were the government, generally thought we had said, 2023 and the third year. And the world was nice one was very important. And I was they were the GPL law and they had to be a market said, but the European Commission had like the German value of law was in the commission, but they just a much. And of software staff has so i was like we had to discuss with it was actually had every time. We was essentially, but there was at the commission. We've got an open source only one member of the license makers. So we had to know the parliamentas because they were a citizen that the world. It was that was just for free value of the world in the software only ones, but it was a clear in the first, quite best for that are not the world. Because this was not so the EU railway court law might be able to be aware of their rights in a commercial law and the directive was a policy was the law. So some companies and now meant to have exactly where why the CRA was the community to just the German law in the law decision said the licensee would be important to a German law. And I'm just had a and not surprised. I was much that to that I had about any law and they would be, because they can't have to be a time but they were, you know the law would be even in particular lawas in an GPL was just the standard regulation of 2023 to make sense and we would like any reason that that the past public law in the licensee was that was not an court law law. It was in the only the law and the GPL could be the law before they thought that they were been fixed, but the law was actually to a good effect of the law and they released through the rights that do then they don't really know, that GPL regulation and that good legislation was quite the organizations are really mean and we have still asked, but because I said earlier and in the CRA and they were very much of negotiations did this the law and I was that we had been from the court and since the directive he was a law is that we know. So we had to have another court at least about those Commission and they have a the copyright factories and he would take a German copyright GPL and they did not all just to continue to do to help us to the same market as far yet as a gap as far as they take heard of open law no any policies and they had a trademark and they have a GPL law holder, however they were able to a copyright rights. And as they're all the fact, in the CRA and they did some value to have to create in the technology or they did this law and they were just in the law law that did they had a copyright law law and the law would happen they used to be the rights in the society and copyright law that they want to make copyright, but they were a sense of the directive. But they were a so they were the lawyers to do there was the law. And then they do was a law law we need to think they did I don't know that of this value of the copyright law that government law directive of open source conditions that then then we came on the law and he would put a secret that is the GPL and they was a copyright holder and they use to have any value in GPL and you're just because there in the law and they're going to become a law conditions of the law. And then they're thinking about law doesn't really have a copyright in the law law there's to the law and they're just mandatory always sort of copyright would be done in these GPL and saying who will be the law, but that politicians are the law and they're an law they need to you a copyright directive and the third law law or the two law that they just become one's not the non-based law or a law should be there and said in there's a way up should be an in another law and they not as law, a directive to sort in the licensee who had a value value of a value is and this term in another copyright directive that the GPL GPL no license. And for the other copyright or the society of an open market law it was a copyright law that could be the license a directive as the law would it means. The law in the copyright law key is a copyright law has been no copyright in this copyright rights is a one law of how did not a copyright law that the law value, and it still exists and for such a copyright which is the law would be always be the uh no secret license and in the industry law to a uh in there's huge law was a license and the copyright key clause's not considered to law and often in the law in license license in fact because it is always a copyright law of law open commercial law. And they made in an license law law value is something the license and the law that was basically the law copyright law but most legislation of the law, but to parliament was a scientific copyright and at the copyright infringement policy law. And because the way that the directive is not exactly what happens and saying that do I got not see it also just
