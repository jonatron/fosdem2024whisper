 Hi, I'm moving that. I'm going to talk last six, here here. So thank you very much for coming over time for the first talk was to present as I've got a few years to four years and also got like today. Thanks. 
 We talk a quick talk about the talk's going to be a talk about the next goal, and I'll show if you some of all the room from the talk about the Ministry of the University which I'm going to be very long time. I'm on the presentation. I'm going to talk a half a little bit about really going to talk to talk about a long name. I'm a few years. And I started about how did from the I'm going to the last year, in the last year. And this year at the years ago is an introduction of that I'm going to speak a bit a few years about a talk to a lot about the beginning years. And I'm just wondering about a little bit about the co-source talk in the Foundation and Martin is going to what we're going to present a bit about people and doing with the back to present in open source of community of a very long time to talk was a little question in the audience. We have to ask some of the market and we're doing, since I was mainly for our knowledge. I think for people and the last months ago. I was, I was showing a year ago, today at the first year ago in 2019. Which I said, who was going to go to give you get you a little bit about 20 years ago, which was a general. So I was a few years ago. I was I was a couple of a professor at the majority of two years ago, because I was thinking was using the end of people to make the time. In 2019 when I'm very, I was one and we know that I was thinking about the time. So to speak. And I'm showing an introduction to Martin at you about the world. I'm going to Alodojo, we did was wondering about the day of the first time we didn't really know how the Commission had to communicate with a future. And then I'm telling you know why we've been wondering. I'm going to go, the community of my last year to keep going was the European Commission Initiative. I was the second aspect of the money. I would like the idea of open source energy sector, I was to a very useful moment for us. But now we don't have to work on collaboration of the world. They were most proud, like that mean I really think there. Why do we're going to contribute, it? For the world, we're going to the people to go at least I'm going to them. And I'm looking at the problem with a few years. I'm going to the panel and we're not going to be looking for the beginning of people on it was to be a couple of a quarter of stickers for the OpenAI and we had the amateur community that could get into the community, we had to make the idea of the number of the open source projects. And then, I'm going to go to be the question for the talk to talk to that were about the challenges on to, we had about the world, well, which was not just present some other I think that was working on the time or the community. And then I ended up. We're very exciting to go on this public room. So OpenAPI. And I'm looking at the beginning. So I'm interested in the beginning. I'm going to show you asked me some of all of the end up to talk. It's super sure that we're just going to share our community. Thank you today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much.

We have a community engineer, but I'm Bradley. Hello, let's our first introduction in a couple of the company engineer called 3. And also present the last year. And I will give our first of CodeD. We have a little bit of examples of my friends in France and I think we have the audience that is one that open source journalist. And we need to give you about a little bit or a little bit of open source community and we were using this workshop around the University from I'm not working on the talk about it. It was very much a few weeks and the first year, okay, it's interesting thing about the core and the future. And I guess that's not, I've been talking about the first there's something that I think about the beginning of the start with the most popular law and he's the money and he was I think that we have been an incredibly great. And the last year in a bit of the best talk was most of the end of the big talk was that was a bit about the French companies and a panel is why am a little bit of the year and you know, this talk. They may think it's very interesting to what we're actually have heard about it's this and money. And this was using the right now I think we have heard about open source in the first of the point, when I want to get a very happy to start the community that I have noticed that we had a focus on the time. And the most important thing is I'm done at the community was I have to stop as well, the world and these years ago. And so I'm going to be the time over up on the panel to think I'm not starting to present myself trying to talk about me to keep it against the problem. So I was I'm just showing something, we've been talking in the last year, the first talk that in the last year. I was the agenda. And I have been at that we got the first year ago. And we managed to talk about a couple of the years in the year we have to have a lot of weeks to have been seeing the co-profit funding and we have been not going to be happy to be sure that the day and the years ago like I've got heard a long term of time to be at the year, I was a little bit of the day. I've got a new tech world, where we had like very excited about the last year. And so I was going on if we've been saying about to talk about and my year and he was. They didn't really heard about the open source project was wondering if you were really know a lot of the companies were in the time because we said, as this year because they were a couple of people were doing these're at the companies And I'm going to really interested in a long as I showed you had the time you who, I're struggling to come up to like this kind of my, but I was talking to me from the chance to say I had a couple of my career in the end was just spent the way they were to make people in contributing us and they started to that what he had a little of the fact that they went into that there were going to the first talk was going to that I'm going to be a really an easy to talk in the last year. And I'm all the last year. Just to show me over to the last year. And I'm going to use, the years ago. I'm going to create a few words, so many people who I'm going to make that they've got a lot of the last year to share the year. I didn't know, and in the women and I was like I can we were a little little bit talking a few years ago, you started a couple months ago. And now to talk's going to the open source project and what I was going to go back end of his project after the projects to give a team that's going to share with OpenJDK millions. So I'm just want to talk, it for us an OpenJDK community. And yeah, it's like to work on, I haven't like three years ago. And the part of the only for the US and I was great to be a lot of the people at the last talk to be a little bit of time and the first of people are following the people who are going to spend something that. And I said I was seeing a project of being a little bit of thinking, there were a lot of a half of work and and of things that were and trying to have worked on and really happy to be very first of a researcher. Here was also a few months ago, I know, but I was a little bit of thoughts on Sunday but I was to give you know that I was the right time for people thought I thought, I said before, I was just wondering. And I was talking about, everybody was. So there was the two years ago was even that I was really one is kind of an open source community discussion of the very quickly, but I said, the next slide was just did a very much of a lot of our story. Some people. I was getting started to make a year. And I was at the company was very, that I really important point. But I was telling us, but I was to go to just the time. Okay. So this was actually one of a screenshot of the people that was if I'm not made the beginning and a lot of being on the community and you were the contributors to get a lot of people and then you know how many people are really get into a lot of people. I was kind of people who were doing the years ago, get involved in the first impression in the people for me on their ideas here. I was, so I was wondering when there and all of the people, I was something too? So there was the community and most of the council to discuss these technology. So I was actually talking about what I'm going to that we have, I was saying that they had one, well, but I'm going to know, who was actually think we had an open source project that person that they were there. They were the value of some people. So there was some people, what they were the, now and they got a few things that they're going to do I was wondering about someone have been doing in an hour. And I got the first and then I've got like, but we have to know, the first thing, I kind of the moment. So, I'm going to see the last year, I'm going to try and I'm just wondering, I'm looking at the next, okay. I'm going to say, people in the time. So we
