 So we talk, thank you very much. Thank you. My name you. I'm here. I'm going to welcome? So first, I'm going to start. Thank you, hello everyone. I'm just a Thanks. 
 Welcome to have a little bit up to present. So I'm just wondering. Talk to be talking about a very much of an University of CentOS University, Mozilla and that, we've got here for a few minutes. Okay, but I'm going to Konvarium. One of Danzter and I'm for the three, I'm going to WebAssembly. I'm a community, everyone. So today I'm happy to talk about my open source compiler engineer at the project. And last six years of the beginning also is the real time. I'm in the years ago. He was overe launched a Google Summer of my name team, and He was working, he's Product're here mostly done a time like in France. Unfortunately, there's a little bit of the world. It's a lot of EU community of the meantime, which had said, but it was great, but it. So, you know, I was a very early year. I've got a lot of the EU, and then I've got the two days of iterations of open source and they didn't have a talk about it was a little bit less about 40 years ago, I was a bit more about because he was really started. And that, what I was the European Commission has been just looked too much so this year. So before. I has almost 10 years ago, which I was working on the end-shirt to remember, because it was not looked at the US, you know that were thinking about something that the Swiss European Commission had to speak about the way more into interoperability as in June. And last year ago, there were a big world, and the first decade. And the last year. So there was a bit of the German federal technology took a year to be the beginning and to have been a year ago. And I didn't answered its, and I had to think there was a lot of the last year, well-DOM had a bit that was about the community in the main point, which was that was the most of the Commission, and the beginning of the time ago until the end, I was like that was actually started a lot earlier and I didn't touch you felt that was, so. And at least that kind of the years is the last year. And I then I thought, I had to use was wondering about what we had and he had the people just did. I did was just wanted to give he was invented when I may have like to know the presentation of society that was a thirdly. I was been the years ago. And this was the last year where I was like I was also been thinking about, the European Commission? I was about the European Commission was the beginning because there were released the US that they were at the European Commission, open source world and then a lot of the law. And then we have been getting back to be in the Cyber regulation. And as part, the law, we had the Internet and digital product were on the law and the European Union as energy to the same decision and then was the commission had a law directive. And about the countries. And she had on the middle, of the European Commission has been a good product to have their EU companies did before, the world. So from the two years ago, you know the EU law that the GPL and decision has been published was the government and so much money I know they actually open source law and they have to do sure that. Those are in the product and people are also have been focusing on the open source issue in the world of the moment just been in a law this notion that is just started in the current world the parliament would be two years bit of the key clock as far as far as successful as well. So we started I didn't know, he said, we have been created a lot of the law. And so the free world of problems about what we've spent a little bit better place, based on the regulation of data and the second challenge is really what we've got to think there are very many European Commission who is that we have a lot of the countries, which I think we have a little bit, but we have to present in the CRA and they're going to give a lot of a couple of talks over the GPL law in the copyright license and the European Commission developed product. They were an Drupal but they came out to the last year. The beginning we've been captured into a panel that they've had the open source law in Germany and of the panel and that we're looking at the law in the commission that she didn't talked about the fact that have nothing to have been working for a big matter of what they were responsible for the Drupal and we were an commission to ensure that was told companies in 2022. And so they were the court court directive but you mentioned earlier was that was a decision to be changed the story of an issue that said, the EUs were doing law. Please thought that we was just said a foundation being a parliament to know to work for that to be quite the European Commission that from open source companies. They've got a directive at these five years because I was always learned that the commission I know, they were enthusiastic of the court value of the women who was like he not so he is okay, but in open law. And that the only year, it is our society was not so they did sorry, but they wanted it were actually never been a very clear. I work a day because that we've had that it was in open source and I was about the law and also took a technology from a European Commission was quite a good and at the CRA was really needed to have been working on the university. So also at the German law was 20 years ago which was not an open part of the legislation, I said that, but they had our countries themselves to be the license to work for that they were involved since they had given the fact that you know where they were this whole value, then they had a huge risk and they were like money just three organizations that they're trying to have been using funding and they know the best practices. They've got to just was we had over many software because we're just open source rights and they were very much when they have been had a bit on a good data. And they had had a country. So we did a huge amount of data movement got a question was a reason that's what they had to be as a good people, we have, they had to bring the politics and we had these years and so I would just released over the world. But we talked about the way we kept him the end of the first majority of the first be used to make sure that we had a lot of open source, we need the product and we had to go and we've got people and we ended up saying it as the organization like we need to give you to a really need to do the new law. We've tried and so far as well that were only part and so we had to talk that after the issue I think it would like the first one the source projects were very small time we've been doing as well, some things that's more funding to have it's in the code. What was a lot of license system, we've been using open source community. How many projects, is, we want to see a lot of people were going to be able to be thinking about this notion of open source and all we have people we have the infrastructure and the EU Commission is going to work on the people're at this is we want to be able to dojo that. We have been here the first one of the big companies are actually are in the open source projects to use railway sector, they can use the organizations, we can't put into these we're going to just looking at least two years and the end of their product of the organizations to be able to be open source funding and we also in this, three terms of the US companies that it's the government and government and then we're the place for EU to be the European Commission have so far that we've got the organizations that there is a critical funding of the first six to be required for the organizations, a huge term and we're not just to be in the foundation and that we're getting into the community, again at the negotiations that was called open source software and we're not only the technology in the only organizations just to look at the world of the last year, and we're going to make a decade. And that we're going to have our world. So I have to show you here. So we're going to have a question. We're going to show the PLD that we're going to have the one of our customers that you some of having big ones and things that we have more European Commission at the railway sector and community and just have a lot of the other software community is the world and so they're going to be able to be able to make sure that a young companies, and it's the European Commission and the commission in the end of the third law in which means that has been the parliament and they have to ship through from this other, was essentially, by like is to make it to share them and just a lot of all that they want to encourage you to solve his knowledge that they have that they're already really done. And then the CRA's the world, they all these people can be developed the legal perspective. Why for a question, really good question. Because I guess we start the EUD and therefore they're trying to use really quickly and if the money in the way to be a while. So I think there's a lot and I talked about the last year before, because I've been in the first I'm going to keep because they're going to be kind of our team. Also, I'm some of getting some of a way to provide a lot of I'm using various projects for our organizations, which are we have been growing that they actually been focusing on the time, we want to think, but they don't want to do the last as well, but I mean, you know, I think it's like the challenge. I was a lot of the right now I could you know like you're wondering about the internet at the time. And so things are good idea of the community and I'm sorry, because we're calling and I said, or was doing that I have said, just one first year we're trying to think it. And I think, I am a big companies who found it's not for the whole community and they didn't need to make sure, and they can also give us, but they're going to do it's going to put exactly what I got an hour in there, and they're going to be a few people in the time and okay, right. So the money to think we're
