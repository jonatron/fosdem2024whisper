 The second one is to stop. And finally, we need some cases when we run in the engine where we see this. And we are going to be confused you to make the impact. And as before the first point is just to bring us to the original stack then see a list of pieces where you have a number of the type to the register between the analysis of objects to the string and be the end of the object. We're going to be with a table that is a table I'm going to be a bit of this code. And then we're going to do in the text and select is ready on this, so you just keep going to actually jump to show that to postpone this is going to talk about how this in the error that has an array value of an object into the function. So you did we go to this object to the objects as we did. So it's the output here. So this is an object file, the type is typically a case of the one of function that you need to be a string that you're going to be a similar. And so on the one is this is the string that the type of what we would be? Because we need to have an example, this struct, we want to read, right, but now we change function, but we have to create a value, would consider with the registers that method, so that I have to give a one function. A and you an address then the first value one to react, and has to the arguments, the instruction. The map, people out of the value to match that's actually the value. So I will have a class and they're essentially a variable. And so it's what I'm actually did is all that. So to an array for example, okay, so I'm going to say, we're going to be going to be going to have the object to we are going to map the function so you actually run into the table. So we have a very good question with the path that here. You can bring that you have the arguments that you would be used as you've seen that. And then we have the beginning of a given first one. You could reuse the opposite to that we have to do a map the deserial pass a deserializer saying. We can't really do that we're looking. You can actually using random flag, we're going to know what is a string that's going to match the value there might be a result. And if it's where you can do we have a read that we're going to do. But that your pool that means we're going to look at least four bits, four registers the value in the first one that it's going to add more arguments. This thing, so that is it's an equal bit more difficult enough on. But we're using a number of a function computed before we're going to provide another register this is in the index and the line but we try to the object and we have some arguments which you've been looking for each step from the value we're missing. So we're going to be the structure, we get a value here. You might be going to know that we have this. We need to look at the value. Okay to be the map that we're going to the result of the value that. So we're our object there's going to be able to think we're going to analyze here at the kind of the code. You have this and then we have a value for us a function for each no modification. They're going to select this case with a value. But we need to make sure whether we can have a value on what functions in this representation of course, when we built in the index, we'll see that we're going to deserial value as you know that but this in our value you can keep looking ahead. We don't have a value that the value that the result that is we're going to need to search and, if a value to be that. You can be aware of a value that, if two, it's a method that loop. You can see that you're going to change in. You have to use the value in the value of the value in a value so on this value of this as an object name of a value to the types of the value and then you can see what we have? So if there are is no value but it's the value of the function which means that we have a value in the value value that we have in the result to change is optional error string, which is the object in JSON value. It's what it could do is a value so after because if people are going to generate a value the search. And during the number that you don't just want to kind of those value in the value. And how many, what I think we need to figure today, but when we're those four step is going to go to have some way to keep things like, you're going to do. So there's here, it's a function. So it's a value of things like the, you know the value to solve and it. So the value map function that, it should be used for example, and a bit. But I think about the value because that it's very specific item is actually too much done in the pointer to match if you can see the value so that in a variable. So that the type in C is not that you. I just like you can see one string, you can see here. And you just look like I'm going to read a prompt that's going to see. And you'll show you're going to see the first note here. All right, this you see here, okay, okay, let's get this, which is also the same value. But, I have, this magic, do I'm going to take the structure, so I'm going to go through the type of the error. And if I'm going to show that. I'm going to do. If you know, I'm going to give it. And if I'm going to say, I'm going to run the, actually going to pick C code back to add here. I'm going to the file. And I'm going to create a language. I'm going to see here. That is I'm going to present you a lot of the table. You'll have an event of things that I'm adding a little bit here, I'm going to show you code, and a couple of a GDB, the C and I'm going to go there, like, you're going to be so I'm going to show, oh, probably to get the start about the JSON read. So I'm going to see 100 milliseconds. So here's the Zj and Biffy. Let's the S3, in Rust 2. And so I'm going to Jupy is going to come to have to create a little bit about Ruby Ruby and I'll see the Ruby 3D and I'm going to VLC project called ABI, and then I'm afraid to Fos and then I'm the Eridom. So, the first to do I'm about the code that I'm going to talk about it's the code because I'm going to talk about 10 years ago from a bit about the Vinting, 100th of the Airflow and the RubyC and the CMake and Python back ends, which is a good to that are getting the JavaScript. And I'm gonna. I'm speaking about 4G, the CripPad which is also I'm just wondering if I'm going to just going to say, I'm going to say, which I'm going to be wondering. And I'm afraid. I'm just wondering what I'm going to start to talk about half of the versions of the FOSTA, so I'm out CERN. But the most important thing I'm going to talk to talk I'm that I'm going to I'm going to talk about the other one is the details about Ruby 3D because we doing some of our C++ 3. I haven't seen the one of the compiler since this is the developers around that are using Python. So it's going to do this talk about the whole problem in this is that's a bit of the C code base, which is kind of the Python code takes care about from C++ code and C and we had the next, we need to get in the C++ compiler and we've included is going to see that we have to be a library that we're going to be going to know if we can do. It's not one of these things we are going to be the WebAssembly and we're going to have a bunch of the source code and things to be a Go code more than 1, on the C code out is going to be not just the compiler that we're going to be able to be able to show you're going to have going to get our code base and the native code. So when we're going to go back end and we're going to show that if they're going to go to start the Rust compiler. The Python code is the Java. So we're going to, we have to start working and we're going to talk about the stack. And then we're going to talk about how to show about thinking about sort of a Go compiler. So we're a lot of code that's going to talk to be the code work and we're doing that we're doing. We're working on the base. We're going on the code. And this is why we're trying to add to do I'm working on the code base. And I'm going over here we're going to be just going to start this very happy to start working on this already, one RISC release. And then we're going to work with Ruby code where I'm going to get a JBLEG. So while going to show you should come from my code engineer at that will talk we're going to, who kind of our code and we're going to go through it out and ask for a new code. We're going to give me first talk about NTalk running native code that are being a little bit up a great code that we're going to go to take into this, and we're going on. That's going to talk about a little bit about the latest version of the worst part of the open source code that we've shown in a C++ compiler to I'm going to come in the Linux and go, I've got here, because this is what is the main GCC CMake with these small Linux. And the code is interesting to be a lot of X3 and this, the next year ago is the real code DAGs, and sometimes the most of the C++ code base. So, I've seen before, it's got to talk about Rust code and C++ code base, so on there's called OpenV and so this is just a little bit of like a C++ code in the C++ code for SINV, but it's pretty, like GCC. You can ship is the memory module it. And it's a Rust interpreter should be as we need to think, for the version of the C++++ code base case does. So there is a different tools, what are different library, the C++ code is very, in C++ program code of our C++. So the Rust compiler, you can be nice compiler state is that it's a Python code is very complex is also the code, we need to think this API for the libraries and the C++ code. And last3, why we have about CMake and GCC and C code? That's what was the GCC would be used to analyze and what is the C++ might be open Bilers in C code and so it's what is going to WebAssembly code. So they are here at the core code base library? But there's important is a lot of C++ for this. That's the C++ and I always possible, this. I've been talking about the interpreter, I'm doing is. So I think about S3. An AM C++ has already two years, three years ago. InC which is, the developer compiler is a C code called C++ code. It's kind of C++ code and C code base a C++ code in France and C code project, C++ code is great code itself. So, so I was sort of C++ code. So. And one that's, we have our API in the C code base library with Rust code base code by C++. And I don't remember, this is what we've been using, we do we have some Python code management. And lastly, I want to know, it's a C compiler base. So there's what are many languages that we have built one we can be released with C++ versions of the other types of. The main functions that are not we have already know by functions, four that are the C code, which is used by, which is the code. You can cover C++ code for example, at the CF is written here at the CEG, after 2023. So there are these is just one Rust libraries, I think it, which is kind of C language is quite useful, but for quite well, many, like a C 3D4, right? Because it was not really bad. And so that Python. But you can we've been seeing. But it's the code is just for RustCF. So, but it is C++ code. We've been running the NG3 compiler is in C++ code in C++ code. But, it was implemented by C++ code. And then it's really kind of code like Rust 3DS runtime, we've seen that we had to take a Java code to generate, we've got a test is the first, which is great idea of Python code namespaces. Some of the D stack at the GCC, which is, but probably it's not by the JVM program. It's the end, but it's a lot of the code. And it's going to see we have a pretty important point. Well, but we have a lot of JavaScript type of Python, and we made it. We have some good point of all the concept of this because that we're seeing this, we also, we've been doing the source code structures that we're going to introduce us that we have our language function that we're going to talk about Unicode, we're going to happen. So we're going to come from us exactly all of things about four things, and we're going to
