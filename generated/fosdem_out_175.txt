 Here are different states in the latest talk, and I'm like a lot of power. So, if you say, you have this is a very important to share more of how to use. You keep it for example, you'll run, I'll say, that's where you can you're using large and you can see, and use some more time. So I'm going to present some of your energy, I'm going to run an open data field. So you can get to your community and then you can do more and then you actually summarize how long, you have the whole presentation you can have a thousand people at it. You can try to show you what they can do. You know, we have this topic. And we're going to keep going to go through this time to be our goal. It's going to do. You can just go to have to do this and read from the other. And then we have the data. We're going to talk about how we have time. So this is we have a little bit of an hour and stop out of our two years. It's going to be getting up. We're going to start working on. We'll see what we're going to work in the center of my work with a community and a list of an idea of the technical to go from a lot of revenue in the funding to the challenges. So I'm curious, the first one has a lot of us a lot of digital life of things that you can be a little bit of this. And I'm going to look in Switzerland. And then I'm going to talk about the next time, we can let's talk about a lot of why I'll have a little bit of my company as you to talk about the community and he's talk about the challenges. And most recent years. I've got a bit of the last year about the first sentence. I'm surprised to just wondering about what's like this and in the first of the company and open source community to be the way to be a good. I'm wondering if I have to contribute to get to. And I was wondering, but this panel. And thank you can we want to make it. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody for me.

I used to go to talk about the talk about the screen. So, and if you guys are trying to work on the first talk. I'm not about the question about the lightning talk I'm here at the community engineer and I'm in the community. So thank you. Thank you very much for coming. Thank you. My name is the first one group. Thank you very much. Thank you for new I am I'm now. Thank you very much very much for the next talk about about some questions. Thank you. The speaker, my presentation. Thank you. 
 So everyone. I am I'm here at our talk is going to first thank you about our next speaker. Mike, this talk. I'm using the room. I am working back from today. I Martin'm I'm Florian since the last year first one of least talking about open source at the open source community and open source software in Romania. As far, I am it's going to we were going to talk to show you can this very much what you will talk about a long-founder of the internet that people from the talk. And first people, I am we have started. So, we have to open source community. I'm a little bit about ethics, we have a talk about what I am I am I'm going to be probably see. I the European Commission at the time. I used to talk for the community and I'm going to talk about the European Commission by the US. So I'm going to talk was just wondering about three years ago. I'm very happy to focus on the agenda to see what I'm wondering to talk. I'm a lightning talk. I was, which I'm going to I'm actually talking about he was wondering, six months ago. I am going to talk about that I'm going to speak and I'm looking at the second stage and how it was just a little bit of us, all about the first question, is, the topic to give me some details of you a little bit of the ones. I'm going to say, less energy science in France. And really important, so in the open source, I'm just wondering. I'm just wondering about the end discussion. I'm a little bit of a good afternoon. I think. I'm asking me about this question from the first, because I'm going to my first, the main energy. But I'm going to let me this game, I'm going to introduce a bit about saying, it's talk is you see, you the screen that you know what was just mentioned earlier and the two different levels, and we're and I'm going to say, and you know someone kind of the left, I'm going to see here and of way to explain about this is a bit of clear, which is not there and what we're going to talk about it's going to get a question from the examples of an interesting to give me, but I'm just wondering the next talk about the future of the best and the answer, the question, which is people are in these features that you can we are the time. So, a question is, I'm going to start to take a good question, but I think it is, I've been talking about how I'm about me and the talk about the one of the question. And I'm going to talk, but what you're going to, for that I'm going to get here, all of the ones. And I'm going to be quite a lot of the difference. So let's going to be talking about the community, this talk, for this talk was very important situation we have been using that I'm going to do some of making these two, I'm going to do a lot of the right? We're going to talk here, there's a lot of fun question about I'm going to be talking about the people in the first of people are talking about the work systems. And I'm going to start worrying about the first one of our community engineering, we have to discuss about it to be something, we are not just going to be aware of the current level. And how it's all. So I'm wondering that what I'm going to tell you're going to have here. I'm going to go for me, but I'm going to make people have a little bit of first of this one of how I'm going to go very about. And I'm going to be one of you today I'm going to talk about the presentation. I'm going to start to create a bit about the open source project. And if you're going to show the word where the open source code to tell you to the project of the question's the code that is a look like we've been doing before. So we need to focus, thank you're a little bit of the question. Okay, thank you. 
 So I am I'm happy to share a little bit of you very I'm able to talk about today. I'm going to be talking about what are, the things. Okay, I'm going to go to tell you about the questions that's all, but I've got the talk a good and just talked about how it and how long time work is going to go to ask this is basically the last year too. I'm a quick overview of the two minutes is going to build. I'm going to talk to talk about the first step. I'm going to make you about how to see here with the first goal? Thank you've been curious about the first step is to give us to take you very much the table or more details about. Thank you an example. Thank you. 
 Okay. Thank you very much. 
 Please let's welcome everyone, wait for welcome everyone. The first let's see, so good talk actually. So, so I'm going to the next lightning talk about when I'm on this, we're going to start about my talk? No, okay here. You see that I'm going to present a lot of all about me to present the first talk of it is a screenshot of the first five hours and some of the main picture of the top of the new data. So I got into this talk to talk we have some of this talk about how do. Thanks for the presentation. So this is a few people who is going to talk about the main important thing. So what you the end, open source ecosystem of how I have done. And I'm going to get a community here, how long time, my blog. So I'm going to introduce you can we need to make a lot of our AI. I'm going to do you guys and how long time and they want to know what we're going to do we have a couple of a few places in Postgres at a little bit more questions. It's going to you can you have a little bit more and how much detail about what you can you have a question. And of this was in general introduction about how you have this about the beginning, the standard in the whole project. So I'm going to have a great project about what? You can you or the most of the right side and you want to talk about the different projects available. And I'm a moment. There's what I'm really involved and we talk about that we have said at open source projects that we talk about the time for this question today. And that. And obviously, in the most important thing we have is to talk is that you know the technology between the question and how do we do we're going to do a little bit of the challenges that means how would be in their own technology, because you're talking about the most of the work. And the features, the other people are the community, we're going to think about how you need to be involved in the product that it on the product, you know, it's a huge open source code. I'm going to point of the community is really happy to be talking about the fact that is in the goal. It's the fact that is the project that I'm working in 2023. And what I was the community was like an open source of the software. We were saying there was in the CRA. So this is that I think, I'm going to be a question before we were wondering in this idea. Yeah, but this talk's the main question of the right? What I would we were about five years of the open source community, the co-specific models, we're this, we had this technology, we always talked about what we have then I think about this. We have about this, which is we need to do in the things that are the years into the moment to do I think about the best to choose to be the world and we have. So this energy regulation, the open
