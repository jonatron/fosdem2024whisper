I'm the first one and the first thing I'm playing with the first thing. I'm just wondering. And I'm going to be just wondering, we can do that. But this's going to do that. I'm using Go. We'll run this on to the developer. So, you can... So I'm just wondering. Let's see the Dachter project. So to make the things that I'm going to happen. So I'm going to I'm going to be going to be the presentation. Okay, we are going to be wondering. So I'm going to try to run the presentation. But I'm going to talk about this is going to cover. And let's see here is the demo, what I'm wondering,. So, I'm going to show you should let's talk. I'm going to talk going to keep going to work. I'm going to talk about the slide, first way about that I'm going to be, but I'm going to present you guys and say, I have the next round of the next talk, which I'm going to continue talking about the last year. Okay, sorry. I'm going to start this talk to talk here. We've got here. And I'm probably going to talk to talk about the conference. So I'm I'm going to going to be talking about me in a talk about the first going to talk. What we have the community on the last one was open source and I'm sorry. And I'm going to talk about the I'm going to talk about the presentation. I'm going to talk about my next goal of the way. And I'm also present I'm going to talk a talk. I would I'm going to talk about why I've got a lot of a little of years, a lot of other so I'm going to talk. I'm just wondering. And the start's only a very good idea was on what I'm going to talk about this is that. And I'm a very excited about what I'm sorry to talk about this is the beginning, but I'm doing here because I spent a bunch of thinking about the open source projects. And I'm going to talk. So I'm going to try to share the room because I'm working in the presentation, I'm going to keep going to say here. So I'm going to talk about our talks about my name today. And I'm going to talk about the audience because I'm going to start by the talk about the last six months. So I'm going to the first version of my first year. I'm going to have. So, and I'm just shown two years and what I'm going to work we've come to show me. But Mike, I'm going to say, I'm going to build a good here at the founder of the last time. And I'm going to talk about the time. And I'll find the open source project in the community in our software and we're a large open source project and we're talking about a lot of women. And I'm back to talk that's our projects that is, we have worked in the last slide that, which is a lot of the world and that she has been at the first thing in the first the heart of the community and the point and see the next one of the community. The first five years ago? And that I'm a bit of some of the world are very, well, the years of the whole long time. But in Brazil the project is the fact that I'm, I'm going to show you see the community engineer at the community, where there are. And today I'm going to talk in the story of our community to talk was going to have been in open source in the community to talk here in open source project. And in 2019, which is from the community perspective and I got and I think about sustainability. Okay. I am I'm going to present here from the open source community community work I'm not going to be the community. And thank you very much. Okay, so just wondering what we're changing this, good ones that to you very small, as the people open source community is that that we have to think in the world. So we have some of CripA and I think that that this is not that we can be used in the time, so we're going to work with our community, we have done with our own world and they're going to open source world. A lot of me, right? Okay, right? And there's time, we now we've been talking about the beginning of community and our data towards the work on the EU organizations in German foundations. We are a very much very close to have a lot of our community. We have some of open source projects to impact on Amsterdam. In some large world of the project and you know, but one or even the way to think there's also a lot of the ecosystem and more. They are a volunteer from the European Commission, so on the Drupal engineer in terms of the researchers that we were like in a little bit of work in the European projects we're gonna be a lot of a lot of people in the EU model. Well, but the panel at the panel, the European Commission of the European Commission was just said, well, the world, who would be very much also a bit confusing to share of open source work to the last year. So the market and so on the tech, these stories that has been a set them in the time. And since the topic of the years until we have in the EU is a way that the Future would be something that we just and how many people are here are trying to work together from the world, how to see the whole policy is the biggest issue we want to be the world and the world of the world of legislation of the decision, in the EU law. I think of funding from the process was just three years ago. So the world is the EU can we also spend a major discussion of AI in terms of the challenges for open source law and sharing in the global rights of science and we have become a decision and as easy and not always think that open source software, many government policy, the world making the rights as I said exactly in a very obvious source but the value of the foundation to be the copyright directive in a directive are often in Germany of open source world open source market. So I didn't first law we did not aware of the European Commission and the railway impact is that's not a digital world. And we should not about that the EU were aware of the impact of technical issue and also on least for that are aware of the world, the companies, which I think at least three stories in the European Commission and so many European market is very interestingly in the beginning of the EU association many European Commission and some of that the German laws were a standard to the only by EUD team is very preshetically about EU rights and I think we had to make electricity and the European law makers and railway community that has thought only important policy, and the European railway public commission have to deliver act in the time in the world. So I said, OpenGI, these rights and you to be talking, who are very important to the only have a free into national world. And so we just the market. So first year, in the EU, in German government is a year, about open standards and the PLD is we have its community infrastructure policy perspective in the railway foundation of this railway government is the PLD were identified in Norway, but not an educational institutions in the German world are not actually different in German law, to regulation forces the end this case the world. So that it's not on German law in the copyright we also been using our science in the EU institutions, I think we have the EU Foundation can apply for it. And I think in this part of this panel, which I think the law as we're more important things and at the sector in the world. At the copyright liability directive, so we also my government we're also have the first and it's being a so we have a national railway procurement state of the European EU for the CRA, what are, to present on the EU transport government and so that everybody is an EU in the EU Act, so the EU field here is the European institutions would say is a term of public government is the biggest law to for public administrations to governments are the EU and after the standards, but I think was not about the commercial bodies of policy was using companies, so first the reason and in between legal ones in the market, the rights in open sourcing policy rights agencies, the railway and the law as we are our government law or when we have had also very open science in the European company. So also to work, okay, we are now, we are always not aware of open source software world, and through the law, I said, to be the civil society in Europe and in the government said, I think that the open legal law that they said to get a court supply chain of this law and so the value is that they are going to think that they said, probably just act. And so if this basically being a law is actually. So you have a general society was also the federal states of the European Commission and how open fact that I also for the most European commission is a very like no idea of these hypothesis in the European law. And this law in open source world have the EU agencies is the time, and I said, so you had to think this law and in the GPL would be the commission because it would be useful of that only in the cost of the moment. And effectively is the community, as the decision doesn't want to take and often as this German court and the EU would be a national data model and a German law, and maybe the same problem is only, or it's also the only just the commission policy. And if a second to be able to for the rights in the open source moment that a very positive space. And finally, the last year was actually in fact that was the one year were a company did the fact, but you know there was the whole German law that the GPL value of the policy, the law and that it didn't the directive. So because that, your market of the law law was very first problem that, and the only one and the EU key that I came from a copyright law to decision and I think we had as you know it was asking of the question. When you the definition of the CRA to have to get the first one that. It was to actually really a national law, but you know that, and the licensee were not actually made by the government GPL law is that were talking about the law and society were I actually that software and the license and they found a strong activity person has used because the trust that the commission or an open source law to make that had some copyright law directive the legislation, it happens on the was also to a possibility to be a law thought that was really a decision in license, but the GPL is actually that even because I can't talked about law is the software, there was the clear of the license of the definition, about this was any law had, so he kind of a person and he was not doing this copyright cost of the copyright legal of law, so they thought that they are been really aware the person to be in the copyright infringement. They didn't just asked, but he couldn't think this issue that the copyright would think it's a license and they were very, the fact that on the fact initially got a matter as far as the license is the GPL that the decision the copyright value, well, and that's not as the license and the license and he's the law sector in the licenses and what they won't make their copyright said, right directive. And there were actually did the license has done. And then they didn't really see anything that market companies that he was required and that we need, but this could get used to the people are just said that you can't get the opposite that's going to be the copyright or not clear. But this always the best of the license, I think that they don't know, which they should be used in something that, no really, I don't find the license, but the license, and they should be very good to be an object that we thought that we're using copyright in order to ensure that open source context that's always look at the idea between the question. So if we have to put into the license, we would be open source and we think that they have said there is the copyright needs to be you know that last one-bout is much quicker in the copyright value of the, but the CRA has the GPL and the past person that was not a directive. And I think the best society was that the way that I love that was not, in your company, there are the scope of it was a directive so that would be very old thing, but the product and there are in a license that they're the product, and I would think that they want to open source person in a time in a cost that they can be had had and like they gave us, that were very loud and they don't. And I was the idea to be really have a guarantee that were like, really something that they were there were a lot of two times in the rights and they would like a huge number of projects who decided that there was looking forward to get is that they would be a really good thing they're getting involved in the third-workers were just discussed a lot of the car and then it has to be that they didn't have on and they would be messed up to the license is. And they said, they can't know that they just to make this through. So I would look at that you know, and they've had a legal value of an American law that the copyright term has been paid to copyright open source of the public value in the law and they should be law and and that will not be able to be a commission, depending on this is, but it's the law that we can be a copyright could be the rights in in copyright public law, should be the government. So it's what they do we care
