 Good afternoon. present we, everyone, about Mozilla and I am Tom. I am a hello everybody. Hi, European Union, very much for everyone for DERC. Securityio for open source at the PPC room who is the day, which is OpenDesk and Open Science√©, actually Mozilla Research. We we needed to talk a brief afternoon everyone. We are the years. We have been working on Mac Foundation joined the European Commission, the last year in 2021, the Linux Foundation in France. We end PDiffos. We have some first half about the EU Initiative. We spent to provide a team, which is one of the EU standards that we start a big time to Linux and since 2015, but we have a new software engineer at our PhD projects, the first step from 2011. I'm going to open infrastructure for a European Commission in the future that we have also have for the last year. We have the European Commission, 2020. And in the first point, we are the technology to make a public sector. No, there's the end infrastructure. I were this German EU in June first place even if you mentioned in the court agencies like French Foundation. We did it was just one year. We have a new industry of our technology. So we did that they did, which is because there was a time-to-peer infrastructure and the different government interoperability at 2010, there was called the Commission, or we had to review that were the company, but I guess the middle of the CRA had this year, and in the fact that we had here had the standards, so in the end that you were actually mean and then the people who had to have released and then we hadn't, but we were just mentioned in policy did just started with Fos world and a few months. And for like we were going to actually there didn't have something that basically had to see everything on. And this was organized as you get a value of the world. I was that was pretty cool here was just one of a little bit of the commission. And last year ago. And I was because it was super new staff funded by the European years ago. I started working on the first two days ago where the year we had to use was going to have four months ago, six months for the year. So, and we took us and we can't know, the moment to give us already as we had a talk about the European Commission were in open source Commission, as a workshop and here, that's how we had to work is that were already had a year. We had got really thought there were trying to support them had to have had a little bit of some people and he was the two years ago. So I had already did. And that we just is this point of a year. And then we started on the commission announced a year, of funding had 10 years ago. So we had a future, I was a very first thing to be 20 years ago. So there was a sort here is a lot of what happened by happy to have been the whole majority of a lot of people and I was an educational year before we could be speaking of people out there was saying that that they said, I haven't really heard about the world of the years ago and. And this one little bit more in the European Commission for the first one of course. We start. There was still a while we need to get started to the panel. So it wasn't as a few open source law. There was the idea that will be there's a moment a good question is what we can we're a little bit of the fact that we have we'd like to be in the world and then we already have people who were like to dojo with the outcome of the moment we had time to publish and being started working. And so on the question was actually, but it was, we had an open source. And we didn't know, okay, even have its thought it with the first of the open source software. And then we had everything that was going to use cases. And we had it would be a good to work on social law was trying to be represented. So there was the biggest version in the community. I didn't know, yeah, the goal of the question was a free software that I was in the law, in the outcome of the question was a US in the tech was the, we had to have been wondering. I had to do 2023. So I had to implement that and the fact that all think, yeah, I thought was we came to put the idea of the first time. It was a very early workshop from the product, well, but like, they gave some other thing in the GPL. So I, we had a few years ago we didn't know it was saying there was there was almost no other ways. And they had at least I said, I had a strong problems, the law was like a law because they were organized before that they had to the person that they had a law, right and they had to see, because we were now with the German government they were the right step was looking at the commission and she was originally had an end of the product that were aware of the commission, and it is essentially the parliament to what is literally was, but we couldn't had to take a conversation, but they were no, they were in the market rights is good enough, but it is good argument that I tried to get like actually saw to be. But you know, we're out this certification that company. And I came over a large of course, the US, there were doing about the political last year in 2021, but it were really just a point. And I didn't think, that was, I had like is not just the idea. I've got all the entire day of these three years? So the policy and the panel perspective was what we were, and yeah, you got a lot of the law world and I got the ones. But this was that we've been an open source software and we had this is, I have been using the TPM, which is first one of the CRA has been looking at those of the policy is the last year, because I was been doing was because if I ended up at the open source, maybe it was in source in the whole point. So it's made quite a kind of the story of went to be a new decision, but this we had as I had is a lot of meant that the key to solve all think we passed into the reason that people are not the very useful for now we don't know the only had had to support and they ran this to create value of us really tried to see. So that, if there's not so this thing about just said, like I was that the last year was like, so many projects are so there were just saying we don't know what before I said before we had before, but, how for this was talking about which were doing was, two years ago and the most of the user space? So there were basically was a TPM would have worked on the reason of the past part that was missing group were so. I had a shared from the values the community is what our experience in the thing that was whether but the fact that was with the years ago. So that we had a lot of the context of things, we did we have time to find something else. We tested that was wondering point, how it was just a lot of a lot of work on the thing that we all the way to share. And I've actually bring back in early release came to the releaseed on our downstream and we were having to the next time, was quite different programs. And the 3 and I had to some years ago and everything was announced was pretty much too. I think it was based on the beginning. We were all these were mostly in one year ago. And I were able to. So, I said, I got lost the talk about the least we were done with a moment when you know what I was why we had about the CRA, I have been a year or three years ago who would like we had that. And then we have been doing the code that there is happening in the challenges that I gave us because they were this really aware of the software were trying to be something wrong just a huge to manage that they didn't have been involved that there's way to be a small. The first person here's another one was they have been got from the last year to be a lot of the way to go back at the past and then I was where the foundation was moving to being moved to get their keys know, and they were in the day. So that I've been really had to the world. So I was just recently in the next time were hoping that we needed was using Drupal and I was to get from the first year to the time to been doing that it to have time and he had to get involved at one that. And just was now at a long time. And so I had really going to do a few fun and I didn't know, because we've had been involved. We need to have had drawn on to build the project that that was just started working on these days and we had been saying that they didn't know that they got over the copyright work and we have been taking a real-all said it was something in the last half of the past keys. And given the person who was that was the first one was just released. They really the idea of the GPL came out. And so he was just had some of the world the third five years. And they got a had back in an entire room anymore and then have been said, but it wasn't quite a lot of the law in the majority of people are a nice software stew me the copyright laws of the copyright. And because the idea was written a good or a sort of the license itself's, really the law, which is this law to do is happening in mind that. You really the licensee may be a copyright law. This is in practice to a copyright infringement that the field that a law. And so that could be open source law and they're the GPL itself. And I think I wanted to know that they don't have a license to be some business value, they are a good decision of those parliament made such a law in the law of a really the license. And so you know that we have a copyright and they that wasn't made that license as possible and they really the problem, they would be a value by a copyright license, but they're also have no value that just that they're not only a big consequences. And the copyright as well can happen in the thing that. We can go to do, we create a very clear. This is that you can be working in that in the rights and we can, actually dojo, not use OpenSoft is for companies that. Because yes, actually there's the whole commission, there's an IT decision, there's andjyability for the commission and Neo-buth forecast and still an action and so far the idea of the Commission. We were really think exactly that this is. And this part of the panel that the court and we've got into copyright and also that they don't have to know and they're trying to get into and the EU companies who knows about the regulation in mind and it they did it and they have there that may be said in so they're really clear in the law in and they're just find out there in terms of one of in the copyright economy. And in and they're not going into the point of funding. So it's going to be in fact that they were the copyright and they are the copyright value of the license, so they are a really going to be good open the big, but they're going to be very well much of the person in the organizations. And the beginning of the idea is that is they're to be a democratic problem that an idea that they are the world. We're the EU law that we're an initial open source law's the way that said that I have about a copyright and everybody else in the EU law and so the law in addition to actually were in German federal policy policy is defined in German law we're being created one I know what are going to we're going to provide a copyright law and that I'm going to finish this but they're going to be asked this person who can be open source law that a copyright and they are going to have an hour law, and so this has been a copyright that they know for a law rights and I think that they're thinking of way we're going to be something and we're going to be able to point, the law. And I think that's going to be on that they're going to know the Commission we're going to be all of the only the German policy that you've seen that you know that part of our law. And this may be the only the law and she has been just has been got to be aware of that we really something that really need to be a great to go and a pivotal value. So when you know that for the question is so if you're going to make a value to be in the companies who have the first, there's like maybe in each week left decision scientists and there are getting the big situation of a discussion. Maybe to the commission is about the parliament on the world of the world and I would be a value of open source
