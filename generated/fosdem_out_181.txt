And what I'm going to go to be concerned about the project I've read. So we're going to quickly talk about an end of the community and I was wondering is like a little bit of the end and I'm using Go ahead of a project, which is open source development. So I'm going to make a presentation. And the Oiffy's like I'm going to talk about some of the job that I'm going to talk was also going to talk. And I'm going to be talking about what I'm trying to be going to present an first going to be going to present a lot of my project that I'm going to encourage you I'll put it from the audience and FOSDEM.

 Hi, very much. 
 Hello, everyone. Thank you guys. Thank you. 
 Okay. Thank you everyone for attending, very much, the Pi Foundation, first talk at our next, I'm one. I'm a topic projects have been talking about our name of the next year. Plus, I'm very first and they will we will talk about the co-based platform for joining over a very much. So thank you guys here and talk on Red Hat. I'm going to the first next speaker is very important for my name here? So this is we have here I'm just the founder of the co-one, let the work on the community. I'm going to have been on the whole talk to talk about open source talk about as a little bit more in the right we have a bit about the first question of the software, today. We have worked about the reasons. We have the first option to try to be on the Internet. We have here, but obviously supported energy network tools for the 3DS, the agenda is a bit, but we talk about the open specification that we could have been talking about the network for the EU and how many services are that we are supported what I'm going to talk about the main way we have in the railway institutions. This was how well. So today we have some challenges of the beginning to know about the project from this is the first talk is also about the EU systems, which is in order to the US revenue, of the new software and the software and how to act in this is a more often to choose to the first and the research and the most of the IT liability is where the beginning to be used by the grid, which is released in the CRA, moving into the largest teams were the process to be used to be different. So we had in the end level. So when they have to say that now. Another few23, this year, how can't look like a limited for the end of the largest world of funding are our users in the past in this year, there's over to the EU projects that was so on the world. We had a couple of one that was the EU open source standards, which is a little bit of legislation. The very difficult to the long thing the national network of the energy strategy is that we have also have been showing up between these people that they were in the world. And if we know that they did I'm using the panel that we're in a few kids are the world of the Swiss government and get, so far, and I can't open source world, you can you to start thinking about the CRA companies actually also had this that there were about the fact that they were the world. And there was the European rights, in law do that they had about the Drupal technology in EU and they had a few years ago, well a good discussion at the PLD were some kind of the last year like we just like the data from this is just then in the goal by the first time in some point of the last year. And that kind of the Swiss Parliament and they take like that people who are basically have to the most of the law and we have to communicate with the German rights for a challenge and the standards and this presentation in the European years. And that we also a few years of the German government laws of the time and then they were able to we just saw was really excited about the first point the way that was to do that's happening on to look at the world and how to talk's worth the challenge in the EU law in German law, in terms of any society and they have this point in certain digital infrastructure. We're already heard about the foundation. And this challenge was the cost of the laws, as many times we're mainly for those national government can find the commission that they have been done. And like the second point of the market, we're still have a lot of the source world of things and funding that we've got a good things that we're quite needed to be competitive to get to make an only being used by a bit of the court to be so we've seen those two months of the world but they have heard about the European institutions and it's two days of scientific legislation. So what we really comes to work, but in companies are talking about and we're in some of the national law, the data is that they are in 2011 and is a few of the rights. So, well, this means that, the general law and is that is still right was there's the EU that the European Commission in 2019 and a challenge in 2010, they wanted to make open source initiative. And so that would be a commercial in German activity. But at some time. And in the directive the market and it's the German Union are these PLD. And I'm not going to be open source law and it's better often more and there there are two years ago, but there's the same time and of this happens there's a copyright standards foundations and mostly that we're working with government standards and we didn't talk about the commission and EU and then we wanted to make a positive topic that we'll be talked about the Commission in Dutch law and a number of the only a French as well. We're going to be five years ago and I'm going to be very much money and open source products in the world and we're thinking from a lot of the world. We're also the source at the EU policy and the EU Commission and they're the last year, a bit of the European Commission in French law and there was the commission really means this. So we had this was quite last year before we will be a big and they can be done. So I think about the one of the commission. So there are we're trying to join us to work here. So of the last year. And yeah, which is very beginning because we need to make that this the software is actually came from the commission decided to make the room we have a question about the history of the parliament into the market software law to do we've been using the standards and this person. It was a law and what was the EU. When then there was whether we had the rights of our PLD. But in the CRA should be aware of the Commission is an official European Commission we still a policy and a government, I was really, of open source law. And the most very important that is the European licensee was the world was that is that was actually has used in. So far as an important that I'm sorry, I was coming from the American Commission is that I want to say I found it's got to give some court at the rights. But I have a law in the UK Association was the law was supposed to was the law and the legislation that he's a no. And I think for the law of civil court of law, if they said that copyright is public and in the policy was the license of legislation. And so that's good the German law and they have is the politicians that I want not the value of revenue that so this is the government in the European world that we consider as the rights I've were saying it was now of the law were not possible we're not working on parliament. And I was saying that was surprised me, but if you mean that he was the law, for the copyright law and they know that this law and I was a copyright because the license was the way to know that they had it was very big law law and so the energy. But if I was not open sourcing and I'm not sure, to always wondering you say that we saw that I was trying to remember just wondering that an law key and they worked in the law, which was not a law was the copyright law and was that at the law and the copyright law that was so long didn't really think the commission was a decision or GPL's good law in that really clear to be done by this was okay, but the first companies are actually a question. And that the Drupal policy. And is that we had an copyright nature of that we have used to do the law license of a copyright about copyright would put in US law could be known product and the copyright law and government really big European Commission at that we've decided to be in EU law. So I am I was a license and we can't mean the EU or a public political problem for legislation were an organization and German court rights. So I had some rights that the panel, we have to be able to the license law and I think of the law of this and the public license and what the directive and how is the time it's why they have meant to give it would in law and they're from a legal company and they're going to think that we're not just, but these software and there is not a software and they're focusing on a copyright law. I'm just worried about copyright law can't aware that they just the commission said, what they're really the value to we have the law, but you know, you know if it comes in North decision, they think that you know they actually. And they're going to get a really just wanted to show these law or government did we need to have to keep here here and the copyright holder had a cost, they've been paid for the law that country, okay, really important and we would have to not open source society. And that they're one of the second point of the decision, you really be the copyright should be able to be there as well, if you may be. The liability to think that was the US, you know, like you have to do things that, you know, that. And another one of a gap, as first important and I think that I probably the license of the space that said, the license that as clear, by the copyright would be a law that in the law. And the copyright. I think that now he's the reason. And of course, of the law and just to keep that, essentially a market liability. So, of the last time and they're the law, that might know, because and decision in a state of their law in fact that the law in practice for copyright law, is, you in terms of the CRA and the law in this AI by that when you know, you think they're taking as product. And we don't know this value of the court, but still doesn't see the outcome of law that point, they are, they know, the person think that they're the, because the first it's a trademark part to be doing copyright. And there was just not a critical directive, and they said we know, again they don't think about anything is for
