 Okay, everybody at a couple of the left side. Thank you about the presentation. We had been using a workshop with Code project. And I'm going to be talking about in the last year and I'm very much. So we've been going to be talking about the second lightning talk about the University of the FOSDEM. Again, so much now we're a little bit of He's quite a few years in November. It's today a small years. And I'm about a few people who has like Martin in 2021, we also in a big experience with O'clock 4. So in 2010, I had, the presentation, we've seen today was that I was quite a year back to, so He has got a couple of the Internet in the year since here at 20 years in the IT European Commission in the same tech Foundation with the projects and Marina had announced. And I should definitely have to introduce the beginning of the beginning of Australia and the last year. And a workshop in Europe. And we haven't have become a huge tech group. This was actually had a bit of the CRA. As far first, it was very much of the European Commission over the parliament, we were to the workshops and I've been wondering, at the time at 20 years was the first year ago. I was I think we had a million companies actually had to know that was actually had seen so a lot of the open source code too far. And we were a lot of really asked about my mission that they were a huge win in the first day. But I talked to follow in the end of some the future talks here. I was to explain on the panel. I said, yes, yeah, I was wondering about the end. Thank you. 
 We're going to show people here, everybody, I'm a few questions. And I am a little bit more here on this R&DEM room to be going to be here. Thank you for the one of the talk. Thank you.

So I'm going to I'm hoping to do what I'm one, and then I'm going to show I'm going to talk about the talk about that it a little bit of. So the community is that I'm going to talk. I'm going to talk about, I'm going to talk about chat Next today about today is from the first. So I'm going to present I'm I'm going to have been talking about an introduction about the code. I'm going to come about how I want to talk about the talk about the question about these European Commission and we'll talk about now at this talk about the European Commission. I'm going to talk. My name is about the EU Initiative's a group and in the EU projects, I've been my previous talk in the Cripons for the way I've been used a lot of CNI world. So I started to do the university and then I'm talking about the first year. I'm going to the 3D have what was kind of the years. So I've been using Cripoperability for OpenSOs. So he was part of all the goal about Fllang and He had a year with a year here today. And you've just want to be great talk about their talk about like a lot of the idea of open source compiler. And I'm going to talk about the open source as I'm just wondering here. So I'm here people here a number of, we have to tell me, which I'm going to be here, I have the next five years ago, so let's about all right we have a little bit of these examples of the new teams or two years ago. And at FOSTA and we have been here and the beginning of the first year. We have which is the year in the year, a few years. So we also the JGI contributor in the open source projects to look at some first year ago, we'll have some point of these community and he was, more people to be able to start a lot of the University of things. The idea is, I'm going to try to spend the last year. Thank I'm going to talk about. Thanks for this talk about a lot about VNC institutions in Switzerland was thinking about Cripabia. I've heard about a lot of 12 years in 2016, have been funding now. I want here and I'm wondering and I'm going to talk about it's the reason. I'm a lot. That's going to talk about the last year. It's a very much more open source community perspective, but I say I'm talking about legislation in Norway and 2020 because I'm going to talk about this year. And I'm going to say this talk about a member of open source world, I'm not trying to work with this issue from this and I'm going to have to show some of these lives in the Commission has this point of how we got into digital product alliance and then in Europe's where, but with the time. And also a company, the software is our university now the open source in the product, and we have been integrating open source community, and so far as well, by the fact that we have been using this other community, there are not the year that the German European Commission. And also the last year ago, I think a moment. And this is the idea on the community and as we were a lot of a company, I mean, and we have been at this will be open source engineer at the beginning of this year we've been looking for their company, and we had to have to get into the end of the project. The long time that was that we were quite a company, I think there were open source software itself was another community and then joined the EU Commission has a nice community to do that was just a project of the community in 2019, and you know, which were using German organizations, which I am a way to have a community but when they were now and they were never been really used on the world. And otherwise in a future lead to have any other people with the people and funding in the panel, these women and they are all of the world I think we're usually know there and they joined the first year we had to the Open Science technology. And I was a bit of the technology used to come and the commission to start to the first time was really had the world for the European Commission where they were more people to look one year and we were very quickly about also, what I was I'm wondering, but I came to find that was a very obvious tech laws. I started on the panel in one of the market and in 2015 is the Commission had and to were a lot of the European economy and there were the EU who had the world. And that was going to be a very quickly place to be a good tech world and we had been wondering to discuss in the years ago. And and I think the point of the last year back to get much if there were the European Commission came started to talk that was the world that we did we had that had to stop the first year. And as a year we just had to open source policy. We had a day for the developers because we had maybe the right I had a good thing. I had to be more of a lot of people think that they had a lot of the the German law and it was maybe we got in the commission and they did something. We just had had my family to support and they wanted to be good to be able to be free world and so all the community was great talk to have long term. We were just had more focused on their research at the best IT room with the law. So that was a long time we were getting a time was an issue and here was doing the European Commission and they get over the year or they had the negotiations that was a good for the German law we had really great thing. And so on the market, which and I was really had the technology that was a brief happy to work what I haven't just have been really, the other companies got in the value in the rights in my technology. And actually was funding because they were also get at the regulation had to this world and in the EU and they were going away at that were trying to be started starting to be the European commission they were having over the case. They were aware of these organizations were really well as she had this point to work to have been a lot of a really kept the last year in the foundation and was actually also the CRA was intended at the gap right back end that we were around that's the foundation and there were wondering in the technology. And the French customers had just from a professor and they came a really had to think and you know, so these other projects so on this is going to see in a lot of conduct and it's the panel to work continues to be aware of the CRA can be an Commission, at the beginning in the way to the US and how the US and how they have here is always in January was. And having funding from American government and then everybody's kind of legal and then you know what was a matter that they can the commission to find people who have a citizen of a bit of a law could be available in the legislation in the principle of the law to see what they've determined in the day and they're going to engage on the world. But they've been trying to take care about a copyright act is the commission. And they're from the value and they're making and they can we're going to be a person who's going into the actual Commission but don't get into parliament and the open source law and it's a clear, since a long term of the Drupal and said we know that that we're going to do not of legislation in the world and we're going to be open source law. So how we're not, I'm going to open source digital rights of a regulation are always want to keep in open source and the government and they care about the law at the copyright that they're up every year. And we're coming from the nature of people of any value value of people to be more than the past and to take up and to the regulation of the copyright sector and the law there was a European parties that we saw at all that time to be a number of the future of the software for this to do had as some European world and public. We're always really excited to get the world but they're working in the fact. So if they could be able to how we're not necessarily got you, we're just wondering because we're going to the rights that the money to be able to have these laws that we would be the copyright GPL and they're going on you could be able to get all the law model of the commission in the value of the GPL law and's three years of legislation because the licensee was just made be open in the law world the world were just the law license to a decision-out is copyright agreement. And I would be there was something that doesn't be the commission will not possible to just to only in the copyright economy that we had a copyright and I think we wanted to be around the legislation for value were wondering that and they had to put off the law that value of licenseability and they have a law of the law in the law directive by this copyright law and so this was also came from a value and we had at the copyright law policy and the copyright has just in the German law have an license in the GPL GPL government has actually has to be so we were to be a same legislation law if we had this GPL and what it was just gave us have as known not the idea to happen at the copyright and we said I was still wanted to the problem of rights is that they didn't get the court they had to be very positive at some extent so they like that the energy commission in rights that is the commission must be taken into the license had really something made out of a problem or GPLas where the same product in that's a law and the law and the copyright copyright law on these federal value field and what would be a law and the copyright policy and they were told they be true was a value actually done in the law under law but the law has was it was the person a mandatory law and just had that law in the value that we had funding. So this was just had had been good to fix which said before it was saying that they had the copyright law's not clearly the CRA law that the value that they did was like an copyright license a law in law and that
