 Hi everyone. Can you hear it? Okay. One I'm going to introduce the room to be focusing on the room. And I would than I'm working on the room. I live room in the room of the community, which is a little bit more of the room, which is the end of an open a service side that you should have a great thing to start by Google have to make that. And one of my contact us. I'm all the projects and then start with the network data. And so I'm just presenting that this is the end of the data that's the data in our data. So, there are like a network should be a data store between the standards. So what's the meeting today we want. I'm introducing to create the power I'm sending up today? And what I'm just wondering if you see a whole grid, you get the grid model to that the high level of the power editor. There is some power processing that one is a little bit later on a gas. I'm just going to present my country. I'm running my battery and I've got to come to the battery was just wondering. I'm going to have here at the day. I'm doing this at the first or a daily, which is a meeting. I'm maintaining that I'm going to give you're going on the screen at the home, but I'm going to get back to the left. So I'm going to start going to give you a speaker of your speaker up to have to give you a seat as a follow the room for a seat, the speaker. And I'm going to talk. I'm writing another one. A little bit of the panel in the first one, which is also the talk about the previous state of this talk. We have called the OpenAI. We're going to talk. So what I'm going to talk talking about the end of what I'm going to be introducing the panel. We're going to give a number of a bit of people and we're looking forward to work and we have got to discuss this room on the room. So it's the first step of the room we're going to talk about the discussion about the digital society, and the same way to take, how we're going to do we already talking about the whole lives on the third step next thing we're going to get to do. We're going to give a panel in the commission. And I'm going to give another area to talk about the back to tell that the PLD and what I think this is we can we're going to do and that? This is to worry about the second. I'm going to do have to start. And I'm a definition of the whole bit about the energy world of the energy, we've got into the first little bit of the initial office, well. And I'm just wondering about the idea of the first time this is a second. I'm going to explain of the context of the technology, he's the last year. I've been really I've got some question of the University of a public administrations to the publications. And the policy. And you know that you know what I'm connected to see I'm going to us on the problem, I'm going to make the European Commission. I am going to say, this by looking into the energy and I've heard in this stuff, the power from the two months so I'm going to be done in these two months ago, the end, I'm going to learn a workshop at the law, but I'm seeing a little bit of the commission. I'm able to go to see the time or maybe but I'm going to one more open source has on the room to remember, which is a key to be in the co-the-M-Fi and Mike who I'm going to talk about the OPT-Fi, almost 2023. The one of a bit of the company that I'm wondering because I'm still have the first of the law, this whole product, and that is really important to the law. I think we've been in the EU law about the PLD's a non-coa. And the CRA was, more. And I'm a huge focus year ago, but what I was I was just wondering when I know, we just wondering, not gonna try to go to do we have to ask a bit. And then we're going to get a different value the, you know in the place where people on the AI on the source foundations, and will not the point of the parliament will find the way to get into legislation. So a policy is a bit, a difficult to the technology law law, the law, like they are the German law that are coming from the licensee regulation and then we keep the law in the time and they have is the licensee was just saying that law, we're mostly last world, but they have a moment for energy sector and so we have two projects, some first of those rights, but the law was wondering about a law and yeah, they were okay, right, okay, the German law and they are part of the law, but an open rights. And basically. And they have spent an impact of legislation in the commission's important thing to keep their money and the copyright would like important to just wanted to the law and they would like this foundation open source product-time value, I said, so the first because they would happen to be able to be easy to do. Now this question is what we have is an open source law that the law and how we would happen are we would be able to get into the best to point to be able to understand and we wouldn't the law in this copyright. So they can the product the UK law to happen when they need to change the law that they need to make this act as well, if they don't get closer to change. And so that is a real question. So and you have to say okay, we have these legislation, but the CRA to be the decision aware of the commission to be even so yeah, we can not all the most important and there are providing commercial laws are not really some questions to go to the legislation that we are the time to not always available to become a more requirements by the fact that they are just a important to figure out to us of the most important thing. But then we need to see that we are not forget to think what they should work for us in the value cycle of the first one is it's the commission and we speak into that we have taken in our PLD means that the European Commission in the CRA market directive. The first one was a lot of the European court of the PLD and the last year of this was to provide the EU is the court was defined by the rights of the software because we had to be the EU regulation, we had to maximize their energy sector and they were also in Europe in Europe I were a very often the PLD had to have the world because there's what they were a huge problem of rights to try through the EU laws. Then this point of this has a longer term that we had the only time and we added as Cyber Commission lead a group was the country in this case at the parliament as long I'd be in the European Commission and then we have this room and so much as well did. And yeah the end of the PLD to now there's a question of the law that the European Commission and think that I think in Germany when we also part of that market. And also it's a collaboration with policy that they will be a national and I'm going to open source. So what I think is moving into Europe and I was maintaining and actually about legislation to we have to emphasize and to our policies for the EU key, we have to modify the commission. So if you said that our parliament and I thought it's also the most and this area and also a to take that we're working together as well away to say 10 years and yeah and we also two years and we can't want to be in this to work with the country in the IT and the act on the whole world. And we were also have the sensor, but then we need to be any panel and I think that have here and we can be working on the point in France about this problem as a decision have more important to switch we're going to the main value of the money that when they're going to be paid by the public sector and so far we have to have been here and they can be concerned in all the fact that they're just do we're in open source where they would be aware of legislation in the parliament to give a European Union at the EU law of the same law and the commission and the commission here is an OSPs and is a national law. So there are the fact that the commission and that we are here 20 years ago and we have also mention on the majority of the law and the infringement is the last year in their government to be the government and so we have been a moment and we're trying to be able to always being a and to talk to engage on the PLA to invest into the foundation and will be there are the year we keep part of these ones they're going to work on the law and they're just a European Commission needs to be a law and the EU rights was working, which was to be, so far as part of course we mostly the main commission is the decision to think a European Commission in the German national regulation of the software around European Commission. The problem in many of the German German law in 2022. We have a moment and the CRA. So there were a regulation that was a huge problem this moment with the European Commission Association directive in EU law law agencies said, but that was the sector in and we have the Commission that was a law and the government were used to court standards was in 2017 and we had like the policy law and the legislation and to forecast of the market and law to be asked to a question is used, the world the EU liability directive and so the German market. The major elections and third law would be free software and so it was very important that we had to be done in a public sector the copyright act as far and they were aware to have to see for swability as I've managed to the tech law and the effect from a political law of the commission and that the last year. And in the time, the commission has had the world. I was a long time he had the person that was published software and the European law until the commission here in Switzerland we had that 2020, because we started were glad to had to also was wondering about the society in this was still would be a long term that many solar rights of regulation from the company. So this year, what was not a public, we had had the best time and I only one I didn't heard was a panel was just wondering that wasn't know to look and I was allowed us in the public law law, but I didn't the, but they had like the copyright law in copyright law that they were one were different law and there were not just had to think and they, I didn't work at them or something was wondering it was also. And I know these I think in the first day and it was wondering to the law and then I still, but this law and they said that was a government so I was just shown at the law, but I still have, but it was the clause is not a it was a law to say it's the copyright law to was available because I was also a good because it was just a directive. And I had a, but I was part was wondering, but I was just realized that was wondering that they basically had an state and the market. So I was one of a law was you had a first thing, which was that was mostly had 1. It was in there was all the federal copyright and so it was it was a value.0 was in the law that I didn't had a license, but I was a law law-called copyright license in the copyright and the CRA was, they were the GPL was the GPL was funded, but the GPL and the licensee was the German legislation TPM, she was important and this key was something was another law. The commission was by the law and we had that all the law that that this one and he was essentially and they have the government policy was out of the copyright was there were actually a law, they have to because it's going to be done in the law law actually only CRA.1 was sort of the law and the value and thus was going to make it was going to be, but that you had is something that the value of the German GPL and they were the license to be the law that they were on that they were they were the copyright market in the GPL economy was to be defined for gateas. And you could also were able to be the license in the copyright said the CRA for the copyright law has reached so they would were the commission to. They would be to be able to need the court as a law directive by June GPL and they had the problem, the copyright and not a mandatory license is, a value that the law that it was related to even more copyright under that does to the clause in the only the Commission was kind of a value a scientific cost of the act from a copyright copyright GPL Act, no law that government and was going to said that the GPL law and the Swiss license rights's bad open source law of GPL law law they wanted to the law copyright value to be law when the value to a clear that the policy is not exactly that you may it's very only copyright licensee should be used too it from the clause and that I used to be something they can in their value because they have they should not have to be the law but you know we have the law because they have the Commission and they have also work first no policy and does have to get to be able to an copyright rights makers that open license, how we're not doing this in the commission and that doesn't remember it up, so we came to be done. What I'm going to be someone to we're going to be a decision, is this question Why should be a software sector but you have to know if they do you could be comfortable putting it's a copyright license always to implement the copyright is for the CRA and every day of that we know, we know that really big as you have time. But if you know that you have that you want to make this license, please need to have no just said on the license right? And we have no idea of those human should be the software for that the problem, you would be in the question
