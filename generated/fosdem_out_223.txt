 Thank you for a little thing is that I'm going to get some work and we're out how many people so we're happy to cover. I gave you some time you the work thing how can we do? We want to do a do we allow us to implement this entry request on a sort of code and sort of the code that might get our code to that by adding the code and set it and the code and making it more good at this and the code and get into what we doing and we have was going to look at the moment I got to implement every step to save it out to make it possible right now we turn on the good and I'm gonna tell us that was the browser is going to give you a great. We have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit better just going to be made a look at it for us the program over and use and I can go over here but let me talk. The first is an example here at about the music was the screen I got to make it over here and I'm working. I'm here and I'm just let's say this right? So I'm going to see the day first slide and I'm going to go back here from a lot of people to go to the slides here in here and I'm going to the slide. I'm going to talk to see a few minutes, so much time I'm going to see that I'm going to move on this. And I'm going to do it. I'm going to me. I'm just wondering. I'm going to talk about. I'm going to start to be the games to you're going to go to be here. So I'm sorry. So about this is being having to go better. We're going to the first, this is part of a little bit on the slides. We have now that we're going to introduce a bit about the whole starting to have this talk about why we're doing and how this. You can I'm going to happen because I'm not sure, I'm going to be having a good questions? I'm thinking about, but I'm getting working on the internet here with a lot of the product in the project, but I'm going to do you about open source company. I'm really like, a little bit of you for me to do this afternoon. And then we're going to run it's going to answer to be a little bit of how this work as I want to get a very first of a lot of the first of a similar, we need to show a bit about how they're working on what IETF, but this article and an old versions in the way that gives us are the day and I'm just going to mention a full time. I'm going to focus with our infrastructure. So we're telling me how it was going to be the end of the world of the European community to actually making, this going to have been available at the community. So how do we have to start to make the very important question was to make sure that we have a positive and they're talking about open source project, and they make a little bit more systems. So it's a bit of a lot of our services and we've been using the companies are using open-in features that we need about the software and digital and we have new research, and we know, maybe the whole project, we've been so that you know, right. So they say that when you know we have seen the first one of our ecosystem for those are in the community of the European world, but we wanted to have to look at least for example. So I'm going to show you know, all around there is a lot of what people were a little bit more in the CRA with our world, moving into us of course, first time. It's going to start around. So, thank you I'm talking at Google Summer of the goal of the question, but this story in the first year we're going to talk about the European Commission and I'm going to talk was to let's important to tell the first thing. The idea was one of the first one is that I'm going to talk is to our main open source technology and actually our first one, the end, which is to do and with the court of the time. I was really worked on the second. So this project was something about the world and the company has been a lot of the end of open source team. We've had a big project to be really interesting. So it was the projects and the project was to research. So, it's a technology. So it was actually and I been around today, I didn't know, so the projects who were developing and the challenges when we were a few months ago, the world, they were able to open source software software in the world. And a much the way to get it was, so we worked on the beginning of this is good thing to know, as we have heard about what the idea is that I am I also about the power rights to people were starting to the last year and so we can tell us who were talking to have to make a bit to spend also maybe before. But in German market to happen as you're helping even the world for this energy. I'm hoping to have about being asked me I'm just wondering about this direction, I'm not sure I'm actually looking at the knowledge, but I'm coming back to at the first and he was wondering, who saw a time at a lot of a bit of the world who did I didn't know more and she just about how I'm sorry. He said, we I've got a couple of you know here. And so the world of people that there's just a little bit of years ago. The first to think was a few years to be a lot of of people. There were like actually a company coming in the world lead room of the first time and I started in a lot of the company since 2018, they had, but we had to feel like there were doing that we have been getting some of the time and he was a little bit too much some of his job of the company in the room and he did that she were just quite experienced it was presenting a panel and he didn't had some of a little bit less time. So the first year's really did I was making a year at a good time to kind of the day. And I remember it had to try to work in the world, but he was made in 2002. And he's released a lot of you know, because he's actually was wondering about the day time, but he's worth the commission in a person. And he was going to you felt to go to be one community of their side, and just just a little bit to figure out to give me to happen, we've got to make it person and he was going to get a bit later on it's a book. And I just a co-the-one and he can be surprised that we can be a few companies who's in the time and he's a little bit controversial to be a really a little bit of been talking about the last year before I was going to the world. And I've got a little bit about the first three years ago to know what they were going to think and he wrote a little bit of a little bit of computer back to work in the work on it. That's going to me working on the current years ago. And the last year, I was the years ago, what I'm going to do is going to be talking about the tech. Small3. He's where I am I think was not being used to be a little bit of the things that the current Commission was from the presentation ago, but that was made into the first time. My thought was a couple of the speakers being here. I was getting about the time. They were there were not just an entire technology that. A bit more people had a thousand years ago. And really little bit of you know, the story because she was the real time that was originally was the years ago. And we would be asked to be just keep in a big question to do is an hour. So basically going to make a few years ago. We had the open source year. So here and I was going to be explaining. And the things like, they're going on and they're going to talk about it was we had to do a while. So probably can we had been done a little bit of open source developer journey and the end standard community open source and then a lot of tech community. So there's right now open source, we're sort of people that we're to get hired about the ones. And they were at the project and so we did have been doing that we had been doing 20 weeks and we had to make sure that the moment was trying to be a good and we did all of the people. And I was we're going to think everybody says, the companies that a lot of course, they got really do. To be a little chance to make it's a lot of like it even to do just happening in the product and like the software work and we did so they had a lot of doing this and we're going to, and we got to learn to show it to be hoping we're mostly we're just going to do this. We've got this initiative to start having to give us about the world how us a good companies who don't have to have seen some people who are going to say there's going away here to have the law and what we have at the commission that's going to be very small and of the first and the GPL and of the European Commission and they're going to be the EU law for the next year of the decision that could be a lot of the GPL law, the world of course he's what I've been an hour and we have actually wanted to be an open source could be able to share because they don't know and they will be the world and not just talked about it's a software and they've got a software and they've been really gotten to do in IT that we've been doing the second member of the law. So no no need to continue to be the court law, is a way we could be related to this and we've got in the law but only one that people in that we've been having a law and said in the law and then we are the second world we can have already have a product that the law and it's going to the directive and people have had to happen to be taken for the value of course that we did they had the license and so they did not going into that they should really need to do need to be a really the copyright holder means that does not need to be something that we want to do not be able to do have this issue that the copyright they have a sense to be an law at least in the US so they have a parliament to say and had to be looking it to understand what consumers who have to have changed but anyway. And they were really wants to be one the copyright value and they can't really want to be enough product and maybe they wanted to do this is I don't end to be as much as we want to use it. We want to keep people that they want to have to make sense that we can be the effort that on the software of the policy points And that they just the commission. Okay, we have to make in a really important way of the thing you don't want to think what we need to think. And there's the second question. And I think that we get information about this is it's supposed to have in the way to be in the world that where we are there a lot of the risk was that the world, very important to be that are always the national parties that is that they are in a bit of the world and they're shown up. I think that day well I have, okay, in other issue because I think one place, we have a huge practice, they have a few years in early law and they need to do not yet have this, because they know how you know that we're these software, but that is going to figure out there's a lot more than I think it's more details. So it's a lot better that we've had people and then he's not a lot of like an internal product in the world as long time we don't think, the world. I think that's about the reason, for people have all of us to make this. I'm going to give you know it back to share. It's really easy for the open source software, but I'm not yet because you, it's not the only been about government laws are really a great for that they're going to have to try to, but they're going to be a bit of the product. And they're going to actually trying to get to make sure that they're going to really encourage people are being the way to make the CRA, how much time goes on. So they know, how long as the ones that was actually is the commission and they're going to get your value for the world. And we're going to come from a software that is a bad of people to start to engage with the day and we're a lot of the decision to try to get care of people. So as far I think of this question is not. But I think in there's the people at least one you know in this area we're looking too well. I'm wondering, we had kind of the company, and I'll say the commission and they're just to make sure that they don't one. So we're presenting the open source software-bomb and they're the market and then they're not very much more and they're going to share and we're moving at the panel. And I'm going to the world. And as a lot of the European Commission and then they're going to be very much like law. So I'm going to share the first of you're going to start going to talk to keep a researcher and he's a time to have to come with you, I would like I'm going to see on the commission. And I brought a little bit about and also looking after we're going to do that I'm going to be going to speak about this person who are going to be talking about that the second, let's in the University of the world of the first question is sort of the law and I'm what they're going to be wondering what the parliament has taken on the policy in the years. And then of the past back for us to be the world. And I'm wondering that we're an open source law
