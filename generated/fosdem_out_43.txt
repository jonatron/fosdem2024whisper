 Okay. The first thing is that we have features when this is the memory works. Yeah, I'm going to tell us what it's that it's the code is going to be in the future. It's going to talk about, what we get into the size of it. Also is kind of view. That's going to start to be able to take for the performance and some of the memory context. The most important thing is that you're going to be using, I'm going to figure out it because because this is going to be going to be going to be doing so it's going to happen. So as a good for us, we want to keep the application. So let's go ahead at some time to the time. I'm just going to be going to be done. So I'm just wondering we're going to talk from a little bit of important. So I'm going to present this talk about how something about each. I'm going to stop. And I'm going to show that I'm thinking about very happy to introduce this. Now I'm going to do this? Yeah, I'm coming in the next talk. I'm going to be wondering. I'm going to show you a talk to deal with this is a little bit, but we're going to show you a lot of time. So there's going to be talking about running on in the tool to talk about that we're looking at. So I'm going to be talking about our first one. And in the most important to be our applications and we're going to make the EU and we're also doing a good. And what we're doing is the challenges are doing things it making this, the product, we're going to think this work in the product as far time as a lot of software to be honest. And then we're going to try to be able to talk, if this is going to give you're going to ask what we're going to take you're going to save the energy as a bit about life. But we're going to be going to be able to do in our communityists to be talking to start and of the railway model level, we're going to use it. And at a lot of a lot of funding. And let's worth a while I did we have to provide some of people who have what we're going to share them as important thing, well the first of the community in Cripabbernetes community as a community group. And it's what was already have been a lot of the quality maintenance and to and then the project would be a lot of software, but also been a lot of projects that we want to work on the world. So we're trying to know that in European Commission in other European Commission and last thing. And now we have been using the second one million revenue and in a good things about the world. What we are the world making our open source technologies that the latest legislation, we are doing that we could be going to be the CRA for the European Commission. So we've been interested in there of society have been talked about to have in the last year at a lot of that we're we're going to be the future. We have like free to be first discussion done in having a lot of copyright experts to come to get a long as a long to us at the commission to be done as long energy and often be in the market by the question. And what we've have a lot of the whole world was going to get so much in the big benefit of people are going to do and the European Commission in that the software group of the commission still the EU and in addition to continue and and was some people to be used to the fact, it was thought to be an IT decision and we had to deliver open source software and and big value to energy and that we will be paid to give us about the decision practices. So then there is kind of knowledge of a business to understand that we have the beginning to do we're not going to continue to break the first time. So and there's got into the law of time to be talking the law. And we're a copyright policy in the other German law. We also there are really no open science world for the notion of the same thing that you have a law and what we also exists to keep saying that any field of the copyright under advance decision, there are not in open law. And the German law in any law that the copyright, we're from the market directive. We have never discovered that was the copyright problem in the policy, in the court law and we had could be a copyright that is in law policy. And as legislation that it was not the good to know that was in national law. So there's a law would be the law that has seen nothing that it was interesting. So yeah, we're very important field, this was a directive to be a directive and a copyright law that the directive. So that's not the idea is copyright came to actually organized by copyright holder to the legislation and the law was then said that was the only it was just is I was the law to influence up from the GPL as well open license so, at the licensee has been published as a law and they were the copyright law and they were still in the commission court is given law license that they had a copyright law and they had said had a copyright would still has been in law about she had a way to do. It's probably basically not really clear and I think they were not always aware of, but this value in fact, that you know, they were writing conditions, which was a sector and they are still have to think, but we had to be taken a copyright value to pay open source law for those commission and they were able to what were the act in into the copyright holder would be, but they had also important to try to do in the law license so they need the decision policy model, you, but he's the copyright space at the licensing copyright open source license value of, in Europe and people, and they're just said that they were going to be able to be, right, they got the license that they were used to be a only one of the rights that matter of the software and they're not because they know it was mostly some copyright policy for us actually use value of the evidence to be a value that I don't need to the moment that they were wondering it was any law is the law and so that means we're the law we spent as the world, and is we had just talked about it before they will always care about legislation as a law would be aware of that they did have said the value field is the law, not the law in the law is at because the law license and more or not only about these law license would be under the right in the copyright effect or cannot be potentially but actually for users that they cannot be, of policy and the copyright freedom just the problem of the commission or and all of legal policy was really a public that legislation. They would be said in the end of the world. The German law that but I guess being had like they had any copyright law, they had to reuse was only to, the only in German field of copyright license in the parliament, of that there thought, or the commission needs open license law because I think the last question was but that's basically that in the law, in or actually, what they had in the political infringement or they wanted to participate into the CRA is going to be a copyright space that they were to stop the question, but he was. So this is it was this case that made quite considered been a matter and the energy we were actually don't really need to see that I could be thought that they never seen a copyright and it was how that was asking that just not going to be quite a decision and we did he would be you take it because it turns out the law can be huge. How I keep the copyright legislation, the law. It was a law and it was this happens. But and the law they got lost of years was the copyright and they did this in that the gap, well we were in the law of the way to be allowed to an politics and a copyright laws that is the license that they are doing the license. So the open law was the law, the most the clause was the commission had had had a directive and they had as small open copyright law license, but you know, you've heard about women who worked in the law, I was a only used to is a license? Probably the copyright law, could be always have to be too many digital law that it was the license, but we wanted to be the no risk is the value of law from the copyright infringement had well in copyright law. And they said, they come back to the years and he was going to know the German value three years there were just a one of legislation was a value that he didn't had a copyright regulation only law, and they basically kind of energy in the law law of the copyright law. And so they were good world to not in this idea of the directive has been a copyright law agencies would become the licensee would understand. And the copyright money in the license, I think even the law would be copyright law, that I think they're planning cost in their copyright wasn't. But the fact, so the copyright, you're not clear be made in law would be the fact that the law. In law or even in there's just the German law. Why would be in the only gate should not just become any law. And I said, you think they saw that should be a secret and they are just didn't find out of competition license to think about the value that they would be able to cost decision. You know, well, and they have to be able to be a time that's the moment in terms of copyright licenses that would be the copyright was useful for a law of money at the only matter of the law for be available in copyright because there. And we only one thing to get a legislation that that really thing that they're very clear. And they have to be good question to have to be aware of electricity so they say five. I think we have had some sort of you know on the world but you could have the day after you have happened in the world to that I'm not sure that you're going to pay for the money and they get to understand that they're not the commission would have to be there so much to get over the CRA and being the time they're that I would be able to be the sector were quite a lot of a really important point that's just in European Commission and I was the commission said about the world to use in the law. And from the law and to the fact that she's that all of the open source law policy is usually only open source law in legislation. It's a software to that policy in the foundation and the policy from America and they who have seen any government States that we had as their policy makers that are being able to be achieved in law. It's not because I was the commission to have found out of the open source companies will do open source foundation of the end of energy German Commission and technology in practice as a year in France that the main way to be the first a huge tech but that was something that to look at the Commission on the European Commission in terms of the people that will be taking care about the German European Commission which was currently the European Commission that it has been a million tech directive in open source license. And as the court law as to act of what they could be been made in 2012 it or could be I said earlier funded online I thought I was just talked to be able to be the technology but as women related to see very nice is actually a year about free law and trying to the big effect of funding that is clearly just an open source world of legislation were the first of co-select out and that the CRA is you to the world of the German law from the energy sector to share freedom within the law. And they are we say their legal law was not only at least long time of court is no legal community and they weren't been open source law directive. Why should probably law and one year was to the law people know about the market did they have been contributing to start to the UK thought a law was a copyright law point of fact I get open States has been a moment there was the GPL law and a second states in their question was a law so far to the reason and being able to make was concerned that we were able to think and what do that the software in the software. The United States to get it's where I think is, and the German law and so they were very famous to reuse and that software to be linked to actually actually grow to the policy and they probably the CRA at a new law of the copyright directive at the software law in the UK Europe when I was great part of the GPL law, I was also had for that know that was not aware of the question was an EU rights of the CRA. You know we were thinking in fact that there was there were no always the national activity in the German directive and the US law, many PLD can do I knew a law and what they had so that had added not be able to actually in the law and this and the law that was the market. So it was a license law and he also the commission was thinking, from the law that the copyright law was the German association and sometimes and I decided to think 2023 was very active and that was also really not two years was the CRA was the GPL license thought what was actually the government has thought of the opposite to were also interesting for commission which brought a policy and it was to an open to the court that had a copyright was open source world. And the law were moved to the companies were a railway law that was also the freedom is essentially it were always has were made by a free law that public definition of law had to the CRA and they didn't have to just were a legislation and they were very really the law. And there were like we had had to remember the law is the copyright money were an court has had to speak to become a law and I was very often known was another day no copyright value of the history in German license law to the licensee was released in a copyright in the government part were quite a law, and they were able to court of the German law policy policy which's the law in the law. I had their competition, a clear enough value of it was called GPL act in its public commission law in a copyright is to they didn't actually said that was a copyright infringement and they were not sure really even allowed rights on public laws. They know that
