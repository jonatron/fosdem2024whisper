 So a very little bit of a bit of a thousand, you're doing this demo here. We have a table. It's just a little bit more complex. So you can see a look up a quick bit like a little bit, I'm not going to look like this. My name is a blog, was we had an image. So I'm going to be running an open source? Because I'm going to show you an open source project, which was wondering about how more for getting into one and I'm going to go into the new one question was that the documentation. And I'm going to be a very quickly explain if you're going to look at the web community of the room as well. And if you're going to see, well. I'm going to solve a question, you're going to talk about going to find the one. I'm going to be being able to introduce the right. What I'm looking at how did I'm going to show the best to have this about how did I'm waiting for us what I'm going to be going to try to be using. You don't want to go to have the future. I'm going to think of these two questions? What we're going to talk about accessibility? What I'm going to talk about the side. And then I'm going to start using this. So I'm just wondering, if you're going to download the speakers on a web server. So the laptop is you're going to change the top stream that I'm going to use this server, you. You're going to do this request. It's going to come to run a server, but you're going to have some of components, how you want to modify the data and then you're going to make the server to look at the server. So how you want to start to share that you're going to be all your server. And it's going to go to allow you're going to do that we're going to go on the internet. It's going to the server to do.org. It's kind of this. So I'm going to have put the server. And now going to run our server. I'm going to keep going to send the server from to the server server of all of this work on the server, what you will stop. And also need to start the server and sends a server, and now, I'm going to come back to keep going a network or they're going to start running this data over the other. Let's going to talk about. And. From the server inside of those will end, I'm going to stop sending it online server to share the server. And I'm going to us on the prompt to wait for the server, I showed. I'm going to, I'm going to work. I'm writing an email server or I'm going to have different server. I'm going to do that to start to switch to have a server. All right. We have the server to do the server. So I'll see the client, we want to tell us. Let's going to go back to your server end to start and send a network that you can just want to the server and you want to the client service client server is supposed to the server for instance, and the server. And then you can then you know that. And on the server. You a server? The server, if you can see that this server doesn't connect to call it's available. And the server's something I want for the server to the password for which is on the server, as well, I basically an server, which is kind of basically the server, they, or they are just use and they're like a browser, so they do that still want to use servers. So then they have real. You can do not have to have to configure that for the API. It's also the server that we have the server to have multiple services. So, that obviously we have. And we want to use to make a end up. But it's the client will have a user. And this is very user is the server client server is a server, which is a service service that's about the user, the server. And then that's what you'll go will be here. And so that's the server or we're working this request server, that time so that's a client server, you are the server to go to get the server. The DNS server. So that we have, we have the in our client client, we can just saw to the server to do. And so on our DNS application, we're going to create a server, which is it's going to have to start writing client interface to add to look against the client. And then the endpoints server. So when you have time you have to have the server with a client, that's going to another server. So, and client from client from the server from that's going to if you just want to store your server calls, although you want to introduce the client API server to go to set up encrypted server at the DNS server, which can actually comes to the server to that the server server. And we're the server server on. But what we have the server, we want to connect to specify a server to the server. When we want to service server, we want to integrate on the keys on every server. I to client. Yeah, from a server and if you can go to have this client client and start up to that we want to browser to a server or server in a server server server. So the server, you have, a server, the server to server. Maybe you have one server. You're waiting for the server, which you want to client, which is going to remove the services to check that for listening back to the local clients, on your server. But you can end of the server. But if you can probably have any server cache or they're going to server or server to send to do them and you need to the same request. So server, if it's a server works so you take a server. And if user server up. So it is mail service, it's a server. You just one server server and you need to go to have right for that in the server, we have a server. In the server for the client. The server server that would want to the server to start this. And this side, we'll be able to apply, right, it and if you actually have a command that's like service, it's going to use. And then going to the server. And your server, it's the config. It's going to see that's fine to be a server and that would be going to be encrypted. We are going to be able to be able to be using the server. We are seeing here. So we have that allows app, we want to present in the server. So you to make sure that. So that's a TPM. And in this is this part of the server. We'll start to be the client at the client side to your server. So, the server. And you want to do that. You want to just want to go to make in front end user in the server. And then we are trying to the client. We need to go on the server in this client, you can do the server. The server, in this server. And I tried to be able to do this time that, it's the server. I can choose the server with a server, you. I'm just need to do. We need to make a server. So the server, you have the server server back to have to the server. We have its server that data server in the server. Okay, but, at the server server client will have this server to run, that. So it's not the server, it also the server. Okay. You have some server. But, but you need the server, very easy to have four server to be able to do this. You don't have time. And the server for example you the server, if you have a real server or a client that's the client client, here. Or your server server is part of doing. So, your server was in that I just put back end client's very good server, that I'm going to look at the message. Again, again, I really, I work for our server, I'm just keep building on the server. If I will be able to port. I'm thinking, there. Sorry, that I'm not asking for the server. Yeah, if I'm glad to do it before. So this room to kind of a bot. Sorry, I'm going to do. Just the server ID, we want to do that. What we're working. I'm going to try to start with the mail, so I'll give a real, we have to run DNSM. I'm going to be going to show you a presentation. I'm trying to present I'm going to use open-to-ups in a laptop, the application, okay, we'll be able to build this. I think we just the server because we want to work on the server, right side of the server is the user space. I think it. So, to show you today. Okay, I'm just a to the server. If it's, please give us to a client to open-to-ups that's a client server and not a server to have the server in this server. We also got it. We prefer to show us. There is a client side, which is also a mail servers. So, the attestation's how is available. I'm going to, we have to know exactly the user providers. We have any questions to talk about our work on the mail service. So you know it's in the server. You can have a client side, of your server, for you know, for this, ask us, for free server, but you can do want to happen to worry of course, for real ID provider and I'm going to see what I can are going to create the user on this, and that's important is actually what we have had to the server and we had the server. So, we can you just skip my server, what they made the server, we had to do that were using a client will lose your server. That's going to see the server. But what we are what is, all we remember the data set. There are the server, we have to do, a server. Why are these requests? The server, we start. So, we have to trust the server, we have the server, how we have, so we need to implement it the to verify the server. So I also started working with the server. You need to it's a server for example, how this point? So, it's a server to, that. And we have a server. And the server and we have this time for application's the server to take the client. We have a server. We want is the server. We need to go to take the server server. So, and the application is the server to basically the server, we want to make sure that. It's server, we want to get the server, is the cloud server of this one DNS server, and you have two. So this room, how I also the network? So, we are here with the DNS client server doesn't want to connect user server, we have a gateway to it's using the server. So you want to the client for the server and we have to send for the DNS server. So, it's just works. And now we have some, we have all the server. We have a client server as an server, we have to look at a client, we need to need to start you. So you need to send the next address. We need to end user, we have to do this client update client server, and then we have to call the client, we are connected, you can only for example, to start the client and then the user IDP of the client server is here, and you need to see how server, we need to have a server. We're going to log pass it, and that the server to user providers, that we want to deal with a server, you call the client server to have of the server to share the server. The server, the server. So, PT in one. It's the server and before we need to try to get to work on the server to have. But as a client, we also the server, we have a server. Then the client demo. So, we need to send the server over the server, we need to send the cluster. We want to the server, the server to an server, the server, how we need to connect to do we try to your server in a server, or server? Okay, we want to change us to the server and this client service server. Right. It there's not a data. So our server at the server to request does not going to the server. So if you have the server? Okay, you can also try to provide this page. Okay, we have to add, okay, so this to what I'm going to create my server, I'm going to show you, and if you a server to do we have the server. So, we are creating an application server. That's going to call an server server this server, but it's the server in a server, it's the server is a server to have a server and run it's going to get the request, the server to the server client or you already want to the client inside the end up and client application part of the server that you have on. You can come to have an it, the response and then the server will be the server, I'm going to download. So it's just to come from the server and use time. You have, we have this client, the client server side of the server to to server with the server. And the server, we don't have this. So the server, yeah, but I need to use for example. Okay, I'm going to do some room. So, now we have the server in this demo, the server. Okay. So, the server protocol you know that means you want to do another server. Yeah, the service service. You can be also use your application, can create the right now. The server? It's the server to be a, do with a server. I don't know what's like? Well,
