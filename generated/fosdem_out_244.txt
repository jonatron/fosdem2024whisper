 He's attending a day in the big introduction. I'm going to get to this. I'm going to be like me at this presentation. So I'm happy a really able to show you some other people together. So I got this talk. I'm going to be wondering why you later at FSF. So in these are the time. The first version of the OSPEG port and I'm going to talk about the hardware and a bit more than we want to do, like, how to get to do we do this today. So I think it's when I'm going to be able to create a memory state of the state of the implementation of the end of the difference. And I'm going to try to generate this case because it's going to be able to do something that loop. It's going to do. But I'm going to build a log to say, I'm going to see how this page in the video side. Right? I'm going to go to the display. I'm just going to understand all from the video. We have to bring back to the next. I'm going to show you where you've got an agent that a laptop to look at one. And if you go to the end, you're going to the server, the browser, as well, you're going to make that's a server to talk about using the client. We have a UI server. But yeah, we're going to do that. So, if you're going to keep writing to be a server to work with that would look like to have a client and look at the server. And we're going to show you're going to get that we've got a server. We've been using to have a server, we go to actually call you an client service that and then we've got the server over the server server. So we've done through the server. So, we're now have a client. We're going to end of our server. And we have to be going to try to start playing it out. They're going to be looking at. We're going to have a client page to start this server. There's going to help us. So we're going to start and to pick one application at the server with the server. And that, I just made some questions to tell you. So everyone. Let's going to start. That's going to talk about the client. So we're going to introduce a prompt, well to our provider on, the server. And what we're going to be able to ask a server? So this is a server? You just an attack for our client. And we want and I was using the server server, we have a way to end of the server for a client server. So, some links. So we have a server or EID, the server, we have a server servers, we've got. So we have to the server side, we have the client is on the website. I guess. When you can start a server, I might want to say it as far to try to create a mail server to your servers. And if the server, the server, I'm not good discussion. I'm gonna try to start and to the server, this server, we saw I'm doing for the server. So, we have it to stop. And so this Go to see here. And then we have a server. So the server's here are using this one working room in the server. And this will try to be using a Web's the request, I'll just wondering, but please. And here. If you just in case, you've seen the server. So the server's always do we just want to bring your server, how it to their server, we have a server that we're just. You're gonna the server. But what's going to pull a server with a server. It's going to access to have to the client. We'll get the server. And this here, it's going to a server, we've just wanted to be able to be the server. And now we're a server to tell us to start to make an application stack. It's going to make an client, we're going to send us to our server in the server. And next server's going to the server to go to your server. And then you can also need to move down. So, we're going to the command to an room. The server to the server. I'm going to me. The server. And then your server to the server's a server. You can start and server. You want to client. And the demo, if you can start, you would talk about that's the server to go. You'll see, which is if you're going to a server with this process, we're going to have the server. So you're going to see all very, in end up, there's already out there. So, what we have you're going to have to go to say, right? So it's the server, okay. And if the server, we're going to read. So, no, then it's going to do we go to know, the server. We are going to do this network, we want to be able to go back to our S-im. And we're able to touch. We're going to continue as a network that we are using a set up to make it in a network that we're going to develop an end this whole service. So in our certificate provider, this is part of a few main goal. So in RTC, we all, we need to talk about using NSSP. What's how we want. So, for the slides we do the new servers, we have to remember. And right now this conference. We're going to just a new client is the server has my presentation to be able to be able to create a little bit of this information. And then we're building on the widget. Today, we're going to implement it works. And we have this. So we're being the application for a client, where we're going to support for the work with the room. And then we've done. We're going to be the server works. We're on. We've been able to start the next time for the room here. And when you can really want this one minute, we can have the server, you're going to have a server running we want to have a front end, of the server for our client room in the time, from the server. And that's the server and it's getting the server. And again. So we'll present in the server. So, like a server's pretty often in the server, we can contribute to get the server as a server on top of my server. So now we have some questions? And anyway. We have we're going to the server here before we kind of our server who are going to pull request, and we're going to change a client, and. So please have any server, we're trying to be here? Okay, we have that email client side, yeah, we have to have a server server server and we just a server and we want to add to fail, we're just want to check out here. Okay, we're going to going to use the server to start the server now going to expose our staging data. So this and we're trying to start the user. What's going to, like the client server we have user agent in this server to have this DNS server. Then we want to get the client to the container service stack server that we have a server, we can find the server. We don't implement the server service we can create Kubernetes and open that like that NScripts, that's a other services. We have a video into the server we only your server is going back to do we have an application, we started. So the server to talk is going to the server. We have the server to start the client server, the agent may take ready, we have. Okay, I'm going to try to find this questions. So, going to get to take this. We want to get our end to share this from the server. We want to send, we write a client to the server. So, do this room to basically the client part of the client perspective. So we just running there. When we're setting from the server? We're listening to talk about my client side. This, hello client to the server. I'm going to introduce us here. So you everyone. So, well, the server, I'm here I'm going to say, if you can do that the server. I'm going to introduce the server. ICTP server, in a server, it's running on. If you're going to, the server. And then that was happy to go for our back and continue to open. And now started, if you know what we've got the server description is trying to go back to the server? So, we have any server, for the server. So we're working with the server agent, the server, you basically have user, and then one server, you know, and you know, for the client. And, that's the server, the client. So, because the client, we're open the server, it's the client, but, if we're the server, you've been, this server doesn't need to start the server for instance, but why we want to talk about our server, the server, we are the demo side, we want our server with clients, we will end, because it's all the server. So what we are the client's actually we have to see today. And, I'm sorry, we. But, I'm going to have one or speaking to show you this command to start the server, the demo to see here, if you're going to start using the client, like here. When you'll touch client, it's going to WebKit. So it's a client server to be doing the server side. So, you will be familiar and this again, I'm going to start to have to plug in the server. So, if you have the user for the server, or just go to the server, we're going to start there any one server. And, you're going to do our server, we have a client. And, I'm going to do some end, we're going to speak the client session and I'm a server here. All right. You see the server to stop it's just a next part of all want that we have one to go to say, if you built the mail, what is also want to integrate. So this is the email server that's going to use to authenticate with the server, and now is interesting to implement the users. If you'll be like this. So, you. And if you have a RESTP server, it. Let's going to be even the API, you don't want to have some more. So, like, I'm going to support for the server, but it's a server that's going to be all the server, right just a user will want to be able to make the server. This is also helps you have those customers. If you want to talk about a user has some sort of the server? And then you can use for using-based server, like API. So basically. You can be able to see where the server and then have a server, well, and then we're going to see, why I'll go into it's going to what is, I want to make the server. It's not for that we're going to test with that in our server. I'll stop one side, but also want to talk about how to get a user. So just wondering, a client can I'll find the email server. I'm getting going to the server. And it. And I'm going to be a client, but I'm going to show you right now I'm going to ask a microphone we're going to talk about user and I'll demo server, but the server is going to note here. So if you can show the server. So I'm doing the same user, this one, we need, we have a client and, I've done to start to see here and here. But the server, I'm going to start. And one, I'm going to do this is going to go to talk about the mail server. Then you are the web server. So that is just a container room to this in. And then I'm going to do that, and then in the server to go. And then the server is telling you have that the server. You're going to the server, why you are all going to start. So the server. And the server's going to see the server, when you're going to draw the server, you want to have the back end user using a server. There's the server, the client is already using mail server, you can see, the server requests, this API, right side, you're going to give that's a server, we can just a server up here, a server and then it is an attack to send this, or it's really the right, but it's really available on the server, for example, because the server will not the server. And the server is the server, but it's a server, and your server to go to, but it's going to that makes you can just a server. And then, you know, obviously pretty fast server, right, your server to get the server, so the server's the client services to a server to a server. So this server, we also gives the server, the same server. This is going to the server, but it's coming very useful to your device. So, you can already have to start and so on the server. And this service to, we have this cloud. So, we have some demo just a good to be able to create a server, but it's the server, we have a client that is going to identify the server, where's going to use, that you're coming here and also the client, which we have some network, the server we have the server server end, which is okay, so many server, but it's a, we have two, for example, so that open, for example, we can then we have to just the client server. Cool. So, so, the server, we'll end the server, well, we have a server.
