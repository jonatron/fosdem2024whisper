 My name of Google which is a new project called Open VeralF. And I'm going to introduce over the first as I'm just wondering about that. And since this is that helps us about a third two years also built in the community and how I've been on open source project. So, we've been about how in the world, we're describing a few months, we have to be a website. And in the organization. So, I'm going to be aware of the end of the OpenJDK. And I'm going to have asked some open source companies who have one to write a little bit of OpenJDK and that we've been having heard about a lot of other organizations that are doing other people who have been doing with the project. And the other ones I'm going to be a little bit of how people who do we move into the fact, how we've got in a little bit of a little bit of this on the organization. And I was wondering, sort of the other thing that that we've got a little bit of a very easy thing in the project. I've got a lot of people around. And these are like to do. So we're really, how community have been getting some people to understand how much more about what we've been working with our company, has got this that I'm going to open source code over and I'm here at this talk, it for me a bit about that's really a C++ project to be a really for us for the community. So it's okay, and I'm pretty much. It's going to make there. I'm going to work. Okay, what this is we have been using for your project and why I'll be great. So I'm going to talk about this. I'm now. I'm a lot of the one of you. So I'm very good question, I'm going to talk. I'm gonna look why you. I'm going to like good wondering, but I'm going to talk to talk about in the most of these people could I'm just talk about we've got a bit of the ones and actually heard about this was about a tool and the last year ago. I've got a very quickly thing about here are very proud of the most of that we have been heard about the University of the day of European Commission and actually was kind of Project came to talk of their Drupal, but it was kind of a bit of went by the community to she was a lot of the good talk. And looking at the first time. And I am I was a lot of like now, I'm going to I was being actually kind of project. I was going to work with this as an open source project. I was very excited about the last year yesterday. And I was here is the University of Fosa, and because nowadays. I was someone joined. And I was the European Commission's the fact that was the moment a little bit of a little bit harder initiative to make it was done enough for years ago and everybody. I'm just wondering about the Commission and my first one place and Fos. There was about software engineer at least the years ago. So this objective as the year, they had to build, but they did I was because the software and they were going to be the end-scale developers in the world in France. And in the government that it was also funded by the tech, the first day that what we could be able to make it was just kind of the European Commission was just a scientific society because he never had. And this year, I had a long, but then from you had to do other companies and I was wondering, but I was like 20 years ago. And when you thought, you would just know from the companies who was asking that was removed this story and they got a work a lot of being the market and had to the CRA in the moment is kind of the project that has been thinking of the last year ago, who feels like you've been at the world. And what he didn't. And so somebody heard about because they can that you know about legal government as we've been there were the world, they knew this is an Australian world which was the most of the market that we were the future and they're going to be forgotten the commission we had one of all the world of these days that the policy who made by the panel was really just wondering about the fact that we had to have the European Commission's a lot of that he had a researcher and we went into this year, moving big thing was just trying to the problem to the conversation that would get to have got an open law and the end of this law would be quite a law to have worked on the people on this really being done, and so much and I'm not as in terms of the year, but it was the commission was super important that we have been at Filingual law law and now I think that you know that you know the CRA had to come to need to go to be a way to realize that is not in the world of what I hope that I've also wanted to have to continue the beginning. You know that there was the European Commission found out of the negotiations and we're just had. And here is the open source world that's important of court and that all those are the CRA and in the EU funding that can be the last year. And the EU. Some of course the commission. And it's basically is a good solution. Everyone remembers only why is because there's part of the law in the first year. And which is why I guess. So the license can we're a term. We should we have a product that was the software that we use of the commission at the German community about the copyright law that we were now in the market and it was wondering that we could think, we don't have a directive because we've been doing it was wondering how we're about law in September, often do you know it as an impact of the European Commission all those issues it? I think it's in this problem. So I think it was copyright law and what we started a that all, to be we've just using, there. And I think, there's a question was a copyright law but they have time and they're really interesting issues who were all the law making in the copyright law-generor, which is an open source AI science community was really a standard or a copyright directive basically and was a non-shirt on the GPL policy and it's at the government in the parliament and they created by the way that regulation to trust would think they were taken in German product and so first EU law they were an industry law they take down to keep a way to this in the whole law and they did that people to keep the law and they knew that people still have never do, and they know that it and we need to be making and you know what they were originally feel like, let's just, right? If you know, you know what I've got to offer it open source this but they and our software to be the license and they're just have as a great software. And this point of course they could be very good. People don't have that if they're asking that they had to have more interestingly, they like someone must not a time from a transparency value of money can always keep in the GPL law to think they're not able to be the person who's the market and if you have to know what they're the public sector act it's a good to understand was to talk. And for people were interesting things going to get the world and just wanted to be a commercial law that they should look at the license to train that in the organizations could be enough directive in the PLD and they're going to do that they're not as well. We were using the commission will work on the product the law and they want to figure out the last three years and they don't think we know that. The copyright issue is the decision and you know what we're going to be in a law in the value of the policy in this area that we should be a problem but we've got to do we will be able to get away around. I think about the work now is I'm going to do this to be there. But I'm going to be a decision and the energy model is a big level in the license being developed by energy we've just felt in and we're really seen in the legislation that we're not going to interpret that well and we just mentioned that and what we are going to get the long and we said we're going to think that we'm going to be going to come on the law and we've been done so we have a regulation now at that we're going to keep doing was going to skip. And then to do very quickly to do better and we've been doing that we have shown we have been working together and we're going to have a lot of the best practices in data and they're going to be surprised about their data we're going to be on a very aware of certain market. There's always to join us and trying to be to deliverability policy and they're going to do this legal product and they'll be in into us so many people who have enough to be able to give money in a different organizations and you can't have to get into their funding that the freedom up to keep going to be able to be a great to start what we're a lot of the world even possible that we think to come to take rid of work on how do in that we will come together to us and open source communities and get this thing in the different organizations already the license point we have that do we're talking about like the people and for that we're very much about their engineers to our business and we are trying to get in that there in a lot of open source we can be able to solve a lot of this person who did well better and also very good group into that have been had to keep just been on. So I'm going on the word of the tech, what companies that's the first and so like all the things. So if we're going to be worried about the right. And that we have said before we are we're going to have to have all around to look at all have to be able to ask the EU, what we are we have to participate in EU, we also want to do is what we have here to do we want to do and invite you're looking up asking people to follow our work together and that we do is we have to apply a community as that we are taking a very important and keep open source software that a full product and we need to learn of us to try to be able to their people and we have to also just an open source project and we are just identify the IT service development and we try to do open source and we are doing this. And if we have, give you're going to make sure we're going to make this open source software as faithfully as well. So also the first we have any reasons for a way to get out of the project. And we're going to be a big contributors to really a lot of contributors to have as a better and to be able to be some people in the product which we're going to be the question that's the market. We need to build a question and that they have had this well, but they're like've been doing open source software that can be something that like the community, you may be really think there are like much harder than you know where you know open source software is there that it's a web communities and then they have, and the whole project there. You know. And we can to have to think about open source, as community bases of 20 years and we're going to get into those projects, but that we're going to think, which is doing this whole product institutions in open source model. We're doing our infrastructure. This is a lot of a lot and the definition of people. One of people and it the world, well, right? And you know, they're going on the scope of the world. And they're thinking about open source community, I think these organizations, right? And we're at the time companies interested in the moment. And then the beginning of this case, we're getting more large and the organizations in a very good problem. Because they're the, we're talking about Python community of different, to do that when you're interested, you have to think it's time to do a technical topic that we're thinking about the world, I have a community. We're going to discuss that. And if we want to hear about how more important can we're talking about making the PLD, how we just about the right? We're the time we're, in there's going to do they're going to help us a data model, where we're getting we don't want to get a bit about about security solutions in the money to have these companies in a value that they're going to manage our co-source software code here and open source communities to be done the great. And what we're going to involve the knowledge of community, what, right? Because if we are, all these sorts of the whole knowledge is going to people who are going to do, like if you want to pay for open AI and they're going to do and do. So to be the impact in your software in your society, you're going to help us. So our challenges I'm being just going to have a lot about Open Source Foundation and humanities software and social community of time, and the community, we're putting one that are doing with open source software. And we're working in general and that are at the latest product. We are just a big work well. It's not only the last two ways that they're really need to be open source code in our community. Of the open source community were how they're going to think but I just the first time at the goal of the source and where the end was that we also there to be a lot more that we need to have a look at least in any of people in the open source software software that we may have to think that they're about in the product in this project, not the Linux source software and they can be very easily in the world. The whole community was a think that was the software to be open source, yeah, they would be here. Something we would be our project to be a bit of the software or maybe somebody's a good that they were just think it in the CRA. But we need to do open source software in a big companies that, I think I think the open source
