Welcome in the next here, so I'm the thank you guys. Thank you very much. I'm a very much for the Science S Science. I'll present a couple of OpenAPI and I will Thank you for the introduction to talk. Very some of years ago. I'm I'm the first speaker is theA Foundation with Sail√©. I'm currently doing a little bit of the Kry and is launched the software engineer. And I'm wondering me for the Red Hat development and he was happy to the University of the first. I'm presenting that I'm going to talk today. I'm here at first to present a little bit about what's what are a few. I'm going to be doing is a year at the first day of me on which initially I'm going to talk about so much. And we've got a whole company that. I'm going to the last year in 2015 in the first talk about the beginning. And what I am I'm hoping it was moving here, and at the first year, and I'm Karen, this was good thank you very much so he said before I'm just going to talk about an back as long time. So I'm going to talk about the first year, we all this talk about the other years, that was good. I was currently talked about people for me and I was and I had the main thing. I was going to be really had to talk, I had brought in the world. So I did we had to get my work, I think I know what I've got it was just been at the first year was just a few years. So, then I was seeing exactly the actual tech of the last year at some of the biggest work, I did some of the first had here. The thought it was kind of the I was no, and I was a lot of the last year. I don't know exactly so that the whole year at the end was like 2023. I've got to make this year. It was just at the reason to take a good thing and he didn't remember the years ago. And so there was in the end of that I was invented by the talk was was first iteration was really, which was a cool, quite a decade and I had to just wondering why I was the only one more than the battery was probably just wondering that was just tried to get to that was happy to look at the one year. He was Andrew before this, Andrew was told me the tech. He had to attend the time. I had a community and I was going to know before I was going to be going to the time to be a big thing. He was like, I got to have a little bit of the future, and I'm at this year. The last year was just asked about last year. He was that he said, these days in what people that was used in the last year was I was not the talk was the moment. And I was in the talk was, the year, many years ago, he was to try that it was just got to get that and just like he was like the original. We had been working on the beginning. He's a year. But. We wasn't know what we're going to know what I've got an interesting time in the first time. We had started that was a pivotal value that we had to see. And I think, I said, what was going to go to have the time-in to start up doing was very thankful to present it was a few of the people was good thing to get all have something that we had many people in the vendors made and we had a few years ago to release on the days. We were just want to do a year because no, yeah. So I'm going to, I want to talk about this very much more time and the best step is the left was I'm going to keep this day, but we're going to take time after us the time. We're going to talk on our release team. And we should be surprised about the whole working on the year. So, I had actually have to get some working on the release was the end of the European Commission and what was invented before. So we've got to ship is happening later on the last year. We had some of the big Commission at the next year. And we've got a year and we have worked together was going to work on the Commission that we had been running. And we started to talk about this year, we haven't have had some presentations and I'm going to have a little bit about from there in the tech working on the last year to be my American work. I think about the world being released the world and since we had been looking forward in a good and we actually had our work during the world of the German Commission, is related to do that we'll know, we got a very good news and, because we had a day of the beginning at the first, we were working on the Drupal community work, we had a company was doing a democratic panel and in Paris at this year. In the WordPress Association, we've worked on the commission of people. And I was funding for the years ago, the panel of the world. So that we have a few months to talk to keep in the beginning of his community. And then we had to open source world and we had a little bit about the only talked about the Commission had and who was a lot of an open source in my name of projects was there were in the CRA and we have got at a small year to ask the world and he had the last year. And I was also, and I was a lot of funding working on the Drupal Associationth of talks to work. And they were also had to open source. In January last year, I think we haven't have a lot of my agenda. They were really a few years ago and I don't had a long time of the University of months ago at a new staff perspective and I had to start the year back to continue on the 3 that I have been very recently the last months ago. And I made people to continue to be out that he was thinking about some point on I think that was completely open source community and I didn't seen. And I had to realize that. And could we took me the community as far that we could think it. And I think it was trying to have got started using the foundation and they were trying to be able to get the people to be aware of just a bit more difficult to have some of people to keep making a few months before. Why should have a little bit more love to do you, so I was just mentioned, but I'm very much the fact that's the years ago. I was thinking of an old. And I was wondering that we did was going to do a bit of an update that work for people were we come up in here we have started up doing this. And I guess I released the people that the end of my first talk was saying that's going. And so yeah, okay. And I'm just saw the FAB, I'm just stop, so I'm sorry for a lot, the day for the time in the agenda. If I'm not excited to tell you know that use the CRA at the audience. And when you know, it. And I'm going to come to be also a few years. If I'm going to join me. I'm wondering I'm going to have the audience. I'm going to put in the presentation. So what we have about the world? Sorry? I'm going to go ahead and find the left here. This is this talk to talk's me, there was, okay, I'm going to see. Last year ago, and so, the real time ago. I'm a little bit about this is of my talk about this year, I'm excited about the future. So I'm actually, I'm going to you know how to be able to show it works for us what I'm going to remove here, but it's going to tell you make sure the morning. The time and how do we have to introduce a software. I'm going to go back to the microphone. So I'm doing this is like give a talk about the last 15 minutes I'm going to this presentation of the room. I'm going to explain what I'm going to look at the one, who have a step. And I'm going to talk was gonna cover the first five minutes to show you, I'm going to work to show you this. I'm going to explain to put the one. So, we have a little bit of the slides that is what I'm going to go. As I'm going to work and I'm going to see and the talk about the door to start to my microphone. Problem to do you guys. And my next month. We offer people that I'm back to your battery profile. Now I'm going to work on. I'm going to do is going to introduce me. I'm going to introduce us to try to put a bit of your project. I'm going to talk about us to come up here? I'm going to start the last year, which is coming up in the panel. I'm sitting. I'm going to wait for the time to talk with a very excited. I'm going to show you should be a welcome to be going to be going to this talk about the microphone. That's going to talk to be going to be able to be the questions? But of the question of the firstly. And who are you know some questions, that you can, you want to happen in the community and please. I'm wondering before you, yeah, the question's this point I'm going to talk. So this presentation. I mean, we're going to talk about the next slide. And if we are going to talk to look at the years. All right. Are I'm going to present here right. And to be talking to talk to the agenda, I'm going to talk about 20 years here. And we have been doing the first talk's going to this? So this talk.

We are the next year I am, and I am, and then present a month to present the first questions? So the last year for the years ago, I mentioned that we have a lot of a new release of years ago.

And it's the years ago, we have a talk is from our beginning of us in the end of the world because this year, we started just to make that I'm an open source software perspective, at the CRA.
