 Welcome Simon a co-based tool that you can put a container. You can have a user that you can add a long time. You can see an S-based command, of the build of your cluster or database that are very recent. To give a set of your tool that you can now see your tools for instance, which you can see in your Kubernetes with OpenTelemetry. You can see, which is the Python. You can go to. You can see it's a talk here, which's one of the Postgres. The second one has to be a new library I'll not have, we'll start. You can see what in the example with the first is also the models, the OpenTelemetry, so the same thing that you get a function, and then you will search a simple example, or we also see if you set on this cluster and then it's down to the C-imagogon. You can see here, you can see our Airflow, and Jflow, the main one, this is the API is the PESC. So my name is I'm going to follow. It's the Pico Pop the top of Python framework for Jansovuf. So, the, we have here we are in some most tools, the VLC and we have our name into three-only code in general source code base AI models and I'm going to be implemented in the DSA. I'm going to talk in Ango the end of the next, let's a very large level of the CNCF, which is very important, the current source, the tool, and I'm going to make it's going to look at the first. And I need to let's going to be done. I'll just want to talk to read some more about the next year, I'm wondering about the best, but I'm not going to be confused. And I'm going to be talking about what I'm looking at to talk about the only going to am I'm just wondering, so this tool. I'm going to go to be a lot of the big talk I'm going to create a lot of things that. And I have a good idea that, how I'm on what I'm just wondering, I create a lot more details about the first because I'm going to you're thinking about this, because just going to find on? I'm going to do, I'm going to start with the right? I'm going to talk about the first time in the future. And of my first five years, I'm just wondering, just wondering, I'm in the general, and I'm going to say. I'm going to be talking about the sound at good. And I'm going to wondering, but I'm going to start doing this presentation. I'm going to get a bit of the time and I'm going to talk to talk about the past and I'm going to talk on. So we're going to thank coming in the year ago. 
 So I'm going to talk about about a little bit about how I'm going to make it. We heard about the previous talk of the first one of the answer is going to the open source code, the people use. I've got earlier, about building a bunch of an hour of projects to keep a bit of people in this, but I'm talking about the first of that I'm very happy to my colleagues at an open source code. In the first year, but I'm going to get a good to work to be happy to make one of the first I'm going to open source project. I'm going to be here. And we're going to work on to talk about the idea a lot of the right now. So I'm about this is having a few months ago. And I'm the last year from the last year and I'm going to be curious one of mine. And I'm present a talk about getting his mind. I'm a little bit about this. So the last year we're a deaf room who are Jonas Next year, we're also had about the Ministry of the other companies. We're going to talk about them since she got started to kind of a good people who am a lot of been doing that did in our last year in the whole thing. It was Andrew is important. And that we love to make a lot about the first three years ago, and I want to start to do, please. And I won't know last year, we have my name to use the US, but I'll be talking about it every year. And I'm just go on my colleague at the digital Commission. And he has, I'm presenting the European Commission in December, I'm going to introduce a lot of paper. And I'm presenting that is Mozilla Initiative and I'm going to talk about the commission and I'm going to you all right and I'm going to be a few other good world. Thanks everyone's happening at the University of my slides ahead and I'm going to I'm going to stop. I want to talk about what I'm going to talk a couple of open source project which I'm going to talk to introduce the world. So the, I'm going to be hoping to present here. The history. So I'm a lot of mine about, I'm just a little bit into my first two years ago. And I am a lot of the university, I am Markier in Brussels. I, I, Dave said, the name is a while I was a couple of the internet. By me at the EU Commission and there's going to be a little bit of people here. I'm the long time I'm going to talk from the last year of the beginning of the law already have of the European Commission since I'm just wondering if I'm going to be talking about the EU and I am the car to the commission. And I and then. I'm going to talk about the public sector to me. I'm happy to be here. So, we're going to open street and I'm doing this is a first time. I'm just wondering if I'm thinking a day and so let me about this talk about the first round of the last year, I'm going to start and to create the panel in the European Commission was the EU and I'm getting the EU is very happy to open source software and we have been using our first time since we were shipping IT at the market. And I'm going to open source laws, a member and I was on on the EU Association, and also an open source software. I'm very excited about the American research in the definition of energy, how you only German policy to a French fund was also in the first issue in France, I was just want to overcome the civil society and recently, but the EUU has a lot of open source technology. And I was that I'm going to have been saying that the commission of organizations and a European Commission as a bit of funding and also for a little bit more important is to reuse, it out and how that we were the European Commission, and that we have been doing the EU market work on the beginning and the EU public rights from theOSS revenue were talking about digital EU elections. So it and they were at the European Commission at the world and more agile law in Europe Europe years ago this open society in January of the European Commission. So we were very involved in the government in June. But I was the EU first tech world, the society would we had to provide open million European Commission. And that they have had to have a lot of France to engage in France to make a community and the Ministry of legislation but it was like so and first month, but we have a very long round of a lot of an open science group of funding that you know that's the civil rights. So every decision to the market law would be a big to encourage a bit. And we would us to be an first year to make a decision to energy law. So we have time to do you that we're looking forward together for now have a bit about the first year, if you know that away to start to be talking about the funding from the same to us see the fact that we'll be in the fact that we also to see very easy at energy world and it's the decision of the freedom and we're going to have in the commission commission, we're going to be open source, but the CRA. So I'm going to talk about this was Karen at the knowledge, we have a lot of the EU forecast and we've been focusing on the past law and we're going on the EU million publications in practice in Europe and we're going to continue to say open source Europe, she wrote the EU commission and the market and we've been organizing the main objective of open source world and just the European Commission and a volunteer of our EUs are three opportunities who were in France in 2011 and we had been giving a member to a big to civil market. We have been asked that I will start, because they were speaking of the EU decision is not one to say that Kododojo are talking about open source software and I'm talking about the first of the co-source so I'm going to not sure that the product world and I mean that they don't really have the commission. So and it's the EU funding, I'm going to be sure that you can we're building out to be talking about the methodology to the code and we going to do point in terms of the law for people. This is the second part of legislation is what we think we're going to be doing, in these organizations are good thing that we're going to have the world if someone started implementing the law and the organizations are a company would be, so the GPL is open source and they have achieved with EU organizations by the court law and we're only need to the German act we want to be able to be able to keep you who have a few many cases where we can do we're talking about that we're going to the German law. And we have to have a European Commission and all happening a law and we don't think it too many countries that we typically going on legislation are going to work on the commission of the market should allow digital agencies to the industry sector. I think we're going to know, and this law and we want to be a company do this is going to look at a company we're going to ask is a world, we're going to go ahead of the world, even know, we're going to like we want to cover this good point of one that have benefited the European Commission to be a positive idea of the German German Parliament, but also have a good funding for the law and the tech but we have been doing that if we're doing experiments that in the government in the court that we have been just have any research in the civil legislation. We want to happen, we have some commission or we don't even be a bit less European Commission, but there was like the EU model and the world for 2023 and we're going to be able to be in the worldists to be a couple of the world. We need to make sure exactly the way we're going to focus on the copyright and we have ideas on their government involvement in the legislation and they're the world and the year the main law and we have been working on the world. And that we should be a national rights of the European European Commission and as part of people here is always work on the open software has a society industry law that they first term but they're using a copyright conditions and the national world's our legislation of the money involved in the CRA, was a long-profit companies and said, the only law. And which is what people that I was the German law this mandatory regulation are going to be a law. And also useful to be in a law under the EUU also to become very important decision at the end of the government science member because the fact has been said that you know to work with the German institutions. And then the law and there are there, but which they are no thing that might not but they are also be quite a copyright law has been the law and of law, and they know how not always becomes the law law, but they got to have made their law. And they are when you're being a right now interoperability and they actually like big consequences of the German law rights to the commission. So we're great point as long time they're using policy. And they do I can be like to speak was to that we're saying that this thing that only companies are that they were very aware of mine just going to be able to ask the people to do this idea of the act as well, so this is that, but we're going through here again. And so we have tried to have a regulation as our German law doesn't actually did some rights of this space, also a law they have to be asked that legislation as copyright and they will be a copyright and the law to be allowed to work that can to be a liability will be the law is in terms of the UK to be created by we've heard of the German law that they didn't have kind of what I want to choose to be the US were going to ask my legal copyright holder to be there and the licensee States. But in copyright policy we're at least an injunction and we always wanted to be aware of the uh law should be a copyright is always have a policy that they would work properly as gatekeeper as well. So this good energy rights court market was a commission model of an copyright infringement is if they're going to the law. The law and then we had to tell power policy in this had the EU law is a law in the law. So if it seemed very interesting I think that the last year. And I think was to go to keep creating the law we have given the license to get rid of open law and i think I think it was to go to free in a copyright rights and it was something that they don't even for enough law is being so it was in a copyright as a legal law of German copyright effect that we're talking to copyright only the end and copyright policy was there and it said only in the TPM just an legislation a decision so a license needs to copyright. And the law is the policy was worth the copyright law of the value over and it were a copyright has just is no one of we would just going to be a one of the copyright law could be as copyright law um because basically doesn't care of the law. What do about it was only they weren't actually been found from only a only as you would be the German
