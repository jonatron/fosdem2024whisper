 So the two is a network with the left. So the University in the open power. So we will get to this automatically. We will be the next presentation is going to be into five, but in the future. And this one is that we want to modify us to send some other rooms to set energy from the future is just then one. We also have these infrastructure system and we want to turn and to make a real time to do that we need to have to spend the future for us to introduce us to pay for us the talk was also working around. So here we can try to, so we are now a bit of how it's the real time in our website. So we have a question that was, thanks, we have the question. So we have a software engineer around the first talk is good thing we have to introduce. And we have the answer about the audience who are from staying in the user science in this project. You have a big project to the internet and open source world very familiar this is a web. We have a good talk about the world. I said, I think this is a big open source software, and the best. But basically this is new community, right? We are also quite a long time and in the government activity perspective, the market that's the first in the open source project and what they have today we're very well, which is going to keep in open source community and open source software side. The different institutions of the world, really open source infrastructure for people did we are different projects. And we have the last year to get this point. So I think that we have a little bit of that is not being used to solve as well from AI community. So I'm really great for a bit of a little bit of a great language. And I've been a little bit about a while I've been seen that's really been looking at that I've got a little bit of money for the people. And I'm going to get a member of an open source community was on that I'm just interested in the company that we've been this. And that was not going to go into this to the data. You're going to say, let me. You can open source community in this, yes, do you're involved, you know, but you know, and you know the open source communities, this is going to like the funding and that have a community sharing it's going to open source organizations, but they're building a very important thing to have to see here, and we're with people making open source and all our other types of the community, when we've got the community, we're going to invest into the people. And I got a lot of the end in the world of open source community team team were integrating like this companies, so we've got the things that's coming to make them. So what I think that we have had and we've seen a sort of a little bit of a little more important I've got the people who were talking about what I'm really heard in that are in the ones that. And so they're looking to quickly we're trying to work on the other people and they do. But I'm having changed the people involved, you know, like, we're on it's about a couple of the communities for people like like that. And so there's all these two things like so we're the community member of people. And that are the most of the years, I think that we've got away and the world, and we are a couple of all these. And they're going to get involved in these people that they're going with these organizations and we've got these in the people to start with this we think about the right so they're going into that they're going to be a given a very actively heard of time. I said that's been a really, which I'm just know, we're going to be talking about another person that so if you'll give you're here. And I did that I'm going to go wrong and thank you three the question. I'm going to note. But I'm going to help me with the panels. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
