 So the first of the chat. And here, we have, at the way to do more with the room, we have a good challenge to know, but not going to start to speak, okay, we had the screen, we can make the main client. Then we use the client. We also have access to basically send some this to the bridge. We can take to the server for the client, we are already. The server is made. We have the server, well, we have some time. We have to specify the client for the server, which is available. In the server, we also showed us. We have an application, we have the site. We have some of the server that the client. We have a client that the server. We are using the server. We need a server to use to get a server. For example, if it works. And then we have to be able to click on in a server and that we have the server. So this client's going to check that we just want to do the server to be the server. Then we store the server to be going to go. We're using a server to find a room. We are going to be able to be able to clean our side of course our server. We want to call the server. And we need to set a server. We also have a room to switch to pass to send this configuration on the server. We're going to the client or the server and we're going to the to go through so we'll have a server. So we have the server server from the server. And if we have some client. We are going to take a server here at the server and it's going to tell the server. We need to start having to continue up to do this time so we want to do we want to do this. But I'll have. Please, I will ask this over here if you. If you can spend the server to start up and you're just don't have to have to start by a server and the end. This is a server on the browser which is the server. It has a server to a user will continue here on the server client. So you should be not get your server. You can put a client before the server to. We do it up to the client. It's going to your. It's a server. You can be configured. With the end, you can see all the clients from the door UI. You'm going to get a server that you'll talk about the room. And it's a presentation, okay. That's, then we have our application and we've seen that we're going to use. This is going to provide a way to look like to provide a UI to provide a server. You can do the browser. You can drop in a server and you can see up to be integrated and make sure that in a web server for us and you don't have another server or you just compile for the server. I'll get that. And this, you can do one in the server. You can see is going to be done with a new server. So this. Okay, we are not using our clients. But now the server is going to do for us to update. So the browser. It's that's basically the client. You can be the server. You will be able to share. So I'm going to implement your server or client, we want to present. So this with your client to talk. So the server is about our server, how your server. And then we're doing a server. So you also we have to have a server agent to. So, the server to start here's how it's a server and you're going to work. We're going to do you have that? You to start. And in the server. In the server, if you're going to come from users from the server. We have a client client app to set up to a client server, but I wanted to the server, I have to create a client up and and let's going to create a server, the server. And then server and it was going to create the server and connect to just running, which going to a server. And I wanted to your server to do a for PTT session, I want to take a website to give the server. I'm going to the server that there's super user has a client's available, and I'm going to see to start and enable the server to my server to do that. And this client will re-dex server is kind of mail server. And it's going to client, and it's the server server. So, the server. I'm going to give you to your server. So that's the server is going to, I'm sending to start this. I'm going to change it in the server. So, I've seen before the server, I have a server on the server, and the server is computed server. So you need the server, I want to do that you to start using this to use the server. And this and you can also want to kind of a view and your server. I want to modify the service and server. You can be that in a server, of the client's, then the server. So how the server's real server, I'm going to say, I'm not going to create a mail server, I'm going to be happy to share and I'm going to the server to get the server. So, this is, it. Sometimes a client knows. So the client. And today's going to not possible, but I'm just want to create a server, I'm just one of what's going to match what I'm going to... Let's going to be able to start your server. It's the server to show you're going to run very happy to put some of this with the server. So for the server side that I'm going to going to be here to work on this user. So we're going to see a file and the client has to be able to set of your server. And we're going to make the server client's going to do a server. So that's going to introduce the client, you're hoping to do, like open server, like, they are just go to be able to this room. But I'm just telling the server. Or, what you're going to do we're going to write your home server just going to the server for the server, which is going to do that, but if the server will help you're just accept a server in on the server, that you want to send your connection, we want to DNS server. I'm going to that we want, but you want to get this and this. So that is that's part of you're running and there. I'm going to go to be to your attestation, I'm going to that. I'm using a side where that you want to keep the server description. So that's going to start. You want us to do this role. It's going to take out to figure out to work. So I'm going to start a client's going to be a room. I'm going to talk from the API. If you add a username back and send the server, it to the client is going to use. So the server is no, one. You just the end. You could use case, and, for the server. You can see that go back to create a server. You can also go to the server. You can show you can see the server of the server. You can see your mail server. You can just connect the server. You can here, you can see that. If you can see if you can see how to, you can see it does it's better. You can see here on that we can see in that if you can see the server for us, like that it's going to have. The server. And this is also a top of the server. I'm going to see the request is an server. And in the server as an server and I would also a server. So if you create the server to that you are in a server. You can get back and the server. So you can see here. You can see here, we do it's also. So that? The server. I'm going to see here. And in aTC server's the server. It's all the server in this is going to the server. So you have my, you will go to create a client, which is the server, in a server, the server, which is server to the server. The client, we talk is just see the server, we have a client server. And you can see, for the server and the server. So it's the server. Like here is going to now going to be using a server. So, when you see the server, this. This's going to touch server, you're going to start to run the server into this server to make it to be going to be available. It's going to start a page. So the server, I'm going to ask you know when I'm going to find it. I'm going to do that. And another server, I'm sorry. So, I have to show you. So this is here. I'm using it's this case. We do I'm not sure what happens. And then we have here, we run. It's going to look at the data. We have the server and I'm going to show us, and now have an login server, so the server will try to share the client can do a user field. But the server, that's going to show the client, I'm going to go back back to my server. Can you why we're going to tell the server. So, so in the server, this is going to test the client. And then we're going to work? How's going to have this will end, the client connection, not going to run. Oh, but the, sorry, we're supposed to this is going to be done using the client side. What we're going to turn a server by default as a server. The server works. And now just can we can have a client, you see the certificate of this is going to make it's going to run it. And so that's going to be the server is made yet. Okay, I'll talk, we're in there's going to this, you can do that I'm not work. It's going to go back to that we'm going to be the client role for us. And then I'm going to get the server. And I'm going to see it really a end with an application. And one is the client. So here I'm going to deal with a server. It's going to make a bit of the client reader and I'm going to mention of the server. And then I'm going to go to hand of my server. It's the server. So it's going to start this one of the server. And then I'm going to be going to make it. And we're going to do this, so please, I'm going to take a client. And now. And the server is the page. And if you can see the client page server, you're going to start with the server, you're going to start using the server, the user to depend on. And you don't know, the server, you can go. And if you can see that you're going to the server and start track, if you have to get on the client, you'll just play. So it's going to the server client's going to be listening to start doing this session. So this is always important to see the server where the server's going to that's a server, the server, is, it's going to authenticate. So to talk is going to contact. And then we're going to be using to be able to talk about to make this context. So I'm going to go to see the server. And the server, I'm going to continue the client, so you're going to get the server. It's going to get a certificate. And I'm going to continue. And you can then you a user to start sending this session. So we call to do a server. And I'm going to a server, the server. Okay, we have here to get a server access to that Go routine within the room. The server. You know, you're going to that the server that is going to have the server, and we have a way of the server is going to a server. We don't want to find going to implement it, if you can just want to start up. We are starting to do this questions, we're going to start-time server that. And I'm going to be going to show me your server that I'm listening to show me, I'm going to, I'm going to start to be talking about the server. Or you about IMAP. And I'm going to talk about doing some questions. I'm doing Go ahead. So, okay, you can you want to parse a room for the server up to start in the first side to use the side. So we have all of those, we are also have a screenshot and we also a bit of how to do you want to say that we're running in the server and I was going to also the server and what's going in the server. So this is the server extension. And then it's our server to look at the server and we want to call. So I'm not going to repeat the server one of my server is in the server. Using the server. So we're going to close to run the server, I'm going to say you, I have the server, we have the server to talk. So, I would want to start at it's just as the server, since some client will be a server to add a client at the server. So I'm going to be able to the server, I'm just going to create a server, on client server, and I'm going to talk for the client, I think it's going to give the client server provider to a DNS server's going to send it's going to my client. So I'll talk about to go to the browser. And it. So the server's probably one, it's going to a server. The server server. So in the server's not going to run the server. And we talked to make it. No, so I'm going to open browser.
