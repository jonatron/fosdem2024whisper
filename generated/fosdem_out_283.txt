 Hello Manuel, thanks everyone. My name is Vina, Redvas, well. I'm Manuel Jian, here for OpenCLI. Hello everyone. So we are going to briefly about very happy to talk about today today, I'm actually talk about a much for a little lightning talk about TNDS and Airflow. I'm our name is Eric Fabamuth Foundation. My name about the previous talk about open data in a few years ago. We have this talk about here and recently last year here and the University of Astro board. My name is Alessandro Bookzto Center. I'm sorry. I'm here in Tinyostdter and the first one of the first one of the DAP. So that the presentation. And I'm very excited about the one of the previous talk is that we have is a major talk. I'm in theory. I'm working in the first time I'm using the LibreA. I'm done in the best time to speak in the amateur radio? And this presentation we have been explaining to talk, I was the amateur radio Foundation. First, I'm going to a high open source engineer and some famous time? This is everyone is in the community now so I am a lot of the European Commission, but this year ago, many projects started 20 years ago that I was basically we had the co-time topic. So I want to 3DS. We have a day at the open source software because we joined from the first year in the energy and the railway Foundation Project the co-bomb. We were some railway and so well developed a lot of the last year and the European Commission, so it's a community, very much of people and it's in 2018 we managed to actually really know, it was the most of the case. We have heard about software were about different projects and we used to work, but the fact that we have had to be open source projects of this was done last year ago. And three years ago, but we released since we had to release as I was very, but like and I think, we started and the first years ago, as we are here, we had a maintainer so the whole talk was open source projects do that the European Commission was, so it was working on our community and we even in the current community was in the community and we still designed to be doing and for us and there are really some countries. And after the next point, but we released the market and the community have been talking about 2023, we have been the technical projects, the world, which is a long of the CRA in our research community. So we were a new companies in their rights to stop and we were thinking about collaboration around the time not. And we have to get it, how many years ago 20 years, six years, I was that the moment. And if they didn't reach out the last year and you want to the best day, which is, so as a lot of Outreachy was having a good situation that since we did it was they were the regulation. And I had to choose to get the organization, but they were a while we have at the EUs and they need to be so to get a European Commission there. And in the European Commission worked on European Commission to get that they are some money in the Drupal. And we have been using the PLD was in the open source world. So we have a national supply chain of free funding in Germany and national member and they have spent another elections that we have a year and they were just had, and I was the European Commission, so we released in this the European Commission and the first thing called open infrastructure that we have in the European Commission since 2016, which created EU Association wasn't had the beginning of the funding and we had a cost for the Drupal. We found that he did, I would be just talked about law and we had a GPL society that people who are the CRA, if somebody was just keep in and they were the German Commission and they would like a way to be the law of the law and they were successful. It's a software steward, but the law actually only value. So our roots of the big issue of the technology is the issue that they were very cool thing that were doing in a train as well but the CRA was to be the law that had. The copyright law of the legislation, you remember what they were the commission was, this digital sector because a tech is that was the law was kind of to been one of an open source on the GPL law in the open source I was actually used to be used to speak was using law? Because my law in the source risk and of legislation. I did that the PLD didn't really got the civil society will explain and they had been something that she got a long period of course the company in the software law, but if things such as many people were really see here to the copyright rights is something that had to the notion of the parliament and the person was under the parliament in the legislation, we've got the European society was trying to they were trying to fund and they were just had huge day and so we were this on the CRA on and they had a huge person who could have a long problem. So they were the person that's just work since he were able to make a trademark, so he had that she was really had been a I was like the first person. It's not been in the thought he was that was to were saying I was so thank'm thinking of the years just looking at the beginning of the company and the WordPress law in 2021, I was also is not just doing the project. It was a big tech act as a bit of the law, I've been doing back to be on the law in court law, the UK they often had had no value of the open source community and also initially had, they were used to that was recognized by German law and it was a law in the panel that was to the way was certainly that we haven't know that were wondering what he've got it was the copyright out the value, but we took an issue of legislation that were that was the idea of the copyright in the way that know that he was a copyright had made for at the idea to be exactly about the commercial person that so they ended up in the court people are responsiblely that was like they actually thought that was the software that's it was a copyright value of uh and they had that they were in terms of the copyright was and a law would be required is that we never been only on the law to and they said they had been there's just said in place and that, they worked that he had been just used by a government were like a last year, uh and so we've seen the TPM had TPM. But that was also had no copyright directive in the reason so that were going to put and in that were to be released an issue and the first one is that the UK copyright law that I was since I had that was a really, right and don't had also was a law they did that was going on the GPL that was a copyright in the license is the overall and government copyright is no law that I had it's the parliament to license license and they don't really know at their third person that it was GPL. And then in it was not in the copyright value that it was just the law about the GPL law was not in and the German clause were even as the fact is, they had to that there were not even know that the law has no copyright came from this so he was a case that he also there was an the copyright infringement report of copyright of sort of a good idea and possibly didn't really have a law but that we have no people, but then are always had it was not going to do this proposal for it know that the license and this seems to be the law that we are only because they were intended the law law is true and we had this law didn't have the copyright law in the GPL is law um and we had not know at the they thought that I was the lawyers and it's there had uh they was so we had a German copyright was another as they were no copyright law in a gap but they can be and they had is the law and they're going to care the law knew to create a law. They had I think they are and they apply the policy were the license value of the law wasn't aware that the copyright person has was a long term of the law which they don't to you know that software public law liability was not exactly the copyright license to license clause shouldn't really, they are a value and open software, they were kind of decision when they were from it was no one that is no clause no copyright infringement who got the moment it was I would always to have value to just a parliament because they went it was just to money and then they were this thing and they asked that want to know, we didn't know exactly going to have at the license. Because they said there was not big idea that they're a law and they know he was given commission to no at a value that was quite a term, well. And they were and they're the person, but they did they were a public value that would have't have the principle that from there had been a copyright as it was a good to take a copyright law in the legislation and they worked on a software from. They were interesting and license that just to the license but they had to follow it was we were then was done too kind of the law in the time then they were being a copyright legislation and was interesting law that point and they did they were to trust anymore and they were very long time to think we can have so far. So there were like the US was no legal law as clear but they went for the commission was a very far it was the one very a free law that I knew they did remember everybody said we had taken is to know what do we did was just did that almost been done but like he was the next year I knew it was asking that was quite the key that companies was not aware of the regulation and the parliament in some German UK now came to the regulation market and they had a copyright law law had that was just had more license of the law and would just said so they could be competitive from the really but we had always think we were going to get better time to this that took the policies that we had to be announced also to be looking over to be brought to not to the commission here at the commission and I like I was using our area but I had had to a question was a decision and the courts in the commission they get into parliament's a good so I had to the value that they can't already work in the licensee to make the commission and you know the idea was that we had to make that's just one aspect of the value that. But the parliament is what I think that they have related to know that there and the policy could be the law is when they want to the question was almost the court and they didn't always have the rights by the money because they who would be also trying to be pretty good to do well. And then they haven't have to take the law in this was had to say we had to do and we had kind of it for the software value of trust the GPL in parliament that was an issue and is the term is that a mandatory law should be used to provide a decision right that the GPL regulation from the license would not only but we would be used to license to have done the money in the GPL of legislation and about the law and the UK laws who was the commission has happened before actually the law that since the data as the law directive and therefore this law that very first one and there is almost to legislation and when person and they said and they have like said and they need to be the copyright license and they don't know the copyright market's this infringement decision that they would be taken and I think that they come and the CRA and they come back to know there are like this act? I think that's a copyright infringement or the German law that we are a value that the legislation of the question of the GPL came up in the conversation of the law is for court term was at 1 was a closed German law you know in two value is not an directive to a directive of the copyright law and it's the German rights that she has organized in copyright and any law at least law and that the regulation had the law that very big GPL term was a third law for law and so I had was the EU commission law and they had a value of law policy sector when we had would think there was a second law for a regulation would be a legal value that they had and they were able to also well a German law copyright law google still in copyright sector to be a copyright policy a copyright was the copyright open industry to would be the court public law law to impact in that the infringement for a money and they were not of the current IT to felt to at the German rights and they would be the EU law and then they had been a law and they had a scientific technology value directive that we could be in a infringement law and software as that's not only huge amount of open source commission and the act in the person is often in a GPL because they need to be and they would be in the parliament so the EU license free law to think I think of the legislation that we finally has to think there may be a regulation has a law anymore are a GPL law and they're really part and that they have for government and they are a license act to in German infringement at court would have given a value for the law that decision for the
