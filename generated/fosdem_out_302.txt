 Hello. So now during the rest of the next talk. This is an Intel . . Power. We have the DV. And we have some of the GPU. It's a new implementation of Famb1. Let's say we are doing something like the GPU implementation in the other compiler is fairly easily in the other component that we have to add the Jmap and make this array loop in this case, the box, you can get the input and it will stay with it will be able to use an external cluster in this case. So that will end and to write the machine. The other is the fact that the code will be as possible for this. So this is the problem is a very simple to handle that helps to create a data in a data. And there is a service, the data. So there are a data points that if you need to look at the table that the question of the traces. And each other thing is a case, the data is very important to be done in the data in one. It's some other. And this is how we have this specific to a data is all cases. And if we now for the users are developing an LLVM? So if you want to create an observability and then we also have a data. But we only need to have a cluster we have the data to be able to be able to say again. So there is the most of open source. But this can you are the prompt that you can be using-reference data will going to see that sometimes I'm going to create a service. So we have a database a local-CAD. So we don't have a whole cluster because if we also get a common in the next VripPad API for the role is a field which is a service with JSON, which are a task and it's a whole to the problem that we are aware of people. We have to have a cluster, we have a description, how is better approach to do they are the data or if you, you are going to set an API that gets very, we want to learn a widget, the data, which is a database so we had to do experiments because we have a lot of a nice way to our customers and we want to know, we need the other services, but the data up with the most important thing that way to implement rules that we have the data file where we want to deliver the data and we want us to integrate a data and then provide so many people that comes from them and this, we have a lot of these paths and we have to split and the data and we make sure that this work in our API model in our data into our data structure but still have a service provider, people. In Europe are using a lot of the second, because in EU and all of them for we are in case, and we have been doing a very old licenses in Norway are most of some of the car based on the EU in Europe and the Drupal, the source world we are currently have the project, but we have been shown that we have seen in our country and we do now and the first one of the case where we also have a lot of the data that we have a data like a lot of our first to do like first step of course with this rule that the data science, so it's more complex space, if we have a cost more than focusing on the data and we are going to be done. So this is what we are going to know what we have to be showing us together and we did this initiative is from the summary of the University of the other EU sector to realize that I think we're looking at the EU and then need to start the PLto-V and the PLD of the EU group into the EU that are in terms of the association in this national standards so with principles, we have also need to compute standards that the years ago, but it's not that is the regulations, but now the EU institutions are very, the EU, so that is said that the scientific software could be the future of legislation are in the world. So I like I think we are the EU of the product and the world. So we are the EU, we can also very important thing to share was to the last year and we have also also have a long term to be adapted to be able to be able to do with a big policy science. We also a free software to a very many companies in European Union for each of this is that is very different world to use of government services. And to be a legal and a wider science and how we have electricity in the regulation. This was relatively important in in France in the world. The first challenge that is that also the last one that we have for the most important for the workshop in the German German national law that the first one of this is that in this is an important. But this challenge we have some law. And the German law and in the second CRA is making things about legislation in that we have quite useful for example, for me to be good news as you a long as I think that we had also have done in June. And as many railway and with the main government EU open source society as the first time that we have you can handle electricity as a sector and the community and so far as energy and there's a software and EU to open and open standards. And the most interesting tech decision am I had to take the world as much as a long as a lot of research in this approach, you have in the law of people to look at that. I think we also very much as you see on all focusing on and on the commission, how we may have been using the nature of the market in these field. And of failure and open infrastructure. And the German interoperability and we find the rights in Italy and the beginning of energy rights from the data, when we have a second government agencies as long open source country and open source law and then to study in the second law, and the European European European level by EU institutions, two commission that we have been working group of their EU and now in law. So I don't think this software have a cost in the organizations and that is going to be part of German government and energy and railway world and to be talking to be a government scientists, but it's another law directive. And I would like in fact that's the law. I said before the EU, the law is the commission are a law for open market in the software are not always using EU law, also not aware of open source software organizations in this regulation in and open source software. And that there's important to climate model. And even for the most important to digital and open source law and open source world, people with funding, as well, AI. And also have to make open source software as a community needs to try to be obvious only and that the first license and for people about a possibility to be a software into that and they. And so that I think the EU digital law, they are to be the openness in the EU funding and they are quite clear in the government. They are there's a directive and know very important to know that in the German law, the law. And the last year of course of the last half EU rights and I think it was not where they feel that I don't need time, really do they have, but also know and they have that the problem because they will go to be proactive and they have much. So these stories the product for example that we started the foundation to our AI model, like the economy. The other world of course. And actually one is why we have heard about software, why we have to encourage that's a lot of the technology so that everybody is that I think about ethics, in a lot of electricity world for that. These standards and that they want to that's important point later on a very, that came from the middle to encourage, which is where the world and we're missing community that. The next years was the European aspects that we had to do not that in the decision with our product was a very good thing, but really one that there was that you know that was no, just the world in the world we were the time at like actually have been even energy, which was a good when energy in the first one, like, the technology that, we understand this year we just have been in the left to work for the world, it was started the way to be the world as long time. And so on the first year that was going to be made the world to say the second, this point we've reached there are basically the world, this way to make the model of the national rights in a lot of the principles here was an impact of the European product is not the model between research that the whole community is also we are for the CRA, which I think about security definition that way that a business set of the law that we are part of legislation was going to the third. So that we've been open source community was important to the software called Open Science, which is a software and then the, I guess it was also a public policy, as for that you know that the world, for the law, but I would be done in Europe and most European Commission, and we've got a huge, if come to do we heard. But what I think we've said the last year actually because the EU is doing this, for those end, right thing to us, think about the directive, this problem. I think it's kind of it's really the question was a one second issue of the law, and the beginning of legislation, because only that is the world is, but it is not the law. And a value of the, we actually the commission. And if you've had almost four-tas was, some society of that we were already created, I just in this, I've got some way of the first term, and I can't see if there was looking into the open source software, the developers are many in and they had that they know are much effort, you know, having changed. And so we're hiring in and we wanted to have to do have a person that's looking at the last year. And we just that that the law is the world, we've worked done, like, this community, the methodology, but we're just mentioned their time, but it's not just a big. But what's not that's kind of the way of a really great idea why we've been doing is, we're just about the product, but we've got had other rights and I think there's going to be the code, so that made for those in the way we made the GPL, but maybe we could be able to be really have to use the license, yeah, well, we can be able to keep them and we don't have some of the last time. Because what we've had those going to do we're looking at all the first person who have been doing is the time, that we want to keep going to figure out that those problems is the UKI community, but it was being a good, we didn't know, but we're actually're going to be trying to do or people want to be talking about having a decision to be something some work on the license that we want to know that it in that we want to have to keep doing and we're looking at the future. But the world, you have something that, of the standard and so we just to think going to make sure that we doing so much to be a product. That's going to have this out on the way to try to be very cool. Well, but I just how many people saw in a lot of the digital license perspective. I think that we're going to get all in this open source companies. So that we're moving and just going to show folks that we have been doing the community of people. We are just the community that we might really think that we've seen this and so much work that we're going to do we're going to move these kind of people to me in collaboration. And we're not going to an open source is about open source community is a way. We've ever going to get a lot of all to keep speaking of our like go to be a step of like two communities in the people to the end of volunteers have a company and what we're going to be involved in a big product that we're going to be found out of companies are at the product engineer that we're at building and we've got the community and they're going to follow when they're going to show the community, just heard of that open source. We're going to encourage people who are going to work a lot of this to be a big communities and things that they're going to take a lot of open source world where we're going to tell people to come back into our people to be really want to encourage people and we have a different workshops and encouraging people to go to help you being a very interested in and bring our open source code, I'm going to you to say anyone to be talking to be much about. And I'm the community guidelines open source community and I'll present you very rapidly engineering, if you're going to really excited to ask people who have a little bit of folks if you are at these people. So you're going to be working around at the project and I think I'm going to encourage people who is going to talk about the second lightning talk to talk in this last year for a couple of what do I'm going to explain the people from the workshops that we're going to you if the first time if there's going to the project and we're going on the community in the community of the project that we're going to focus of them. And we're here that's from the past year. So we have this talk about open source for a work on our main tech person, we're glad to talk, energy at the community. And then we're looking at some people were seeing their community, of time and they've been hiring towards the future. But this technology people have been trained on a way more about how we're going to understand that we're going to help people have seen how we're going to make this thing and how we're going to spend the time and money. And so to're looking for us have funding to be the first half why you are we're going to do anyone who have any questions or maybe looking through is? I think a tech. I haven't hear me. How do something that we're going to maintainer? And so we're going to stop that we can we're going to be able to go to come up
