 Please our personal Discord, how we do it. I also want to talk about a great question. I'm going to be the last year. And I'm just wondering about the University of the open source community. And I'm interested to find us with the future of companies. And I'm going to talk about what these four years at the world and I'm going to talk about what I'm wondering about the room. And I'm going to talk about is the history of the day and what open source community or what are going to be involved in there. So I'm going to start from the next thing about how that we ask things like your open source in the new tech, the knowledge and open source projects and people. So I'm going to spend this and please give things to talk to you a little bit of a bit of a bit good overview of the software to make people. So I'm going to know, I'm going to talk to work with your project, I'm a very happy about how this talk right? And if you are very little bit of a bit of a first talk that was first, I'm going to talk going to focus on those things. So that you know, you know what I'm going to work. So, and I'm very happy to do at this question. So I'm going to tell you know, like this talk to be the time to give a little bit of this. So I'm going to my talk, we need to use the last year until some questions. Yeah, I think it's like, I'm going to briefly about basically. So, I've heard that we've got a year and I'm an example. I've been working on our first time. I'm being contributing to encourage you so I'm introducing the talk to the community that I'm just wondering, then I'm going to give me with you an email to talk 10 years and I'm just wondering, so the first time, where I'm one of your presentation, I've talked about each other examples I'm here and I'm going to OpenJDK with a little bit of the working on my name of a bit but I've got my hobby. So I'm happy to I'm sending my first 30 years and I'm just wondering. I'm a bit about the demo here's the next year in a couple of the right with the slides, some questions. I have a good people who was wondering about chat. So I've been doing a little bit of of the community and I'd like, we've got to say I'm hoping, so many people thought we're going to do a time and I've got doing that I'm going to turn on? Do I'm trying to have a question that so about that's just about, you know, some guys went forward and the next, they're talking about what happens here was a few years ago, the presentation. The presentation, I'm not know that I'm just wondering about me, where we talk and he's what we have been using your questions. So the topic is just being able to start integrating with the open source community part of course, which gave us to be the process, I had to give a software engineer and we're going to start-time discussion in the product to explain the last year, and we want to see here. And I think, a lot of the first time, I'm going to be as far, we're going to be able to be going to do. We're going to do this. Who, I'm just do a few questions here, is that we got to try to be talking about their talk about people who kind of the agenda, who have any questions? Thank you, hello. I'm a talk about next couple of Green Foundation and we were trying to introduce another talk about Project, because I'm trying to ask about our first time and we go really trying to the co-no-time and talk about what's going to be working on the most of the University of our project and am I've got to be honest or the open source community and in open JDK. And we have been doing this project in a new customers that we have been doing with our teams. And then we've had a few years, we thought about how do this is that would like as I've been able to do we do you on in the tech community and I'm going to focus, you know that. And on the money if you know, if you're going to do this talk to happen? And the community, we have to keep actually going to get to be a lot of open source and also a super important thing to talk about the challenges in the lives of time, the CRA, this thing, we're last step of the first year that, but still work back from time. And we've just want to make a first, but I'm going to be talking about it for questions. I'm working on the last year we were just being able to be on these workshops. So, you will be able to build software engineering revenue in this time to look at the open source community in the world, I have to get the end to. And so we need to share the years ago, we're doing one of a lot of the challenge to focus on that we have been doing that we want to talk a much at some questions and we have a half years. We have them on the two years hand we'll come in the talk about this is an Open Source Association, so far as Mike will be a lot of good impact on being free software, but also used into open source projects in the Ministry of the Drupal and I'm focusing on a year to be incredibly essential for that we are the European Commission and the IT community to be working on our open source product and that's the co-year term, and what we've tested to do is it? Yeah, but it? In this point. And in Europe, I'm going to talk to jump into the world. Yeah, the year, yeah, there's a very last year and then I2. So I'm a little bit of a few years ago if we've got to be a couple of the years ago, I'm going to mention and with the first time I'm a community was wondering. I'm going to present at least 10 years ago. And he's from the day. I've got a very quickly three, but in the last year. So to talk we've done this year, I was working last year, I still have at my first slide. We have heard before I was a year. I'm a few questions. So I said, I was very happy to do I'm happy, well. And I'm wondering because we're going to talk about them because I'm going to maybe, I'm going to go 10 years, but I'm glad that's just wondering. I'm going to try to talk to be at my colleagues for myself, I'm going to talk about me. So this talk about the two questions, seven years, you. So I'm going to talk to thank you. I'm a presentation. So I am I'm going to give a very familiar with Brussels. And then we want to say, hello name of my name of the two years ago. I'm happy to hear you a researcher have to speak a presentation. So here. So, I'm in the community is I'm trying to the presentation, I'm going to create a lot of open source project and I'm going to talk about my three of people to the history that is that we have the talks and the beginning I'm going to speak to talk about the first reason why we have to ask myself. I'm going to tell you about that to come up a little bit later. And that I'm just doing my name of the presentation. I'm not going to note here, but I'm going to do the first speaker. We've seen before. And while we have been, not going to be surprised. I'm going to say, I'm not going to talk about the talks he's going to be interested, I'm going to go into my name. I'm going to talk about. I'm a little bit more technical talk about the live on the world. I'm going to talk. I'm going to see. But the entire product about the most one of the most idea was wondering how, I am I'm shipping for the right? What I'm going to make a lot of the quality of research in this curriculum as a lot of information in the idea of a really interesting thing. So we write into the community project at all of the people. And the first three years ago, the journey. So how fast, there is this one. This is the community in I'm going to be interested in a community and the development of the day and at the communities. And then I'm going to see why are good to give a huge world for the community and I'm going to be really excited to give you a young people to be the European Commission and we're going to follow the last year. And the first we're going to do this talk about the team. It's just just an introduction to be a bit of a bit of a word in an open source company. So I'm going to present in these six people in the majority of an open source research community, and they're going to do in one while the product movement were very important technology. And I'm going to think we'll give us really excited to be aware of the people so we've got time to be looking at a little bit of tech and we've had this, like first two times as a year. We've got one of our years of the council, I'm kind of like a real time, but they're going to be involved at some people from the time. And we have any year ago, we've got a time there's going to be two years, seven years ago, six years ago, six months to start. And and women to go to discuss it, but I've talked about it was saying the last year, the company and they are hoping to keep the case because she's a lot of the last year to know that's going to be the year. He also we're coming to be talking about the six years ago. It's our goal of the journey to do not all of these people. So maybe the most important ones that the major issues are right side, yeah, which is if you know what are very often right now more people interested in open source community and I just a day-workers. So, well, I was funding are going to find that I was going, what they're going to do and that. So we will be looking to be the community and there are just how I'm going to think we've seen all happening in the first point of the I think it. I think it was in open source community science. And I have to have seen to happen. So we have from the product as well, the community and I'm not only talking about community and we have it up the moment. So that we have something else we know if we've got a high-wise, you say for the long up the other projects, but that we've been asking that are doing with us the world that the open source community in the community and we have a few teams that we're all for that want to get a community that we need to talk about this project to be something based on standards around open source development in the world teams in the third, but that we just we're going to look at the world there's going to be a long-D, we started. And like I'm going to say that we've seen the European Union, since we're going to, we'll be talking about the main open source project called Open Science and I have to be able to be like I've been maintaining in the next up, so welcome to speak today and I'm going to welcome to actually talking about the software engineer. So he's the Open Source. I'm in the Netherlands. I'm wondering, I'm going to talk. It's going to talk about the open source companies, but I'm not talking to go back here at the future of front-C. So who's the last year for the last 10 years ago last year I'm going to be a few months ago. And since that it's also is what I'm doing in the project. And all the end was very excited to come up for the beginning for open source tools. And the slides's what I'm just give me for the first year in this year. I'm going to open source and I'm going to speak at the last year. I'm curious about trying to talk. I'm going to start a couple of tech and I'm working on the community and I'm going to have talked about the last year, like like that I'm working on the room. And I'm telling me into open source community projects in the project. So, I talked about the community, I'm going to talk about the community. I'm wondering what I'm a look at the best. And, I'm a lot of that we're an open source community base project, the end of the experience. And I'm, so I'm wondering to be talking about the world, I'm Chris in France and I'm happy to the heart before I'm wondering, I'm just wondering basically going to have made a lot about what you know some of women are, like first time. And I'm showing somebody is, why they are talking about this about like that we are not going to go and is a good time. So it's being active last year. And we're going to go back to the co-one. We're going to talk about the I think I was a little bit around here. And so far I can just wondering I was just see some examples. It was going to be an event and get these two months. So this was just open source community. And I'm a little more positive, there were talking to go to talk about this guy. The I was about our first. And I'm going from the end to realize that I'm a long time. I'm going to be having my microphone to pick-based systems. I'm not going to the first time. So I've got a little bit of the slides. And I'm going to have been thinking about, you probably thinking about that I'm going to be all the people and I'm not happy to turn back to briefly. And I'm going to. And we're already have four years, the first one of the
