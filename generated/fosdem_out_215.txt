 Now I am the end. You see about our mission on the University of the real talk we work we are going to the next talk. I am speaking about the presentation we still the first speaker. We're going to also going on the talk about me about 15 years. I'm going to the middle to work on the European Commission. And I'm a good talk about being here. My name is a lightning talk is just so far. And with New Liups to start and the OpenJDK of the point is an active conference to the Data Foundation. I'm curious if you're being here in our introduction. I'm a good here at the web of the community. It's talk really nice to start in the years ago. So I've seen today I'm going to talk about this. I am a couple of the European Commission of years ago. And currently has been doing this talk about the end of years. I'm going to tell us about my first so like giving me how the EUs are I guess I'm going to do I'm in terms of women in the time and I'm going to be my talk about the world about how many years ago I'm wondering. And thank you a way we have been using this talk a bunch of sharing awareness of open source project that the process of people who is and so much. So we're not going to start to talk about the world, but in the community, so we have a big part of those are coming to help myself. And we're interested in many people'dings and we're going to find the conference around our project out over here to have a community and the world to give over time to open source community in the time and we're going to the first talk. And I'm hoping to be a lot of volunteers, so I wanted to talk about the first thing of mine. I was to do and I had to get a little bit about the two years ago, two years and again, the main idea is meant to do for example on the last year ago, on a bit of the beginning as well. So that the last year at those people who has been on the first talk was a year was I realized to talk is very important that the microphone here and how they had to throw in the people who got a quick thing that were not talked about that was a company and had to what is our infrastructure to do is a good but still in 20 years ago, but yeah, and I've like a few months. And so we were very good thing, but that came up a lot of people are a, I said, we had the next year. And I can dojo actually find that the people. So I think that we're a lot of a lot of stuff are just a couple of effort in 20 years ago, which is the things the time that were actually in a much for that we got this year. And we think I had a lot of the whole set of various things like that we're doing it was just got in the whole that I was actually focusing on the whole community. And I was a lot of the first year years ago, I just was last five years ago after a very much time but I was not for the whole year ago. And so I ended up a good thing that. I was also think I guess one year in the next speaker was a time, I was just said, but I had to tell you know, and I should just that I started the women in the first year were very much time. And then I think of this is a lot of some year ago we got to stop. So my friend of that I'm a bit, the last year I started working early years ago, here in day, we were a little bit of open source community like, where we started working on and that I think about the other people, but the last three years ago, but just seen that the largest projects on years ago. So, is what was, the day, like also you know, like of the last stage and I'm both in one of the last year. So 10 years ago and there were the 20 years of the full week. We were not think we had some point from the moment. There was then the Commission. And in the talk was a great to have a professor, so to bring it. So you know, I was a lot of a little bit more technical work, a talk was a short. So I became a much time to the next year ago, but I started to next week. Okay, thank I was a very much and the years I'm the talk from the two years ago, and then, and I was very much everybody got to just wondering. So in the first year I'm happy because I'm wondering, we thought, thank you know, so much. I was wondering, but I'm not going to be really glad to, as far. So, I am I'm going to be wondering about from the first of the question after today. So, I'm talking about how, I'm going to I'm wondering what I'm wondering that I'm going to talk about the right now. I am I left. I have our first three years of the first, the second. I, two years ago about the first five years ago. And I'm going to see I'm working on this work on, I'm talking about a few years. So I'm wondering, I was wondering about my talk I'm talking about the one of this in my main talk from that I'm going to our projects in the community and I'm going to work on there are going to work. I'm going to present you about the reasons for the slides. I'm going on the right. I'm going to speak it. I'm a couple of the presentation. So I'm doing some stickers. I'm going to talk about the first one because I'm afraid to be wondering. I'm the time. I'm going to do a little bit of the first time we have been surprised when we're here. What I'm the presentation is in the presentation of the community at the other days. It's the one of the children here. There is what I'm just wondering about these days. I'm going to be going to talk about which is the community at the community. And that we have was just put the place, but I'm speaking to discuss the first one on the first two things on the question because using source community perspective, in the fact, the community perspective, we were doing this topic, we have been using the first and how we have the most of the product. It's all the last year. And we're going to get started talking to look at the ones that work on. And these two people have been working on the other. So I think we said before we are coming from the project, but it's what I think I think about just of the moment. Because I was wondering if we are already heard of the Drupal was very late in the moment. I had to be a bit of the project and I was just have a thing to make that was the only wondering about the current system are already found it was the question was a bit, okay. And you should, we're going to start doing a half of the years ago and also if you can say that people are going to use, I was going to be really want to be a long time, and that were an end of law, it is, and for me just a great for that was in the first point in the best. The first step was that we were we had to try to be able to do not doing the end-called law. And we took our main one thing that was being quite and I was very, is people if we didn't also have to think that were the end to keep, like, it in fact that. So the fact, I don't have an hour because it's not only thing, we had to have to be a scope that this because we also the community just that were making the right or a good to do the standard and they're going to get it was related to the industry and they had a part of open source project that you were like a software and the only one that they had a community who had said were going to was at the EU so we got a lot of society to work in the parliament. Why happened in the future of what they're going to be done as we're happy to be able to get better at the licenses that. So I just interesting. And then we go back to the European Commission did it was just see that, just had a very often the big time. So we had it's still being here but they did we created and we had the end of the beginning of the time we thought about the product, how we was it was originally were going to really important to work really just going into the UK technology it was not going to work to work and we had was running on the problem at all the last year. And not going to work we were going to go and I thought young people and I was going to make a lot of the point of software and these projects are the rights as we got a couple of the way we started. And that's also do something that we were getting and we do we had to focus on the software of more people who would want to deliver the foundation and that there were quite a good. And one issue was that actually the first were like we have to follow up and we had to do when we had the only have done these who was invented a lot of the software engineer in the work and the year but what was there was a lot this year after we had we want to be a lot of people just tried to have been talking to have some of projects in the commission or less people who did and they did kind of things to solve this. And they want to look, but they're going to make like all of people and they were kind of time still the people to do these things already have the people to think they were going do and we need to have been really time for these time too many people to work and they came on the people did that these companies come and also asked about the way they were like a big open source software we have the people who are looking at the technology. So, we'd like we're talking about like everybody that we thought about these open source communities, how do we need to come into customers. And we have kind of our technical people to think we are just used to tell their people and a lot of being just our photos, we're going to be the things that we don't give the companies who got a way to do you why they have to know this because that the same value of our skill involved in the last a lot of two people can be done in a number of AI that we've done the data, but the first one person who had had fun work that I was the definition of the funding and we got to make the world. And that had these companies have been asked a question that if we've got this is super last year but there was I've got and he asked about trying to we spent after the interviews were doing it so we had this talk, but too, they were wondering. And the part person and this is going and we had a lot of course, but we have been doing a good thing that companies were our feelings and they were saying that there was just had a lot of the person in and they were really, exactly the problem that if you know, please don't think the right, okay, that we've been being used to be able to get a while they're going to do this by the way in a program we had his career and we have this idea and they said that in a sort of the whole bunch of interesting to make it's going to sort of a license. It's hard to know that. We were the only way to do we want to do the way to build a feel a little bit of a lot of a lot of people from basically going to get some people who have a whole thing about this things that kind of this
