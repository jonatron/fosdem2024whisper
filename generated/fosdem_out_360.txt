 MQTT. So, we'll see a Wazazaz, this is actually the Wisp. So it's a very simple, how we do we mean is the same state with an interface. So the first thing is that you want to generate an event. That's the scheduler. Yeah, then you can have only have a query. It's really a way you some packets that you get to a name and you have to a VM in this case. What is basically like an image where we have a new system and the proxy with the server with the server and we are going to be called the server which is that for this specific server to get into the server. Then we can't start to do an incoming server that key in our URL to find the server for the server, the query that will be that, but it's a server will be put the server that's using an address of the request and we have to modify the server. So here, if we have the request here that we also support for our zone. So with our server to the server, we are using some services, we have to try to do whatever response client. If we have an end on, we build a server to that you want to have. In this whole server, this, and if we have a server. And as a client's going to basically to start a server is where they are the server. And what's just do is the server. And the server on our server, we have to do. Obviously, because what you have is kind of the server that the server server. And the server doesn't want to disable this server, it says, the server is actually gets the server, the server, they are going to the client to cache. And the server will have all the client server to, and it's going to be able to be able to also available. And then we have some local application of the room to do is also provide the client server for that, on process that. And at the server to be going to say it's what's where I'm going to add a server or the server and then we have in these server. We will probably need to want to be talking to have to do other dev server or so we can do a server to test that's going to be now. And the server server is a request and a user server to share it's a server, but on the user server, when the server, we're going to start. And it a client are going to do that way, you want to expose a client client also... The server. And I'm going to start to also a server API in your server. So, we want to contribute to do that the server to. So how we want to the server service client side. Let's going to now. We want to come back to the server, and it's going to be probably going to do this. And I'm going to say that works. So we say, create the server. So if we'll have a server, these NSS user, if we want to have this server is the server in our server. And we want to set, we want to have before, the server, we want to end. We want to have a client will have to provide key stack as a server. It's a server. There's good API, but it's a user and we want to have, so we for you to do good for example. So we want to use a server application about the client is something, so what we want to say I need to send your server, well. I'm not sure. So yeah, the client. So it's the stream. And there's about that's what I'm sorry, the server, we want to handle. Okay, if we're working on our server, I am now. So thanks to the server. Any other client server. We're going to talk is going to start, we have a phone server API, for the server server, we can, go to do the server? So to my laptop for our server, we do we are using the server on my browser to client, I'm going to. That's going to end-end that we want to introduce me. Okay, the server and MSS server, for the server. So the server. So in the client server is the server will talk is a server. It will see here, I'm waiting to the server. I'm going to see the server server. Okay. We want to have time for it's going to start's going to we have to talk about going to take your server server on the server and also the client will not able to encourage you the client. And now, a server looks like we have to use it somewhere. And we have the server. I'm going to start to talk to reuse the server. And that we have a server server. So, I'm going to take a demo. And we're already defined at the server. I'm not sure, we have a mini client. I'm going to have, let's going to remember the server client client. So, right now, this is a server server. And of the server, as I'm going to talk here. So I'm using a server, let's going to be able to show us play, okay. That's try to start the server. Back with the network. And if you see it's... I'm from all going to tell what's RTC, this, you can I'm going to do. So user of course, you that's going to now, you can see the server as well, the server, but you're going to talk about the server we need to tell me. So we have a server server are going to use the server, so let's going to be going to start you don't get. And then we have this or going to talk to be a server to be going to create a server, so I'm going to talk to share, and we are the server. And now. So next side-'s the client side, the server stuff coming from the server. Which is the server. And, is the server, this server can be coming over the user that, there are sending other server to the password and that kind of the server. So, right? Now they are the stream, how to automatically doing the server of the server back is going to an open. And we are going to an email server comes to say. And then we want to have a server, which is probably saw before we did that. So, we have to provide some. I don't know that the room, our serverP. And what we have we work with the server and we get the time to connect to, that and then we haven't want to the server to have to to work with IPA server for a client service-im. So we have a server, which is the server. So the server is the server protocol on the meeting. So how it's going to manage. And also in the server. So this will tell the server, for the client to trust. In this is going to do that we want to send us a server to set to the server. To the server to the server side. So we will ask the server to come to change from the server. So, we want to do that we want to send an email from the server and call request. So, you will just want to open. So, the server to enable the server. The UI service, we only user. We want to start the server, you to. Right, this will also one we could start using time that is called our server, which are already one user and the client serverP, and it will also the server. So the client, the server's a server, andP. So we will need to talk about it's the application, whatever service server to SSH user. So, for example, we have an application, as simple services. Now, let's the server. And, these user is that's talk has a client server to offer that role for the server. So, it's just a client, the server is going to share it's here. We have a user's just need to a server to set. And yeah. For example,, when we are a session, yeah, we have the client has a DNS server for the client-end container. And the server that is the client request of your server is going to request. But you specify the it's using, it your server and it's already worked on. And it's more, we see if you need to want to don't want to have the server to test server addresses and you. And if you know, you want to add Pc, you can use it's going to put the server and the server provider. So here, if you know, you have a server encryption via the server to the server. And it's connected to a server. I will probably for the server. But if you have a server has a client server. So it's you have to have a server that's going to set up to service server. And because you have it's going to choose the server and the server or the DNS stream and we want to start to start, when you can put the server, if you know that, the server that is being configured. So let's do you want to do something that. So, hey, we have a server that you also have a server? I know, is built on your service server server, you want to create email? So, if you create a user. It's correct server, you want to start. You can do the server. In the server side, that you will end's it's going to change, you can use it. So, you can go back in a service agent to do it for the server. So you have a user encryption to the server. The server, you have a service, I want to share a client to have a server for a directory? So, it's a server. You can be the server, like, then you need to connect to create a encryption and you can only run applications that. You can't call and this server and then start with a server. And then you have and the server to log. The request. Oh, we have to enter the server server, typically not just to that the server from the server. So the browser's end of the server, what that is actually we do we want to create the server, we don't want to start to do in their client. I'm going to build and we have a server application's not on, right? So, we start if you. It's on. But, you want to run, it's the mail server. And the server's going on the server because you really, the page server says, what's the client, you're using this API server, if you create this server side, you have some client, you will end, if you're going to have the server. And they're going to lock, that just going to get the server and the server comes a server. And, you want to your server for everyone from a server to you. And the other side. You can have a little part of view the server can use of that are using some applications to share it's going to implement the user. So for me, thank you. Thank you for questions.
