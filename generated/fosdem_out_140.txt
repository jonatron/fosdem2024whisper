 Hi everyone for a talk about what we have in many years ago that one is just for having a bit on a few years ago. So I'm going to talk about this. So the next talk was over here. And I'm getting an hour of co-Fi is a JMAP is running very quick introduction while. So first of the Raspberry Pi 2, and now I think the first step and the University. And then here I'm going on this year. As you can see how to accept this port, okay, is going to give you a bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit to introduce a little bit of an example that is going to go at the last year. So you can see which is the last year of a few more things I'm going to explain what I'm going to what I'm going to step, to take a talk about how I'm going to keep. How can you take a talk about a little bit of an open source front is going to introduce a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more than mine about the Fos from the first part of 3Dy is the first. And I'm going to show me some of the middle from a year. So in the first I'm going to go to talk about the FOSDOM 2024 because I'm going to me. Okay. And then I am wondering, I'm going to be talking to talk about the morning about that I'm going to talk to be a little bit more about 4th. And I'm wondering, I'm going to be wondering, in C++ release here at the first year I'm going to talk about me. And it, I'm going to highlight that's a few of two years ago. What's the team for a little bit of our open source projects, in this panel. And I'm going to switch along this panel. I'm going to speak about the room and I'm going to be here about is first one to be here, I'm sorry, but I love this is going to be like to talk. And I'm interested in each of us about how I'm going to get into this, I'm going to point that I'm wondering. But we get an introduction to keep and I'm going to speak about my lightning talk, we have already going to talk I'm wondering. And I'm going to be going to introduce me to write this amazing code. I'm going to I'm going to talk about the first year. So what I'm going to talk about is I'm going only going to tell me here about. So if I'm going to explain this talk about the talk about the first talked to five years ago I'm going to to be an open up and another talk? Let's going to talk's talk about the engineer and I'm going to be a small today, which I'm going to talk about how do is what we make this in the challenges. It's going to present what we'd like to come to show you to see what I'm coming down to we want to talk about our best talk about here. I'll talk about this talk about the goal about it's what I'm going to what question about the first. However, how I've been here that we had. And we're going to think we've been kind of our challenges we're going to go back now in Go engineer. In fact that were only talk about this was doing is this from the founder of the agenda. I think that initially. We'll talk about this year about the years, we'll talk of the first iteration. We'll go to KPC curriculum who are also know, so this years ago, we're doing that, but it's actually the next member. So let us are welcome to start and we're, we all know there, we actually the time to get started using our community, but we are some excited to talk about the whole bunch of the communities, we have our challenges of our researchers. So that we're the thing that we want to do have a lot of a lot about it and why we're doing was just like this project we want to talk about our project. But new community in Linux Foundation, very, we have some people in fact that we're the way to do is really want to make our really a very important idea that we're working group with open source projects and think that the people that we have our team in the first place to do that we have a software in the whole project. We just going to talk about this work that we said that. We have some other people from last day. And I want to speak here and I have to speak about that's a open source project. I think we have some people to be in the software developed first challenge that we're talking and we have to ensure that I said that we have been think about interoperability in the world and the first time for electricity policy from the railway sector and we need to talk about people involved in Europe and in the foundation and we have to be great world for the largest government and we are involved in collaboration with the world. And we have been doing this European European Union of in the middle of our railway and the overall projects and we have been thinking about the Commission in the last decade of the market of the field. And then we want the German federal clouds like the EU society and we want to take care of German IT service and the EU Association and have also also in the first workshop of the EU and we get also have a collaboration and the European Commission is also have a level federal law and also interoperability and we have to basically one of funding to follow the market and we have a public agencies and we are of the company that they don't really. And they're of our open source, and they're not a market to kind of governance can keep the national value of a sustainable in a level of the last year, but we have a really good aspect where they have also have been a market and also act as this panel. So we have a business institutions that I mean that we have also need to produce electricity software and so we need to be able to be able to make money in national software. And we have a legal and we have to have to be able to have a lot of interoperability sector in this open source software sector of open source software and transport standards and we also the EU and then we have to have been having to have to do a much of the EU law and we are going to say we have to get into a European PLD is also with open source community and we want to have plans to a commercial organizations in a small law and as we have a really discussed in 2022, but this initiative to have been developed the US and the last year. It's a good so we could send the same as a decision as you to this in terms of the commission will be as you to electricity and so we actually a commercial sector to ask this information about this value from Germany. And this German German institutions, they are the regulation under the CRA and interoperability law in German law in 2010 is a medical rights and they don't want to a directive to be a citizen that the PLD are the question that we don't get in the law. So there are a third CRA, I was made at a time over progress that a very long time as a good and the overall law and our two years. But we have a lot of course in the commission and also in an expert from the commission and so currently in a third group has been very important and so many reasons basically the European Commission in the moment for us and and I think the law still works and that the the point of the law report was to the German law that law and i have developed law and that is also be a big law said in the directive and then in their law and the copyright freedom to actually allowed to do it would be a value of German law they can only law makers is just to be a law rights to be to be useful to power. So there is just had a open source was another law in the law that's like that the GPL but I was quite a civil licensee to exist as far after this meant that I was good to have to be an court and a year we have to support for that was actually have this was the copyright directive and we had it's a law to have achieved this idea of legislation because this law and in fact we were the I had a law that I saw just know which here which was no example there was a in the commission, so they have learned was a commercial state and that much money in general value of the German law so that GPL the negotiations, although the first law copyright and therefore I see is the copyright law I said in this is the court world and it was a law and what they are a law who just the law is it was to be the GPL the legislation that people was a copyright copyright law in fact that it was to really in there was just the copyright law and honestly was something very interesting person who is not really the notion of law and they know is a license law lastly open legal law. And the value of them are this question was that would put in law in terms of the commission but I had seen that had the holder isn't decided that was just been something that was done this we're the community and the law was not the third law in was the source law but they said well and then the law and they have had some legal that I had done was needed to ask what the copyright saying that person were because they were done by hand was just in any way to call to think it's mostly no copyright law for any copyright directive to the license said there was supposed to put that I remember that when in the fact the parliament were just not even could be honest. And and I kind is actually be needed so he was like then that you could be also had probably all the copyright and they were very clear part of the two years to understand because the overall and I thought that's what was the law but that they would be as far as it was the and they were just it was kind of the industry was actually brought me going to that it was very important to have is the copyright is probably great to have been a scope of the fact that it's sort of the law first sentence that could be done on the civil regulation that so I would be a a challenge so far as a person who who was saying that was said that was just have a good people don't know the political copyright space of they didn't really know what the law and they didn't know but they were like always said before they had into it was in the copyright holder to have a copyright and they had to think was in and they didn't always know to go and we probably don't even as much up to the person who was still don't know but I was a copyright directive of the whole, the only had made that they asked for just said they were so they were a copyright parties you could be so I was always had their public the copyright sort of the license and the copyright sector as a so just told them had the commission is really been made was the federal society and then they had because you so they were an issue of space and they were just had a bad value of the commission and we didn't actually take care of the world which could say the copyright we had been wondering that they were a copyright and in GPL law it was for they were there was in that had good to the fact that actually there was a copyright license law said that the copyright we got legal product really thought the methodology that you put the law and the license that they could be it didn't just know about the issue in this is a copyright value because the law as many copyright that was no law, because a court was done to the GPL license that also a GPL is a copyright law and also part of a law and that the copyright and of the copyright policy know that was what was very the copyright in what people who was actually had told people who actually had to get away to a court said um and they had not say okay as to stop and there was in the law called that she was actually a legislation was said this so we had more aware of the copyright authority to have had to be a value that everybody who had the value as an space because to law law, which was at least for the TPM but they were just because I have, we could make their mandatory law field and they told the copyright rights of these copyright bodies in the knowledge that the copyright and they had been able to was a license that the scientific law and there was a copyright value as it was important in that the first or in the GPL law they would be the license and they've had been forgotten that was just had had it. And he was still had more regulation, so like to have the law was just had a law so the law is not going to be to actually required that for the fact that. And so that was a is that one of this, you can be interesting issues to say that we're doing a scientific law to think it and that it was called GPL was really a legal work not done that we did that the law and we had a copyright in Germany to actually had to be at we have a long time to be the TPM that were any end of the technology to keep, but in terms of the act done so that a critical law to be a law was designed for the CRA has been designed for the law. And have got only of American law in the law and then that the law is in this law doesn't get in copyright law and the license that the license doesn't be secret, because no only only be the law would be to an license law, this I think it's a license in law was not done in the license but it was in the license. The copyright law is a copyright for the law, but it's in terms of copyright the copyright court, they didn't just never to. They have to ask and a licensing. So it was considered as well, those law then they didn't even fit in the German law, they were the copyright was at the commission was not seen the license to get to be done in and it was that they was a copyright regulation in an legal law law to more from law in the GPL. But you could be incorporated through law companies that was, which did at a directive we had the court. It was actually that could be even well, just had we have a law a last year now had only because they had said that was a legislation. It was also my value of the copyright in law that people, you say, was a licensee no law, you cannot, you know and you know the court, and the licensee was the
