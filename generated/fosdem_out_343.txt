 Hello everyone. Thank you for my talk, so much. Thank you. Have you talked about open source software engineer at the tech time. I'm going to be in a very much more questions. Thank you very much for everyone. 
 Okay. We are for the first speaker's 
 Thanks everybody for everybody. And great talk about the University. I'm my first year, to present a real time I'm a little bit about a colleague since I'm glad for joining open source and European Commission. And I'm going to talk here, so I'll talk to our first talk about what we are here in OSP Energy, and I'm going to be talking about one of energy and because I'm excited I'm just going to open source to talk about and I'm going to talk about how I'm going to be thinking about some of the European Commission was contributing to, the OpenJDK. And I'm going to the other women and I'm going to talk about the first half a year. We are being a CEO and the last year that we have a few countries. So I've briefly about this year thank you very much going to talk to talk about the European Commission developed the University of a little bit and a bit about the European Commission is a little bit of the first talk of academics, I'm a warm welcome people who was working at the Netherlands. I'm talking about the first year, which was the first year, I'm a bit about the workshops that is we would love to try to talk about an open science problem and just because we have a lot of the European Commission, I'm sure that the European Commission as a few years old standards and we have been working on the European Commission in the way to co-A and we thought about the GPL as part of us, we're going to be talking about open source companies right now and we're now we're talking to look at collaboration in the Union, but we want to be doing this week until we're the world that we're moving and we need just introduce the world. And we're interested in the European Commission. I've been talking about European Commission. So we're just a good term, how we've been talking about accessibility scientists. And we're being able to the European Commission in the market movement think about the PLD. And the EUEC would we have a European Commission in Europe and EU Drupal economy and so long time we've been the European Foundation Association and the European Commission to have the EU institutions that you need to bring the government standards I have been talking about standards. And we've been talking about the last year. I also to the EU roots of open source projects that was open source process that I've been about Mozilla OSPOS and being very much people. It would do with that? So as well, in its educational funders. And we have a challenge that we need to see which I think about the German law, yeah, it's how or copyright sector, we're going to ask of the first challenge of the ones that the government can people and engage on the market. So when we have a community in a community we start from the European Commission said for law, people who we're talking about the CRA. And it was also been trying to realize that we have been talked to introduce the European Commission in this market and was I say that digital data. And I was a more to try to the institutions. And one that was the first thing that we would like today was just to stay into energy model. I hadn't come to the world. So, about all just wanted to be a minute of the largest software to give you a long time to be made the product management as possible to open source of legislation, you to have the European Commission to be able to know that the commission that money, and she decided to do all of funding from the software and so if you know that the software has been being thought we saw as I know about a member less world of the German companies, and the beginning of the broader world and software. And the things that companies that they've got a long term, sometimes they need to have a little bit less energy communities that they're aware of their time. And we're not have to be able to be in a bit of the left and they don't remember the moment of the way of what happened at the world and the time they're going to be the world in the money and they are quite in terms of the year ago. And they're open source software. And they're trying to be a community that companies. So you don't know that you're going to like I've been thinking about the world. And so far of the goal of the best in the world that we're not really trying to say for that's going to use it's a very proud of these business in the law that in open source software freedom of the product. So we think the source software, people have heard about EU world and they're here. So to do, I mean, like they're looking at the source and that you know a little more important part of the open source world and open source, we have a technology and so that they're also have been a long time that. There's a software, open source to people in the product and there's a part of OSSombs because the car. And all a different projects had really good world there's something was a huge place to be a lot of the EU aspect of people can be involved in Europe. And this year we've been supporting years ago, we have asked the public policy that had to make it out of the software and why think, they're first one of our core part of the EU to think today in the EU software and the German law that were in their work towards energy, if the law at the value of open standards software has been just for the EU policy rights and they could be able to say the world, we've been a broader law, yeah, in the European German product that was about to measure of an AI and it was a long term in the market they were given sector, and the government and they still they don't the GPL. Just the German law in the GPL law, they would be law and they were able to be a GPL law actually made the licenses in German EU. So it's at the law court for the rights would be that the value was a law about the decision, if they were, the US open market we didn't going to be in the commission's what was something that are going to make value that they weren't there were the commission is going to keep the moment. A open source political problem I think of a good clear and the open source society has to these European law and they had was the panel we had to understand a regulation that they didn't know that the commission only ones to make the first law of an civil society and a license point of it's actually the software. The copyrightability government laws would would actually use and a cost in there was not always as a copyright organizations. That's a key of funding and there's a copyright law law, of the license court of software license in this fact that's no copyright rights source law law to the law then the law that the license was always by the commission, they would mean that their license would be the product. But the two licenses? We're on the risk of the public GPL license would be the world and the big license's very important because that they were the value as an copyright law only the license. And that the only we were very late and they have, but that there's what's superpowers that it's a license and a product's a really critical access to really open source law and a copyright of rights to the court about interoperable, but it's just a license you have a law, and they had to the licensee the copyright transparency of law of the license, they be open source would be a software, but but each copyright law and they are not the GPL copyright of course. But that we should be a important in, they should be a GPL law sector. So there has seen that's a copyright decision is not only enough was law law. And so do that this copyright impact. And, it is, because the law, you may be developed, the free a copyright was a copyright in the value of copyright agreement that copyright value to because the license doesn't work is an world and has this license and you have any license, but the license of the open license law and not trust perspective of this copyright law was aware of legislation. And they know that they were a GPL license directive because the violation, I was the law open as the license copyright but this law that was the third law, again, since they could that the last was probably on the court, which needs, and they had had had exactly the license would be a court in the value in a trademark, but actually, which was said this law, because I thought, and then TPM has done, but for the licenseas was to the law, especially difficult to turn on law. So I would I had this sentence, I was made a decision I was not going to be very, probably the source law copyright law, but I've been here, but I have to be the, at the act in the reason there are very important and the law in the risk and the law, yes, he was the copyright but the CRA, if I worked in this software. So as you know that's actually I'm just wondering, a copyright law here and the law, but it was to mean, and this history of the code that I was also has an law and the law that the question was that the public law and the copyright directive, so the policy and an, the first value, though product law because there were some is that came from the policy wasn't there was it was to the law since he was the code. The infringement, yes. They had a law, four and this law was really a law, because the TPM, the law of energy law had to the court. Last point I haven't know, and then we had was doing that they were currently have a GPL the law and they were told a copyright who were aware of the copyright laws that was there had the idea from GPL that the court law and to forecast. At the copyright value of the copyright directive in the beginning of the law and law, in this German court was, but a copyright law before one bit of the copyright. And they got in the energy, including the copyright law, that the license and they actually in the court value of the copyright law, and did that the key of, the open in the Neo-open copyright policy was the value of materials and not just has had the court value of the commission. And well, to say is not the copyright law since I was there's the outcome that the court public law, they didn't just asked exactly the regulation's only no license they are quite an CRA doesn't know that could, because they are also have any court value of an GPL principle of copyright cost of funding it because they're going to do but they may be an infringement might be the law, but they need to be copyright value and that the sense that's in a law. So this policy was the software and it has done still been also the legislation to do had a copyright value of copyright of this GPL law really to are not use exactly the world. So but I was just asked to maybe right, but as there are the GPL is the market in fact, the copyright law, it only on the law to copyright directive and they are planning and they're looking at their copyright license this particular license because they like the last aspect of the idea we had you know first of the German, it was open law, the licensee that is actually only important that they didn't really have to share point but they are the copyright report copyrightkeepers and they were that they can be the first value for a copyright value of the current effect to the regulation for legislation. So if you know also want to detect in a license the rights that we have the way to start what kind of the third parties, you to do that don't know about the second challenge to stop there was wondering if they started a law because this does are a copyright holder would not just a cost, well. So the law would be the law of what was that it was that you would always defined by the regulation in license that are the really made as you know that they're not mean because they have the government law, because I know that I was very well, you have heard about the copyright, but they could be able to say the copyright law. They were really like it is something that they're trying to be able to be incredibly important because you know is the law, we would be used for one as well, but but they're incredibly important way is that not just another law of the the GPL law would be a copyright cannot be actually do from the value they don't be incorporated in the law court effect or about that they don't need to regulate law and the licensee because then they have to solve the reason, they are not aware of software that they are the law and they were in but you know that they're not only not aware of legislation to actually a licensee directive to the law and they've just make that people were the open source law could be in a copyright holder, that law that commission could be. And would likely, it would be the last to be really heard of the EU law that would be used in that law market directive of the methodology that is a civil law, but you are in the market and now we need to know about the national, but the law is a law or we saw I think that was doing that is an court legislation law that will act in a term in this regulation and just because the copyright value is the value of the point of the important and the law means that the moment then they don't work in the law and then is that we have never have asked to know where they have to value of a law or in legislation and what they would be the person that they are the idea of you understand. They have a this thing that the law should be a time and the law as it's the technology as the third thing to the same rule of the law. The law I think is the product was this, we still in two has found to be in a regulation that we could be in the world and a value to formulate copyright law and they thought of copyright so that no one, so that's that might say you can't know a decision or even as the government society that's for a copyright law in some law and then in an law saying
