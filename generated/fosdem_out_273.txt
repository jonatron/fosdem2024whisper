 Hi afternoon. 
 Thank you. Thank you very Thanks everyone. Thank you for the next talk. Thank you very much, thank you very much very much. Thank you very much for this present we talk. Thank you. Thank you to present you. We have both, for all these examples, to talk about thinking about the challenges. We have a company for data over next ones by the next? We're going to talk about the latest day, Openb. We're talking about what I'm going to discuss about the future? Do you, how you're a couple of the OpenV, I'm going to talk about FOS or a couple of years at the first talk is our talk about the second in this talk to present us about the good presentation, and I first of my team for the first last talk, the first year. That's very early FOSDEM and the first two years ago? We have is a big ones that we also the talk about this project with the OpenAPI for this area and I'm going to talk. I'm going to tell you mentioned. I'm the first time, three years of the folks at the name of OpenJDK 6. And also the end part here, which is a little bit of OpenStack project and the last year to talk about the agenda. That was a very good question where we did we want to be talking about it alone with the board and to talk about that do is happening on the years ago, a DDS, but we have a lot of the company could like 10 years ago, so many years ago, I'm just came in the years. And also a lot of a lot of software community. So I might is really think there's all right now there's and started by the open source community to be a couple of a little bit of problems of people for us from five years. So let me, so that are our community engineer around the last year. Who was a bit of the people that was something from the knowledge and I was how I was great company, and he was the first year now. Is there was an interesting. I went into the year, of 20 years years ago, but he was that I was then now a few years ago, which was people were also out of like it probably going to be a year and I was going to achieve with a great experience in the way to be the policy. And the world was there was like far spent at these people at that were people were there and said, I was no idea at that on what was at Red Hat support for that I think time. For the day, yes, since the FOSDEM was thinking, I was there was just got the project years and I was time. Thank you said, I was the room in the introduction, it was the other years ago there was to be really really interesting because the Commission and that was said we went on the court law in the last year, just was a cost of that were doing was just asked that took us because he initially, three and you that came up and was like a company was a new law. So 20 years ago and the community could be the German software law, they were mostly the lawyers's just had to the software rights the world that was mostly an incredibly legal license. And that was that was like the last year they were at the world. I thought it was that I'm going to do. He bought a year that was the funding for me. But we wanted to focus that, some first six months ago we had you had in the CRA law and we had a problem and they were talking about that was about it had all the past but the EU and the open source member of the beginning but the first year 1023 was an EU law was actually talking in this year was essentially that the parliament will be really important to open source law. These were around it was involved in the tech last year yet, so of the last year was the German law was originally since then I was released 2023. And is not seen as a long as long day the European Commission was in time. But I was wondering of the project but for example I was not told to solve both of this day. So when we reached a community, but when you were interested in the panel and the world they are going to people who was that we had before we were trying to have been working on their product. And we started to ask the people can tell us to have been to have this, like I had been a lot of the parliament could have been working on the car. But even in the companies. So, you know, if you know, you know, you know, people that, that are on many that company, they have been done just mentioned before people. It's not only for us. We have said, so more funding in the good for, but still just to be a kind of the beginning to think and of the policy. And the German law we are like the world, so we're like we can see what we have is in the law. There is, we're saying, both the people to make sure that we have the law we say, we call the public sector, the law, in the case they have said, and we're incredibly important for the city, and that's a society or their law, so that's where the license law, they care about the copyright law has a GPL because I said, and they're with government had the copyright directive funded in the policy, they are really been thinking that they probably a law Europe, from German law. And but you know like, for the commission. And we have been now that's like to share, there is and they give the license and so that the law and I think, right, just started the law law, no, in our law, as a copyright law by law, and the copyright of law economy and the law, in open law and we have the law also a GPL law in law in the technology, what. The first in the law, what that German law, is just said that has heard of copyright law in the law law, but you know. And so it, they will be made this copyright law that law, but they want to it by the copyright open regulation, but they are like this open open and in Europe government, and the opposite approach and said, but when I was the GPL law law, they are in the copyright law, and they are only the copyright, not, they have the US and they see that should make for the law, but they are basically. So there's a first, they will tell the term in the law, and still the GPL is used in the law or GPL law, their law, the gap would help to the Drupal directive of the world, and that still provide policy, or key of that the European commission is a given value of a to be long part of it remains copyright rights. And is, you, the law, and they could be kind of legislation for the work under the GPL and they have their license value and they are enough in the world that German law law in the lawyers that was the licenses that society that they weren't have the digital commission has said. These law, which has asked that far in the first people were at least two law copyright competition license becomes there is going to impact on the law and there of German law law, they have policy is no license. And then only one, so they were aware that license, at the copyright legislation so in law, I think they can't know that civil GPL law, the copyright law, they are mandatory and they might be like law in the license license, we're not, there is not enough to public copyright law, the open value, we know, to know about it's often. And that you probably, but it's not really good question that the market is the law, when anybody is not a GPL government law that there wasn't a really a copyright and then it was in license is to know this law and in and they're just no copyright open value to the GPL sector developed last bit of law or they should be to say that the license you know about the value of the law law that the technology is GPL and they are like to the GPL and the law on copyright investment as its law and they say that I think the value in fact, but the copyright is that they get this technology about the CRA has a copyright laws that a moment in law a software and law and the license policy said that law law, I knew that companies think on legislation, because she is being the copyright license in the big and license law, right and they were a licensee had to the license as companies to open software that if they always put their copyright policy didn't think that they will be in money. They are often came from the way. Why would be? They are also, or a GPL directive. And they have learned that they have a human rights of it in the data can the fact. And the last decade of course one of rights software model that they were just got done to try to get into that had a member of the law in the second law, but in the law, but the GPL, that the law that it was part of his law to I think it was probably would like think of a fact that was about that it was just they were very often in the right now. And they had to be a law, but they were about the legislation. But it was that's useful in law and they were like this was looking for the law and there were doing law license in the GPL law because they had asked for just the question. And they understand the European law in the law that court in Europe, they had no license licenses that political member of copyright licenses that they were just a law in the license. But we had been taking the value or this question's not they were speaking until they have heard that the other legislation who had to follow the regulation then we can be a whole law gap because and they were able to not been a directive in the law, and they were already were just okay, but yeah, so the license group was no longer because they didn't the effect but they're not the public law and they had the German law did as no copyright law and they were a copyright law also GPL does the energy law actually no termination for the commission has legal law, at the best place for policy value of the license, parliament and the copyright for the idea has heard that German policy law, right and they were meant not only copyright law can't always be the law happens in law and they gave that they changed in the sense. They do could have only be the money, but this technology they were not trust another aspect of open source legislation. I think I was a copyright law and they had also thought there was something and it was a Drupal that was also meant to, or do of copyright rights but they had a copyright infringement government said there were the risk but not so we did not saying this way to always some act any commission person didn't traditionally, it, we were taken a value of those law that was so it found things that the scope of the copyright world can necessarily made sense and then they had no matter in a parliament had the decision would be used to be so they had had answered the licensee came on the law and the commission that were never heard. We have to be found that wasn't a democratic law that they said, they had to think they were like law license that didn't the funding on GPL so it had found that's actually had a copyright law, but they were done to, but they actually they have been any of the license under the copyright was good report really's not not only value of them. So we were thinking that what they had kind of the reason and they had to be they didn't always wanted to accept that the value that's the copyright as an GPL is that that was the licensee was that she said that the commission, so they didn't want to handle the UK law in like everybody. Like at the case the copyright law. And they need to happen. And it was just doesn't a copyright is really it was wondering, but because they can't exist in the directive, they didn't necessarily have it with the EU commission. And they were incredibly quickly had the politicians that they cannot be able to be that we have so much cost actually been quite important because they were really have the copyright laws that they get this the commission would be a good as far they've made a copyright clause is difficult, that we didn't know what if anyone were as the UK fact that would have their law, they would be used to the funding to be the copyright had to be released by law but it's of a term, the person, very early law, not law value of copyrightkeeper. And they had no policies were in the second law, okay, which I had the law at have had the EU law didn't seen just didn't really matter where we had was that could have the knowledge of the notion that decision. And they were the law, but they would like the parliament there's the commission are asked, and they would be a law laws to public law, or even they want to the EU license-time law under the only standards that's like the CRA. And for a law they have an GPL license as open regulation, and they would not only be in the no copyright holder as a law, shall also in copyright in the GPL so honestly that person that's that they know on the license and we're so we made a copyright that they would be a notion that was a law people should be a problem, but it's important decision. And I haven't had to be a copyright law only the law in law. And they have potentially to copyright law, by the I think we
