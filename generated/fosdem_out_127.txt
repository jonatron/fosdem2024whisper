It's going to talk about the first year ago. So I'm going to talk about the project between the internet. And I'm going to have this is going to talk was able to focus on tech. And now. And we have here the focus on the first year, I'm going to follow a member of my thoughts at all, we try to talk about this panel. And we have lots of you're the next time on the 3. And so we have started from the last here. And you know the next talk was thinking about that we're going to just curious about the year for us, there, and this year here and I'm going to be here. I'm going to touch the meeting and I'm going to talk well. So I'm going to tell me and show the first talk is to you. You have, we have to start-uposia had to be the whole. And to be in the stickers in the picture of the room. First. We had to see how we had a couple of the next year ago. We've actually have to go back here and the end, you know, but that I'm going to the first, what we came to talk about actually done with a new thing to the new software and I get to look at the first year. And I'm it was going to do is the last year ago in the beginning. So and I was someone who was going to do we've been doing, I think we actually, I forgot to go to give us to give more people a few other people started a lot of the room and they're going to finish the people who had been doing have this and they were the guys just had a little bit where they're going to go back on all, but they hear that they're going to get the reasons often we really interesting because they've got this kind of the team and they've been working in the people who already quite a little long time and they're going to do and you're just get great person who can't think it. And they're just go to understand how we're as far come on open source app and they're going to get doing that they're going to do you've got some of open source community, or are really did you're going to see. So that I can't just talk about it. And that the thing is a little bit to be a little bit of open source community that we are working on the first the open source project was we have been doing this was the open source. So the day, we have a while we have been working with the knowledge. So for all work. We've been talking about that we were just need to talk to elaborate on. We have any of these folks, which wanted to create out this, we've been doing these kind of that we've been doing as a little bit about what we've said about the people, we're going to solve this done in our friends and we've got to share, we're going to do this thing. We're to talk this in the full time. We're going to talk about it. So that work we're an online. Since we're also have our presentation about, we have been trying to talk about open source people who has to teach our community that the open source community. And we're going with this talk about our ecosystem. We're just some people? That's also want to talk about this people the mission that we're doing a lot of the projects and our code, we have been really exciting product. We have to do a lot of people who actually're going to make a community for you know, we are doing not really going to ask at the things that the year. We're going to have an open source communities who are going to be part of people who actually talking on the things that we're talking about people from our project in that we're going to have funding. It's a little bit about our community. We're going to invite you're doing use a volunteer team who's going to look at the Drupal and one that. So, what's welcome to try to open source community have to get a lot of Drupal to share. So everybody. And so that's kind of people can come up and follow the community. So what we can be aware of work in a talk we have to give us to about. So there's amazing company for that we have done until you a focus on this time and we're here. We've already mentioned earlier that we're going to talk about how we're not just going to understand what you've been talking about what we're going to work on the open source data management like start our product. And we've put it and our community field of open source projects. There's not the most of our communities, in tech companies and we can actually need to share them to open source project in our culture from the right at the world for this, right. So the other software, we've got started in a community. And I'm going to do this is going to be a little bit of have a community that, there are talking about the product under source, so that are very important situation that would be as well as well. So maybe a problem we've been involved in open source software Foundation's not having a community needs to think are a lot of open source community and we've seen in the years ago. We have been thinking of the principles and we've had our community and we were trying to throw together in the world. What is we had in an open source community, and I've been a great project. We will be the open source community in Spain. Maybe, because there were about the first of knowledge here we could we have the last year. And we worked working on our community where people who were thinking about it was really been writing open source team and I think that we were in this year ago, of these days And I didn't know that are going to say this year we have been just getting the community and I wanted to go into it to be interested in the community. And we now we are also have something from the world and so that's that this project was not to have the EU institutions in the world. And we've had to think it was a long time and they've been in the license and there was made it was a young people from the only really has a community. And usually had to do this. And so one of course we have some people who have seen, we've been doing the commission, we've been working with us, which of people who have these European Commission, the time. So we saw this session movement about a good countries in the European Commission-hour was very long time. And we're going to work on the commission of the European Commission came into the best thing is probably know. So that we had this year. I was as expected if the EU value and you kind of doing this community who was not only one of view of the law and he was that was not been a sustainable. So basically been a regulation, you had the data scientist that was used in the first of legislation and now can see that a long came in the last year. And so we had been working on and that is about this is just was on the foundation by the technology where they had to make sure of different years ago. And then moved on our society were just decided to the German society by the public law and that the market to the parliament were able to us to do we had been working on the law and they were a German law and they wanted to say that they are having a value that the commission were participating to have been paid for and they kept in the value of law rights of the fact then they had the law, and they were the law States that they had to be stored the companies too free software could also the legislation has. They were quite as the software in fact that was the first legal law, there were almost said that that they did that they want to become law policy were just the copyright licenses and they were like the parliament will have said that you know is not allowed, but they've developed since they were in the fact that they got a way that has gone from the law in London might be not look into law which makes it was the CRA in the copyright sector world in the beginning of first place that they didn't actually have four directive. They never had given point, you were still know the law to implement value or to be a copyright value of civil law to sort of a directive that society about the court and then they could be money in terms of money. And that's in source decision would be part of political regulation to having a well, but basically the copyright law act in copyright law that's often was the law that regulation that policy is really important to be not that they were really do at the decision so of the way in the GPL that the German in the German law and they are copyright law is very hard because their, they are partially on law did not aware of the license court rights as an open source law that parliament that market so on open could be, and they discovered from practice of the commission I mean that law law and which gave a directive is to copyright law that they are in being part of legal law, and they have a the government sector has German license cost. The public law do made right a law in law of a commercial law was only standard law in the court law will become decision that then they are connected to the copyright holder. And that license law is there really in fact that government the European Commission that when you also brings to understand a copyright cost of the licenses out and act if that the law of legislation is a government law court law law so they are allowed to the value that open license should have much at only source copyright rights on the government laws was removed the license infringement and they could be copyright of copyright legal law and they've worked in product. We have to read that they're saying that were open access to know so they are going in the market and the licenses in this law copyright GPL but the world, you know what people is saying the product key to that, the license is the source license and market and just for this always that's important problem that by being a legislation, let's when the public license that they were how not free world are going to the law or the space to be done by women and it doesn't always fit in the directive. And that I have a copyright is this is copyright rights as well. And so you know that this law has the copyright law was on the law to was not something I personally think that the German licenses of you would be able to actually a copyright of copyright holder, but it's people there were done in German law to think about copyright law and one of law law was not just in fact that time that the copyright law law are that is not done a in the law and first clause in the copyright law and he was working GPL law and had that it was the copyright key group was a law to that means, just a value of GPL directive because we still they had the copyright thought I'd be so that they are in policy was really see the law and they had in the fact that I was the license directive. And I was one of what was now are the software and could have an issue didn't really have to to be working on court so or just a license and the GPL laws of the product in the negotiations began, going to government when they were to be first we're taking a bit that a major law and they could be a directive and they were looking for a policy that they were more people who had a policy to be a law in the US and well after that point where they are a legislation it has had as well and we were not part that point but they had a civil law by said there was like no of fact that they are a problem that there is the company because they got a legal copyright law forces a law would be the law has been made some policy happens and now they are copyright has not coming in the German law key and they were worried that nothing for copyright law. And it was a policy policy as well and they had. I was actually know that point of the law and so he would be much more not going to be a policy that that there was the GPL and we have like the organization that they used into a directive means that was not that they were quite a copyright sector being a civil law about law in German law that they had what she asked to really had had not that we'd like the copyright copyright copyright person was the world was just in copyright directive and as something that they had done again and they had to have a certification to be a legislation and he was a free
