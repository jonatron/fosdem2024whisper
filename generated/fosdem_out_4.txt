 So, what you can call all, how we get some problems with. And you can do that? All right. And, we can do it, to have to do the stack your function. So in a little bit of a list of ways. We need to make that we want to do this thing. So you can do some sort of little bit of a little bit of some of the tools which may have this, but also for example. It's quite challenging. As you have three bytes from your API. So it's not no things that we have the code, we call is very easy to do and then we have time, we want to do this. So, we want to do this. And you can look at this type of a lot of inputs. So you can kind of dependencies. You can have to set in the tool called pattern with code. So the user error is basically see here. So for can see, you just click the first time, I'm going to be the new type. You can look at the file. So this is the user, just write. You can see the server here, see the file. You can see if you have another file, it's not nothing that I have to accept something. And here. So for this is you can you know but, if you can see exactly see if you can see how to select the path. So for each other thing I'm going to start a memory is to tell the name, you how to give the table. I'm just wondering, I'm going to see the table. So on the question. So this is going to end. So in this is the question is a question is like, the right? Okay, I'm going to call, so we have this kind of the left. So, but I'm going to make sure that's going to see here I'm going to write a lot of that. So, here we have a good question, but we've seen in the question. We'll see how to, I'm showing the right now. So, like this is that you guys have the type of size, I mean, but here. And what's the real-down codes, it has a really important thing that a row of the example, and so I'm going to look for your transaction. So what what I'm going to do this is going to say I was, the search, I'm going to start using a bit of the next slide of the left. And I'm going to me, I'm going this is to show you're going to get the inputs that I'm going to make a block. So I'm going to see how we're going to send to look at it's going to create a change a bit more than the idea. It's going to understand. Mambo does it's not really an instruction, when we have the error model that it fails here is going to be copied, but we need to make this thing because if you're going to do is we do this but that you can we're going to ask the first element there's going to get into a model and see that's a number of the description. So that are you see that's a look at the future. There's the code that are a good point. Maybe you are the code is all all good things that the variables that we have the most of time. You don't know about the code that is the language. But there are the beginning, but there are some of the implementation. The question is the time is the code that we have is going to move the way of the performance. So for the idea is the question is going to how well. And if we have some ways to have done this work for example there and that you can be done here and that you can also have a language which is that I want to show that is open sourcing code that it's the main model that the code gets, the code. And when you can be available. But it's going to actually a little bit of course you can be more than I'm working on the second step out there. It's a Python. It's a single thing. It's really the C code of these are a very important job we're going to mean. And as an a C++ code. But it's how to look, we have a whole code and if you can see that we can do not. That's a lot of what we are we are going to start creating code that we're going to do. We're going to look at the test the end of the C++ code we can do and we have? We need to mention a lot of way it's happening on the code that in the DAGs of the C++ code that there's going into CSCs, but we want to get into CATS description and say we run through there, so we have the future. And we've got the most of the future. We're going to provide an agent that a native libraries. We want to give the product community, in our features. So we are we're going to end we need to have a solution for our community. On the things that we want to load our open source and we took that we have a lot of our need to kind of tools. We're going to say, we have enough. We don't we have the ones to make it is going to know if we're going to switch the community's going on top of a whole type base request. It's going to work in other ways that we have to be quite a long and we're going to build community. We're going to be back to want to talk about those tools that we'll talk about what we're going to make the product set the resources. So if you've been doing, you're going to get all the most of these different kinds of those are going to keep it. Maybe we're going to have much better. We're doing our knowledge that we'll be going to come back to what we'll be doing what we're going to make a couple of the tools and going to make that our needs to be surprised for people who want to be going to be able to get the real time as the code. So we've got to talk about the first time to go for us. It's going to our things where we're going to present the end of the most of our community, we've going to happen in our community. Here we've always know we'll be happy to work well. And we're in the people don't have we're going to be going to be talking about happening and a lot of thing. I'm asking that I'm going to talk about this first one of those people will, we have a lot of the future in the tools and the right and that we have some organizations in the future and they're going to be there's're going to talk to be going to be a lot of open source code in the features that we need to introduce us to be able to be easier to do. That's people are just kind of the software engineer to achieve research that we have a level of the developers. And we're doing the next week being, we're going to take care about? It's going to be very often in a great for people at the question. And we really, we're trying to be thinking when we're thinking about where they're giving us to make any people and they're going to keep going to do that. Because we have been doing that company to look into. And we're trying to be trying to keep going to benefit of people in the person, I going to want to start to get the organizations than the project that we're going to do that the way to look a really we're going to make a new software to do We keep looking at the time and we're going to make it for those people as well creating a lot of work under the product and we have a very often think about accessibility and so many of the outcome we're going to keep working on the great community but we can be able to have a definition of the public security scientists of the community, we have to have a community they're saying the world, like to do things. And we need to have four people to, people understand the community, we're doing the product, why we're often have very good software engineer with people to be talking about that. So what we're interested in the world of the people who I'm going to be coming in this group that we have did we can do is like funding, we come as a bit of corporate product and the decision in a moment. And I'm going to say I'm going to focus on the world of the open source developer of a software is happening. I'm going to talk to be about the whole person and it to speak about in our scientific work and what you very important. So we have to make sure that a little bit of stuff we're going to work under the product for our community. We're going to talk about today in the world. So instead of course the open source community, we're going to give it's going to keep in the open source software that we're going to be really a culture of open source funding for. And so long time to start working on the first time. And I wanted to start of this was wondering, first one for a little discussion about today. And I think what there's this is a year to get in a lot of what we're going to discuss for a little bit of people in over. And that you're being in the first talk I've been going to talk to be going to be putting the money in this in the project. I said, I think about the last month? I've got the first of the project, and many other one of the community industry to be a big community, of the whole companies actually because I had these workshops, oh, we have come on. And in the community, we've got to influence there were completely open source community and make this about their own product research company and so we've thought we also been doing what are mostly in the world, you can actually know, but we've got to get started to a lot of the people, because we had to maintainer of expertise in Blockly for many people and with people who decided to keep a lot of those people doing their projects and the things that had a lot of people who were able to get a bit more people we did as a group in the interviews didn't really take care about this panel and how they get the people that people saying they want to give you're a free time to be ready for this issue that you to show you know that to avoid looking at the right that if you know everybody who said, the community saying that people which might need to do we're kind of companies in the people who who are trying to think. And this in the question? It's going to have a challenge they're going to know, you've released the last one of the lastly, which was in the person that there are like okay, like the right? Yes, I think the community in the good person who did we need to have taken into the open source room to be very much for the EU and we're talking about policy field of the product we have been also the US five months to share with the end, we've got in all the OZEG at the conversation towards the last year to focus of the second year for the project. And there are the year and so we have been working on-time community. In fact, since they are the beginning and we've been using the same thing that we see all, the challenges out how they're moving to get the most people have said, but they're going to be happy to be doing to make their expertise on the sort of the community. And they won't, when they're doing the software and they're trying to take the users, but they think I think they guys are even see, that we're just just going to be not talking about when the things like we're describing the market organizations that they're going to get into other people think about the law and they're going to people who are in a little bit of a bit of copyright fees in the principle and there's much there's a nonprofit organization, but they're partially announced it's another world where you know that you think that they talk is a lot of the main point there is sort of what you've knew about the software, and nobody had a copyright and they're trying to be the role that you're trying to make data in the market and everything that market in terms of law of the nature was the end that was like half time of government is sort of the scope of in this open source And I knew where they're about the business law on a license. And they do I've got the license because they have to be a given a person in the value was the law or do that the GPL open source law that was a copyright and they can be pretty well as time and the German law's the license it doesn't the law, but they're all together and they're not as well so that they're just have been a law that there were there's a key. I have any law but they have done doing an incredible value of that the right at the court and they should also do know that what the rights and therefore copyright world and then they were in the source they would like uh so they are to know that were that stuff. So they said, so they were really open source community, they're just say the software were a good for that were very much exactly that they've got a copyright law in as people for people to go into their legal law and they had, and know they find that um they had the right way to just going to put through their law and this law directive the Tpu. They could be a copyright and they didn't think we don't think about the big commission and they decided they're going to be so they would need a law don't need to take the policy market to be concerned going to think yes this way they get the world that point that they have been in. We need that they want to give a the I think it. And you some organizations that we have been doing the sector in a full German government and there is by a law, so they're a law and those federal scope of the law law and they should be useful to that was not affected by law license copyright as a software but they were paid for the law and they were so they don't just can't have a copyright and they have any government clouds to it and they are the GPL would be the law of someone
