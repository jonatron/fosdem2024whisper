 Hello, today we talk at the first talk, she has this talk about Posh. So thank you very much for this talk, I am our agenda, in France and Chris Sarics. So I can did I am now cover a well. I'm a talk about our first of the day. I am here. So everyone. We are I am I started to talk about the first time for the first talk, which is one, many years ago, I am in a year. I'm going to introduce me from a little bit of the first time for the University of a few years ago. And Mar and I am open source software projects with OpenJDK, a year. And I also with our last year. I I was a long half last year. I'm my name of a lot of the story. And we have also had to inspire us to discuss a lot of people to be a few years ago, which is a standard, but what I'm part or also a time, and I'm going to talk about the most of the next year, this was getting different thing after the moment. And so, the first one, I decided in the only the number of the future at the community were a few different news, but I was very good. I was captured a great presentation. And I was showing a little bit more on the beginning of the moment. And last year, some of a moment we decided to discuss a little bit later. And I'm going to talk is going to explain for a little bit about it was wondering of a few people at the open source software. Other questions, because now. I was a bit. So I'm not just a great presentation. And if it was here, he was, there was going to be a little bit of money, I found it's an official Commission. So the point for me are only thing that I was the funding in the years or I started a small things were a software. So this is, the best question was really important for companies in this year in the time, I was the fact that did I didn't thought would like I'm able to kind of the issue, and a bit of thing to do in a software and I'm going to see here and the other first because it was the first year. The focus is that I wasn't just as the beginning of the time for the software engineer in the other thing was moving on the time. So to get the things, there were I was a few years, looking down the upstream and the US and then the heart was doing the time to do we had a long term of what was asking for coming from the world and we see a half a minute, the Drupal software. Because we had the negotiations and there was basically actually there were in a year, really got a lot of in the number of various group of years ago. And then we had a lot of people who was a bit more what they had a policy in September before we had a lot of the legislation. They were having this technology and then it was created by a lot of time now do was super well, they actually got a good question, the middle of the world, then we came out of the world, so we also have to get into the same time. So we had to think the past or I want to see it and we were able to do the year which was thinking about people who came into the community that but we have been working out we had this, after a little bit of our science and we had a more people don't have to look a time and all the success, so that we have said, how do, this talk was going to talk was going on a very hard to be able to do we could have to see what the first iteration of being used in the communities in a lot of the challenges that were they're going to be done and very glad that he got been used a lot of companies who used in the commission. But when they were going to think we've got this was from the product and I said and they did we have heard of time thinking about that the product they were the product on the work on the sort of open source software projects. And they're kind of community and everybody been around the main project we've been made at the people have come to be to the product agencies that's a way to encourage people that you to become a lot of people to have to encourage you know, and this as part of people who have a problem that they're thinking about the most important thing they think is just some people that just came out of free software, and there was to spend in the community of the things that they have a very clear law, in the point of Blockly were the product developed in the ecosystem developers to our software were a small economy because they were like funding to be sure that's in a lot of the way to the copyright science or there's the CRA and so they see who're like right to make a copyright laws called copyright person who are essentially to the time place to us, the money and they can't always be a copyright was not the fact that was it has been done over the industry could be good company of the reason what that many software and the person to get into what we just is like kind of in the moment and that other person they're in the ability that we could be a so far of thing in case that they are just to know exactly how does not just think have the commission would be open source law of that people and the first time the law to get back to it and things actually would be that they have a public rights and they've been a commercial a violation of the license impact for a copyright copyright law policy in the license and they've got been had to that people can't get to figure to understand at that they're just saw for legislation so they can't think copyright license they're not the public policy. And their law have been doingable product of legislation and then we've been talking about the fact to deliver the copyright law regulation and that's in this time to rights in law on German liability. And open product, we've got those laws did that was from the world and in practice, there were a copyright certification that they're being a first decision in the world and the industry money that I'm here so that we have to keep the parliament. And I've been talking to tell you to the copyright law group that's a regulation was just a civil society and we have been buying something that and then we aim to say that had a way of those legislation that we've just from the organization that I said we've got photos from there. So that we're basically started to operate the organization and we don't want to do it in the next part of you're just need to get back to, how they didn't remember the commission to do you know what can set in the policy and the way, what they could have it open and they're trying to make it's going to open source in a trademark and what there's going to be working on this in the effect. And I can we have missed it like there that has been our first and that we just be a commercial market could be an organization and they've got to have this and if you don't know how we have a good they've been sort of the negotiations want to get care of like they're sort of the parliament to just a legal to be able to a bit more robust or less policy. And that that that does is the value to understand the problem that policy to do that we have a really have time to be part of what the court that we already've got an open source from the commission came out to get all of the only problem person who were three people who were doing there were I've heard when we could build on the time and also asked a different Commission who believed that we're going to ask that's about sort of work for the car. They've been wondering about the years of photos and they need to be the Drupal team who got to encourage us to think of AI who gave it at the world. We have about elections who's not been living group and who looked at the moment and I thought the last few people in a few months before somebody was going to give you were trying to thank you how to get the most of the conversation to do you're trying to do you. That's going to be the knowledge in there's in the future? And they were exactly what I think is we are the ones that we saw in a lot of the only one of our current initiative. And yeah is the question. And we come here we had to keep the team and we've heard about what they're doing was trying to be made the past, there we've already going on the kind of a lot of code that going to actually came into the time we have been the first time was actually did was just going to keep the one little bit to be in the time, because they're going to continue with the world. And so I was wondering a couple of a project that the different project was just as the community came in the number of years of the first thing to ask us from the speakers and I'm going to go through the people and I'll get some people in the digital product that they're going to take back in a bad years in our perspective where I know that we've gone back to work on the one of open source communities, but it comes to influence. And then I think it was to like it and I was probably not only but and I didn't know what I just to think that and I said, like the first, the question was just to you was not know that's very important to get confused. And that's the last year but I think there was all of the people were a good, but we know what about so many companies just wanted to think about the things that what if they were doing are being a lot of the talk to go and the way we was to make sure that we only have asked me for quite sort of these talks in the reason that they're trying to do. Many people saying that the people who had like, so we thought he's going to have done a way to have to say exactly what to be going to do is a little bit more interesting I think that I wanted to be kind of the tech. I did he didn't like six months to speak this. And they have heard about a bit of the years ago and I haven't know that was just went into the people who already had to think we came up and we have a long time-day thing. The money was the thing has put that really a little bit more important in there were going to be a lot of the time a year. And it was a good company like I think about this was just because I was a bit of the world ago and they were talking about three people and I don't a little bit of the discussion to think I was thinking about the one of the ones to be being used in the outcome that was a long do I was really don't like five years ago. And some people and so they are you know who's worth you know that. I there are wondering about 10 years ago, we're some of coming and the one of these ways to the number two years ago about like over years ago. We have several years ago by the thing we see about three years. We need to have to share code so that we are going to work. We have been working on the first time. We are going to introduce the first more people to make this, but more questions, we also in order to make it's some people. Great, but we might be able to do that we have plenty of the first of our community-to-ups. We have a half a open source software engineer, but you always heard about, and the main people who are focusing on the reasons how to use, so that is not you can get started to your software engineering world and the release and the future. And that I think about the community, the most of the software is what we can we've been done in a long as a community. It's like let's all, if you know too quickly, I mean, you're doing with the community, that's do you know, but you know, you're interested in the world as we often there
