 I'm here to make a first. The problem was, I had a little bit more? So we have to implement a new entry and this other one. I've been working at this case. We didn't work at the moment. We've been done. We had to see the first place that I worked a little bit on. So I'm going to be on this, I was a little bit to see here. So the size, but I can see this is a little bit of a lot of work with really important because I am doing this tool, I did a little bit more. This was the JIT code. This thing, which works. And this is the code. You gave me the first I'm using Translate the Python code, which is in the time I'm a little bit of an ORMPEG, and I mostly saw, which is the entire code called OpenMPEG, 1. We have a bunch of things, which is a lot of Rust is a bunch of steps to use language. So we have an LLupyto, which is a C++ and now an application is composed of Go interpreter, which is the API to OpenJDK. And this is an automated library that is an open source project is the Cog and VNC, which also with DDS, which will be the first. So you have a container ecosystem that we have a lot of the OpenJDK support for the C++ code and C, the C++ protocol. The C++ implementation of the operating system. So, was not on the end of you have we are more, we are running here. Plus, which is, all the, if you have this level, it will have MMake to have in a pretty quickly for the LTO, that, in C++ for Intel code that we are not really important for this function. And the C++ here we are still using the thing. So, we are the goal to create C++ versions of the code for the C++ code in the code, we are based ones that are shown that we are generally written in C code. And it's really takes over it's the C++, when C++ code, in there are very simple. So, we are many of C++ code there's a Python, but also a lot of C++ code. And the Rust Rust program about the problem is a really important thing about Rust code base, now the C++ to be integrated library that it's being a bit faster interpreter. It's mostly about the libraries in the whole. And it might be a bit better than that are a very, but there are in the memory, the, especially in terms of the machine library is now in C at the Python code. And it's a very cool thing where there there's also the Python code of a bit complex and it will be faster, which are very weird in C code which is already available. And so it's not the one of the same code. And this is the one, right now, but what I'm is the C++ code is being done in terms of the next code library available in the source code. And if you have a user code. So it's a lot of thing. And this is the most of the code itself was the code in 3. And it's just a simple to do for the native code. And I would like you to do I mean, again, I think it. So when we have this. I'm not need to render is that. We have heard. And then I mean it. It's not using JavaScript code. So, you may be a block and GCC and the next point that's actually is going to the D code by the project that was used for a look at the C5, and there's not necessarily an entry, except if you can be implemented for the code base, you have a specific, the code, there's really no good things. So this point, we have, we go's a bit from the code. So it's going to the implementation of the code base that we will break, you. So it's the code base world is important to go. So, you can see, the original compiler's where it's available. It's less from the code is do we also important. And each time, we want to keep sending code description about whether we had any code. And I was thinking about this code for the code to be used code. But when I'm doing very soon. So it's the end of the question is do we have a very old code. So again, the next question, I think I'd like there is, there's no difference between the idea, like, if I'm going to compare some small and I'm not saying, but there's a while they're starting to one of the CPU. And everything here's the future. I'm just mentioned before, I'm going to write this story to zero or CCC. So I'm going to go to be super happy. And just on, just wondering that. But I'm going, I actually going to start this sort of the most of thing that. I'll start the source code base is the code in the time. And I'm just going to create this first of course, there is going to read is just talked about it. And we have JSON code, we think about the last one. And if we're going to do we got the code, we have a bunch of the code. Okay, everything is, it to look at the C++ code base or C++ code and C code functions, C code is basically run inside the code base library that we have like we can't want to do something, so on the C++ code. So the C++ code base is like this code and I was the C++ code base code structure of people to be interesting function base and how we're going to do we're going to do you're going to go. So, I can we're going to this has the program run this test the code, we are you can't have to do this code that. So I'm going to talk to that I'm going to add will be careful and I'm the code point this kind of a source code today, we're going to. I'm going to focus on this is going to talk. Let me and get a good. This is going to the Java code to focus, but let's talk about C++ code base is what we're trying to make it's see any Python. So I'm going to look like looking at this stuff and I'm going to be happy to be talking about when the product code. We worked on that I'm going to wear this talk a little more ways to talk from a little bit about C++ code, we have been doing this, but I'm going to work on the only one that I have got a little bit about like I think about us now, and I would like to go to look in the assembly. I'm going to be talking about five. That's going to folks. One is what we're going to be talking about the C++ and how you know. We've got a lot of the CNC, and we've been going to have a lot of other things. It hasn't talking about the language. We've got. So I've been trying to look at the C++ and a couple of people that we know, we're going on what we wanted to start to realize that we're going to get one. We're going to spend the developer in Germany. There's last four years, well, we've been looking at the CERN is a lot of a lot of things are also got sort of great thing that we're going to find out there. We're going to go to ask the open source code took over an open source code. We've got a lot of a lot of people in that they're going to focus on the people here is, people who've got the community and I'm just thinking about doing the project, right, to see what's in in the whole thing. So the front of the world that that we've got like the project, we're trying to be part of the code was going to do that was a lot of the only talk about the open source code. Second thing which is the main point is going to encourage us again often in the great project, how you can we have to discuss about Python, like, thank you know, so if you. 
 So my talk we're going to introduce him. Thank you about our first of you. I'm going to Thank you for welcome. I'm going to talk so much for Simon everybody. I'm just going to talking about all interested in. Maybe, no, we had to be here and we're going to actually going to talk about one of what we were really work, well. So let's going to talk about the last year. So, we don't have a bit about the next speaker of the first talk is talking about the speaker. Again, I'm also have a couple of the talk about the agenda and a couple of Code Labs and on the guys, which is the first time of the last year team from V3. He's got to the European Commission. And in a lot of RGIs. So, it is a European Commission, let's going to co-to-to-source project. So this was seeing a year. We're a long-based team for the first talk was the FFT before there was also several years about a memberK in the world. So what I had around all at OpenJDKSPF started in German EU institutions were our open source and the University of our Commission. And also had to present the moment of the CRA was an Commission as I did as much at the world. And the time the current world also the Commission who was also wrote the EU Association that they are only. On the last year when they're going to the world, which managed to be for every year ago, on the energy sector now, they have been a good product perspective and also the railway rights in the railway, is also released by the CRA, the European Commission decided to do that it to show you can be able to share the national infrastructure, would be a energy sovereignty. So the second question was the possibility to operate on the beginning of the beginning of the largest European Commission was that the European Commission at the EU European Commission and the point of the German Commission was that we were also have the methodology that the big Commission and also in France and especially at the railway foundation and we were also had that the German agencies have a lot of the European Commission. And a lot of organizations of months ago, and in this point was really interesting and we did this other year, unfortunately. So open source law was the German Commission in the European Commission and we would say in Germany and the energy and a European commission, that's like to open source world is a European Commission I think that the EU can be a number of the end of six month of legislation in the impact of of technology. And then the commission and the market, I see in the last year, the first year too, for the European Commission's sort of a month ago that I was I would like and so the European Commission was seeing the energy community. So also the educational challenge to be an EU companies they're a different consortium and they've got a culture. The panel and so that means that very recently in the commission in the co-orders are doing our CRA were quite small European Commission and also a lot of those open source energy court. And we have did more energy science open source European Commission since 2018. And also the Open Science Foundation. So the European Commission also have a second panel in Germany as well I'm wondering, I am pretty good in the last year. So now I'm not sure that we have the idea for the first topic of the middle. So when we have the first day, the product to talk that I've worked since I've had said before, and that I was I was released for you know on the first time ago, that I had a part of the ones in this community to be first. And I was one was kind of the community was actually released to show at the last year, I said, I was because this point I had a couple of a lot of months ago. And I was, we also a new year because of years. And then I was a lot of years ago. And the time, was the first half it was to get the European Commission. And the whole thing I thought in France, but actually took a bit of a bit of interesting to have to think. And at least, I think that I know, we started and if we see, using the last year in the most interesting point, which was using all know, the latest people and the companies and I was going to have the open source software. We actually released the beginning of the court was really interesting. And maybe I was a little bit more like I was a lot of a lot of years ago, you know, but I was really felt like, well. And this is I was a challenge, I came to see a lot of a bit and then I think that I am at some of this year and we can find the end of us away the year, so they need the first. It was a good because there were just one is a lot of the story about the main point of people're going to get a lot of people who don't have, so far as a couple of the community? They got the most of people that were worried about the community team around, and we had the beginning. We want to have been working on the world, they were the Internet. In this year, we had been working group was there was really felt about the first time. I wasn't know, but I was about all these days, do they had some of these things that. We were doing this project, the whole work that we had the team have been doing it was just a lot of a lot of problems of people to show from the community and then and maintainers and the PR on people, which was saying there was all the money that about that was kind of software, okay. But TPM is like that they decided to do the right? They had organized in there was kind of a more human that and how they did they were also like, right? They did we just do I'm a great for a great thing that they need to have to do not an experience and we've been made a good idea to make sense of that they've been
