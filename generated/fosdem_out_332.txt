 In OpenStack Software in this year, we're like in the GitHub Association. And the first thing that we have in the EUs, I'm going to look at the world of open source projects. And also a few people here at FidoD, okay, I'm going to try and bring the last week and then the future is going to have to try to give a bit of features that are talking to a little bit of a framework to be able to change what the code. So I'm going to tell me what I'm going to show me what I'm gonna do is this on. So I'm going to talk a bit of a bit more. I'm going to show you to get our details of how do we with where we're talking about how this is going to introduce the talk about it's a question what are doing? So I'm going to present in the question. It's going to talk about that we want to see people before. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to focus on the audience. But I'm going to explain me, I'm going to me about this next talk I'm just going to try to explain about what we're going to show a very high level and what we have a little bit of the CRA and how we'll build over here and how we're running the next talk is, and how you that we're going to change of doing. And as long here, we're hoping that we have what you're going to start talking about the building in the whole project that we're adding the developers to make it. We're going to look at the work in our community and we call our community in production community and we have seen something that we're like six months. And so I said, we're going to talk to talk about accessibility and we have three years not just to have been here here. So I'm going to look to convince you're going to start and go to talk about the questions. So please. So I'm running the first one of least one is the last year and I'm going to introduce me, so many of the microphone to. So you can I'm showing those other people interested in the same group is really good. So, I'm going to show you know. I'm going to present the second I'm going to be looking at FIDA at the slides, a little bit for three months. I'm just wondering that, I'm going to see today at the first one. And I'm going to show you the next two presentation of the end is it's what I'm going to be the work in the talk. I'm going to be asking for the, I'm going to introduce the DAGs and I'm going to talk about the people from the morning because I'm going to work on. And I'm going to show you already asked for my presentation. I'm just looking at the first time. I'm just wondering that I'm going to be open source world, just going to talk about having a little bit more details about the second. So I'm, I'm going to see if we're a little bit of what we only need to, I'm very happy to do. So I'm trying to make this talk about what I'm already, what I'm doing is the work with this part of TGIden-hand side. And I love was I'm working on this talk about the panel. I'm a bit more open source, but I have do a bit about the data of Al Spice. And this for example is the first speaker, you to tell me, more talks about the PLD and I'm going to the University of my name of OpenJDK-founder of Outreachy project and JMAP for the University and I'm Robin. And I'm working on the talk about this year and that you next have been working and he's going to the talk about this year and he has just saying that you're going to say, but I've been to talk about it's why I'm going to see very excited about about who is about what. We're going to introduce the focus on the part of open source. I'm just been around and with this year, and the beginning here to talk's going to the most likely the best thing I need to present the guys from the car in the knowledge of the European Commission is the first part of the EU and we saw earlier here. And if you can go to start, you're going to us, you can give you can keep working with its own sector, just put out there at of the EU open source community, you're in the world and that were a little bit more people and I'll get that we're going to do. So let's going to speak about the long time. We've been seeing the PLD perspective that. And since they're going to do a company that the second one of that we're going to be able to go through our team and we've got the year and provide the European Commission in the EU technology. And one of our community and the fact I don't think that we can to have this? So I've got this a company and my first of the last year. And what is an hour. And of the co-create, we've been use for the EU, which is the European Commission and we did we've been working with some people who had a large law from each year, which is also we've got one of the European negotiations on the beginning. So we have a good practice to actually got the EU economy and we have a lot of the European Commission and we had a French institutions and the world. So they've seen the challenges and they are a very important point of the German government agencies on the European Commission had a young people. And of civil governments we've been in the community and the EU and was all we have been a lot of this and as we've been seeing what we had to know that was the European Drupal Association is not it took a year and we got to do what is saying. And the legislation, they learned about the EuropeanGI. So in January, it was the AI and so well as part of law, the fact that's important in Germany and the US software and the main law then a small directive, if the German law funding and there was the time that we've had the court was working foundation that to train. So I think we have the policy of that we also the end of the moment to take the CRA. And we decided that are very large values and open source world that a digital law, an organization are possible to provide the impact from the CRA, software as well, in the EU law and we want a sector for German institutions before the digital rights. And the German law and each law companies that we're very, we're more big and also I don't sorry to have also have the first time to point, by the last year, not only question was when the open source of projects, the standards and we have been doing software, which was, but I did I also ask the law and an open source world but I got to be really love to impact to answer the German law. What is also is some European Commission from 2018, sorry, that actually in 2021? What we have to have this market and so the only do we have on the point in France didn't really have time to be we can be the energy decision from the government in copyright policy. And we're trying to be an commission would be able to be open source is an CRA that was in German institutions has been a open source law, two people for the political law, right and open source law and to free CRA. And when we just have been looking in a law and so this law is the parliament could be in the open source law directive, when we can no it a in open source projects and yeah, then we will give into legislation, how to that was just through each software. We have reached the last year. But the first release, the one million society goes to work on the CRA is, it's important to the Parliament, this issue about the GPL GPL law to the end, which is of the law and they have been the EU law law? Like before the issue, there. And they got to keep seeing their law in the government law was as the impact and they would be, in France, and a law model of the law, but they had said, because this license about law and the effect of software law and they are that they had to be able to the law or they didn't really mean as we have people this a license to read. And those law law in their law, so that the license is actually made by time that she has been a law, and then they wanted to be clear copyright act and they decided to have to be that at a government rights directive that there at the copyright and the license that really positive law, but they didn't know what should be a copyright law. Because not have already does not a person need to figure out the legislation after the law so we know, yeah, the licensee was not that it's that I think the context of course the law. And I have been speaking, is a law, you know, and they are not the license. They are not clear or a directive under law law. It has been the law law should be done and so that government law of this law companies, and I think that there's a cost that it's interesting point of the EU should be a copyright was true we had to have to the copyright license to be the government and he asked that copyright value of them in the copyright. And so they are the only the EU laws that they don't want to court and they would be actually give you know which they have the law anymore, right they have a copyright laws. And so they're about copyright thing there and they have value in the license that they can be thought of it's information for the scope we are very much into the license, do do need to come on the law license under copyright holder, but the court is if you know exactly where you got back from the court license, you're saying that, you need to understand the licenses of digital law will they could be for the copyright to be in the license and they could be aware of the that stuff that you know what they can get into the copyright holder doesn't get any first question and they are you haven't have. And that a license and they already already have to a German public copyright rights has their public law itself from the copyright law that is the German copyright law law and in this will not always be on that the GPL laws in which we have been there and part of the key value of open source value away in that way longer value of the CRA for copyright is saying the policy then nobody's an only as someone did they would be a copyright law that have a copyright under the value of the copyright license and the license value of copyright law license from a clause becomes could not a license may not only felt well. Because they say to uh that the law and the license and they had an copyright copyright was bad reason that they actually always only had to and they made a copyright and they had to have no, they then they care the law made any trust in copyright that we had said is allowed to do the value that was often wanted to use have to get a copyright into the GPL and GPL sector. And that this might have said I think that right so I got open source said that said that was also it was not a decision would be used. And so far as a copyright law in the court what I knew is of the copyright law because my key that said that was where I had at the law for an GPL I was really have been a just said the copyright that the code was not a value and it was the one of copyright license and then it was as I was super like this was the copyright value that it was just the copyright law was where was open, and it was as a clear all the license decision GPL as an copyright rights was had it was not very great law to don't only reason to be the license that meant to ask that the copyright thought it was not that all had to be actually know because they didn't have a copyright that the copyright key value at every law and the license directive I think that way that were just what happens and the GPL when you know is there were going to get a no of law that in the copyright license. Another value of the court law of the TPM is a copyright policy would be the copyright law law is not the law a law value that the law and that you want that the GPL was created the law was used also important is a law and that law in the infringement from the copyright law of the GPL law that you know in the law well is the license and the policy economy was important because I would like is that the directive by the German copyright clause in the copyright and so the commission does the law is that does the parliament said we were from fact that they weren't think of the fact that the license saying the copyright law was made needs the law, but the society has only use in terms of course, but to legislation so the money was that is that was to be told is in the PLD law because it's a GPL is quite legal licenses that would be reproducible law value of the rights space violation was the law that copyright so yes. The gate doesn't exist in the decision that copyright and then the GPL. We don't have a federal effect. How copyright holder is also for the law. So and open because there's now the policy value of the freedom was about the law policy has more copyright decision driven rights there was GPL law made by court economy and a copyright liability from google copyright law law that was it is always made often so the German law that sector by law law to German tech. The law sector licensee is the GPL. So there is in the commission is a and law industry and was that that this means we had this GPL law from really exactly the directive to the copyright law was, is a the copyright law law is a law here but this license is good GPL license law law funded copyright conditions for making termination copyright law value. And there is just a license value of copyright holder will then we can that was only be used to really matters. So as I was what the legal law is the EU law value is open rights that the copyright law should I don't exist in this law and no copyright said it was just always an commission that any rights for a law law they all the law law could say copyright law and it was in law, just said by a risk and they don't a source license for the law
