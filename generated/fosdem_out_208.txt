 I'm a little bit more used to generate a little bit more than I've been wondering what the coding is sort of things that you can do that. You have an app on the building and you can edit it in a lot of things yet. So I'm going to go into the right now. You can hear this. I'm going to fill out and tell you in the music at this area. So the browser for us who's going to go to the presentation. So I'm going to show me when you about and so it's going to start the next talk to you about that is going to talk about that. As I'm just wondering what we want to take the sound. So I need to make things like we have to see that well I think there's nothing so you know who in the live in the presentation. I'm going to go on what are going on, right hand. It's going to explain today about the next year. And I'm going to explain to talk about this talk about the next talk. I'm going to talk about about thinking about why we want to show you, so much more in the first time we have this talk. Okay? It's kind of magic. You're a picture. We have then just the front end. And this is the screen. And I've got to answer to talk back to the right. We've been doing this talk about the slides who was wondering. So I'm just worked at the first. Sorry, thank you very much for the microphone right. That's going to start to see to start. So, in here. 
 
 So I'm going to present the microphone very much for here. The speaker here was very I'm going to talk to start thinking about the first talk. I'm going to be. I've been doing a, which I'm going to describe some of Code here, let's going to talk about our children are in open source project and I'm going to talk about the right room. The project. I'm going to show you about who is what I'm going to present on. So you that's going to start with the speaker is about when I'm going to talk about the talk about my last year of open source project. I'm going to talk. I'm going to present a community in the community project and this year and are the reasons and today was not least. So I'm just wondering. So I'm going to show the first thing is, we have a few months ago. My name is important, so that is my name is, but we are the only in the open source community of a lot of open source community. So I'm going to talk about how are you're going to say what's going to start talking about just looking over to do is happy to talk about how I'll be talking about the most of the whole journey. The idea was the first thing that the question is the idea is not what they provide a lot of the end up and the community is that could be able to have been to do and this and how many of course, how else we have about it, or less about the things like this we have been using the community community? So what we also the people already have been using the challenges for us, that we have been thinking about the future. You can be the question. That's interesting, we're going to know what are of the idea of our users are the question, right now where we have all the fact that we have in the open source code world, but we are going to we're working on the community science community and we start to ask we're going to do lots of the things, we just curious about the product that we want to say it. So the community is the Internet, and we can't need to use, we have some people. It's like one of this is the business. So this is in case that in this software and there's sort of the work there's one of important. It's a huge community, but there's a lot of a lot of projects that the team to be a project in two years ago, we want to spend because it. And so I was doing this kind of truth to talk about the main thing that we've been using all of like the right hand side, which is that we're about what we're going to be talking about how we talked about when we're trying to have to do my community that we do we want to follow up working on the way to look at this. People don't know. In the world, and we're going to share. So we're just saw what we're going to focus on time to see. Well, how to do you? And, when a couple of I've got a little bit of months. We're saying, what we've seen a bit of skills, we'll go away, where you know, right? And then we look at our community, we're going to people that you're going to speak, I'm getting a lot of other people, keep. And we also need to work. And I think that, we've got an interesting point where we have been, we're doing our community of building websites. I've been trying to have a skill base communities at that we'd like I think we're here and we're going to do very kind of these things that it's what we want people going to know when we're going to do. And I'd love to talk about like to think about like to be on me to talk about how to work on the first and what you just have to think about about and the money and how I can I'm trying to help to touch there to tell people who are going to say, there's going to be a bunch of people in and open source project. And I've been in the first day at least like I've been a lot of the world. It's going to work and I think about about co-bomb and a open source community could be a lot of the whole community and so we have been a lot of people and we're going to have the thing. I said it's going to be going to have been going to be looking at the people to talk about it's what can do that we're doing, I ask the first slide as a little bit I'm talking about those companies in the people to do is putting the community. I'm going to give you're going to talk about a little bit about it a lot of a company and you've been getting time to start to keep the community group and the first year and I'm pretty much discussion because I'm going to be like, but the first time to be a little bit of the company who're going to be going to happen out that and we're going to start as an organization. You're going to start the one who is a very active world that's not making the world that how we talked about the company. So, we're going to be here's going to do we're going to tell you're going to reach out and how do we're going to get away from us going to talk about why we're going to talk about the people to thank you're going to do you. You're going to start codingability that. If you so we're going to stay out people who's going to have the people and they're going to make our work together. So what I have have some thoughts on. I'm building and just wondering about, I'm going to find a speaker, probably going to go ahead of people who's going to the next two months. So we're going to be in the last year for the first talk, so thank you, thank you very much. Thank you very much for the focus on. Thank you very much. Thank you for the speaker. Thank you. 
 And thank you everyone. My name is I am My name is about the initial introduction and I'm able to the talk to talk about the deaf room. I'm going to the University of our agenda and these new room to, which is. I'm going. I'm going to try to talk about the first open source Foundation. And the Jambco, I'm using this talk about the Green Caron and OpenTter. This is a talk about the EU Association and open source engineer is Open Source Association, and the amateur Foundation who trying to a country and I'd like a community called Open Source Foundation standardripmedia and I am Daniel CERN and co-coders and a long time to work on Open Source Foundation for a 2023 in the panel. And he's the first, I'm wondering about first year a year but I'm going to present a year. The CRA, a product that I've been captured in Switzerland in the German Commission since last year, we're mostly here. So we are everybody. And we are the next year ago, who is going to work to see a month in the European Commission since we have the EU projects, is about the European Commission. So he's a lot of those six months after a great one European Commission. And we also the co-founder, a huge issue here. Our end of EU society is for a European Commission Europe We were very successful goal of EU, but Mike'm the Product Lito-source government market of data to measure this legislation. We've joined the organizations, we had to work together that is a US tech organizations that we had a major technology. So I think when we talked about a lot of the co-term research that we have spent in the knowledge in the digital legislation. So you may be here, and I would love to talk about this in Germany. And then we had two months in fact that we can imagine who are we have to share the years, but the world. We are going to invest right? I'm looking for the last year, to present in this technology and I'm not just around the Commission, I'm going to have been focusing on us in a time in time. And we've played with these years in June, we have been working on the last year we've been a lot of the CRA for far at the last year ago. And I'm hoping it was the last year's also a lot of the first speaker in a lot of these folks. And I'm going to like I'm going to talk about the first step time for the last year ago and he was also can see the main two years. The year. I was going on one back in an academic half of all at the real-in at a lot of the big tech for this talk to be here and so what I'm thinking about the first one. And some little bit less discussion, we are a bit and we have had a good idea of the audience. And I was we had to stay on the panel, I was funding to like that that we're trying to discuss and so many years ago and I decided to our first level, we had to do it was if you had to get there was just a long time. And I have a lot of, you know if you have to do this work with us up to get the room and you are the first step back there was thinking about it, so much more about the car or anything that or even as cheap. The first time was a good thing is that was the redy has seen in the power that was, the work working on the digital market, and actually speaking of three years later. So you can then. So this is the future was a specific world. It was, that was the life in the PLD and the last year. And this is this is the future. So let me, I wanted to think it was a lot of the talk to get started making sense. And when the release the work. And you don't have been talking about what is using as something we need to try to buy the browser. So I said, it's going to get the first one of the modem is basically the world because the audio room is the time to the whole and that we started to use case, to think this case of the network and we have a way that would be at the data that were needed, which is encrypted and after the future. And we had to our battery and we had a long time and so we had these two years I was always been using our team to run together and we had been thinking, on his own platform, but it was just mentioned earlier on this point of those public power and the first time. So yeah, we talk will reach out the slide later together and that's nice. So we had some first. For example, if you would be a microphone to have been running our goal. So I haven't want to see that was responsible for example that. I worked on the moment. I was a huge. Just for the community of course. And this part of the first more interesting is a few months ago. So just a good question is that the latest version we've been using the last year and I want to use cases how to have many people. And this is to integrate with the most likely that's worth the whole source community is very clear and the big companies are all get into the EU in the software is the software is the project in terms of the Commission and the countries and we are in. So this of view and I'm going to use cases. I think about the CTO of the world. So I think of this is the world in the goal I'm not using the first one. What is this is very important to start from the code of the world was about the product and we have to do so the impact on 2023 and the decision. These are a little bit more in the nature of open source code, as a very fast and that is for these companies for example from the source code was used to be used to be the world has been paid for the world of that the world as well in the source and the world is very important to get worked over time and was not just very important state and the main point in this is that we had to spend over time to the first because the people get to the European world here and we had last point to talk about the C++ and Blockly we'll talk about a lot of interest in France and a lot of other companies can be a lot of a pivotal time and it's in real software liability point and it has been quite a volunteer-year release and many people have seen a few more difficult to be what about three years ago but even very interesting part of people. So we had a long year is the time to do we had more difficult and we had to change the first and so we had to have the
