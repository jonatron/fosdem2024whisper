 Hi. 
 Hi. Thank you very much for the back here have a month for the next talk is I was very much for Peter everyone. We have some talks. I'm here at the next minute. And I'm working here. So much, thank you from the name we are that I'm a little much Welcome to talk as a few other Commission. My name is a year that I've been talking about 4. We've been working in November and the most of all have been one, we're going to have been about the work in recent release and that we've been working on the European Commission. We have been all in 2021. And today. We're the first five months ago? So the panel, we're glad that today I'm not sure that we're a little little introduction to present us about the moment. Our last year, now we're just mentioned, but I think we're talking about the first time for a time in the last year. And I mean, I'll present you can I'm going to start in this talk about some of what the JMAP program engineer at this talk about our project. So we're going to a few months in this talk about this talk is about our presentation using OpenAI, which I'm going to this code engineer sinceias is the talk about three minutes. And we've been the FidoEG. And when we had done in 2021. And the end we had to work with our job back in the OpenShift is we have to get in OpenJDKK and we're going to talk about a few months of the software is going to be at the tools. And there's like a lot of the main way you see that we have been talking about the first thing that's that we do is you're going to keep going to talk about this time for the community, we've been a lot of the question they have seen what we have is interesting. And I think we have done a little bit about this stuff. I have been the time to focus on what we've been using this year I'm going to try to write. I'm going to discuss was going to explore it's a little bit of your website. And I'm just wondering about doing was going to be the co-option of the way of a bit more question, right away from time. How it would we show you get to introduce that we're going to this is we're going to talk about in this in the open source community? And here. We're going to make the problems that I'm going to try to help us to go to have to go a little bit and we're going to hand off the outcome that's going to find all the one year and we're going to be just, right? To be able to say we're going to have somebody who are trying to talk about this part of the end the end of this year? What is going to take a little bit. What we just going to go to be going to this time to start talking about a little bit of the CRA here? The years ago, a post-off. This is this is the first one of a little bit of our talk, which is a very interesting. And we're going to come to be, we got. We're going to talk about the question. So three years ago, I'm going to focus on a little bit of the audience to come to be so happy to our next speaker for our lightning talk into the panel. And I'm presenting this talk about how this talk about that I'm going to you're going to talk about the talk about how we're going to are talking about the end of the lightning talk. So in the community we, how is we're going to give up, we're going to talk about the world. So we're going to share the world, you know, all about all really important work, our EU Association, there were first one of the O-making and so. So, we all about the people here's going to be going to fund to become a small and we will give each people to be very active of these workshops, to join your technology. And there's what are a little bit of the culture in terms of tech, as well, a lot of France in Germany, who are the European Commission and also aware of time. And one of the EUs are different countries at our current CRA. So I think we need to start talking about this year. Here are we have mainly talking about last year. And in our mission. We love this is that's the fact, what is an impact that the directive and this point of the first year was the community. And that the mission that was funding came up a major institutions were a long and was happening in November was to the future in a community in the EU government had taken in 2014, so we had here, that this technology towards our product or European Commission, I'm going to get into our European Commission and of the panel on European Commission as the European institutions. And so there was announced to the world that can't really see some funding in this world. This objective that I did not going to think we talk about funding to be able to do this regulation. And this are the other negotiations. And we are there's part of people who are hoping to do a research that we try to be aware of our mission and the world that they have, and like just going the world impact, free software in the European Commission has been aware of its own law in legislation. So as well, it would do it's very energy in Europe at least a European commission. And this decision companies are there are the time for the last year and this year, and we're really have asked the EU. So I think we wanted to be a lot of a lot of rights on the decision about a year in many companies and you know about the European Commission, we'd be able to be the history of the main organizations can be there and more specifically in the last year. So we take for a very important idea what we have is then the first place in this year. We're thinking are focusing in the beginning of the beginning of the national sector that was a year for those act that there are we're really we've been made a lot of first one of the European government point in terms of that we're a lot of energy consumption that you know which was interesting. So we are happening and in 2022 then we're trying to point of energy, we get to have another side of energy value in the technology about market. In society and so and then we really, we've got the national value of an OSP for the commission is the EU EU organizations that are done in the companies and national European Association that have this person that they just meant that she is the Swiss staff open source software could be very the year and it took it's happening. And I think we had that they're hoping to keep a very often as different commission and we're like we have the technology. So the PLD was about and we understand that we're going to. And these discussions around EU technology research agencies we just to look at this scientific legal directive came to be aware of this point. So the knowledge is in the law might be at any important to the commission, which she decided to become under Paris to be in Europe law. And they don't mean once you should be this the commission and you know what was not making gap of ethics many people at the world and often take until I'm being elected to think and so many years, I'm just wondering. One has had to have them that that they discovered that to do to have to produce exactly for copyright government and they were to tell us and they have those policy over his opinion on our CRA, we have been a European Commission, which is in the license and they have forgotten to be just asked to ask just have any policy. So this to be a workshop said that I'd like a copyright of a German law directive. I think we are those law and in a copyright States in the business to always have would be something that maybe important. And I'm a US law in a bit of the German rights at as it's of a political and at the law, the court that still quite a very important to be able to be anprofit law. And uh, what I think, was it is that he's because it was about the policy and he was in the license that she was actually got the licensee said, and I didn't like oh, well. And they had been only said before that if you're not have a people found that value to know, so there is going to make the value a decision rights or we had to keep that she wanted to do, because we haven't have seen four% of software. And so an unknown law to make sense of the license, there is a standard in this issue of course, and this legal copyright, they need to be a decision the European license in their GPL law told the value of the licensee authority, but not clearly has been asked for the license holder. Because they're like, I said, no. The no, first that we have said. The only state of the licensee can do a law. And if they can become clear that decision and they have two issues in? The fact that's basically
