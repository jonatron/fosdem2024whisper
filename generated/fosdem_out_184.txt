 So, I'm not going to introduce an end, first minute, this is this sort of the standard that I'm going to present to see how the answer is this? It's the last year. So I'm sure. Or, you know, I'm going to talk about. Yes, but it's just about a little bit of a bit of a bit from a bit of a programming and what it's going to work at the release from the last release. And it's going to be in a year. I'm just wondering. I'm going to put what I'm going to talk about it. I'm here. So I'm going to tell you some sort of a copy and then I'm going to add a bit of the phone to show it's going to be a little bit of a little bit more involved. And now I'm going to say, I'm going to look at, I have some questions going to be happy to be the first talk, so I'm going to kind of a little bit in. We have and then we want to do an option to try to find the developer by adding a bit of a developer. You can have to send an issue that could be able to use in the things that the main thing. We're at how we are we have to have all the other people to have a bunch of the people who may going to make it for the next and they're going to play out how it's the last years. And we've got a new, which was just the first thing that the things we're going to do in the the building's going to see here. We're going to send a very old version of this one. And today is a bunch of the three and the tools that we're with the community and we've got to tell them. And I'm going to go off to live in the people're going to talk about the whole ones that we're going to talk about. So this, if you can solve our kids could do, right? We want people who need to start with writing to do it. And we have a lot of the end of like all the description of the people who's go from the car. And so we're going to do we're using our hands, they're going to start an I'm going to do that. You want to be able to get that because we have to do this thing. I think the years to start, we're going to be our friends. Here you're going to do a lot of the maintenance in and what they have, right? So I'm going to be getting on the first-time people that we did I'm going to ask everyone for each of the humanize the whole thing that. And I love for people a very first step of my next feature of this in this year. So at some time, many people are aware of the whole do, that. And the first we're going to talk was about it actually to engage out. The question is one is that the new steps that we're going to do. We're going to have to be a few people who come up? We'll be talking about the day. So people who's going to be happy to start to do quite important to talk a lot of people. And then be able to come to look at all the first. But we're looking forward into people. We have a second steps of our research papers of our group and like the interviews, we're one. And so much of them's why it's interesting the first of the people that we have to do we have to grow to get in our main ones that we're talking about like a good looking at this. But if you're at the tech institutions are trying to get in the policy. And this is an entire product community. We're going to make sure that we're also be a community will be here at those questions for us so much power revenue. So we have to give us to other questions for the technology research. So it's what we have is doing? So I think this is the first aspect of course, when we want to do this in the panel around our world. So this is the panel. Okay, let's a little bit of two years. Okay, I'm saying, okay, well, we're going to present these communities, we're going to talk about our first round of our first five years. Ready? So, and I'm talking talk about how I'm going to make the last year. I'm going to talk about this working on the commission in this model? We're going to talk to finish the talk about the whole world, and we're going to be talking about challenges of the world, of code. We're going to be a little bit of the first be just to be aware of our time is going to call open source community as I'm going to show your challenges in AI and the day. And that we can I'm going to take the first year. I'm going to be showing a sort of the first step of what we've got there that, I'm going to present for this in the other day, we're going to talk. And this journey going to open source project, if you know what I'm a little bit. And, I'm an idea about our first place. So let's the technical picture I'm going to get back in the time to talk in CERN, the time we've got the stand into France, we're going to be talking about that we're going to focus on a long as we're going to be having a project at being shown a lot of the community who can see any of the technology that we've got in a research that's our goal of the world of the EU institutions. So I'm going to have a very happy to talk and we're going to make it that I'll talk about the next talk about going to introduce a little bit of our community and we did. And he's going to talk. You can that's kind of information about one of a little bit tricky to pick our software and you use the people have to keep going to get to get on the open source community and so many stories that we've done and we have to do in Openodojo in our team and the work on the challenges and they've got around is going to do and we need to change software collaboration, how we have. We have to we want to make our team that we have time our community and we've just mentioned this information here the world. We're going to come on that. So there's going to have another thing because we're going to start working on our research projects that we're quite interested in this technology. We have a lot of technical point if we're just about the most of the new perspective. It's still there, we're building a good reasons that. We're being in the world of what we've been a little bit about that we shipped the most important year we're doing and the EUN is these of a lot of the technology. We're thinking about us have been talking about four years to about that we've got our best and then do that's a million people who are being here about the software that we have talked about a lot of time. We're done, a lot of our open source community, we have a good use of the things like I said that we're going to continue working on the problems of projects. We have to take a few more of these product that we're going to have like people at Red Hat, well because we want to do have the market and to make this to have started working on our product for us to be our Drupal to get into the tech product to be aware of a political group of people who have been using the way to be on the people to go ahead of our work on the product, we have this. I'm going to continue with their hand up to the product. We've ever heard of our users in a very active community is so the world. And I think of course open source product? And it's still an initiative that they've been in a little bit more open source community. And there are the first session. Okay, but also some of tech and where they're a product and open source and a million people and they're going to be pretty good to learn and it's but there's not just a bunch of a different part of people that that they're in the product and other product is the EU companies, but they're not seen in the world as that they're not going to have some people like young reason, I've got a good thing you kind of you know, that the product is they say over the past and they don't think we're not they're going to be able to bring in the right? And then they're asking for the AI and they're going to people who they're just been making a really have to know in a very easy to go free software. So you're going to continue to get to get this morning me and why we've been doing a long term, a good stuff. And from the whole way that's the open source project that we are the open source license so we're just said really excited about the source community is always going to be going to be looking at of the community that we're just come up to get money because we're going to use and to be just to come out the first. We're going to see what people thought of our last year we have we're trying to play and the good to put the work. So we're talking about our product issues in the way we're going to talk kind of the product to see the challenges like we've got more people know we've got to be having their community on this in the software developers who's working on as well and they're working together and a company right now we'll show us from a lot of the past side. So we've got just talked about the beginning. But we're the tech was saying that maybe people from our community that we're going to be going to reach out there's a lot of people to do they're curious about that in a really excited that. And we've seen a lot of the first, get into the idea of the world. So I would like that we're going to be just to have the whole survey and we're going to ask that. We need to get into the folks from the data and just say we're going to ask the community and say that we're in collaboration will be able to be in the people to have to do this. And then we're important to be very much more as well. So the challenges of course we are a lot of the most of the community. So we have been actually being able to have done to have more of people to come from the source community and they have the world. And I find that I'm going to emphasize that's going to be the goal of the community from the work on what you guys are you heard of the world. We need to talk about the people are the moment, that are saying the reason of the left hand, that can the most of the whole list of the product and the European world for the company who have but there as I think when they're there that people that they are actually have been open source software and that is a question and there's a certain problem that they are the impact on the first day we have been trying to be a really good the decision and they have to justify all right or their own companies who has been talking about the other question was asked about it was that is going to work. They were not have the software but they're going to be a bit more organizations that they have a very good thing that, and they just learned about the world because they prefer to be aware of companies who have a lot of the code to realize in terms of people that he's I think they're going to be explaining what you know I think this is in the first difference and since I think about like, there's going to share and so you know there's a question, like okay, like a question. I'm just to say I'm going to do this in the the world's the best way of the things and so good open source people put for the challenge that and I'm going to think it's going to work I think it's right now being a bit of the first one thing to be is the work on the current version of the other time is that meant a value of the definition that they're here that they're in the way that they're just there. But these are the first person are also the people who will you can do really get it's the other people that and they have heard of the thing that we can put an analysis and do I said they've been talking about how they are going to make things like there for you, like the ideas, actually there's the ones that the things we're getting into a little bit important thing I'm going to do here but they're going on the most of the very interesting ones that the values that actually're doing was useful for us had to look at the last year. And they do we're just throw the people in the right person set you get the whole issue and they want to be having funding at the first single one can we need to do so we do their business like we can't call for that conversation so and we tried to share this what this but I'm not just going on this, there that, I'm going to go to show this area. So looking at every thing that next version so now I'm wondering if I like, this is I love the most people at some people and I don't know most people to put stuff, you know how they are you're not going to organize these things like I'm saying, I don't know. And I want to think we just wondering about those guys at the time to be kept just going to talk about the room to like the room for the room to be wondering that this kind of the people. So, if you know, we're going to start an opportunity to ask you should be just see from the next two minutes why does anything and what we wanted to want to say, whatever. Let's in the room. Yes, how do we do we want to be working with us all this. But interesting one is going to actually the news at the work to thank you about the room, I'm going to get a previous hand, I mean that, I was on it as much. It's the internet. But in the world. Yeah, in the mic, the panel. Yeah, sorry, the start it's going to add to end, but I'm just going to,
