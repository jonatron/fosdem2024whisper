 Hello Worldbock, going to introduce to help the PLLEG, some weird features from a fully goal that we have a small application, which is to create a challenge to create it and then we don't want to, so that's our way to analyze the LLMs itself is, but we have, with a few other applications that you have a library to get to the VM base of the C++ for us, we have to add a CripPad, which has like to turn that in the API and then we have to implement your IP, like this API and a API to the LLMs so we have this way to make this. We have our IP server on the ability to change the DNS, a DNS, so we get back back to the OSPs and we useer and we want to basically allow us to say this kind of a first-old architecture. This is in a full API or Airflow API API and we run for these Vox, which is the X11 in the way to offer us a multi-to-based API is for all of the PPC. We don't have data provider needs, so we need to speak about the data into our services we want to support a big part of what we want to have to be for a good to handle it, we also want to implement the data, so we want to implement our next step and the right side of those solutions and then it and we can dojo. So we need to have some time for our own API managers are in the requirements. We need to integrate with this cluster and we have to do in other open-in, which is the data using Airflow and we have to deploy it out the cloud connections that we generate access to go into user interface that. So, the one of these are also there we have a single API that are services of this is also available and we have to make sure that ability to be the data. We enable us and this question, of these in this application, which means that then we need to kind of them to create code base in the API, we need to do. So this API was open application. So we started using the nodes. We have this is what we had to implement a reference to create all of an API to the web data and then we have a possibility to use. We can go back to our application, well, do here and then we have a project about the user to use to your application. And in our data that this. We have to avoid the first in this case, which is that the data to our project. We have 50 years in some of the user, which is completely different. Two other core of the data from the most important, but our data field, is that was also called WebSocket of course, how we need to do we want to speak to support for example, the data, we want to offer us ourselves, we have some way to interact with the most of a network or using an example of the user, the data that we want to call our application as it here because we have also want to make sense to the data on the data into this case we have the challenges to provide our data services that we need to provide data that can be able to know what you can do. So that we want to have this is to need to put the data as you to do as an ID is using the data that you can be used when you can have in this data is a data to be the data and we want to start data with this this cluster. So we have a different fields that the data that are going to add to have similar and it up with this data is just one of your data to the same data and the data centers. We want to the data which are able to say what you can we have here are just a gateway. And so that's what we have is this is do is going to the data, the data to be some information in our data list of that work with other side where we wanted to share. And so that's where you can we have different mechanisms to be very interesting and how you're supposed to implement this type database is also if you choose to have already have this which is not linked to be in source and then we have the data from the data which we are the data value of your data and if you're reading between the data so we have to model in the data in the data and why we're just going to a value and we just a data in a data. And this case, you can be a data in the data. And in the data from the data set, we're going to what is going to determine how we're going to be done as a data that is that I'm going to do it. Let's going to see one of an observability are going to do the data from the prompt that we have to have a table. It's just an example and we have a query and there's going to a query that is your method that they're going to match that object and then they're going to see that it's the data sets. I'm going to create an API in one source, is a data and I'm going to explain that now if you how it's going to think that we're going to take a dashboard to check that the data is all the information at every data point. So that's important is the data, what actually the context of the data is the data. And then going to start point is the data, is the field, which is going to be a value in this is going to start to happen in the first one actually going to be part of this point in the things. The prompt in some useful because there. Imagine that I'm kind of the time because you've got to be like a difference in the data in there. But one of course, the table that the function is that it is something that a new in the dictionary's not going to be the number of the path. So the data sets because the value is the data is going to all the data and the function would be made in the data, and for example of the data. So if you could be in this data gets about that's not. So if you have another question that, the first one data, the data is that you're going to change that the table, you're going to a result in this is not going to work and then you're going on the right and the result in the result that we're going to create value from the number of the table that the table, is then the number of result, but when you're going to be in the two or if you're looking into the heap value type of the table that it doesn't just like a result, but you have the string that at the register, the inputs and I can be the four percent are just five milliseconds. So the number but basically takes three and five times it's not another one of bytes, but this level so we're going to give you. So this is an entry is an array is just the class, I'm not one of the second result of the table. I'm going in the number of the first one here is the class that is where the result is actually, okay, are two function actually a pointer to be at the table, you're going to solve the value, it's just about one that. The first important part of the arguments, we can see as the the second thing we have some function that your object thing to be kind of these pointers. You can be the number of thing that we're not going to be zero and not having two fields. Which be used for some type one that are in an array that, which is actually has this, but I can be used the value to see that we add that in order to be used to merge function, so the object is empty. When we have a function and an object zero of what it are done in a return in some memory string, because we would be here, and the row it's that, so I need on the array in some function, I'm going to give, but that it's more memory to run the object and now we have this, and if we need to check, but the first step. But the two requests are going to be there is going to be some expression would be a description. So this is the table to end to be able to be possible that the memory is in the scheduler that was like the very easy to be a way to do something that we need to have. So I'm only thing before we're going to think that we don't need to store a word in the first iteration of the model which is that are going on the number of the database. So when you cannot wait another model, we start with this. So we are the input a value. So for us are going to fetch with function for the object or an output, there are that you start. We have is another string, if we want to change which is not going to wait for zero. So have to be the problem that you could be talking about this problem. It's the things in level is there's used, but you can be used to clean the exact library. So for instance the real function, it's a bit of the other code object is not always the return. So the type that's a number of that the case because it could add to be affected. I couldn't want to say you want to be an error is that you need to modify the arguments to generate. If we'll be able to be in the value in this is using a bit of JavaScript to do match the structs in order to have three, you have a list. I'm going to do the instruction. And it's going to handle and it. Most of entry to send an error the most error to actually. And that. And there's a string to the pool that the function if we have to look at the arguments to be returned to do that, which is the result to the only return. So now. So what we have here about the error would be hidden from the value. And before we should be like, and we need to need to get the next to use case. But the type for the function. So you have what we want to register a value of like is this. We have that's going to need to be able to try to know the instruction that we want to run it's the event a state of output if we have this function that is the function that we have is going to apply it's going to the value of the function that we need for the value when we need to have to be the value pointer. So we have our value a function of the result you can't need to be done. The value from a function number of it's the return function is the equal a zero value to add to be a global four lines to put a bit less type of memory to be the idea. But the object brackets that's a value value because you should be a path, which will be being used every type but for example to be to be able to remove it's used and no value in fact that list and you need to just a value it in that I know what the number of the standard is we're using state for this one time if you have the result that the variable when you need to be done to do that it does. So as like this is that we're going to have the block in the model. So instead of the function of the next iteration that's going to change is because it's going to have. But we have the function that, we get the next state of the table is not the first value. So we can be able to add the value that we have in the value. You don't look at the object to event or just define the function. It's important to specify that we have a function. Because for these are using the allocation because we can be added the variable. So the block again we have an explicit states, we have the output zero line and so with the idea. And this this type it enables the first function that we modify the value of the instruction can be stored in the instruction is that is what we're I think about it is in a value and the value of the function. It's going to be is going to implement. And we know that we are going to say they need to be able to lock in example we've seen like on the value. So I'm not going to make this is that we use cases because I'm going to map. I think the input, a cost, but I'm going to read the VM, because you need to change the pointer. And you might be the value is the value the value of a value is a value and if you're going to understand maybe this, the value and I often it doesn't work. But for that, I'm kind of code, okay, I'll read the value of view of Ruby code. So I have some reason I'm going to see it, I was doing the memory that it. So I may be able to do that's missing is and so much faster. And so there's possible to see some data is another thing that I'm going to get the fact that I think about that I'm going to see here. So I'm going to work on my C code and I'm going to have this is it's going to do is trying to do this table like one, I'll get the number. So I'm just wondering it's going to explain a lot of C is we're going to figure out that is going to start to be an AI. For example of the function? We need to call a query that we should be able to the Ruby instead of a function we would want to know how we're going to make a query what we've got to work to go to do is our models. So we take a next stack to build a similar to the code and look at this class to the code so we've been using the first of our code that we're going to have we could use on and we get to implement our code base. I was going to make the code. Behind this code, I have a language that we've got a little bit better performance that we're going to run it is going to be able to try to get this way to go through the code base function and then we're going to create that we're going to do something else, but we're going to be the right now going to be hoping to build a thing for JavaScript class pool between pattern, we're going to use these Ruby code base stack is we're going to one we're going to
