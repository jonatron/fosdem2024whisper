 Hi everyone? I'm telling your name? Hello. You introduce FCPPPden by Project, this is another called open-source Code. And I'll talk about AI layer. I'm just wondering, I'm going to talk about how this brings me to deliver a co-source product. I'm going to be talking about why it? And I'm going to say a role and he's not just to start with our first start with the presentation about it. And I also about it to give a little bit of a way in Postgres, if you can deploy Kubernetes. It's a little bit back to this. And today, this is going to set of a little bit of a web app to the data. You can do an incoming table, which is the right? You to discover, which is a message for that I'm going to add user ID. I'm going to keep going to the next, but I'm going to help us to work with an instance of a name. When I have the next, I'm starting to accept a home server itself as a primary time. What I'm going to be a very quickly, but I'm going to have a bit important for a little bit, we started to throw the user, so I am I'm playing this talk to get a little bit of a bit about the main user has been talked about myself, which is that I'm going to do some data. I'm going to have to actually a large key key, a key time, and I'm going to do this so much time on that's a key. I'm going to be a key, particularly good thing that I'm going to ask for now, to create a good job and the key to produce. And of what's what we're to make a hard to do is going to think I'm going to do. I have any of this to create a lot of a big risk of people to do we use this to use of it to go to have a lot of the first of people to a lot of people that. And that we have that's the policy from the issue. We want to do. We're going to have a way, the person with an open source key cloak and I think it in the entire feedback and we already know what we have was that, I'm not sure that time ago, was working on that was going to make sure that people could build public key and even if we do you get over time right? It's going to the key. And now, we get the key that, we have, but I want to have to do this. So we know, we have to, we've got to reach out. And this because I want to do this I just gave us. I'm going to search for example, I'm going to talk about this guy here. So we just the CRA and we're going to do it. So this question was a couple of the title. I'm just say I'm going to present something we do I'm going to start to tell us I'm curious in the session to get the politics. I'm going to talk about the speakers. Thank you, so much.

 So Hello everyone. Yes, you. Thank you. I haven't think earlier. Thank you. 
 Hello, we are the co-founder who are going to talk about the last slide. I am going to wait for the first over? Thanks everyone, hello everyone. I am I present you. It's going to be on the open-to-source with OpenA. And thank we've been present up to we are so starting with the European Commission for our first talk about OpenSourceN, which is open source software. So we have how is first question of the standards, we have OpenAPI and also, if we're the moment, even know what we are we are a few months to open source companies here at this is happening in the first one policy. But thank you know here, is a great to do is in a long term-source development, the last year. And working. I'm glad. I'm going to have been using Open Science world, and a year, and I'm on the morning, we have been talking to present time for a lightning talk about the open source community. And I was an initiative in the first and the last year I was already mentioned, Chris, we invented the source software engineer for the first year, we started my name is I have this year. I first year, we also with I know about how I wanted to introduce the community and I also I've been here. I'm going to think about this talk about the CNCF project that people, I just working on the first four months of our main thing that we consider this. It was the end of the work in current project and that there were actually work there was a lot of the current year ago. And we're a quite a lot of the project that were having been doing workshops that were in June, and I should be focusing on the back to care of the years ago. And there was really thought that I started to say that we have kind of community because when we've been going to try to focus on the last couple of years, but what we'd like we had to build, they had to focus on a member of people to get this effort to have to be able to be a bit of the kind of the main thing to keep your goal of so if they're going to be able to be you know that you're going to have in the more things I'm going to try to focus on that we've got thinking about there, we're going to see whether you're going to probably going to be able to be able to look over the audience about this in a lot of the year we get the first year. And that's going to do that we have been working on a little more people and we all we've got to make a lot of that we've got to solve the people in the person in the community. And it a lot of software, we have a lot of people who're trying to get around the last things that isn't, our things that we actually that we've said, we have been able to be aware of the very quickly at the people in our way to do we know's going to do really make a big win for us and it what we're going to remember it going to look at the companies can't just say we're at the stuff at the people and we're going to do that we just have we're using those people trying to see how I'm doing in the people who can do we're trying to do they're not spend the things. And you're going to understand it to figure out to take a big to analyze something. And we're saying that got to be working on and doing our community people and I've been going on our community and we're going to look at the community and we have the people have the time and we're going to get us. We're going to talk out of those people at the community and so we can be a big problems to be any people who have this? And from the whole company do is that we're going to start building out there are so much living in the product ecosystem and we thought it because we've got our plan for us, we needed to be really didn't have experience on really think we're going to work around. So we want to know what we kept doing we're looking at the thing to have this like. So we're going to give a workshop what we're going to work on the beginning of a few people who were going to be saying that they wanted to work that we've been working on. I can have heard about the parliament out and I'm looking at the slides see if that I've been doing, but what we're going to find people. And we've done as long time. But we're going to avoid the people to talk to think this point are talking about we could we have time for people working on that we're going to do? We have a work on the time. That's what we need to do we're and we're going to talk about Drupal and we're going to have some questions out to be talking about that we're looking at the ones because we want, well. And I didn't have these years ago but we can just said I don't see that. We have a sort of the current two people who came to explain what we wanted to make our product but would do I'm going to do you to be happy to thank you. Okay, I'm doing this talk about how we're here anymore. So
