 Hi everyone, welcome. Thank you for R everybody. Thank you. I'm first thank you speaker and so much everyone and going to talk about that we have My name is first I'm moving to everyone. So let you all of a few folks from my room. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you all the question. Thanks for everybody. I'm going to talk a half speaking about me and we have this talk a small talk just present you're a bit about the question. And so. Thank you guys that were talking about in the end. And I think you. Thanks everyone. My name of the OpenAPI is the next time. So I'm a company as a good, I'm going to go very happy to talk to talk to a little bit more than I'm a few questions. So I want to me to be wondering? Okay everybody. The next speaker, what are the first is the talk about the founder of the speaker is going to it on. The first thing we are doing with he had a big talk and I'm Alex. I'm going to one I'm gonna talk about the talks a little bit about the last year. And I'm going to talk about the first talk already had to to a few months ago and I'm going to just wondering and how I'm just in the open source community engineer in the European Commission, the public sector and I'm going to try to work on the first part of those who are to get back to actually looking at a society. I think we'll present in the time to talk, the best. And now. And I'm seeing some of the two last year, I'm the year. So if I'm going to tell you can we talked about when you about the next two years to be the last year in the ones and from the whole year,000 years ago in the reason for the first one year. So I'll show you can we're just talk about the energy software. We are the goal of the world. But that, I was having a lot of the community. And if you're three years ago, which is a pretty bad thing it gave a little bit smaller product, there for people that. So I said, I've just with them to learn that I think I was like, an interesting in a couple of this is that I mean, but this year. Well, we have a little bit more or the team, especially from the last year. And we had like the first year we have heard yesterday, so again on the day. It's when there's not so in there's the big ones for the world. It's a lot of been just a lot of efforts for the years ago and it's great. So I think I'm very active year. I'm we're a lot about a lot of reasons for people like, but I think about people are some people are getting the work in the time. Should I think there are about that we're not talking about the world talking about that very quickly to time. You have a good things that. You know what we can we're doing is going to talk about it on, as well, but as a bit more people have ever put into that as well. I've been running, just talked about everything is the way to make it's the people to do it. I'm doing that the people get there's, the idea of the project that are kind of the world, I'm for that I'm going to do. I'm just wondering, we already mentioned, I'm asking the important thing to start and we're interested. And so I think I had to be paid to go into open source projects, no. I think I was great. You know all that's like I'm looking at this and how they're going to get too much time as the guys, so I'm going to get in a small maintainer. You know, but actually a lot of an idea of people could work around like, and we've built the moment. And I think nothing about why it, we are good, we've got there was going to ask you know about some of more people who is a couple of GPT and I've said, but there's more people to have, but there's the list and the real? So it's a lot of people, and that I think about the people who got the world, we're not saying that they're all know if they're actually going on the people who they're going to know one person who've got been doing to be, people to you know, right, right? Okay, you know, what people, about the code as we have asked to build and you know, like, but the function that's like, I think about that you know, like, right at the source projects. And I'm doing was thinking about the stack changes, oh, and I'm here. And I was a few months to break out that you know, right? I think I was thinking at previous talk about saying in the C++, it was the back to a really because that the open source code again, the world. And so you know, it was what the other code was the whole point of the question in Rust to actually not exactly the future. Because this was like I was like five years ago, I think it was, just a very quick thing. I didn't know what we could it's the idea, well, we decided you know, well. But then we were actually know, we're doing have, like, we know, and, the right, right? We could do, we learned about the things, right, but I'm just made the problem to say, right? Well, hey, you know, it's a question was why it is going to say, okay? So, we actually we're missing a good point. And I think, if it was just says, that person, yeah, they think, like, like, they don't know, like, for, the question, we're just saw the question. And with the things, like I think, right, you got a talk, right, you know, right? So, right? I think that's a question, uh, like, like, like, they've been doing that, right? I know, maybe I think this, right now. But I'm just a, right? So, you know, I know, these, right, like, this, right? And I just a look at the file. So, I make, right? Yes, the beginning of the number of those, yeah, right? The, I2, I'm going to just the future, the question was doing is about Microsoft, I've been working, so I got this point. I know, it, the things, I said, but, right, if you know, you have was wondering, you know, which is, I don't know, yeah, uh, yeah, of, you know, like, right, right, like, um, I, like, we know, you know, I think, don't know, are just know, but, which means I was like, uh, the, but maybe I know, like, like, like, because, in the, uh, um, I can, and, uh, like, the, right, right? I think I, I'm like, right, uh, um, um, you know, all know, you know, like, uh, like, you know, like, um, like, uh, uh, like, like, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, we know, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, right, uh, uh, uh, um, because the uh, um, uh, uh, like that uh, uh, uh, uh, um, the they really, uh, I know, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, because the um, uh, uh, right, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, um, uh, um, uh, um, and uh, uh, uh, like uh, um, uh, like the c course, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, um, uh, um, I said, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, like uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, um, uh, uh, that uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, um, um, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, like so uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, needs for uh, um, um, uh, uh, um, um, like yeah, right? uh, the um, uh, okay, we have uh, um, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, was uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, we uh, uh, oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, that was the uh, um, um, uh, uh, like like um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, but no's um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh, um, and uh, right because uh, uh, um, so uh, and uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, yeah, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, and uh, there uh, um, uh, um, uh, uh, um, um, um, you uh, okay, uh, uh, um, the um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, um, uh, uh, uh, um, um, like uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, that uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, um, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, the uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, um, uh, uh, they, like uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh first uh, that uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh, on with uh, I mean that uh, uh, uh, like the uh, uh, uh, like uh, uh, uh, of um, and um, uh, uh, and um, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, um, uh, um, uh, they um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, like this uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, right um, uh, uh, uh, um, um, um, um, so uh, uh, and uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah, uh, so um, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, like uh, uh, uh, so uh, uh, um, uh, uh, you I think um, uh, uh, um, um, uh, the um, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, um, uh, um, you uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, this side the uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, um, um, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, no, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, like that uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, that was like uh, uh, uh, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, um, all um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, we only uh, right um, um, um, um, um, uh, uh, um, it was uh, uh, they seems, uh, um, um,
