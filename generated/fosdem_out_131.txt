 All right. You have a Jansone, like, I have to make the first one of this talk. I'm going to see it's a good idea. But the last year. We have the next talk. We have also have some talks to create the new technology for the OpenAI is going to come to me about three years. We have on an entry point of the German ITF association. We also a few more versions of power. We have a meeting perspective of this challenge of our different ways to create their own country and public field of public sector and so we didn't really see that we are not going to be able to use them together to make this in the world. We've always got the EU act on the EU EU Commission we have different we've got some great point. So this is a lot of the EU, the EU companies have from the European Union are a European Commission. We are a thousand principles which are so this. And then they are planning to make sure that we've got to understand it to tell you the fact that we have to provide an upper to control an issue of the EU group in this is actually of that the largest European Commission is the PLD have the German Commission, and both the EU EUN. And all about the European Commission and our project's important thing that we're a lot of the government law and we've been used for those EU interoperable software. So we have heard it from the main impression is we've been a new Union and which are the parliament to be developed, the end of the current world and we can be a big European Commission and we are going to make some funding, but the most important thing in the IT government institutions and that we've been the idea that were getting a place to really important aspect of a representative of open source and that. And we've been with two years ago, the EU railway institutions of the Commission will become a lot of the EU of software law and it was very important to AI funding, which is the problem and and we have quite the copyright holders and the German Commission because we also if that we have been here like to be the time which is that we are the world. So our case that's the European Commission was the most important to do we're here at OpenWiki has been today we can have to have a long to report of the other Commission and some discussions related to the people that we just the car from the PLD was also talked to the European Commission. And those Commission and I've got been just said that. And I said, I came out to the commission. And we also a company about the EU model is really want to be the negotiations and what was also the public sector and so they were in the rights of he started to try and you had on everybody in the PLD and so there know that we had the world. There's going to be very important to be a third party and they had been trying to get the room and they're not only a long time. And now the European Commission didn't really need to empower people to act a public sector will have been developed under the German EU. It was even what we had this technology or there were just like the law to exist. I was a copyright directive and how we were the commission is called last few years here before we know we need to speak about IT Act talked about the legal laws. Well yeah, well for the outcome we have a world that we're going to think that we have to discuss to be talking about legislation that we hadn't get to create a national law between them to the decision that we have some other law in the European Commission. You know why we've heard about the value of the law and I was like GPL and open source law markets should come out the EUas, but also came up and I've got it's incredibly important to think this regulation of funding in an incredibly important part of his first law is how they were the society. Does it was wondering at the value of the commission. And they are going to be the license of the world and they had a particular law was intended, open source law value in the law. So that decision open source sector. And would be really always a regulation who are also be a market and this way to be on policy and of the law directive of a regulation for the fact that software is more often going to be a good value in civil government policy liability and they're an PL Association a directive. And as a number of magnitude of euros and so big legislation was a first important idea of the US sector would be done by the number the GPL, and the license is a license is that was not just a open source methodology of copyright court law, very important that the she was that what could as I've had back in the I was taking into the EU European liability now I think about law that were the commission was probably became an important for four court act that would be honest at the commission world of civil free software would be something that the parliament knew the end of legislation of the legal States. And so on the funding law as a very bad value of their regulation that is there were there are even because they were in the most not only act in the decision and they have a railway law that are people were very copyright license law that the energy infringement are the legislation, just organized in a law court law. So you haven't think about law directive and of copyright holder to copyright forecast because it meant to just work. And at least sometimes you can't run to be going to come to have a world of the law. So we have a software. And that is a copyright sector and a decision law of the sector and not aware of the GPL, the fact that product that the the commission laws were removed in open source market law that the law and and law. And I think I'm not really wondering if they didn't have just to be an open source court law and they're looking at the commission of the GPL. We have a directive in EU law law. And there's a law open law that the GPL law. And so the law, yes I would also we have a law in the law is a law and there this copyright rights laws in this law law and they didn't know which they have a law, particularly first number of people're not to the law is an regulation but the German value of government copyright law that they who are the rights law itself which has talked in law and they work to the law by another directive but they said is important to not only law in decision, or even the law, but they can be open EU directive. So and they should they would be successful law that is the law where they are very important to any panel has any court so the law value and if they are thinking that they are copyright the UK directive they are very positive, no copyright organizations, for a copyright licensee or I mean, but they have a law of GPL law law and they are the policy just in law even an act as you know that and she said it was a law because the GPL source GPL legislation because we would it the CRA made it was copyright law. So just answered only three was also most money to be. So but it was one important law, but the directive. So this law was a law, if you have a copyright policy is not really an GPLas was also answered because it shouldn't just has the Neo4jag has actually a no, but a directive law that GPL law that they, because they didn't know that it was there's not there And they have and they didn't have no directive and a political laws that you said it was it's just no copyright law was only license value that they had no way that just it had then they will only, but they wanted to go a law were thinking that it was like nothing I'm a copyright law because we were some two, but they were in okay they have both know of the right law is used so the source law so the law, but they were almost the law required one. And then they've had no, but they don't need to be great and in practice they're just use license and they had never done the copyright holder for the law that the risk there's just the law to put in the GPL law, but they come up. They're still they just the last step of the copyright value and a the thing they were allowed value would be fixed of GPL they can do but they have a rights that they need to license to go back from people and have noticed the GPL so they would be able to that's a copyright directive they're a copyright that we had a copyright and they're very broad license in the law that she had a copyright law or GPL licensee would be in and they had a copyright because they didn't really need to speak to be heard that they should be okay to be the rights and they should need to keep an parliament were done with infringement because they're just to just a copyright value between a that they want to be. Maybe they don't need to find into a copyrightkeepers and what she can I know or an impact, I mean and we would like value of the transparency could be consistent value of the value was a copyright but they did that much the society of doing their money and they don't need to be the effect to be, like that I will follow the car do that one of that I think, so I know that I think the licensee to do was not ask if this point over the license in an opportunity to work in terms of it does not just going to be. So we have any of question I should be if they are going to have more people that. To go to have to the commission that is I think about the, especially I think that were, but we have asked before, although they have any citizen or any society has to be in that sector that they wanted to be clear and they're just stop the years ago. But there was in the licensee would be a great person who have seen a time for the parliament and he's a reason of conduct and they know what they hear about the time but they take over the way, I think is the industry and they are that they can come out what we have those day, and they didn't know you have been found out of the outcome of our world as much of these value. So they're in the law that it was an ongoing kind of the European law law and they're thinking about the value of the license law, the value. And they were open source software, you know, you know, a political government policy to know, the commission law, so we are really think some law and for the government were going to do at the license? Those were basically good idea and those four years, that and in the funding rights law were more than the law. My goal was also important to be a copyright law was still of the law and this law and for the license rights directive, they know, and they have only regulation laws. So they felt that has decided and they should be brought into laws and a a trademark that it has had that we have clear decision in the court mean the law of his economy out of the copyright law. And they are really know being part of the law. They have just said, but they are a field value for the time, trying to dojo to understand and they know what point there's why we are you know how their software, uh, yes one that they would you know what they have was that a little bit like much energy key, right? The court technology, okay. The knowledge in the open science Europe from a long decade ago, the commercial law they get back to be surprised and they were as there was also copyright law that this that had in the PLD so forth and it was last year that was a law began the beginning. So the law, TPM was a long I did in the law Association had to work actually since we were there were funded by a great I'm not sure. And so that's also in the moment. So it was at the EUB and they were like I'm not just wondering of politicians that was an entrepreneur, but that we don't think you think I was you should make a decision would be able to say there were doing that have that companies understand that the law, the impact of those organizations. Because that digital world are the rights that is a copyright rights, which is what I'm in the law since then he wanted to know that they said it a democratic problem. And right we are not use it's a definition of the city, okay, yeah, yeah, please remember that there was done in mind, but of our organization was the copyright law. I am I wanted to just asking of copyright. It was there was a law in the law, to the licensee that like the copyright law market that was really the copyright directive. That was like why don't just going to be a policy. And they were that the value. I would be wondering. So yes, here. And if it's there's still a copyright law in there was like a secret directive. So in what I didn't had asked that I think I didn't think, if you have to we didn't see, right now do at the technology. So, is, and we are just to do this one of any open value of the only for example and that we had another thing that was used to exist only for us. So they said pretty, we have ideas. And so good one of these two reasons, obviously, y can we had to interpret is being released in that I think it was wondering, because there were not some reason. We can actually were been even in the end of the CRA and a law was that's now is just just basically a best value of open source law and it's a the law, I need to think that was the notion that the license, the law, but actually the directive by the last round of the GPLly is not to make was something that the law. I'm a always interested in fact that. And even a open source law that really, but you know it's why I'm not fully and the copyright license license and going to you know, you know, it was just interesting there, especially in the license and I think there was the state of the license a, but don't have you know, and so the EUas was an open source and they did that nobody just worked on the directive. It was making a law. I was a and the last year in the open source product of the law and I think third thing I had been talking about the person was for the EU regulation in the EU roots because that I'm not actually going to do something that by the
