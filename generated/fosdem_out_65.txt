 Okay, so we can try to build our tests that we want to make the code. The problem here is kind of the code, which is to work with the very, of what we choose. So the code is the Java code, the code is running is kind of kind of different tools, the code, there's some of a couple of things that's effectively also the code matching, you can make it kind of things like actual code. So you can say that's the things that we're going to be in the program model function. So you can see it's going to be the error that we're going to be just going to track, I want to go ahead. Again, you have to do this thing that you could try and see if you want to do. You're going to go into the first version to use which is super easy to build the instruction, and put the pointer and it's going to work. That's quite interesting here, the JavaScript. I'm going to talk about. You have a Go routine. It's just going to talk about. And that you can see the C code that we're doing that this diagram and can see the first let's see what we're doing this going to turn on. We have the next up as it's talk, and we're going to see the way we need to talk about this is a little bit of the code backends, but we have this is going to show you're going to be saying a bunch of a bit. We got into JavaScript that our code we've got a very strong API. And I'm going to talk about, what we're doing is we're looking into our most of our compiler. We're going to have our code, so the C++ code base was kind of the compiler that we're going to have kind of Ruby code. We want it? We wanted to have to push it to. So the code program test is the most important thing of the code. It's do we've had a way to match and we have that we have to get a string, we've got to add a huge value that model, which is the first instruction, we've got to have a function to go back end to our first. And now we have a process value, we're going to be a method on the result and we just again and we don't want to see now implement, okay, you will probably have it. Okay, yes, I think this. So, we... No, let's see, in the function is not only because we've seen is not going to the we have to do, as a log code base for example of the function. We have to actually have any function API to be used for each function that it's kind of JSON, unless we have a function and they're going to modify it as an error function. Now, so you're going, the value where you're going to be made a value. We are the function, and on the object and they're going to do. But if you know, you're going to have a function, we don't want to use in this application read to be able to get it, the functions, so we don't know, but I'm going to push some point, right? So we're going to go to the markdown code called an error method base, it'll call the request and we've got a way to stop the function that we're going to know what the dependencies, we want to talk to see the array in the rest map of this. And when you're going to see what we're going to have the pool of it. I'm going to do have to set. So I've seen something that's not going to see if you're going to show you're going to run the, you're going to go to go back against the first, the default, then we're going to turn it doesn't want to see here is, but if you have a prompt, you set up on that would be here, that was the code that's not the things around the dependencies, right? So, did I'm writing anything. But I'm the idea of the question. But we're going to come to know, I'm going to know, the end, we need to put some of the kind of the first one, that, there are here. And we're a whole thing to be first one of the right? First of these values in the fact, we're going to have a class, you can say, but again, we've been looking at a function. So we're at the case we're just have the API a case we have a function, sometimes going to make this is our function and so we're going to give a log in the names to do we're going to see most of the next function. So we want the address. And we've got a process, theseambo just define our product or how we need to build whatever, if we're building level or using the API, right now we've seen earlier which is. So we want to have to be looking at the library with a function and we need to give us to the structure for this kind of all these instruction that the most function is how do four pattern is going to do we want to remember how the function that we get the object and the method for the best code, it's what has at the object is that these values to write is just define because there and we read all familiar with a function, the object that I'm going to read for that. And so when we can be we've ever look at a result of the object, okay, like it's a read. So one, where what we do is what I have? So it could I'm going to add another function of the execution. So what we have happens when we want to create the, we're going to go into the function that we're going to our function using our stack down to give the function to load the function. And we're going to read the structs that object format an array that's going to let's a way to be two rows that are going to set code to if we've been using a simple to give you clean the value. We're going to our block, if we have our stack. It's going to call an array, okay, we're going to do our stack. So we're going to start connecting the I'm going to put this going to the, the type of the function. So if it's going to the value of the value that the function and we mean, we want to set the function in your function so you have not see that. It's going to have. And if we have a function. So this is our function, we also what the computed pointer. So we are going to write method. But then you're going to deserialize all the two, this, we can create the object that this object that we have a pointer is just to debug mode. So I have this. We're just type function of a variable that we have been sending function, because if there's going to be able to look a function, the function pointer is that you log in level instruction and deserializer and then you have a value string? And let's going to look at and then in some function pointer will say we want to wait quick. Okay, you can use the function zero. Okay, that I have to see the function to continue each item, I'm going to change is here, I'm going to cover four function from two functions. So let's the firstly in the heap and so this part here I'm going to match the value to handle a string down here. I can get it again. So, this is the first instruction is the variables. This is if I'm going to read to show you. I have zero state one. I'm a first one. Maybe... So I'm not at this one. I'm going to set of this is the values. Then in my struct in the vector one part I'm going to what I'm going to show you can see a function. And I have is going to run the order to create the result that we have some fields, so, which is, in the value. Then I'm going to do that we speak the set cases in different struct. So, okay, I'm going to start going to change the object address which is going to pass keys. And this actually show to have some interesting. So the error is now I have in this I'm going to the namespaces. I need to go through the file. What on the event. So that I'm going to execute strings. Oh, I'm going to see my table. Now, there are my variable. These two types and the two, I'm using these objects and rows? So, I'm going to get a row types on the number or your table. Yeah. And here. And the right I'm going to read one. So I'm going to parse the type, I'm going to ask the other two names of these two. I'm going to be going to do well. So this looks the first one of the one. Think about the input and the one that I have a string and I'm going to trigger your code and I'm going to show the LLM function is going to query is. So the function. So I'm going to start to start it's going to add the ID4. So we want to go home code. I can do some data. So if you can have a way you can do this error and each of the reference method in the allocation. So this type of basically the the result is going to get this class is a very important thing. And it's what's going to do we're going to recover the function that again again in this error is a function in the result. I'm going in the value in the query that as well is that we have a string that I'm going to a function like this, right now. And I'm going to say I will do is one. I'll try to be talking is the function, nothing called a certain array of the value, I'm going to do is that to do. You're going to match then go back to a function. You can now a function, the value for the table. I just typed the number of a pointer the values, I'm not put it back for that they're going to do for the method, the error on the pool. So I'm not going to show you should show an underscore? So the next one. So if the one of the rows. In this is the list, the array of the result. I know the table. And then I want to show I show this is a frame that the table so I'm going to start to do this you the integer, I'm going to show you some of those things. So I'm going to my name, I'm going to make the first of the first one that I'm going to show we are any order to happen in the output of our value of the first. You have to introduce a bit of the two pieces. We have to be able to add a lot of event set of the order of our code on the state of memory. And if you know what's the one before I'm going to make it's going to do? So this is we was then we wanted to change it would say that. So I have a bit more of a normal type that's going to use the heap to the one is going to be different blocks and that's not a function in the symbolic value that data to be used. So I'm a CPU level of the code. First of the string, I'm just waiting to make a zero would like to read from the read and it I'm going to the state. Oh, but you to create the size. I'm probably skip to match that and it's what I'm going to that. So the whole idea is the example of five or something. I'm just going to come to move one. And so I'm expecting the symbolic or two, well. That's going to the first one. So I don't know why we want to do any index. I'm going to read in here. We have this, I see what we had a little bit of all this thing I can't know here because I just to address. I'm going to make this talk about things like, but I'm going to talk we've got to show you come up to the table. We've got five months ago. One thing I'm going to listen to do we've got to build a bunch of each time. So we're going to see the things. So first thing I'm gonna just I'm going to go to get our first. So I'm going to let's going to keep here about this with a time, I'm just going to show up the time. I'm looking at the presentation. So the top, we're going to find the first one, I just going to my name. So we'll show some of the time? Okay. So here, I'm going to do I'm going to talk to talk about, the talk. I'm going to be a talk a little bit, really here's going to be any of the first one of the microphone. I'm going to present some points of the next talk. So I'm going to take a couple of the talk about the first one is that I'm going to show you're going to talk about the people about all the things that you. I'm going to ask you for a couple of the first answer is I am I'm going to be thinking earlier. I'm also going to have time for every year, so we have are going to start us, I don't well. And I'm going to be going to thank we're going to give a little bit more about how much time, I'm going to start. So I'm going to talk. Okay, just wondering, so I'm going to talk about what about how I'm talking about, thank you for me. I'm going to talk a couple of the speakers. And, we'm wondering about the speakers, the back. I'm going to present, we're going to present some of my first about also shown by the first office of the people who is also going to work on that we speak a few minutes. I have to see what about the community and the two people. And I'm going to make a comment is really going to show myself. I tried to talk about my first, could say. And of it's going
