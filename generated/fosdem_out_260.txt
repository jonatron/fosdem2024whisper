 So, next, we know, in a very first, our first version of a little bit of the other system, we'll use it. And this is like the moment in the, we'll be a bit more important, which I know if you're going to do that to talk about this. So, how do you need to use a service that? And the user should ask you to bring a custom user. I'm a lot of that, I think how should we need to go into the user provider, but let's say, an unint and create a message, well, in the proxy server, and then user agent, it's an email server, but you're the server. We need to do an email application. And also to have some other devices to modify the server. You have the server implementation in a schema in the server, you want to look for a login connection. This is a prompt. You need to handle it, or a server with the interface, and that the server that allows for another service and then do this API is basically the message. And then, I'm doing that's going to try to be here on metrics, I can do this with this. So, if they are referring to some other applications that you want to click on, do you can do that. It's how do you want to share those your server. Can you take a password. What you want to do you want the server's not want to do you have to use the server, you need to start? Okay, and check one. Does you need to update the client to use. So that. So it's the client for the server, what we're going to change. So, I'm going to build the front of the client to answer is done. I'm also a server provider, the server email application. That's possible part of the server, I mean, the server is the server. At this content from the server. I'm going to add to play. I'm just wondering how we have a server for the client side. So the user, I'm going to like to talk about this, we're just going to do we're going to start using what I'm going to see on the server. So I'm going to ask the server. I'm going to ask. And then we have to use to make a server for very first. We have to specify the server and we want people will do that we have the server and we want to end to continue to use here. We want to have that. Nowadays, if you're going to have to add to do the open the server, all these things. Any of the server, for the client. 
 Okay. We are coming to do this. We have time. This is this. We are going to talk. Okay, thank you, everyone. Any first talk's all. Thank you for the screen connection. I'm using a working on your side. 
 Thanks for me. So that first talk. I'm going to talk about me. And I'm very much. I'm a talk about a quick introduction about building up. In here, I'm going to help the room. So I'm going to show you a talk about a talk about RTC UI. The next speaker is today I'm going to our own the talk. We have our talk. Thank you about here, a few guys are a slides, the stickers to talk of course. Thank you is really am a really a student for example of contributing to talk about why we work around in the front end-endA to a European Union in the Internet. We have heard about the meeting. I'm also have any slides. Please have a next time to our software engineer and the founder of the talk is an architecture that is 3D, the last year. We are some, which I was I became a few years in April. In the first talk about the Open Science Summer of the modern 3D and I said because he's been a topic here. The history will explain the co-called open source railway community. And he's the US and the AI platform and we haven't see in the EU industry of the first of the European Commission and started, and also about the railway project that means that are open source software and I see on Wikimedia Foundation. And the world of the European Software Group. And I have a month, the European Commission. Thank you have been doing this year, I have something, but there were also also a bit of the European Commission of government and I think about the most important and this year I'm there were going to be able to be open source maintainer's why we had to start to talk about the presentation at the political of the year. Thank you for the European Commission in this presentation. And thanks for a step we had started with the year? We saw the various European Commission will have two years ago, but thank you to talk. Thank you very much. Thank you, hello everybody. Thank you everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you work. 
 Sorry, so much, much. Thank you very much way to talk. 
 Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you for the lead for the railway commission and everybody. Thank you for attending? Thank you very much. Thank you very much, very much. Thank you. Thank you for now. Thanks for the project we don't really care. We. Thank you. Thank you for very, if you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 Hi everybody. 
 Welcome. Thanks everyone. 
 So hello everybody everyone. I have to our talk, I am our open source software from being the room to introduce our goal of the challenges and Martin who are talking to give him, a few minutes. Software and I'm I am I'm going to talk about a bit about the first time for an end-time project. I will talk about a long time. I started working group of My name of I'm a network and I am going to the web session and the next level of you guys. My name is to talk about tech perspective, which is a researcher in the University of the amateur organization and for organizing a very briefly to have in in the past time, which is the first point of the first day to continue looking forward, right outside of a while. A bit about a very big time to deployer and to first problem and there. So I'm the left. The first interesting is a new open source project of the ecosystem is my first half a community was the community Initiative needed to have been using a successful effort to keep an open source community. And I'm not so I'm going on a collaboration for the source project and I think of the project. So I'm going to talk to use open source. And which is to the commission and in an first one is if you're just keep using the project developer project community, you will be able to make a good people. So there's pretty good to have been some ideas on the moment. So I hope they pay for a great. So I had a while we have here here. And there's too far the best time. It's a good. And because they are you have seen in the majority of how would be of a lot of a long term in a lot of code. And with people which also had been working on the last year. So it was just for the people. And because that's a lot of people to think that they have been as the problems. And there's the past that I was a lot of OpenAI has done this is only one very famous and but it was a little bit of research team. But so far as well, but I'm just open source project was a few years at the community that point in 2016, you can't have it was the beginning of the year, which was quite bad person that we've pushed to be a few million a lot of open source code community with the technology. And if I've been the project. And one that I was I know the open source community lead tech company have been on the last year that people who wanted to go to get a software on the issue of the community. And I think it and of software group from the open source project. But like that was the way of the future to go to do that you know if you know if you know, right? So that you know, you're using the people who have like, you know, at this project. And so much time, do you know how to do you know, in a lot of the project. So, like I'm going to think from the project? And there's the community and the open source software and the way that says, I'm mostly what you know what I was in Europe was just wondering the project that I had been being the code. I was here from. So I wanted to say I was to work right now is what I have been doing here today, I found that I was that I was going to think I was going to say, I saw that I just stop talking to start it was wondering, but I was great, okay, but I was there as the idea. So I've got a couple of my experience that was a little bit earlier, I was like I was wondering. I was glad they looked like, but I was like you know, and you know, it was, I think there were like like, and I already thinking about it was a lot. I got a bad. So, but it comes from the last year ago, the next year ago, but anyway and that the experience in the point was this year. I was very excited was just kind of open source project engineer in the most of being had to be open source, I wanted to think that we were there was a first working day being 20 years ago, but so the workshops, the last year. And yeah, like 10 years. I don't think we had what were so I was not saying now, this to look like I wanted to think about what I had to describe the time. So I'm just in the front, I was wondering if I worked on the year ago, of the question was wondering it was I said that I have this was, but I was that it was the open source project was not open source. And I was a lot of that I think we had a bunch of data from that was a successful so we have both in 2019, I have all of Kododojo that we just had to get in 2019, and for people, but the first people were doing and I was saying that did it's very long time to actually it. We have a clear, and we was something about the end up in this day, was very quickly. And in US, so it was generally but I was a little time away from our best and we have heard in the first year ago, for the case, but we had to be a month, which was doing the past that they got to know, and it was there was a lot of an open source projects, but they are not as of people may know, we cannot be able to be aware of these software as well. And so the one I think it was just was also about the CRA and he said, why you mentioned, but the University of the source, so I had like 20 years ago is the first be a lot of the most people that he had some of companies, they wanted to work under the year ago. So I think, at the license, so I will be a directive in the moment. Sorry to present 20 years, even on Europe. I was wondering, but I was asked that was wondering. So I was the last six months ago. I think, after the right? But I was an open source world of the commission. I had to show you know, I was wondering, so I knew that we have been doing not so far, I think that. And on the funding so people, like I don't remember the next one. I think about the commission, we're also have the product and Martin was going to do,. And the people were doing that had wondering, I know, time. And then, the reason for, that came at the German, I had the first point of this was that was trying to start at the commission, was, so, there was there was open source year, and the railway sector, so many projects around it was the last year, the open source source world and I went into the technology. But and the Commission had that I was a nonprofit EU organizations for, I'm saying it was wondering, like with the digital world. And I was the topic that I started then we had a round of the end I don't see, but I got to invest into the world. And I said, I didn't know, I might show it was a little bit of what we've ended up, which was, which was actually came over here to actually a TPM and the open source of the only year. And then got all in the issue. And I just going at in the day, of you was wondering can't a decision that was using the place to thinky said, not to have a commercial and then the end of these three years ago, but the open source world were some times to do at like the world, I said, I think, good. So I had. I said you know, since we had a year, a free world was doing the moment, yeah, this. So, like I was we've been thinking how many people had to make sure, for instance, which was the history and I'm also had in the very happy to do we had a while I'm a years ago. And so we were using co-based from the US organizations for that I'm using a company that was the US, what I had to talk of the fact that we have been maintaining the 80s have to get. I'm here. So that they did, and they had a lot of the technology in the idea that was that I wanted to have had to change that they did is that by the ecosystem. And this technology, a single place, a lot of the idea of the overall, the EUD can be in the way that in a look at least the market, the first that I was more than a long period of the PLD is something that I actually came that we were going to be, the Ministry of our plan is not having a years ago, I had to support, but I also started to focus on the research in June, to be able to be
