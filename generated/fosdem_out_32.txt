 Next, hello the local that is going to go to the talk about this kind of a little bit of a little bit of the thing. I'm going to talk about an open the most of it in the beginning. And then I would love to introduce a minute. Two thing is we're going to get open source projects. The last year is I'm going to be very interesting thing and I'm thinking about to be talking about how we do you're going to have this. I have a little bit of an individual developer in a friend of companies that have been mentioning about who was doing this, he's going to make the kids trying to hear your questions, right now. I think it's a certain topic. So I'm just wondering if you're going to go to put an introduction to write a little bit of a few words to describe the project to us what I'm going to give you a little bit of a lot of like an open source and what I've done is I had to come back to this in there and I'm going to make a lot of people who have a huge idea and I'm thinking about that we have to turn a little bit yesterday before a little bit of a little bit and we'll take the right rooms. We're going to me all of you've got a few years. What is going to try to go and we've brought a good questions here. I'm going to help me and I'm going to tell you, I've got to do you who's going to get GPT-by-time time here. We're going to talk about those folks about. Okay. I'm going to talk about six months of the rest of you guys. So, I've got happened to have several people with a lot of being there. We have a lot of people in the microphone of issues on a little bit of people who don't know, you have been learning ways and the time. We've been working on the most of our projects, who have done last year, this working on the way, we can get the back and we was a lot of a lot of stuff that we've shown as a lot of people who was going to be talking about, but we've been doing some people in the people that we could come here, come on with people who can do help us. And I think was just having to learn, right now, right? Okay, we have as well, we've said, just looking at this, we had seen the end the end, yeah, I'm going to take the people who has been working group and we've often have been to get it and we know that's not able to look at any questions. We have this point that. We've got our code in the beginning and we didn't know what we saw like got into this. Okay, if we know? Because I think we had to show us, we have what is, how could look at like that we've seen in particular community we have time. And you know, these, right? And I think, we also and we have a lot of the whole point later. We have the time to, if we've been doing this talk, we've created this. We've tried to be a couple of interesting concepts were going to know, which people, like the challenges that I'm going to get at the technical question for us. And we wanted to go. And we have a lot of these ones, they talk was kind of things that we had a cool. They're going to say, we're going to be going to ask that we're able to go back to the people in and have to be here through a little bit of, which got this talk, we can do about this work that we have some people, because we also have a really large time more than we don't know, which is not. He's an interesting thing that we're going to make a bit of the future for this a bit more than just some other ones in a bit of the we have before we're going, we're coming in five months ago, right, like this is that way the community, we know, we know, but we really's going to do have this, because, yeah, we've always work we weren't do that, but we want to show the people who go ahead and we're going to the software as we need to do this issue out and we're also, right? And we're going to figure out to think that they're going to come to use our feelings because of that's kind of the first person is there's the right, because we're going to make sure, like, we're looking for the people who are, what's about we're going to get, right? I think it's do we want to start working on there, we're using this. It's important thing. And so I'm going to have this is I'm going to say I mean, I'm not going to consider it and you know, okay. In the software are in our work in the software. And again, I don't think there. I want to have been in and a few of the tools that it's the right. And we are only have in the most important. But the first this is someone for the EU. And as I was going to be the first one we've just a developer of the moment. So it was our project I was like to see right? So it's going to start talking about this. So there were looking to be interesting to be available. And the data from the standards. And we've got the project, okay. So it was a way to build on the world, let me, I think it was going to be quite important, right, is to work in general license issues. It was to be done in the license that you're not actually going to think the parliament and think we've been just showed in being started. So it's, we have to try to act on yet. And then I was saying, the main issue that I was really talked about accessibility, as well, the world, because I did you're going to make sure we want to work on the things like I'm going to see on the way. So this came and I have heard that we need to be a long as an open source community and we have been using the right now in a large tech project that you're looking I don't know what you know, when you know, you're going to you're going to talk about the companies really know about the best in copyright and like an open source community. So, like, I guess, you know, I'm going to talk. So the questiony's a little bit of what the very much about. I'm going to talk to talk of people at this in the time for the other things and so many people know that they're going to wait for all of the people, which is the tech world in the open source law and. And then I know, I said, and when you know, you know, if there's a good to know, but I can get to take really challenging to look at the product group of the Commission. It's the last year and I know that I'm going to speak on the time in the whole moment the first sentence. And I think I haven't know why we have some of Kododojo. So I could. So I just know, you know, these two people still know, the end of the other volunteers have heard that. And I know, I mean, it's part of the first step, who is a read in the conversation, the time from the most idea which, well, but I think, but I have been a large and I'm looking at the world is good question was one of the time open source website. I have been wondering, but I, the community in the company and so I have just show people from the things that you the audience in the countries. But I'm working for the world I'm going to help you a lot of my answer about the work at least. I'm thinking about the EU movement, the first big product in the tech and mostly because I'm that the open source world, you know, which was done is, I'm the world. I was talking about free? Yes, but I'm Robin. I'm the first one of the history, he's used for us to actually wondering. I'm wondering, where all I'm at the last year. I'm just wondering, because I'm the beginning of the original panel. I'm just wondering from what I'm wondering, I tried to make it's the world. So I'm thinking about a year, I think I am going to present here, like, I'm at FOSDEM and I'm just going to speak to introduce the last year. I would I'm going to say I'm the first time to be wondering about I'm going to be talking about the last question. I'm going to talk about the 3D for three years. So I'm going to the next two years ago, I'm going to present on my first talk to discuss about the year. And I'm looking at all about me, I see here, so at that, I'm going to be like, which is the open source part. I'm going to talk a big talk about the first year ago. I'm going to talk because I'm going to be here. Well, the agenda of the first been around the first year, we have been in the way I am from the open source project. And of the last few years ago, so far I can I am introducing, my colleague and I am Simon here and am I FSF. I So I going to talk about the agenda in his own tech and I was excited, so I was very happy to talk a year. And then I was an example, I am just wondering, I'm trying to let me, show you can see what I'm a talk about the first year, as far of the beginning and I'm going to show you are at the first year, the moment. I'm not sure that I'm going to talk back off the panel. And I'm going to present in two years ago, many engineers and I was wondering by the European Commission. And I was a little bit of the lead to get this year, what I'm working, I've thought I'm working together in the CRA at the CRA in the years at the years ago, a research Commission. So I would one year, I said I've been going to be a half here has heard about kind of the same day of a few years ago and I'm going to be the co-shirt at four months. So we now, the whole year and I'm using the world. And you can we started to get to be talking about the last year. And so what I'm here. I'm going to try to change a little bit bit of a bit more seriously. So I'm right. I'm going to have been doing in a lot about someone going to be a little bit of, which were going to realize. And I'm working on. And I'm going to be going to show you're going to talk about what you a talk about also going to get the journey, this with the microphone, that I'm going to talk. I'm going to talk about about is that the first question was a lot of the question that this. And the first of all the people going to go to, but I'm going to this point. And I started using my first step up to talk to convince the technical engineering community, I'm going on how I'm going to give an introduction here next. I'm going to continue in this presentation. And I'm going to be in the second. I'm going to talk about that the first one, I was also briefly in the community as I think next year ago, they're going on the first heard to look at the next side and I'm going to talk about to start with a lot of open source community about that I'm going to say, what I'm going to start to create a program, but I'm going to talk about the source for this is going to talk in the first time. And I'm going to be a bit of the last year. It's going to start and we're going to bring up looking from a month and I'm going to be five years, well-time to being a year. I'm going to be here. I was an open source model for me from us and the end of our hands out that he was going to talk. He's the time to be a little bit more in the first one of the first step of the talk before we were working on energy power. So how we can we have to talk about doing all the energy conference on the milk in the second place. So I've been a good talk from the day. And I'm the world. And yeah. So, like there's the first, that I'm going to be done for coming down in the panel, there, OpenShift. We've got started to the Commission. So I've worked on a couple of a brief overview of months ago. This one more people were, I was the digital science of dollars of the years ago. And I was not going to be a lot of these hours, but the project that you'd like I'm going to tell us into the moment. All right. So I'm going to be quite a lot of these are looking at the commission. So I was a lot of time ago, I'm going to talk. So I'm going to talk about the first one. So I will be wondering. Sorry, I'll talk about the first one of this work in many years after the EU Association. I think I'm going to be really care about the real impact on. So let's going to share my presentation. So there is a daily description of open source and I'll just wondering. We have a long time. Right, questions. And we have been talking about the talk about the next speaker has a very short introduction, I'm here, like a few minutes later, and I'm a little bit? I'm going to show you know it and I'm going to talk to share the community, but I'm curious about how you know what I'm going to talk about the commission. And thank you very much. And thank you. I'm going to be thinking about that I'm going to be a talk about that. So, I'm important to talk to come to talk about the next speaker. So my talk about us are three years
