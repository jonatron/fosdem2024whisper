 Okay, let's see? So, welcome everyone. That's talk to this here. And you can find a few other ones. So to help us to introduce this. So let's see, the next talk is this case, you can generate power futures. So if you need to use this. And, just giving you some capabilities. And the path of us our knowledge between each of the first is open source. So, the next slide I just to ask a little bit about earlier. So this is a lot of more about. So. This is how we are a lot of data and how often about energy? With real as a few months or less. And I have time. Let's say, again, if we used to see the slides. So if that I'm going to come here. Let's see how to start these guys have to talk about it. You have an actual data range. So I'm going to do is, that like to show you that I'm going to tell you how we have to see the blocks. We are getting back to add more. I'm going to run in the query is a lot of these data that are the actual data for the world and open science. It's just a little bit important for the AI is the two years ago. So it's our first. It's important. It's possible and we have a database and it's done at all the right. I didn't remember the data science model where the data is a lot of what does the data are in the data flows to look at the standards that. So first point is, I had to start with different concepts on a lot of tech. That's what's getting into Amsterdam, how many of context description, and what I'm going to discuss and we get into a lot of the whole list of things. But on the table. So we've been asking a look at the data, I'm going to ask the data sets of the values to be there's not really the space, but you know there. Everything is a more abstractions, there's also a number, has a lot of states in one of months of authors. So you may have a number of thousands of people that can see how much more contributors are trying to be a structure of different types of work. But the same thing is a lot of data. The main idea is that you may have to implement data model structure that a number of legislation in the value of value because it's open science. So here, of the knowledge that you can be used to maximize the value in that's only in that the table, the other is that you can be able to make sure that well. So it might be the problem we don't have these ones that you can have a sense of the best to call it can find a lot of a thousand steps to make that much immediate model, you can be used to find a community that other world, the energy production system of it's the source library, so that you can be more than three years ago. It's not really important. Our security science model, how do not on the global model, less. And and you can be your mission in the actual AI, but basically that the most important. The life becomes often power is basically the world. It's in the technology will be the effect this is the first, but it's a lot of the first time. I'm very first FFTs are in a thousand energy calculation. It's the states of the data set of the railway technology of power and all the context is very important to to ask you and as far. And the question is this is, we need to go to change the data in many things to the other things for example. So in the last half years ago, you can be in the first one five minutes. And I know it's the bandwidth and if any energy. And so on small power consumption we have in the science, when you know whether it's how does is so that you see. So I said to take a lot of power we started to the bandwidth. So I mean, and I'm actually do I am going to think that this is more likely to start, I'm a lot of energy. I'm going to do a bit of the energy energy. How did I'm going to let's going to introduce us look at least this time to do you because it? How don't use and how we are you hear the power between the quality. I'm doing a very excited about that we have the energy energy and this questions? And this energy bandwidth energy independence. We ran into the power consumption, and we are at the energy consumption, we can also talked about energy energy makers and. So I'm just wondering for the world. Because I think this moment we want to get time to time. I do some research in general energy, we're time here. Thank you, thank you, I think my next time. 
 Okay, did the first, some round. Okay. Okay. Hello, thank you very much. So it's another talk, thanks. I'm just going to talk about this one of applause. I'm Alexander DAG in a little bit of the presentation. Okay, because I was the EU. I'm going to go to talk about how maybe we are only showing you know about the energy estimation on the energy consumption in our model. I'm talking about open to the network research in between the panel to make energy consumption in 2019, but it work in the knowledge. This is a little bit more important to climate. So I'm a long time. And this talk to tell you before, but we are up to what we have, the next months, but now know, in this is the capacity in the product. So this case I'm doing it's a bit of the end of software is what we're about the CRA. So, energy so I'm being used to work to do we want to do and we're going to hear me. See. I'm going to take the start learning, this into the moment, we're going to live stream to go to join up our open source revenue to continue to talk, let's going to another microphone of, who are using energy energy we're going to talk about the beginning. And I think, many that we have this workshop. It was the world in mind we had this, we need to have to do. So we need to talk to the first of us. So we have a lot of the university and we would be going to do also had to do a much energy quality of the data and they're going to talk about we had five years. So that was also have to discuss in this year, there. And so, the second of a lot of the law that we had this. So we were our first few months here we need to the second step of the first step was quite quickly the first time. And before that was not open source. We were wondering, so we were the beginning. We had a lot of the end of our three years ago, because we used to work on the parliament was that in the real time is built through the world. And we would be another year after all the University of these who wrote a sort of you to see why it was that I think about the world and we had this. So yeah, I had a little bit was really fun to see that could what we had an work for the whole situation. But the panel was a lot of how it was thinking about the world. So we had in the court, mostly introduced to be part of people see it in open source software and we have already heard that we had a half years now now. So we released a few months. Okay. But we had a very, we've had a project just been using a product space of the impact on the EU institutions of the Cyber month. And I decided to provide a lot of the main tech perspective was just, but this and they need to know that these things like in the thing about what we have is the whole challenge that the grid. So I've had a bit of the first release and if you just worked on technology and now have a lot of a long time that the time went to have been doing that the moment that the day and the community was in the world that. So I could be like, I've had the digital rights and from the decision. And if you're hoping to get the first-position and you're doing this stuff coming in the world, the bottom, very often because it's actually went into the EU and they were like the EU to provide the commission that are the open source world of the beginning, the Parliament, right at the PLD was also the world to work and most people who had to be a world. And that it was a lot of the open source world that open source community was really started in CRA was quite a really something that was being moved to actually our world. And then you know what we also trying to grow back end of the future is not as well in the day part of the project. And today we started to see here and I was very closely to community were a lot of the future. And obviously as a strong software team had our community in the future and we were talking about tech community, and they had to invest into a lot of the market, as I was here where they were contributing to improve the future and they made this is just the right? So they are in the community industry in a bit less open source community agencies, what they were getting data are very familiar with a successful software, and, so it was used in the largest world, for the world, but they need to do we had this, we need to think that they have, so they were supposed to try to be used to talk about the two hours because the code's a lot of the way to be able to be the foundation to be a lot of this. It's why they are not a bit of the software, there's wrong, right, if you know that, I think that when they are going to do we are not all in it, but they're going to have the world. We're going to discuss about the open source software making sure that the people have even get the product, the time, but something that people as we have just wanted to happen in the world who are very important thing to think about three weeks. And so first time. Well, we have to have a bit difficult to work of an open source community, we had to think it, we need to be a lot more time to build the long time, which is if it. And as we need to do it's going to think, we want to look like a good problem. Yeah, yeah, we're going to have to go ahead of our community for most we want to start from the community, right? One of the AI that was talking about the DERN are going to the community where the main research project, how we have the foundation for open source community. So, we have a full source community, there's the world companies are the people to have this from the world right now there are a lot of energy of ways that we're going to engage and we can be able to think that way that we also with us our software. We're very quickly talking about the EuropeanOSS Initiative of standards which is to improve people in what we've been talking about this product in Europe and we're going to do. So we have is to know that we want to talk about the legislation. That's mainly about the EU world of the world. So this part of the Drupal scientists is a long spent the EU organizations and also about 20 years ago. The other product and I'm just doing's the Commission and we're going to talk about the one of our EU could be a long term of the EU organizations would also you like to do and we also be talking about the EU people on the standards. In Europe that we're going to us to be able to talked in a world to travel ecosystem of the EU law and all of that we could be going to have a digital railway interoperability organizations has been paid to be able to create a risk to work on and think that digital market transition from the world and we had a digital rights and actually wanted to the other society is the EU to make that that we wanted to go to get open source and we're looking at the product. And the German region at this year of legislation in the regulation that we've been this was basically and the government and then we've been able to be open telemetryists to see this month a great and to show it's what we've had to create a sustainable open source law, which is important to just a long time and we're going to summarize this law. The German agencies are in June to need to do. And I think that I'm still as I think the idea that they have to do have a real European Commission and we're talking about the same as an open source world and the fact that they didn't mean this certification in the world and they're a lot of the impact on a good because they have been so we've been using the whole lot of people who have we have been so much since then they give and they could get. The history of months in the problem is as a lot of the beginning of employees use of their institutions in the European Commission in Switzerland. And that we have also have now funded half the past that the tech world. And on Paris that it's what they also the commission. So the companies have is what they've been the organizations were going to open source project is very interesting because we're going to think I ended up there were like just said we've tried to go through a small, all the world and what he was going to make, so much money away from the parliament, the commission were the companies and they were creating this law. And so in the UK law in the licenses. And they had a law was basically the GPL is there actually a legal law and they can be saying that he sees in a EU and they were a way you know that the law's important thing not just so we had a value that they were trained on their rights that they had it would have quite an copyright that in the law we have to see that they were not only chance for the license by copyright the law, but the good that they were thinking, the license clause was the copyright law in the law, they would be useful cost of copyright that they had that they were a law in the rightsas has been a sustainable that's the outcome was the European Commission saying that they could you could be very specific law and so long term
