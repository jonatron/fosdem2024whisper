 So this is a lot of new for example. You could be a little bit more complicated to be done by using a very stable to do it. You see some more detail but we might get in a lot of technologies that you'll say this is it's not just to do one. And in your users like the same thing for you so the front of the challenges that the actual model is the same thing I'm going to show me the first step is. The other thing that you are we're thinking about how we build the way. What else you want to build this is a job more complex performance for, things. We're going to look into the libraries that you need to know it. The second thing is that it's going to have to be the code for us, we need to go with our users and we want to match this block our code around a few types of different types of data. You can remove the JavaScript code, and then keep the code to be is the code, there. You can see that you're going to match a string. You can have a result in a number of variables to the code, which is the code and the global code base for a piece of context. You can see that it has to work for example, but if you can you're not use a string, you're using the query code that right? You can just use this is your code that you can play on the API that we have a test. You don't use Ruby code. You're going to run on the right place to be able to be a column one can use to look at the library, you can be aware which that you can be able to, like a JSON object and then you could be kind of this or you want to create a result to build a table as a variable with it's the right? You could be used when you can do this. This is to get to go to what we have this is just the call it works. You can be a bit closer to a lot of thing. It's kind of this thing about doing in the entry, we try to make a class. It's going to try to declare the most of the JavaScript code base pointer. You could be a function and you have a command and try to make a line. You and then you can see the actual code is the function and we often function that we only the state, but we need to try to start the output pointer for example, which is. This is not, is something that we need to look quick. If it's going to say that we just one. It's going to be messed up, we have an error when we're going to be the, but we're going to do them will keep some like to be executed, you may not really need a string. But what part of the string, and the function is you actually going to be used before what we're going to be only got, where to be because we need to do this code and get executed and we don't have to edit our error and we can have the message, we have to specify the error and we've seen that. What the results, we have to implement that's here and make a whole function from the error is on the error. We're going to our API and if we got the object because code out that. So that's going to see there's not really obvious and our code field and then we want to test case of our behavior and we're going to do something that work, we have our function, and we're going to return the value to be able to look at the return to do. We're going to continue to do so we have our code in this case. We're going to be going to be going to try to to be do this memory is going to keep it's going on this. And give that's another thing that we're going to do to be just the code that when we've got some additional code that we're going to implement a look at type of this structure across our error for us this pointer. We're going to be open source code and we want to have an object. We're going to be ready to we're going to be able to reach that we're going to think about our data driven code number of the things that we're going to make that our model so we're going to discuss the opposite that we're going to do some of our model. And the main point is an array that you can get into this figure out of these versions of the fact that you're going to note, but a bit of the results that we need to stop the query will try and the same structure that we need to start with the future that part of the code, well be a very difficult thing that we are the method that we have a bit cool branch. Why it's what we have is going to have some data sets? And I'll be able to integrate is that is kind of the second. And I don't know what the ones's going out of the JavaScript is that are there are this. And it's kind of a way people are the exact text. People want to ask out that the way to be a function is done that you can be around the idea for that have it's going on. So there was a really the way to think that there's a bad because people have the models. There's a lot of the different problems because you just a lot of code and what I have the code in the code and look and there's all really, like how you don't really don't know and how to look at the code code, actually does it's going to show and you and how much changes were sort of the things like the reason how this is going to be the code and I felt like my project. And I think I can the types of the code in the thing that all going to do I'm going to show you kind of the numbers. I can I'm just run. I'm measuring the most of the things that the language that they were kind of like the things I'm going to do, but that they're going to do is the question of what you all, they're going to start doing this and these information that we're going to make sure I left to look about one question here that have to jump to think we've got a lot and now do we're going to get started writing to five levels that. We would love to start into some people who also have a lot of the most of things that we didn't have back in the question. Not what we tried to do? Or I want to have like to have issues with the perfect, and we would really have to know what the code and they want to look at this kind of the end of a problem and they want to use the point because we have to look like this and we're going to say we have a list of a lot of values that they're going to look like even a lot of people that. And because the role have to understand what they're doing is it's in the people here because you're going to realize that you're going away the table and you're going to have this or you're going to look for that you're going to have like like a data from just looking for you're going to have a certain data that's like this method that I'm going to get what I'm going to talk about the job in the right at the column but I'm going to figure out of doing is we're going to look at the result to take a kind of this table that really important. And if you can we're going to be going to the result of does have a read this thing that you can be the object into the number that people at having a, like a number of the idea of problems of events at the code, and the way that data to speak to have the data in the results and we need to put the data into this table and this data in each kind of the table and you can be a good. In this is the table, we have a map for each other types of the table of these and then for example, the data. You can be here. You can give the main thing that then we have to show about what the rules is when we have when you had again start to our data, we should have to see on the deserialize that as a specific when we have three examples of what you have we're trying to figure out how to make a query, how like this diagram, if you share, you're going to read down for a couple of the result, you don't know, you need to create another metadata, is happening, this, you can switch, and then you can do this out the data and the data that's going to read that basically the node with this with a prompt, which means in the graph and the table part of the description, I think should just going to see that when as I'm going to say, it is going through to ask us, but I'm saying, it's you can be going to deal with a table that case, but it's let's going to do this in this, but it's just says, how to do you're going to do you can do this, right now we're looking at the data. And I've got an instance, okay, people standing up to focus on to create a table, I think, oh, you know, because that's a prompt. But we're going to create a database, right, like this is that are being a data from the data field, but I think about, we're going to use cases and maybe we have to turn out of these patterns. But that we have the question, right? So, we are like, right? So what do we actually one of the fact, today we have, we do is we're going to ask me like is that, like a question. So, like, we don't have a question, yeah, the, we've read the value in a statement, I've got an object here that if you know, you want to, this, this API, right? So you can, if you need to look at that, okay, but if you're going to do the whole thing I think, I just want to dojo. Okay, I are you have a picture, right. So you're going to define the right? The server and a data that the user are not just the right thing, right? So all the main one was just go to do I'm going to this, what I wanted to solve that I'm an end, I did is a little bit of the things. It's not from, and I'm going to do we were trying to do that? I mean, so I don't know, and I was afraid to hold the first question. Let's going to do we feel like, still going to have this stuff, but this is that I didn't think this work, actually the result of course, we had to just do that. Like as my question was we basically. We had to see is done, okay, they have to add the other types of the CripPad before over to one-V. And if we have 20% of the last year, we saw this week at least, we've just know that NBC and we've been running, we have a lot of one year we need to introduce a couple of those that. And just see it's going to make sure. So I just basically you. And then you saw today, this one, I'm going to go to say, it's the work, I'm going to happen. So we need to talk about the end of the, this. So, if you know, I'm hoping, we've got the CERN. There's talking about the fact I'm going to what I'm trying to recognize what I'm going to be wondering. I'm thinking, what you, you're going to call, you know, you do is going to give you know, right? The thing I'd like the beginning, we're going to go ahead and tell you, this is when you a fun, at the way to focus like, and you can just try to go through this, if you know, you need to, you know, you know, you have some of course there's the people that have to do with it and you should be a lot of what we have, but that we can do. We want to do we're going to have to just a lot of how much. I think that before we need to support for a lot of people. So you can we just use this. And yeah, that we have the problems, good idea that they use cases out and they want to run on. And if you have people, we want to start with that. And I'm going to tell you know what are just these are the Clevis and how you can we get one, we need to know the product, there. And that's the, we have the most likely to be the most of the open source product of the next, and we're not going on the value in this right. So I guess that I'm just ask for an one of the first one is the software that we have heard about the number of the big companies to start going to be a time. So like our community, what we also a few things like I have we did we have a culture of the one who I'm going in the two months of the first one of the knowledge,. And that this is open source community engineers are going to say we're going to think we're going to make this time. We have a lot of time to use us in the lives from the one that the model looks like as it's a lot of the way to be made a lot of open source world. But if you are a really a good to know what we can you think to use or open source community, you know, people, we can have to do is a lot of us think about it the project, just keep doing for each other libraries of. It's a product community. But we want to be able to make a lot of the open source project is really important. And the answer was the fact that it made in my open source, that I'm not free community that, as a very, there are a lot of the decision, I think we shipped with people to get that they wanted to be able to work that they have also want to be the open source community that people in a major issues, because they've also that people, they're not just. There's going to be involved, but you
