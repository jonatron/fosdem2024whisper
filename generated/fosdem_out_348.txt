 This is many of other languages. It's fine into one. And, this is going to be a database. We have this. We are looking for the database. So the database of the structure of an open data. It's an instance and the description of the whole of how to draw to query your database. Everyone has the data set. There's a concrete definition of databases as you have. You can write a value or put it down here. In the whole path that, which is called OR we call the data in Python stack, which means that all the table and then we see what I want to go to this is the data in the labels, but it doesn't mean this is a result. You have an instance and this is that has been used because we have the problem that you run it's kind of is not a simple to figure out how we have your data is inside the code or your read and you do you are being in the node and when you go to Kafka and that. And then you know, if you're going to have a result in the data, an agent that means that you're going to make a dashboard that you're talking about that you're going to be going to be able to do this. So, it's kind of a table, because it's another point of a lot of the database in terms of inputs that's very important. And as it's over time. It's something that the first one interesting because they feel for file and I'm going to say, you're going to be a thing to be the whole topic of the output, okay, but it's from the list of the table I'm going to show the database out the result that we're going to that we're going to be looking at the data that data. So the block is that is the table. The first one here is the value that is just the table from the, the most important part and you're going to see, and you know what we're going to see, and the data is going to say you just give an in the read in the table or different a variable, which you're going to say, we're going to know this at all the idea where we're going to be going to say that. In the table is I'm going to have a, but we're going to go back here. And I'm looking at this, again, we're going to have a three, and what we're going to be going to do is about looking at the structure of the index that we are going to do. Now I'm going to try to make this, what the first point I'm going to start talking about, we have a lot of it's a few interesting thing that you've got this context today I haven't so I get a little bit more or or less hard to worry. We're getting the lowest data structures that the same, there's going to solve the table. I'm turning the one. They're talking about one to be a definition of the data collection, there that we've been to be the amount of our role and having this time. So this is an example, I was what I've heard this is to my definition, but I've got last two fields. And I've seen, I'm going to start in my colleague, which I know, you that I just two pieces of them, I'm just wondering. And I'm going to think one with a different types of the, we're going to see and find what I'm going to have to do we're going to be doing with this. And I'm an additional way, they've got lost each first time, which is the value of the main problem of the data and the data that they don't mean. And this is an eye in there are the data is just the start a text state and they have been the left side, which I can be all of data. That's the data is not very important to be very important to do is that value for the two people, but then I don't see what I think we've got this one, I went into the data into the table in this context of the data type as simple in this is not that I think here. And here I'm going to see here on here, we've got to show you to do this memory does this instruction, CMake, is kind of C++ is the same table of input, and so you basically as two, you've seen the data. It's actually the read. You might be aware of concept that when you know, it's all the table each one, even the opposite is something about the results in this information called the result, which is actually gives you can't an error. You can show you can help you just define this, for example, as a string, you can see that you some kind of those events as it's one that you can also have the input and you to go through the top of the best. It's going to this class. And that's open case for the first in the first rule, on the object on the first of what is once you've got two types of the columns, which is that you put into a one. Third one, in the same number of this idea, which is that you know that the opposite thing is also as I've been an A lot of first one and you could have a table. And so you can see, when I had a bit of an input, a sample here are now at the number of the table, you get this table. So that table. It's more states. It's the second one, of five bytes from the number. A number of the table have the model. And this table. First one, which is a block to see the first one, and so, I have so here. You can see here, I have a lot of RAM, I have the sample. We have a result here. And when I have three, you can see a number here, four table. I'm not have any block, index and 0. And this register read is the table and one. And that one and so you see the transaction you see here, there. So it's the table is a set, you can see here in, which is two, and Mambo, three times in the number of the size of bytes and thousands of blue number is slow.1, less slower, which is 100% two pixels with a number is basically faster than a result. But maybe four, maybe you can see it, three or four bytes, 16, 1 million. One is 0 for every row, but I will be 0, the middle and 15 milliseconds in the table, I see here. But you for 1. And so in 4, so now I'm going to be here. Okay. I'm going to show what the variable is the table and you this is the data. I guess. So I'm going to give a program, I'm showing in 1. I'm just going to the next four times here. Okay, so the literal here in there is a number. We have the screen, no longer recap. Okay. Okay, I see here, I'm running here about here here and Go, I left so the current, I'm going to be here, this is going to go through those. That was the left. So, because I'm going to be changing the table. So I'm going to tell you. That's going to note is the number of this, so it's going to say, if you how I'm going to describe here? So, I'm going to talk about the table, and what that's the main one, I'm going to give it's got there are the previous one two, and there are some I'm going to see. I have been going to know like the other. So one of data is the data space and I'm glad that we will be able to do this way to implement it. I'm at all of the data into our data structures, and the database because I'm going to see here. I'm going to explain how I'm going to do I'll give an application learning features for a bit more question of those are going to talk about the talk about how they want to ask them. We don't know what I'm going to do you can you. So I really tell me for you what we are the other stuff like my questions? I think this, we want to start this slide about what for this kind of my presentation, we want the database? So the picture but we need to do is essentially use our data, because I mean, I got here, right now is going to check the middle of the table in the start the state of the beginning or the database. So we still the dashboard. So we have this point from the center of this API, we have this point in the API. We are going to modify this case it to be there is an application by the API for the web UI for example, but there are some of the two types of these events that now are the API, here are going to start, we are coming from the challenge in the end of the data where we have a lot of the application where we are already talked about accessibility requirements and we need to start working on the code base software provider, but they're to use cases, but they may be able to use cases, you know, which is the most important layer, so we want to make it in the world, right thing that it's the main problem. So there's just to work with that are some requirements. So the question and the developers to do they are people, right now in the work on the work with the code, but we just make it like a complete component and they are not really in the future and they are very well. So that we are there are going to we can be here so the answer is that we are the best thing we are not really the most of this is that the future in the world was exactly what we know that would be done. So we're going to do is we're going to try to start doing this and give you know what we'll be a little bit things, we can we have our world, we're very interesting talk to be trying to how you're going to do we're looking at the question. So by fixing the last year we have some other people who have to be able to have a lot of our product in the world of time. And I'm just you haven't know, we're the world, we're going to see, the world. And the world was what we've just start the good talk we're wondering if you have to look, for the front end of those things that we have got the world that we're doing and we're going to see the people who are going to look at the world of the energy from this end of the world. Okay, who are what I'm just wanted to do in a lot of the question. But I'm not a lot of our last year. So there is it doesn't too far as many people in the time in the world. And the last year. It's the firstly for the world. And to make it's a part of a lot of one of power grid. And that's the world. And the power and it's the energy processing electricity. First of money to act as well as the energy and also the electricity and in the power in Europe and you know, it's about energy the energy energy involvement in power. So there are in Brussels. And I'm not happy to be able to open websites and at legislation to control of the scientific energy grid and almost a very, which shows when we have been the energy consumption. And the US, the commission in the world, the grid in 2022, we are very important to do in open railway law that in which is really actually going to open source space in the only one of them and we can take that we have more money in the energy grid, and of our software power centers, which I want to have a priority time in practice. Now, the world, I'm not use. And we have heard about energy sector, even more energy in the world, like, this energy when we can you want to encourage you have. We probably don't really have another panel. We have the energy energy law. We need to take decision science, because we are not going to bring the railway, I'm not just a bit more energy energy physics revenue, but we have to our energy, we have also have to make the European value in energy to a world for you to think about energy energy science needs to energy investment. So for the beginning, we have been thinking about energy energy in power energy. I'm very happy to are in free. And I'm going to be here. We have to be able to train discussion on the energy. I'm going to be an energy. So what we also going to talk about the energy energy value are asking you can we have to our energy standards, the grid power energy about energy and then from the energy energy impact of energy energy. What can can we have to try to energy energy was trying to energy energy energy. And at the energy power. The energy makers to energy as time level less energy. And the energy energy energy, and as we will be the energy energy power energy meters and first energy energy energy of the energy actually the higher time before, as well as far as you will be on power long term? Because we can we are in these long, we are also use energy energy time, just detect energy energy. So let energy in energy energy to energy energy compared to energy as a energy. So what social energy, we are the energy power energy science per 10, the energy energy energy energy and about energy energy power energy. So, and at energy or less energy power will. And there is energy energy based energy energy, as possible, we do we have to power energy energy power, we consume energy. And, I would even the energy power cost energy energy energy speed in power power, we have energy energy consumption we need to as power and to speed energy energy consumption in energy energy sector as long. And I don't remember 3. So I'm just to explain as an energy. So this energy energy energy energy energy energy. And we're important. I would say. So I'm at the energy. So, this, in data power in energy to energy power solar energy emissions, I'm just wondering, for energy, but is trying to energy energy bandwidth or energy power. So, we will be using energy power energy power, I will
