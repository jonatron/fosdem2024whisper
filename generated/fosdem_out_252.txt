 Good afternoon myself in the first goal. We're being able to do that with that. So we've done this presentation by our friends. This is kind of open source software. We've done a project that we should look at this year. We've seen a big organization with open source projects and we have a lot of people who have been working on the next talk to the DBA. We've been done a very few years and I've got people about this and we've been going to you to build their project and how it's always a bit about this. Most of the people that they're going to work this work out about the product, but about our code for us the language. We have research in that's maybe some of what are the issue with the things that we're building with the collaboration. And obviously there's a lot of open source world that you're not doing we're going to know about that is an open source community as well, but they're going to go into the build a community. And we're just going to start thinking about that we're going to focus on how to take the standards in the product work around a bunch of people, but we're trying to do this into about the community and open source. We're not like you're going to know what the world. And so we have we're going to be talking about the things and we have a really excited about the community. And we was that we've got we've been a lot of the community. We're going that we're going to run and we're going to work to have the community in a huge, I think a long ones that we'll see open source project that I'm going to say. He's going to talk to be a lot of the context, like that we've got the community who are looking at the things really interested in the time. Nobody ever had to talk was wondering what I was going to sort of the first hand? My name was a whole thing called Drupal community's and he was going to be a workshop, we have to see. And he was just wondering about us at the open source community in a company, who was good balance out a year in Open Science came out of an open source community and then they're last year in there that. And which is that came into a number of the technology what the beginning of us started to me? But if I've got in Brussels's the open source community can be open source community and a matter of digital community in that they were a project so they learned from the open source forum now in and they also got one of the community and they are people and at the last year without really part of this year. And he's even at the point that people who are the past. And so people, we're hoping for the process. We're going to be the first one of the EU Association. And last two countries that we're talking about the community and that in the co-source communities and the funding are looking, to be heard about them a new community and product. I would be in the data, as well, I might be the most people to think about the software organizations of the long as long time. Most people have been in the last year. Because they started in the organization and they're in 2022, uh, they are the first things that is the world also the first they had already have been in fact that they're using software as well that we have a very much as far as well. But now if people have the second. But in the important as a problem of the community does not by the world. I think we have to highlight we get rid of the community agreement and so we're really help us with the foundation that the same time they're going to be just to have to follow the open source community in the world so they're going to get down in there out there. These're a few things that we're the right? And the world are the beginning. And that we're going to do this from a model. They're at the we're going to start thinking about, we're going to try to be going to get some of the first one that sometimes people're not really important that it's going to put the things to make the people and we're going to bring up and come to get started to the work and they're going to the right thing that all of the people who are having out what I'd mean that they're being talking about and we know if they just actually want to their product people who started a good to be good idea why did because they don't have to do it's going to make the people to be trained in a lawyer and I think our model that we're going to be going to be the right now going to be talking about. I'm going to be talking about the way in the person to be coming to be there very often a lot of the foundation I just the culture here in this. That's where we're last year that we're going to do that we're going to see myself. We've done in the talk to add there but that in the project that the community and I'm going to be an open source communities to explain why we've got so I can we're talking about the people to do not going on to talk because yeah I've heard about it's like it's what we'll be doing is just a community of the world and I'm even into the community and I'm doing is asked about the last week of the people in a lot of women in open source communities in open source software and then the other companies is the work on a lot of the community organizations like this panel of people who are trying to be pretty well. It's a lot of way I thought I think a lot of people thinking about the collaboration is, and many companies are important talk about the software and they don't really want to be able to do a good to help each other people in order to do that they should have in this work that, but they're not always going to do for us as a lot of decision of people about the world. So there's a short and people are all that the different ways to help you. Very good question was the things that's just like that still always from those three people who knows about doing something like the project which are mostly a very interesting to be in a lot of people that we have been done at that. So and that's what we can you're going to have to do is a bit of like a lot of a lot of people were like this project, especially is very good and there's actually last year there's a different ones that we have been doing like far in different people who are just working on the most people that are actually have, right like that you. I've got the future and yeah, what I'm all about this work. I wanted to do have so much of the good answer is happening it was the people in the community. And I'm going to have ideas about the question, okay, but I was that we've seen the things that they can be now and then we see that we're here and we have 20 dollars and we're all of this. Here are from the good world. And we've got the open source world we're going to look at the work. So we're going to apply to give to our work. So we've got a little bit of a half of our initiative and we're going to let's going to do this is again on. Thank you a strong time. Thank you for if you.
