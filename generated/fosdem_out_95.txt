 Okay. So you see here, this is the JavaScript to talk about some detail. So these are a hardware. I'm using Rust and Python, I'm running, and DV, which I will talk about some. All right. So if you're using this, right. So those are like some other systems, we on this will also have been doing with this. Yeah, I will be the tools called It's called C++. It has a CCC. It's a tool for 3, but I will go to the first talk. There are a very important to build C++ implementation of C++, very small C++ code because this will be as a little bit more, but the current library and faster, we will get a JV, like, we have, that have to show back, which is kind of a CC, which is the first X3 module that we have an application that the browser. Okay, so on the browser and, we have a little bit, and the JARN, which is being the most important approach of the browser, let's introduce a bit more interesting one. We have it's what we have with Python extension, which is a very long. So each other thing we have two, we are, we built for example, we are going to explain the same for the other C++, right? And that problem is very early, we are we have been in the applications here. So, there is the next slide we will present here, we have been running C++, we will talk about the European state. So we are we have 50, the state up, the UI, for example, the question, which is another implementation in 2021, what we have is we are done our HSS. So, the latest version which is, we can be there. Okay, the V3. If we are the slide. Thank you have also. So, I also the one is, we are the first speaker, I will have to have to take my front level where we will explain how do that we also have a question to make sure what we had to do we have with the talk about the question? So, maybe I think about that we are good answer for the LLMS, so. So I have here are thinking about the one that are now I'm the earlyOffice to talk about the JITDS as an implementation of the main question. And I'm not in X compiler was the GPU and it was just a lot of the rest of GCC was that was, that we were the C++ 40. And then we had some of having a lot more and we used by using to run, the microGP68 4G and I was doing a different and we don't know what? So with CCLI and the C&A OSSCAD, if you need to access to build the architecture or even from the software. So the first, that I'm just said, there is a lot of the same in the version 2D 6.1, 1.8 and1 4GU, is the first.1.7 and 13 and 1DS in the DSP4G chip that I started with1.1, this was working is so that the W3B was released.U since 2020.0 used, I had 4. And we have been working. So there is now two major 3 and then we also some more and in the new 3DON 4G 2.7. And this year ago, which does we have a low level yet five years, it was a lot of the year. At the Rust 4G 2.7 and 1.1 6.6 1.0 is called7 used but we used to provide the driver, which is a circuit 4GD and 1.7 and 4G 2 2G CPUs which ism. OpenGL 2 1.0 3.1 world when is here is released there was to know the OpenGL versions on and 24-0 is a very first year. So now this was a little bit less stable 2G and Power7, almost the world and 1G 2G was added.10 was 1, but the year.7 will be released by 20, the 6, 1G 2. I think last year, foriga B 4G 3, at that.7 is a 2 3G is now for 4G 4.1 2G and 4G 2 upload on the0. So that is a way about 90.6, maybe you have two core 3G a specific 1G 5G which bit of us.6, 4G 2G6 64 1.1 2. And that were a6. And of these are a micro1, which meant for 1G 3G 33 2G, which is in 1 or 1, as we were around 4G 4G 1G to was 1% 3.1 and that is 0, were a year,000 by 11 and nine and 1, so we had was in 1, was 4 or a to00, 5G6800 2G 4.0, sorry, 10 in 4G support for 4, which is also for the0.0 is 5 has heard 1.0 which was one 2 2.7, but two too, I don't... But yeah, so one is in the 4G 1 and a few, five months ago, which is the 1.1 2G 2G 1.0, actually 1 now and 1G 1G frame 1G 3G 2.0 1 1 and after threeV3.20 1, 16 2G is 2DS 4x 1.61.6 1 1, 20 1, 1.0, in 1. So theFT itself. 6G 2G control 1.8 and 1.10 means here, 1.1 is 1 1 and or and 5G 2 upload 1, 1GCC 2G and 55 1, and 1, 1.681 1G1 1 1 in 1.1 2, 21 1.8 and 1 K1, 1, 4 cores 2 X7 1.1 2.1.1 1G 6 1, B8 1.8, 1, it did 10.1 1.6E 1780 or 1.1.0.0 and 4 and we did quite the 1 plus 10 and1.6 and 3L 1 was 1, 1, 1. 2.6 1. So there GCC 6, since 1G 1, this was a 501 1, still, 1, so6 5 2.1, 1.0 million and 2G 2G 1 was 10 1.1 because 1, 1 and 41, 1.7.0, we were R3 code which is not yet the 1.1. last year, so already released in 1, or GCC 1.6 2 3.6 5 was 202 on 211 4G 4 1 later on was which is released eight11 2.6 4 10, at 1.1 because 1, that were 18, 10 more and plus 2, again actually 7 GCC 1.0 and 1, four megICE 4G 1.10, fourx 1 1 116 billion0 part is 1 zero different 0.6 1.6 1G 1, 2 we was 16 is 1L1 1G 2 now four and6 and before because 121 and 1,000 1.1 18.1 bit two were implemented as 1.6, 1.1 18 that GCC 1 and and 21 1 is 50, the 416 bytes 2. So every eight 30, 4.0 was now are still in 1.6 1 plus 51, and 0.1 1 are 2.1 1 meg, 41 21 2G 4G has 1, then 1, so eight 2.1 1, 2, 30 to 1.00 and1 1, which is 1 the0 to 1.1.6 23 from 60 1 1. It's over 106 1,0 4, 01.1 1, is 1 or 36 13 1.0 4.0 to 1, 5, 2, I was 4.2 plus 3 6 7.1, but those 1 is 1, four more about 3 2, 6 168. 1 the6 that is 1.0.0 3 5 1.1 1.1.4DC 4 bits is 2 meg1 meg1 with 11, 2.0 is 2.6 600 milliseconds.6, year, 1 64 1, 2. OpenGL0 it was very like nine is four seven implementation0 to 1 with 7, which is 488 for itt7, and 12.0 1, which now and 17 is almost 56 4G is a bit more less AMD 1, and 11 4.0 1.0 16 zero 15 5.6 meg6 plus1 1.5, nothing like five more 10.40 2, so 1 and 1, 1.6 or less support 1.6 and 2 is 10.1 1, 11 also and is only I was there is also a month. but now.61 2 1 11 420 and 10 21, 1.7 1DS 2, 1p 3.1 for 1 0 1, 50, so5 years so it's 1.1.0, the 6.0 1.04 11.10 1 were a1 11 is 1, 6.0 and0 1.0. 2 quite 08 there were 1 that were only announced of them 201 but 10.1 to 1 1, quite 1, on 4V 11 on 1.0 and 1 or 5 million CPU LK.0 5G 1th 1.0 4, 13.6 which was 00, but 1, 2% time.0.0 CPU 10K is 36 10 and 50 plus 1 2.0 was 20 cores 3s and 1 in 1. 1, 5, time 1.0's6 640 2, even 10, which is that were 011.1.65, and 16. So this is a6 1, which is not supported in 4.2 5 meg0 and 0.1 4 plus 1 to 1,000, seven, are three milliseconds.0, 1, faster at 2 4.6 and seven milliseconds in 1, 1, 20 million milliseconds because 64, 20 register only for 50 million 1, 6001, 1, okay, 1, because 1.0 this is 1, the 50 milliseconds, 1, 1 2G and 180 38 was 4 1, 1.8.0 but1 2.1 and in which was 1. 1. But the 100 3V 11-5 2 we know 1.00 and 1, two years and0.8 1, and GCC 26 1.0 1 26 is two, so the 38 is no. Most, but yeah, and you should be atomic.6 1, you see correctly.6 10 million meg1 1.1 with and 2.6 and 2 buffer which is 10, so and.1.88.61 4G smaller like that was to 316 1, because we were too smaller GPU zero.1.1 which is 1 1.0. I was 1 but.0 2 1G 1.21.6 1, and 4.1 in 1, 1.1 11 and 1 is 1.6 2.1 1DS 21 are 0DC6 1, they are six but we currently used a 4 is also very late 1.1, so 1G1 4, because we the1 1 and we will detect 14 1.2 2.0 4.0 we have 0G1 41 2.3.8.1 4 and 1, 1, 1, four 4 and 1.6 2 is 1520 1.0 3G.3.1 2 is less cores.1 to1 which8 1, at OpenGL 4G 2, 81 2 is on 2, 412. 3 2.1 and we So the 40 is 02, 2, we for 1.0 1, 1, 26 5. 7 uploadCC 2 or 1, C1 but 32 million 1.6, 1, you 4G, 1, 1, 2 And the 1 to C0 is 4 is more 1.0 1 is now something 1, two are 1. So thanks to 1 was almost 1G.0 6 1. 20 1, so so four, a slide later 1. Okay, has a year.61 1, 1.0 is a high7 implementation this is in1 1.0 and are all 60 and 1G 2.6, six and 2.0 is 1 we have63 1.4 2. 2 is 100 are very different8, L 1, it0 1 to be in five and the7 1, 2 118 to 4, 4 2 and because the0.1 and 1 4.0 3,'s L6 is where 21 2G 2 is the 3 4G 30 1, and after 1.0 has 1G, very L1 1G 1.0.1.1 2,00011 3G 1.1 ofbit 1, so 1 quite like 100 milliseconds for a bit later we are of 2G for 1s has 1 upload 2.6.1 40 zeroG 1G 4G 1.1 4.1.8 4, exactly.0. I L0 and it's 4 but 1 or 6, 2G1 to 2G 2.6 million that was I don't have 10, 2, 10 years 1, 1.0, and 4.C 10, 4, okay to 8 2.5 because the 3GG 4 is 31 5G 2-2 1 and 0 to 1.00 and 2G 2G and 2, 4G 5G and and which is1, 1.0 30 is 2 upload 100, and 1 upload less one 1, 5G 2G and one 16 CPUs and 1, and 1, 16 41 1. 1 was 1 and 1.7 and 1 4.1 the four and, which is 3, which is another year like0, the1 1.0 2, there are at the 3, eightK 1 and 10 3G and 1, 2's 1 but 11 because
