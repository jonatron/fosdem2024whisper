 Thank you very much to have only some of the cloud, and I'm good part of your way to see what we have that need to add an overview of why do that you want to speak to each more details of the details and to this protocol that you will be the requirements of how you save into the protocol, let me take a future. So this is going to start this question. So you provide a bit more difficult to have a very good. This is how you use we need to deploy this service server and to the server which allows network it to create some other parts that is the server for the server, and we have an application that you to use the server which also need to send the server to think this is going to add more time on and if you want to integrate the server or whatever to do about a server that, you don't need to have to use the key to configure the data to create that a container from the server or do the server, and you could get a request that could run on the server can as a user to check out of the server to your server. So the server, you want to be able to have the server which is the client there. So let's start the server, the client IDP. So you from or your server on the server for this server. You can set up there's just change to authenticate a server to authenticate to the server which we need to deploy it to just a server in your service management URL. But the server to go to that. So if you can connect to the server to the server to the server's only key side, we want to our event client. People from the server. This case, right and then we have this role that network and then we want to set this can connect to join the home, but then we want to this whole ID. We have a DNS client, and then we need it's going to use our server side to take a server, for the client IDEC API. To create the server. You need to see that a client's the server server, how stuff that's going to do in your server. So, I'll go to keep it's going to, but it's going to be the server. I just running. Yeah, we want to work on this information into the server using data. So it's fully this we're using how we have a client. The client and the server is in your server. So for that's your server. If you are ready to stop up in server. So, you don't want to try to have that. You're going to contact the server, if you're going to have, because it's fine. The server and if you're going to send possible. You have to client server, as you can have a mail server up the server to create the server might be in a client server in and it's an server. And the server's the client side, of a server is a server. You can actually running server. You'll going to get a demo. You can see the server and Kubernetes to put as a server. You can run a server. So Kafka server to the server to work with your page. You can see here with the process. And you can run it in a server. You can see something to the server, has a user ID. You can see the server configuration here's a way on that, this is going to try to end them to also the server back to handle it. So the server, then you can just put here that request. You can see that the room. You can see the client at the web server to connect to do this to the server to that in your server for the server. You can start by the login the server. You have to create an server. So I'm going to a server. And in the server side, I don't want to keep a server to just put here. And it. I'm going to see the server to the local service agent process in the second server that's going to click server. I'm going to get to just wondering. You can see what it. And then you can see here. And it from the server to the server. And then I've got and what the client's that you can get them. You can be using a client, so I'm going to give you can just going to build the server. Like, then it's from the server or the server. So, what's going to get the server. It's going to give a server. And I'm going to the server, you a server. But if you can run a server to create a server or server, but then you can put is going in the client page. That's going to create a server in the server. And this bot in a server, you have you can also using a server. So this side server, this is called this web server. The end. So it gives you can tell the server. And the client are going to create a web provider to it's going to show you a server. So, the server to trust, it's going to be able to install the server for the server. So the server that one or in the client, I'm going to create a life user. So the server, there's going to be a service that we've got the server to be default. What am. So there's going to do I'm going to make a user and then I'm going to be just going to start with the server and now. I've been trying to go to go to show up. And then just read a user to take a client, and then I'm going to server. I'm going to try to do this to show... The end user for us. I'm going to get the client as quick. Okay. It's going to the server service. So, I'm going to be going to show me just going to go if you. I'm going to, I'm going to show you when it. And now I'm going to keep running. If anyone is going to open client. And in the end up here, we just going to the client already worked on to create a server. And we have a server to be here back end user to our server, and it's going to this server. So I will. I'm going to'm going to be done before I'll get a server. And in X. So, I'm going to do we've got the same ID. Okay, I'm going to add a end, but I'll go here and give it was just to your server side and I'm going to the client for. I want to my server and that's going to the server. That's going to ask a good end to start up, it. And if we're going to have the browser or going to start up. And then we're going to. So this is the server. And now we're a very happy to be using the server and the user just be an audio's what we don't want to put this container side. And what you're going to implement this is the client to do you're going to answer to be really want to bring the server that we have to the server. Basically this email. And I'm used to help a server? So I'm sure I'm going to do this. This talk. I'm going to go to work on this. And the server and so we're going to start with this. But for the server. You can we just put the server. You can specify the user and then access and we can just doing the server. When you can fetch messages to the request to end server to your server so you can implement a server client. I don't... It's the server. Thank you.

And so thank you already been working on the talk about the end of my attention for free but we have to talk a problem on the room. Hi. You have with the talk for the agenda. So here? So thank you mentioned, please talk about this talk in the talk today. I'm going to the audience and so I'm going to give a little bit about the talk today. And thank you a talk is Alex, a few questions and I'm a few years, please. We have a few people during the first talk was to our next year, which is this year. Yeah. I'm a year. So I'm not sure that the time. So a good talk is the Commission itself. I'm originally had a project and about two years. So, before I was an introduction to support for the journey. Okay. So I was an introduction to about a bit about this presentation. I had a lot of a good thing that time. And now I was the moment. In the number of the whole year ago, we can I was wondering. At this room and I was my first day, I was wondering the back back to the community worked on the first the last year, 20 years ago, here is we were about 20 years ago to some of a year here, but the first six years when I had the CRA, the European Commission is that is over the European workshops the moment. And I wanted to build year. So I also at the last year, who did I was the beginning, I have a year ago. I had the first day, they were invented over his year, that did was the company. The first year ago at the member of day community from the world, I had to be the first year in a long time we were getting started wondering. And that now I had here in a lot of my community in the year here. And I was the last year we were in the presentation, and we get started in the first day, I was about the big product and I has been doing this year here a few years and I was an last year, which was something that was funding in the beginning and since in June, this was in a very, good thing to work that we defined a year. So even on our projects, the reasons that was just are the University to be in the world because we saw one year ago, so we had to spend a few years ago when we had our thought that we had this would like those group in a small sponsor are for the world. So there was in here, we had for the CRA. And we were the whole release is I was around this point of energy that we had had in the development law that were now. And I was actually went out. But we had a big part of women to be, first thing. One year ago. We had a lot of the European OSPU, we had. We introduced lots of time here. We have a million women, we had thought, but like, maybe this year, we have had last year, an first seven's like last year. And the University of the third year we saw earlier announced to be the community like the past year in 2021. We have a little bit more years ago. This year. Then we had a half a little bit of to give us that we released at least one year, we did that time, so we have the last year ago, which was the year and part of us a year that we would be released for the most of someone that. I think in the point, I think this year. So yeah, yeah, there are only discussion about the last year was a bit of the last year, right months. I think we are the last year there's in 20 years ago, there was a couple of the year ago, but there's nice thing on the first version of those were a few years ago. And we did we had been going to see the world of my really matter why did this is what I would actually came from here. I had another talk is the beginning one of my story was originally quite interesting. Because I was like I was doing he was the year to the point in a little bit about the past year ago I was also had had doing last year ago, I knew that was going to just a more like I didn't know the last year ago, because now. The first couple of the years ago. And yeah, I wasn't know what was wondering about the next thing he was do I had to have been the first year was basically had a while. But now, we wanted to stop. And there was one of the original months, we told him and can I was really know here was thinking about which was one year ago, but two years ago, like it was, but the years ago, you know, we get back to solve the beginning was was pretty happy to 20 years ago. So, like this was a little bit of computer. But I had a few more difficult. And to make sure I said this other people are all the community, we want to offer to ask this work on the more organizations that this curriculum. So, you know, right now I've had also one of the time. And I just asked the history going to see some stickers to see was a little bit of volunteers. So if people. So, they were like, I've been working with this is like you know, you know, this stuff that they have been talking about the company and they have a lot of the first point where they're involved that was that they have been taking back by the organizations? And he was the commission and they had to think, so they have a little bit more controversial, so one work I'm just use. It was to know, but if you know, the time, can think about the kids, the Commission was just keep. She had the countries, yeah, I think I'm just saw during the company and the US. I've got one of the project very excited, everybody, for the Drupal to find out there was, but they had a community
