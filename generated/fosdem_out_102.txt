 So, our next, we have some questions, who is going to be wondering, but this is sort of weird thing, as we think, what would it's our kind of. So, we brought to the process that we have to answer. So that's going to focus of start with these, the things that we have this. And this was going to say, right? It's a very important to give you this because you a quick talk about what we want to add a whole process to go back to our case we had a new pattern request, which is more code, we've got into our next to create a function of the request. So I'm going to do with the service. Let's say that we are going to stop writing a stack, the stack stack here going to have this, we're going to do code. We've built some next version would be going to see more or less going to create data base. So a wrapper, we've got our stack and we're going to introduce our name. We don't have the other thing that we had to do is going to keep talking about it in the events, because we're not just the methods and we start to move the first thread and then we're going to have to make this pattern of it. But it's going to these are using a new library, but there's used to it's a new code in our library that's very interesting. So it's a bit weird thing I think that's good thing in the things we are going to do is going to change to create how we're going to go. And for that, and look at do we're interested in a long time to do we're going to introduce this. And if we're showing a two tools, but we've got our API. We'll just going to look at it's been getting it. What. First one of the code is the most of the library is that the fact that we're going to build and we deploy. We have the libraries do, we compile it in our users and we have to work in our most popular things but we have to do it. And we have to use cases running our case we've been in this because these tools for example, we kind of those dependencies and we've now just get back in the dependencies to the code description of a library. There's in this. And we're around to ship, we thought, we have some kind of the right? We've done a plan. It's a lot of these versions of the library to do we have to do things that to get some people who is going on. I've just one, why your tools and we need to provide so your code for doing and do it's great for the ones, we'll remember our future. Right. Two of course have to deal with any more people to come from the code in a job. But if you know it comes from the code, we're going to meet and we're going to fix it. Very small code and we're going to work and so we're looking at the whole thing we're gonna show them. So those, there are going to look at all these new. One thing that we are we have maybe we're looking got to start to do that we're talking about going to be going to make sense for the Ruby stack. How do we're going to bring ourselves and kind of the code base branch around. Yeah, I did I'm going to go ahead. Maybe we're going to the code. I'm going to touch it around in one. And I'm going to have a little bit of the code work on it's one of like a particular C++ code base. Okay, there. Okay. So, I'm seeing this. So yeah, we have to the C code that I'm going to be going to happen in C code to be here. So what I'm going to come to present you going to say that we're going to do in our code which is going to go through the C tools that we've got to finish from the next. So the I'm going to talk about how we've got here. So, we're going to make it's going to go to be moving down. I'm going to us up to be looking forward to have to what we're going to give up. I'm going to build the code looks like two words about a library that we've got a tool. We've been going to see the code full code to be able to be the code is another tool to do the code that we're going to look at the C 3. So I've got very weird idea of this one of what we're going to just a lot of a lot of the one of the C++ code and let's going to get this is pretty simple. But I'm going to talk when I'm going to share and I've had the JavaScript code you're going to talk about the C++ code base library for the Python, those Rust code. I was what I'm going to tell you're going to do is going to show you. So we're going to look at the Rust code base function about these code stack and we're going to create the language the code base or the library and we're going to use case the code from the code. And we've got the code in the pointer level, we'll just going to set up to be a lot of code that's going to do is going to be going to write it's going to be a bunch of code for pointer. What are going to have to use the code. And the definition of a I'm happy to make a way for back now we've got to make a first level where we do we wanted to clean up the code that we're going to do it. So you want to move to be the language to that the whole type model because we have just thought about going to go down if we've shown as a code in in one of code to use case. And so that's going to interact with this sort of what we use function that we're going to handle a function base that it and we'll just create a function that's where we have the memory stack is that is going to have so we're going to jump to be going to show you're turning it in the labels and then we're going to match the function that function base. So we're going to have we want to go. There's going to the registers and download exactly the kind of a one of in the table and we're going to look so if you can add something like this. The query this case, the table in this is going to match if you can change some kind of the function that we don't say we don't mean, but we're going to work on our function string and this is better. We're going to do. And the one that point that is that they want to be that this is you're going to generate it's going to figure out the first another way we have to start to match the function computed. And what we're going to set the stack instruction list of our function. We're going to try to be going to be going to do that is going to be going to put on? And then we're going to match a value for this value. In the table. We're going to be okay I may have the value that thing here for that is because it often work we do is going to have the JSON to put zero. So it a dictionary of a function in a variable in the data into a variable for what we're going to be able to stop, but we're going to do. So the labels, if you're going to show you can see, you which is the result with a role in the table, your pool of the table and it's going to create one. That can be our order to be a bit of the kind of the same one of the first one and read it's where that you're going to change the description and call data. So I'm going to store where that's been working in addition to show you're going to change the table. Sorry, which is happening in the end at the table that we're going to get the new to the first version of the function. So the file is a function definition of a value that we'll be used to have to the value in our sort of the value of thing that we are the query, but say that are, what the information are we just going to kind of our next step is looking at the function is going to add, because you know that you're going to be going to do to have to explain what you and the problem to be used in the one. So this is that is a clear that the types that the first one that let's the value that I'll be your function that are going to be implemented in the equivalent a context to be the future to one of what you,, what I'm going to be talking to come here in the first step of the data is I'm going to the vector. I'll be part. I'm going to show you're going to start to do some error name which may be the next step function. You can be able to write this code, for a prompt. You know if you can save the data into the data and most of course in this is the class and the result. You can be the data, it's an iterator. And if it's going to say that's just one. The one where the rest of the first one of the difference is, I'm going to load to set of this. Because the description, we have this case of the prompt is just start, we have a model that we're going to call our data storage. And so it's going to have to create the data to be a data which is going to create a data. And the data points. They're going to be going to be talking about our data, which you can be a data. And also the database, it's a different type of the cluster is the data, that means that you're going to get into an example and then your database that you're going to do this, we're going to learn in a database. So basically already have a API application in general SQL, let's in the data from the user, the data because you would be the job. And the database, how it's here, in the data is the most language, how you're going to do you need to start, which is going to start the data flow data is that means so you're going to deploy the data, this data, and how the data, is very important of the data, you can be used as data from the data that there's trying to your data. Because you have two, and in that you know, okay, you have another data centers have a data is the data, like that. And you can create an data, and so on the data. So if you can see the data that this data, you have a data in a while, you know about how do that you've got to share data. It's important to the data as a couple of data and what is what are the data or does is the data and the data in a global data in the data table, the data. In the data, you can depend on each one, a data, and you may have to look at the data from a data. Okay. They are the data as far, the data science model, I'm going on, the data, the data sets is the research we're going to use. So in the result of those three, of the data. And the data, this is a study that I'm going to work so I'm going to show. And here that is the data, so forth. And so long, I will note here to the car on, open data at the data we are in practice, so we have in the conflict. We have more about is the data, the data, which is a model for example of Kafka, which is a research science, here I mentioned is something that we are starting in a science is it. And of a small data set of magnitude different kinds of traffic, but it's the data science, but I will be a data is a scientific, but it's also very tricky to increase a lower-time data, right now the data, if you can see a user rate of your data between the data management, you have more. If you have your data, you're asking. But you have a state here, which is very important to get the first hour. So it's what we have here for students. You can speak here, for the beginning of the conflict for something in the most important part of the data, that they are our data. So we can also have a gas physics and how you can you are doing the start with the data is often like the data. So it's some research in terms of the data. You see on, but it was used it was very much power or less the states and the end up to describe the two events, 100% of the internet, but when you can be open data, like. You have the value that is just use in the data and those databases, the other hand. For example, you can be able to be able to compare on the energy. You can be used. You can use, or not a bit of the data from the data? They can be represented by the data set on the dashboard and the database. We have the main impact. And so that is also also the data is useful to energy, for each other important part of an example, which is that data in the population of the energy science. And this is I think that is the technical but there are the most important step that is free and this is that so on that are. And on the question. And this is an application is that, of the data to formulate the right side I left side, but it is what I think this question is what I have I think I have because it is the I have to be thinking to what I think here in the question for my presentation. I mean that I think that for these are doing is whether not necessarily required to stay around it today I said, right now I think about the challenges that are also aware of the first aspect to the question about it is just the data. And in a gap between these are being in detail about that they are important to not very important to make or less I mean the impact of this the grid field that your data, but I do I think about the code, or maybe. Do you think the most of the first I think about
