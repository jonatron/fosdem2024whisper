 Our name is So, if you're on the web server, you want to provide now we're going to give me an example in a long challenge for the browser. In this case, it's a database of the API that do, is an array or the process. And then you can do it. So now you can just declare the context that it to the standard, you're doing the primary number of data pool of machines. And we've also for those ways to use for that. This is my application. From the database that you're going to happen. And I have this data, we're going to create a specific expression for that, which we're going to be using this object. So, if you will be able to be able to be the database. You have to share a different execution and that's going to be the documentation to be able to solve the cluster. You can have it. You can generate my data into each other objects for a very visual. But now there's some sort of what the database is that you want to use the end of a combination of course? Or you're not the table, your database there's another database, and things that are different. You might be there and you have the data that are the resources, of your database is the input that you have a table. You want to you're in your database. You don't have your data data, or data sets the data in your cluster and you want to share data. And there to edit these types of data. It's no things that's not going to understand how it for one which kind of this thing that so Postgres, but it's what I don't know about sharing, let's why not going to be going to talk? It's going to know if you're looking to be able to go and how it's going to ask that it. So that you have to do you know and you're going to set in the top of the table of the same column types of your transaction of your database that there, which type of an example, very first block table and you have to what you're going to deal with the data groups and the information for graph database. And then you know that you know is going to register, so you have the data model and you're going to the database in your definition, your data. If you're going to be useful and your website for your data, you have to do and then that, you have your data and then you don't need to have your data from a prompt. So, you can see a kind of a data in a database and what you need to look into an example how you can you're asking the model all of the different roles that you can be used to do and the other types of all the indexes. So we are the set the data in a data blocks are going to kind of data set. We can use that in the first, but that we have a data to be working with the data, you can be just set data set of an data, open data files and you can be a lot of the data and then you can be able to work. So this, if you can, you will recognize that's going on the more at least in the part of the data sets of our data, the data in the end, we have great context. And it's the two ideas about in another research is, we are going to do a lot of the data sets are very simple, but we are more like much everything that. And, that is open source that people are a lot of a lot of data. So, is the technical resources, the data, it's about the power, you need to work available to see here. And the table, we're going to use is that. So the first one of this is not the data centers, this happens in a little bit of the data is created by learning because the data is quite important to be, we need to have a data. That's how you may be the data, this can you can be used on your data science and as you can be able to look like for this data is just take the data, you that stuff, we're on the server that you can put into these data on the data perspective of data in any very good idea. And then that's going to think about how can be in your data science and the data analysis, but the data's interesting to make a data. But if we have a data, the result, we are trying to be open source data to do that they are going to also aware what do that we want to be very complex. Maybe that, if we have a lot of our project. So we come back to our data to have a great question. And this is about sustainability over time to the first time of this is I was the panel. And right now it is something that problem but, we know, especially though we had a few people to get into the first step in the list of the business in the term. And then the first thing was the country. So a graph, it's the beginning on the first. And we wanted to try to make really, we're going to build and we're going to show this context of the beginning of the German physics and we want to have to support in terms of the most important to work the information that we're having one. We have to do something that, okay, we have been using the grid, we have, so we are. This is doing those structures are open source infrastructure to find out how the idea that we have? So we have a lot of the moment, we can see that we are done. So we need to implement this is a question of data and we want to build on the main policy points that we have to make a priority, so this and we also have a real context that the most important point that we want to read the world. And the first one is that we usually we have a community to use cases that we have a better thing that you need to be a bad question is that we have a network. We have not just one here. How did we have any of the European, we want to do this and we've seen that people want to know about those the social data is an organization that you're going to do you to have to see here for each other people who create this data. In practice is going to capture the power. We need to cover the data. So for example, you may not just had to use this is just the first to remember. So I'm going to have to start for example, thank you very much for example. This is going to talk. 
 Okay, thanks for the speakers. So I'm going to be going to be it's going to talk about the questions. I'm going to be going to talk in France, so good to talk about me. So in a good guys and I'm going to be wondering about people who was a great to do we have this topic of data on open source. Okay. I'm happy to take to be looking at America also trying to do not so much in action and I'm very much to make all open source curriculum so. And the question, the other people in the other people I'm going to keep the whole conference where they want to have these are saying that are like, so many people get a lot of years. The first-one is your people are made and we are being open source and safety. So there are in the time. And last year. So there are a big there are the actual world in this. So I'm going on the lastly in the right? I'm going to talk about the first time to really important part of the time. And I'm going to introduce the question, I'm going to ask the title of the first. That's what I'm saying is an interesting part of the open source law. Because I picked up and it's doing is already the point of the world. I'm a really glad that it's what he was we move as a little bit of the community and we can you see is this. So there are going to the Commission. So I'm a lot of the Commission because I was really want to be very happy to have, I have a little bit of the first time. I was saying this was wondering. So I'm not so I was to look at the first of the first. And I'm a researcher which is just for all right now we have to do. I am the time to think you mentioned before we're writing a challenge. We have a lot of the last thing. I'm going to have to talk about the talk about the CRA and I'm going to be wondering. So what open source communities are the most people to be the developers and the first couple of people are going to engage with you know what we have to be mentioning here. We have a lot of the last year. You've got also think we have to move in the idea of the last three years ago so the CEO perspective. I think the most of freedom to open source technology from the best part of the community. So I'm going to be so that was a lot of the last year of the Commission. Here I think I know a lot of challenges that we have been talking about open source project in the projects are in the product. I'm going to be and the project. Why are the Open science, the foundation in the last year we're going to make a lot of the open source project, people that we go to achieve in the projects were in the US and we have heard that they also in Dutch and like you guys before they're going to be a great and they have an beginning of work that she knows exactly what we have been a good thing to bring at 2023, or the history of mine that's really first person who was where I was going to be talking about the foundation of the German federal Commission and he's not going to make a political companies, but the license to do that we want to do I've had and they're going to do what we have was going to look over to to do in the public sector and he's the panel where the panel is about the time at the European Commission perspective and I'm going to be going to look for us about at the EU institutions of open source world and we're going to go to tell us to our community and to talk about European Commission and to have a question of people in into the organization that are going to be done in here in the co-profit. So thank you can we talked about the world where we have a bit of course we're going to ask me about the PLDy. We're going to support a few months to be a whole two years. The year in 2019 but I think that we started from and so I think that I think there was a lot of any member of those guys who asked about the last year we am I would like I am going to share our institutions and I am I think the last year because you think yeah I am I said he thinks it's a lot of the first time ago and it's a lot about the question or none of a lot of open source software in this one that you know maybe some years. It's in the world and we have worked in these issues about the court is happening in a lot of the product and how do so on the PLD and I have been working together in the EU is going to do you know the PLD-profit projects I have been at the last years ago and I think that is the last year we had a panel, but, and the first steps around the first year, I would be really stay in terms of the first time to be even less energy and just wanted to think we have a bit of energy and we just so we have already have to talk about the European Commission had to be the most of awareness about the first time to keep people. So it's a big talks about tech and we're a little bit often going to all the beginning we're not just an open source project and we've shown from one of the European Commission last and we've worked on the rest of the world. So we've got to talk about 50 years ago. I know what we're trying to talk about the previous talk about the first year and after a couple of being had to focus on the OCA, and the community had to get as I'm not present, so far as well, I'm a nice thing that the idea, as I've been working on a researcher, but I'm wondering there you there were lots of the open source foundation on the market and so many ways to talk in these are a challenge to be able to get a good thing. And they don't think there, but they're really care about a bit of the goal of the world and there's something that they're hoping and they have one of the digital collaboration with GPL are some of software for the Swiss community could be very often focused on it's a lot of this and they just a lot more important way that to make sense on that they're still had to be on the rights but they want to understand what they're interested in terms of time to actually not having those group and they would have a better than well they're starting to change a lot of the commission that they will skip into the best time. So who are you want to do anyone here and I just wanted to look like I want to say to follow the time in the day. We have all our money but the tech companies to take this time and I had a good idea of the time that we were just wanted to try to say I'd like that we have a small open source community and we want to go on all about the things that we're going to just going to think that they're doing this tool that we're going to get their stuff back to worry about these point in the sort of the first thing that could be the people who is that come at a few people were going to just going to think that is a lot of money is really a very much as well that we had the work and we're going to look forward to point right now really not so much kind of a much especially in the things we started this so we wanted to tell us came back to ask the focus open source community were interesting kind of like we had these issues that we would be talking about looking to do so they are we were already have thought we have been looking at this in the last three issues and then kind of people would like they're in this really like they're doing this but they've been some time. And they're looking at the last year. There's like in the
