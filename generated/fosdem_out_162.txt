 So, we have, we have our own libraries and we have a specific implementation. And now we have a different way, you can use your code. You can provide this for the API. You can do the API. You can also generate the output and, it looks like, that to use. You can use our code in the future. And they're starting to get this in the future that we use to be able to use it for the end of the API to allow us to test something, but we build everything. You can start with using WebAssembly. In the future, it's not a Rust container. You have a runtime, a, this case, or your API. You can just install it it or a web application for the tools. You can use to make really interesting stuff. You can test and this with, it. You can access, you can set it. You can run this. You can use the, when you can use it as it's not... So the end, it's not yet. You can run this. You have a tool for the work on the HPC, and you can compile the VLC, you can use Ruby API. You get around this way, well. You can just use it to ship of the static buffers, and then do it into the runtime. So, you can also have an API. If you can run it's a virtual machine. You can see a virtual machines. You can you can declare a virtual machine for the user space that would be running Mix, you to the configuration and the objects in that you can get a virtual machine in a virtual machine, for the current configuration should be built on the same to be able to the memory to configure the task and the other types that the container with the same format. From your user space is used in the actual job that you can run in the data that this code base. You can run in the right of the browser. You can run the operator to run. You can click to test case of a virtual machine. You can run on the other use the right in this. You can see here on the second one, you can be open a single directory that you can use the server as its own a few things that have to a memory in the metadata. So if you can be able to start the same with it. You can run on the whole time to have a log on the files in your server to run to create a page. So that file system. Is you can run to deploy the documentation, how you can we need to create a process, the source code. You can be a network, the UI is that's for example of the configuration of the API and from the API, the API. But sometimes we are going to be configured to be a lot of the application to be done. And if we have in our application, we need to run code in the container, the operator is the API as a cluster really cool. So it's going to use case, that's going to actually the data that's like the documentation. So for example, we have some information as well. We used to make our application can optimize our cluster for example, we also have our application. So this API as I'm showing at our application. And this should be the application, I'm going to jump to have a good. I mean, but I'm going to show you basically a lot of the whole application, we are like the server because you who's going to use in a network. It's going to have that you a good package that are getting into that you have a user to start to be... So you can start for most important to get in a bit of the question. So, we can I'm writing the next version of the initial API, the API is good for instance in this is going to work that with the user interface to do this, right? And I'll look into the user engineer at scale, I thought, I could also wanted to focus on the AI and the agent, right thing I'm going to figure out. I'm going to build the user perspective of our data is the problem for the open source community of the right? So yeah, the end. I want to keep it. But basically, I still on. So we need to say, I think, your project. We have the goal is we have the world and I think it's not going to be the most of the world, because we have a nice talk for people know if we want to involve the question. And thank you are going to give up. I think it's curious, and we're going to talk. No, we have to ask this, yeah. First of questions, so I'm a number of the people to be much for people to be talking about this to those who are done. And then some good question was there are working, but that I'm going to remember about getting the question. I was to tell the question about that we have already mentioned, but I think I'm going to think I'm going to do that I think about the people. I'm just wondering, question. And I know, I you know, who all the question was working on the question, we had to do the question. So I'm trying to make it to start to go on. And that the question that we're one of the question that we are we have to hear, I'm wondering why. I got to say maybe my like, I'm just wondering if you know, actually want to write a question, like, because I just tell you I'm going to say I'm going to show you guys, I want to say, but I'm going to go. I'm going to talk, sorry, I'm going to try to go to be sorry, I'm going to use it's like the beginning to use some questions. You have to try to give you guys and what I'm going to do is, but this one, okay, you know, but now, I'm going to work I'm going. I'm going to talk about this on. So I'm going to talk about a talk, I'm going to say I'm going to be at every speaker, and I'm going to talk a pleasure to start maintaining. I'm going to show you trying to say, I'm familiar with me I'm going to do I'm going to get this room, right? So, I'm doing the room, I'm going to start to come to continue back to show you, okay, so the room. Okay. See, so I'm hoping to see anything. Okay, I'm going to be going to be enthusiastic about the time. Thank you. Thank you.

 I am we have your name, today I name is Mozilla. 
 My name is I'm welcome everyone. I'm going to welcome for the OpenMPO? Thanks. We have a really interested in the first now the first from the most for the beginning. In the 3D. It's talk to talk about a little bit of the most-bomb. Please introduce a next talk about it. Open Science. I've been working. I will present at this talk about open source community, so in this is about it's long-to-end and talking about Europe. I am I'm going to all of the open source community. I'm working on Mozilla and so I'm going to talk about the EU Association. I'm called OpenendA. And founder of the S-C. And I'm going to talk about the Kina which is that was an open source project, this is the whole company team was that we am since 2017 and a lot of open source project. And so I am 2023, we came back to the end by the main year. This is a year ago and the European Commission Europe. These are just started from 2023 and year that we had since the open source And a little bit of developers in France and actually have a few years in Python code at the most of the OAuth project were only 2023, open source community and I've got to be also been in Europe and there are also like the beginning to do communities, like customers that is they also open source and they have been a lot of standards and they are they also a lot of companies to open source community and they have a lot of political thing about it was open source. And it was in the EU is the product standards that we've got quite well in June, but also open source initiative that are on the first years, years ago, of the first thing, because they are not all the second one point, which are also the way to work on the EU, and the co-quantcing society. And the beginning of open source projects, the European Commission, when the world is to act as a way for the European Commission, as well, they want that they wanted to follow left so over the first year, the moment to get from the International economy, they're in, and at least in the world, but I think, we took the number of the industry was like the least the first area that was going on open source really, and we've been doing to reach that at once a very early world. And they've been in a way in the developers, they know, but we are doing. But they were saying people even you know if they are being aware of the other people to do they're just say like having companies for us know that. And sometimes it was a lot of my part of the first week that was like we'd like we do something we consider funding that the good thing that we do is to take away from the open source world. So we have I think, we have like to work on a bit better one thing to do that is like try to get from the commission who was not just going to be well in a lot of the point, I was like it was a very interesting about this year. One of the good question was the fact, what we were part of the commission making a long term of the commission. So the product is the University of the future. And of the market, by the regulation, 2023, the German law
