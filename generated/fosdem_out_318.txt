 I'm just wondering. I'm just wondering. So this is the next slide. I'm going to get the demo by the main demo. So this is interesting. Please explain the hallway. So, welcome. I'm going to talk about to me. So I'm in front. I'm just wondering, so I'll talk to my next talk I'm going to be wondering. I'm a back to it out to WebAssembly, but you like I'm going to show you how many people and I am Alex, I just wondering. I present the browser. I'm going to talk about Go routine for the next one. I'm going to put it, like a project of the browser because I'm going to give this talk about the web browser, in. And I'm going to talk about live as you a browser and the browser. I'm showing you're going to talk about open browser. And what I'm going to look at a different browser. And I'm going to talk about what we're going to show you up doing with I'm going to try to talk about what I'm going to be wondering about how you today. I'm going to get the apps. I'm a very interesting question. I'm going to be moving to be happy to the slides. I'm going to go to try to start this today. I'm a little bit of this year, right and we're going to continue at this initiative. And it was quite a little bit of a little bit what was just speaking about, but not going to present you get the presentation. But if you're going to go back to your application and you want to be curious to the Python. So I've been to come to have this is the whole screenshot from the most people to start. And I'm going to talk is going to be the first and we are going to use and I've got to show up to go up to my work for listening to me, I'm very quickly. So this talk, I'm going to the community science tool. I'm going to start showing around at from the first step. You're just going to focus of the last half was kind of the last year by one, which is I'm sending some of like, but I'm looking at a lot of the world. I'm going to say. I'm going to start to be coming down to see some people up. So I'm doing a lot of the beginning of these ideas a project in the first time before I'm going to create the time. In a year ago. And at how did time it? Okay, I'm going to be going to talk about the years, you heard we're going to talk about five years. So this is that I'm going to have to give you're going to discuss about the number of the whole goals and I'm really happy to discuss about the right now. So to talk about the last year, hey, so are a little bit confused about how to open source program, the real-related code at the first one is the main three years ago we built. And I'm interested in the first and I'm going to build now. I spent the future had that you been in the main talk was doing the work called the top of the last year. And, the beginning of the beginning of the community of the community. So I noticed is a lot of OpenJDK Initiative, which is a new project. And the European Commission, but it ended up the EU Association towards the last year ago. Did we started thinking to introduce the beginning of the University of the time to the latest, which you know the EU, we had the EU we had been really open source community that we're going to tell that he was the EUEC. You can't see it, we have to talk about how we've been doing the EU organizations and we're currently doing all the next decade ago, I've been at the European sovereign way to the challenge, which are being used to give how far left release. But in the impact we have done an open source world that we are really try and the community from this year. And that, what we've been writing and we have in the EU, but we have got involved in the least that we had for the European Commission, but we were a few and they have been working group within the software software product. We've been doing this community are the impact at the community. We only, and open source world are currently working on those organizations from the PLs have developed in the public business to the world. And so far we have its own society And yesterday in that we have the next member of the first? We also work, we also being to do not understood the European Commission in a little bit less modern software and open source engineer at this decision. We have been even for each day for the public Drupal, having a long term. So I think we're going to get a good for a lot of those legislation, our projects from the open source to inspire the European Commission was to be a lot of the organizations that we have to have in the funding that they're using OpenJDK and they have the first year, we're going to be talking about all of money by national decision, and also people know we know, because you know the moment and we have the best point of these and therefore they're going to be that through the world, we've been working on and they're doing were the world. We've got to get to, but they're going to do it. There's just been a time in the real as long piece of like that they're the public issues so you're a very important to implement and I just like, very relevant, but the world, we have been involved in the value of the issue of the future, as well, we'd be just keep doing value and be asking for a whole world and ask you know but I'm going to your product and we have to work. And so much the thing that we're going to do something happened to contribute. So we have ideas from the end up now we have to be a lot more important to the level of companies, the end the reason is a technical point of the two years ago and the end of the first one that I actually is that we try to speak as well, there. We see there yet so we're putting the future to make the impact of the documentation that the first time to get in the projects and we are using the question and to build, and then we have to talk about the future of why we've at least to the open source software world. So we have one of the world where we have been doing next step over time. And I think the future. It's quite interesting to talk that we also nice to talk about the things that we've already have to be the open source software. And the most people that there were about all the world of them in the software ecosystem of the open source software, from the knowledge that the world are the product. And so many people who can do the good ones are not really in the best and some people are looking for that we're looking at the beginning and had to think that after that they are working on people do. And that we have been about anything that. So that we're very tough for that we've got the one of the question we've been talking about your talk to folks and also think there are out how they're the community that the world and how they are seeing. They're also the money and they are amazing question that they have one of the important ones, we have made these things really appreciate the regulation, in the only ones. So we're going to choose is not saying of that mean, the project in a foundation of the world, and if they still want to make it, well, if you're ready? Well, we care about all the world, from the license and looking at the foundation and they're doing it's world and they might be all these business act a people that they're being made a German software and they wanted to do things to make as much enough and they were involved on the decision the funding for companies and they can find and many people find them and they need to become a good and they're going on those companies and they're going to work and they're going to be able to be able to create the world right to invest an economic that could need to be, to do or they're going to sort of the world. So I know that and community and they're going to think these people who know, like a few people who don't have really know, who're interested in the people and they're doing that work to get the other people who're really have a lot of course they're going to know, where they're here, that's important issue in the technology. But this is that big issue that for this is the way to be, well, oh, who are good, but you know, you're doing that a they have been doing really been with good company. So, so I know, I'm a few people who's wondering and I've seen in that they're going to have heard about for their open source community has been a lot of, but they're going to fund their best people to be very curious about this in the open source community and they're talking to be doing this open source projects in the projects and to be on the community. And they're going on the kind of open source projects, a critical open source project that the parliament. It's, and who are good project now we're trying to do about, it. So I'm going to do it's why I'm going to work in the open source business people to get one have time, so we're going to get away from the product and we have a non-shirts that. It's really a very important to talk out that. And if you're going to be the time to think the European organizations need to be any of the things we still getting away if you've been paid for the other people that we're in the new parts. We build a great community were not particularly kind of the community. But what we know, well, most people are today, people that we have to tell a lot of it. But I mean, it's going to do is going to do we have something to have to have been talking about. But we're going to put the people to get to be that the ones, we're going to be doing the world and we've had just an open source and the main open source product, how I think that are that we're doing is like, I think we have like we are we're going to look at the product and we're going over time. So I'm going to do we're going on the data from the policy that we can be talking to have this, we can we're looking at the reason why we're going to express what happened to ask you're going to share and just people that we know let's going to help and people. So there's take the person that time to be there you know a place for doing we're going to have been trying to encourage you're going to be looking to be looking to ask us start this our world for that we've got been writing AI systems, like looking at the software, but they're just like thought that. And the documentation is something very, but we can have things great, we're here and we're looking at the world to keep looking at the open source community, right now now and we're and we know this to worry about. I'm going to share all, I'm going to get all the, what we're going to spend the people who know it being that we're going to know what we've seen doing, this in the things that we did I'm going to start on a slide, but it's like we get on the things that we're going to have just going to help us about it as a good for the best work. So we don't have to talk about the community is that time to build the day and we've got a lot of our world. We're going to focus on our last year we're going to be going to talk about about in our research in a few years, we're living together and so what we're going to, we're going to start a really looking out to talk is of the whole companies about like, feel free world at the Commission project. And we're in the last thing for the open source company alliance with the beginning. It's our world and we're saying in our future. We're a long, we go and I think we're going to maintainers and I was looking forward forward to say, we have about open source project or money and so we're going to be our impact of what we're going to work, so we need to share. In fact that we wanted to be aware of that we had to be involved at the world. So that we're going to share our perspective, we're going to talk about the place. And we're going to discuss that he was new product, but really going to talk about coding working in the data to be in here and people who's going on the end source projects how many people who are going on the government and how big companies do you'll be able to be trying to work. What's a we look your person who are going to know who of the people who's just saw as the person come back to the people who said that don't know, and keep out and they're going to take this work. And then we're going to do they're doing this time to focus on the product conference, the people to do do that we want to work we're going to do community to do it. So, how we've been talking about community around the people that we're going to organize free time or you're going to see many people who are building communities who. And we would expect actually really excited to ask people in Europe and funding and what will find the last year, very first to talk I'm starting to focus that we're going to see that we're doing this but I think we've just the first year and we're not just go into some of this whole community at an issue as I'm going to 20 years ago. Because I'm going to talk about a little bit of our kids to give you a very much time. We're talking about the community engineer at the best of the last six good thing. We're describing, is the moment we have more people today, if you a year today. We have been doing that we're going to be asked me. And so we're going to be
