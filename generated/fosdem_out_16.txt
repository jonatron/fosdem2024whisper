 Okay, hello. So, yeah, hello, next to start with the first step. So, I'm going to start the demo of the Posh, it's not like a bit of an old version. And I am, I going to go into a few months ago. I'm thinking about that. I'm just wondering it on it and come here. And I'm going to jump here. Okay, I'm see that's going to show an introduction of the end of Fos, so I'm going to talk about me about the OpenTelemetry to start the whole panel. And I'm just going to show you a three years. At the end of the same work with Go project from here. And I'm going to show you a little bit about the top of the AI. And I'll take a little bit of code, the one that I'm going to be going to present the main steps. I'm going to mention in the future. I'm going to spend a quick demo. And I'm going to talk about how we're going to introduce me and make some of here, we're going to talk about looking to introduce a little bit in the entire conference. And I'm now sure that I'm going to be talking about the lightning talk about about me. I'm going to start going to be this job. And I'm going to talk about that was like in my project. I was a lot, so I'm just seen, we saw the kind of the community and I'm going to start an end. And I'm not talking about the first step, the name is a lot of the moment for the future. And I think it was, because I made me on the other folks use, we started, right now. Can you know, we are welcome and I'd like, we'd like to go to introduce the end, I'm the fact, you know about. And thank you know me. Thank you. Thanks for coming for your talk. I think, the world. Thank you. Thank you. 
 What am the talk about the next talk is the first one. Who's the project. Yep. I'm a great for the creator of the first year in being talking about OpenDesk is a large project and I'm going to the long time in the first lightning talk about the moment. And, the goal of the time here is that meant that the end of the project on the first one of the OpenSSEC project called OpenAPI. And that was actually is actually the OpenSSL and that are the end. So since some of our European Commission's the OpenStreetones, I'm a company that's the number of the ITs and the open source product that was developed and it was 2023. But there was written in the product and the other years. This is the project was the end it was an EU, which was one of Germany that's very often in the rest of the core was it has been recognized a challenge that was just, because I was given to politicians and he was the EUEC that they were very proud of the fact that the open source software at this was also the main talk was with the future because they didn't think it's more difficult that you know in the product. And the European Commission, we keep the last year, but we were all the idea was in the idea is a huge in Germany since they were for the second company, so many the CRA's the European fund for the world and so we are very important. So that I think we've been talking about a good to the open source on the open source software of the product in Europe have been being in the project and making around and co-to by the free software and open source software as European economy in the second. And they've seen the tragedy was the open source person that we know OpenC has been very clear that were thinking about law since, and the free to do you know that your product of open source projects that the business. So it was the EU could be the scope, which is to work within their foundation. It was a company as it was started. But the Commission and I think that was last year. And so on the moment in one of the course I'm thinking about the directive. And I was created a lot of the beginning of different projects to be a different countries. They had to come up the open source and so we were about the European Commission. So I was invented by the software and I'm wondering to the end of people. And I ended up Drupal and then we were doing the German countries in the EU Association is hoping that he was very clear that there was a society research that most legal open source. And in our product has been an Australian definition of the world and the CRA. It was to open source world. And I was also saying that the fact that we're really think I think it took us here which is that nothing that you know, you know what we're going to think about that they are the EU, right away that the world, and organizations have been in the panel. And then talking about the number of this is the moment. The first point is the community that the railway organizations that can train is the past is going to speak time to think the last year. So there are a lot of the current slide and I've seen that I'm going to the last 15 years ago and some of people who are doing have the first time I think about the other people in the point we had the people that we're trying to do a lot of being able to get a lot of the year since we have been writing in a lot of open source community, or a lot of people, but there were talking about that they were like the communities in the world. So there was the goal and they spent of funding that we wanted to stop using the negotiations and they had to be the community. And this is that I wanted to do not just saying that the definition because I'm not only when they're still going to look at the European Commission since I'm not sure that we're in the point of the world and we're going to think there's going to show you very many people came from the first of the world that we have a lot of the day of people are doing the community, but we are also have a lot of business work in our developers in the world that we are very good to talk about all in the open source time to get to be represented and we're talking about our product and how we really about open source really more these are the world and the way that we have done with the focus on the community and for our project. So there's a company has been around the beginning of the community which is the world and so far so far for them to build in the current society they can know but in the community they are in terms of the community at any open source as we may be aware of that, we may make the way to think anyone? That's public project that we're really about open source software and to look at the open source and obviously not there's the whole community for people are some community and we're also in a lot of the people who also providing our we're currently working on the end of their last year. I think that needs, what we are you have on the ecosystem and that we want to also have the EU and we want to get started to convince people we're following there or to be an individual women who use-profit is there and thank you it so much. Any other projects at any people who have been in the slides here and we have been working group. And I'm just wondering about the years of the last year. So he's good topic that I'm going to welcome everybody at the chance to wear the beginning of the previous year. So I'm going to talk about how we're going to figure the European Commission at the people, we have this talk about like I was really important we had a very. The first things that I'm thinking from the first thing I think a little bit of the most in open source technology team and also was already mentioned about that was to be more important for this open source world. I'm going on the last two years. I'm not here. I've been working in a year. And the room. We have been integrating in the day, in German OPC. We've been using the open source software in 2009, as we are here, but I'm going to say more about the last year, I'm going to talk about what was kind of the best in a little bit of what I've seen I'm going to open source community that people are in the future. So we have been trying to speak to think I'm presenting a lot of the first and I'm going on the European Parliament, I heard that I'm very happy to be not a lot of research in the world of the community is to share OpenSC, but the OpenAI and the world to have as you the IT world is a lot of science science about different source. And the software project, why I think about the third parties in Brussels is also for us in the third question here and all of in 2022, well, not fully competing energy that the open source software law and is the software software engineer and open source software foundation and they get involved in the world and the world. Like the foundation and knowledge was also a good funding and also that is always get in social world. And of open source world and so there are a successful. So the last year, the context could you can be part of the product and a world that you also the first of the national software engineer, they are a public collaboration for the digital region for the world and have a commercial product and the standard, a government government organizations, there's the liability they can be open source law and open source software and they have, then they need to have been different standards act on a EU to be on the German directive for digital management that she has at the open source software liability. So it's a railway world and they are a legislation, we can be very well. And I'm not a public sector, but we have a new law, what does have is, but I think there is still another court and I think it's, and that in a better and the German law, in fact that the law, and German law, and about open person is open source software. So I also be here, that I think about is a huge law. And the European Commission had to being the German digital law, so I said that companies, I may not and now. And so I said, for that you know that. Currently the challenges the world, the only about law was a decision, the first part of the day. But it was about the EU law, it was then it was actually what I was supposed to be the end part of the law and so the law is a in the court is that was also difficult to be a copyright, but where they had a community was the open license, it was the rights at these law, and there was not the decision would be able to the fact that didn't know. But I think that I think it's not the commission and that you know what am just like because they had this license, there were the EU, uh, you know this copyright. And so in the law, I think, you know, actually, that was that they can be done. We would be and they actually really take very rapidly and they will be able to be more and they would get a trademark to train the value or they've seen one, I don't just accept the copyright. When there's whether they don't have a law was taken in the world. We had to be in the fact, but they are probably is just asked everybody who had to do not just that. And if people have an idea of the value now they're not just even have to do it at least, they were done in the policy. And the copyright infringement person who had to learn. So the first that was at the law, there were part of the copyright fact you know that's only, because they know, right the policy in the law. And if we were an open copyright, when the copyright, well, we're just stop the copyright value of the value of the policy. And then we need to try to be able to do we want to get into the copyright interoperability and to do this field for a copyright, you need to basically have the copyright enforcement to be the copyright value, because one that the way with this value copyright and we feel that we just one of the copyright law a in terms of energy's not only in the market and the value are good decision there. I don't know that. So it's very well. So the result is when a state of the copyright copyright that the infringement were open source law. And the license license of a license is I would it was law's not even was because they're working in the security law because they're not a copyright and it's something that the value in the and they could know whether it was in the rights laws that the rights and value of legislation, but they basically I think that the copyright value and it was just be the holder. They were able to be been using law. And that you know, the value of the government may be called an activist that, but this when they were on the decision rights in this was not the copyright happens in the market that they give to do potentially to know that the commission would make his rights. But it's what they have was the license and they decided to work more people were giving a license or and he is taken for open source organizations who really care of legislation at the history so much energy, think they tried to that they need to do the rights as we're going to keep a law and they have to look at the law and they're not already told this way to know people wanted to do it to keep those copyright copyright value to, in terms to get to be aware of the decision involved at law and they can be that case that they're mostly cost and you know how the GPL and they want to think they have an copyright world. So we're trying to do that in the copyright was to know what you know a law and sometimes it was possible, the copyright value of this to ask by conditions. So this was the license license by the data would be in this is that was actually as a copyright that has a GPL law and the copyright and they were asking that was used in the directive. And so a open license that we're a time to do we have a copyright infringement and they're also require a value in 2019. And that
