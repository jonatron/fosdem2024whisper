 We have a few things that we have the whole talk to. I'm going to talk to be wondering about design system because we have a new system we want to get some tool model in this. We need to create those documents. We want to have a tool on your application because you want to build an API description of the container which is kind of a web infrastructure as possible for that role about the application and does this to the code into this in the cluster. Then there are no one of the ability to look like it back in a kind of the web application that you need to have your application that you just need to ask for a task that you to create it or want to loaddown tables and you to deployer files using your app and it. If you have your API. So if you're using a service, you're going to want to call the deployment and it a pod. You want to send you just one or a web server call it into the web API doesn't have a server if you want to run the network for. So that's probably a workflow that allows you to and will try to track to do that that to deal with you to do the application. You can integrate the server. You can read the server, then also create the end up a user server or other provider. In the network of this will need to write into the API as you can modify the end the backend client you can have multiple data, on the data to start going on all the server and you. And the question is a database. So the API is the user is a server to go. What is very important to the Kubernetes can you use the new client to build service via mail or your service to a service, it's in the email. The server. And as Docker file, you do we want to deployers, a user? So, the request to integrate and deploy on, we want to provide your service services that we have to have the server and service provider, DNS server, the client to be also want to deploy it, which we have a service to S-ons, we need to be able to're trying to store additional data. And the server to run the server and also you can also want to what, because that we want to manage to run on the server. Then the you might need to look at all of those DNS? I'm going on the server. I just one, I'm coming in the server to authenticate. So if this is going to see, I'm going to, I'm going to be going to be going to talk to talk because this is going to highlight it's what we are the client to be here. It's part of the server. So, we need to be here for questions, what there's going to be talking about the server server to understand what they want to do, you want to create this as good topic, when you can you're trying to give that, but the server can you want to want that in the server, so that's here, for that's going to start up, we want to keep going to make the server, I, but, we're going to do this. We have a server and we want to come to go to continue to some thoughts on and then we don't need to the server, like, so that, I'm going to work we want to do we want to do. But, but if you're going on it's going to call the server I want to get out, yeah, and we're going to start. So this has a user know, but it. That's a user that the second thing that I thought that we're going to go to continue to this. I'm here. But I get a simple. So I'm very user space and I know, everyone. But this is a very often for the question. It's not needed to go to create a lot of a lot of people or how you know, it. And this is that are quite, but what happened to have the user needs to add the user, the user IDs, so this is what is, right? So, so, I'm going to know, you know, we've been doing, the right? Because, okay, you just the, right? You know, the browser, the local server is to do if you know, you want to start doing the server in S-imimmented and it, so it's not quite easy to keep the user. The user space is some of the server's part of the server to have the machine, you know what we've got in the server, but the server is happening here to get, and then where you're working on the client and then just shown of the client, well. So, I'm a server, I'm working on the server. And I'm the server's the client. So if you know, you're just going to be doing it's going to see the side, because you see a demo. So, I'm going to talk to live server because you're going to have that's going to start with the server. And I'm going to start with the client side,'s going to ask that's already a bottom. I'm going to show your server. Okay, you about the client channel. Is it's a server prompt, we just kind of the server engineer with the server. So, we have now the configuration. And I'm going to start the server that was going to talk about their client, it. And right? How are the server? So this is that's the server to work basically the host, in the password? Those are more user to our server. And the server is the server. The server server. And the server, for the server? And the server would actually go too. You can see the server, we're going to that. It's going to run the server to get the server. It's going to the server to be able to postpone request to run. So the server. We're working, we have time. We are going to plug up local JSON to the server. We have a server, we're going to be going to be able to do it up SIP server, which is going to show a server, the server. I'm going to say, well, you can, right? So this is today we are you. We have any server for a server server to build our end, we don't forget about creating the server? Or you don't want to try to know if you. That's going to lose someone on what's GStreamer. So the server, we have to write a DNS server and a server, in a client sideology, in his server that. So that? I'm going to end of the server, we can see how we have to call those things, but now. This is the server, when you have the client server, you want to create your server itself, you can do want to the server. And now like first, for the server, this server side, user files and that you just just talked about a server. You can also does it's better page to configure server, which will not, which is a client cluster is going to create a service server to add it directly, it's an application and the email administrator. So, and this is the server, just, you get the server's good thing that. And then also the server are responsible to your server services, once you can actually using the server, you have that we want to implement, to take the server. And if you should be able to the client to follow the server. It's public server, we want to deal with the server that we will have as a client's going to come from that. It's trying to give us to enable the server to. Thank you a server. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, great. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Hi everyone. Thank you. I'm going to see talking about the bot, we'll introduce a friend. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you very much everyone. Thank you everybody very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, afternoon. Thank you. Hello everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very first office to talk about a part of an questions, which is being here about how everyone for questions? Good afternoon everybody. 
 Thank you. Thank I'm a time for a little bit. Thank you very much. 
 Hello. We have been a very much. I'm a very much. So I'm working on the name to Fosder project. Hello everybody. Thank you so much. Don's the name for a project in a project at the Mozilla, the slides. So I'm going to thank you today are working in Open Science Welcome long-source website in the end of the last presentation, we use Open Science GEPM, and the first introduce a little bit of how we have a little bit to have to encourage everyone for this talk. And thank you so much all this talk. Thank you. 
 So everyone for listening the great talk at the community from us. And we joined a community that's a long time to everybody. We have in 2019, how there was that we thought we've been talking about how these things and we have working really a lot of the time to look at the company that. We've been helping us about the world, but we're also know, the first, the first one point of the European Commission, the first year we've been talking about the two years ago, a year, which is the world of the EU institutions and how to be there are there are a European Union for big ones in Europe and they have been found that last five years ago. We have been trying to be here which are getting a bit easier to come in the European European Commission and the open source platform we had been going to formulate the foundation and their software and in a lot of the EU Association and people are the project. So I was very similar to set up your world of companies are both workshops in fact, the community is like I'm going to open source world and what the one was the largest organizations that we're going to work also making people, so I'm going to the European Commission in a government and the open source project to be not the Commission. So for open source community, well. So I'm going to be being made an expert sets? So we just the US Act and you, a bit of the EU Association and the world and also in the act on the foundation. We have been talking about this year of people as a software. We have really think about the European Commission and we have to have the Commission in practice and years. So our government France's interesting. And now the first of the only in the parliament last year about the commission law or so we do you know that so open source software lead. So this is the market, which you know that they were in an open source software for it was so we were in reality and the whole part of that the Commission and we had the companies at the parliament and we had ever had a lot of 2019 because we were at the ones and you have a lot of people from Drupal we decided to go to solve that was to present our product and we really do this year's always about using the European Commission to be the moment before you know that you have been doing that we had a little bit of funding in the world. And what it was actually is good thing that we've had to speak to have seen the history to have a discussion of the way that we did we were talking about about the European Commission of the law by the commission, but I know that's the whole license for the community engineer at our society that we have could have been to be clear in the parliament, we could be able to be that Drupal and the CRA to set we do or be aware of open source law, we have open source software. And so the law and we open source space in civil society. That's a open source. It's the negotiations in the decision would be a tough to be in the world and software scientists in the CRA and the first of that you would be like to act in the open source thing that was actually allowed to be the EU, but it would be related to bring to the participants that a question. It's kind of a pivotal thing that the question was that are still quite first thing to find and software. Right or maybe think about a sustainable and what are there you are a lot of the Drupal in European Commission. And so the fact that we have, I know that was a couple of a lot of the parliament said here that you can't know that they're hoping to be a lot of European best person, like the commission, but they're a lot of people would keep talking to engage in this about the product. We'll be very good people who are asking this organization, right away, we're not talking to help us but we mean this, but now we're talking about the I'm not going to make money in a lot of this law, but we should give that we do not going to help us more aspects, but also to be so on the second aspect of the market or the European digital sector for people who's open source and we have really looked at the world in 2023 I think that. And this is now they're going to be there. And one of course you know, the first one is a goal for that you there's the legal problem. So that you know, but it's the first point of the last year and the law. We have been a more important question of the end of the law to do it's going to be easy to say that. It has to look at the challenges, but we still the next year. I think that we're not even very exciting thing to do is basically have done at the other people to be competitive to make it. We're going to the member of the CRA of the license away, as far as we will say that we will be able to find a world. How do we need to think we should be thinking about that we have any accessibility changes the first? Like if we can we're talking about my colleague, we want to follow from the question? So the first year.
