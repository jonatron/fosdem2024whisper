 Okay. Thanks a few people in all of this I'm going to give some questions. So we want to keep your project for us, doing. We talk about the solutions and coding towards. We are going to do experiments, we have to set our friends in our community. I think we can see that we'll present a lot of people from a lot of talks in there's a lot of features. So we're going to be built a lot in a lot of projects in our project that have this kind of time. We've been speaking about it in our community, which I used to build their experiences? We've got a project called Run Runto-violence of work on our project called AI team where the company and the Red Hat for our workshops. We have a group and we've had to build a project and build that I'm going to talk about the most of the things we also have to be to contribute into being a great area and our community and then we're going to talk about a lot of people to be the various people, so we're going to work in this stuff to have the product and we hadn't just going to have this project in the way to make a first of the documentation could give the code. So, the last year of the project so I'm just wondering that I'm going to hear from the community who was important. I'm a year over here and I'm going to actually involved in a sort of legislation that we had a bad group. And I was saying, but the two months ago, I was we are the end of the French open source community as a good projects towards the world, I am Google Deepto and to we am I'm going to do. And I'm going to come through the digital open source research that we actually is to go, we're going to start with a long time to be a long term organizations, so we are the community and co-founder of Europe in a company and I'm going to look at that we talked about the world. And I'm a little bit about the biggest talk about being a good point of the European Commission and I have to talk about the software and we have been in 2018. We had some open source software policy and the process at the general economy and was an initial work for the initiative. So I was in the fact that's a long term that's incredibly important to be a really important. And of they were a lot of people in companies, well and someone I think really, like the fact that the parliament to get good idea that the open source community companies that's pretty much about technology. And it was almost 2023 we had to have a lot of the end up in one. They could be just be more in the commission. I was the parliament to do we were mostly want to do the whole point of the same software. There would be more than a third directive, which was a law to do a legal issue of the parliament Association, it? And the law. So all the CRA is that we're a time the world we have a little bit later because in the markets have had to be a legislation and we're in the parliament to be applied in the parliament from the policy in the public sector interoperability that they were also there was doing law of the technology, a rights of law and so it, they got to be heard of what they are here. You're using copyright sector because they're getting the law. But they have no. And that we have a way to be public society and they have even the source software, the infringement to work very stable policies and they know the rights for the key in public sector came from the German law would say. Because the copyright was to be really good. And if you can also don't the second and I said, you can be a copyright world, it's a huge country, and actually you can happen in the law that most important to be a copyright and then the German law. And the big point of course the key, you can be a citizen that can be a good. All right, you know if you know, for the commission of that they're a small legal law and they can't care of the law to be able to be a free value for the big win legislation in-peer law, I know, because she's a market, the sector in the law and the licensee law. More value. And after the gate would be a good enough license-founded an open source law, they have it's the law legislation. In fact, but one of copyright law really important license that they are really have to think there that you know that law itself I think this market law also this market of law, because that or GPL licensee, when you know how they can be a copyright, you know, you just do they don't, you know, and they're going to produce a copyright law, and the fact that you know, but there's important to be something that the law, and that's important is the security that the CRA, it's where you know, it's interesting because the GPL was built-time and the first copyright holder, the licensee does that, right value of the copyright holder should be it. When I really, I think he's important thing. What, but not important, then I think it's not a value that you know that you know, no, I know, because, you know, but you know, you know, it's all the license, that they're having the answer is like more or a legal law, but there's a value of the law since it's like that the license. And they is a parliament in a copyright infringement, because this regulation that everyone is, they think, the law in and they are there he's anyone in the state of it. So there's the commission, we don't think that is a society will be some copyright law. So there are still not a gate from the good practice. And the market to avoid a copyright law, I think, we're saying there, they're also know that they said, like that the government to be GPL. And that they know, they haven't very important to have the court to always had a person, but a copyright as the one of it was people, but they know, these copyright. And in a question is very much as well, and they were you know what they just came around the only use case they were in and they want to think, they're like, and they have to actually they are in particular sense of the licenseeas had a copyright sector and they want to do not all these companies that they come from the cost of the decision and they were all these people were able to work, like to have to do their company and they need to get involved in the GPL organizations and know, you said that people all the beginning of these problems that they really has to be able to have been at least the copyright sector, they were the market, but that we've started the EU government was very happy to think we had they were just had we got heard in law. And so there were great person that was a law or yes, too many companies and I said, but this, like to have proven that the way of a copyright needs to ensure the copyright that we had this public law over to be an law was a member of a license. Obviously, I actually getting the least, as the context of a license law didn't really have the number of funding in the panel. And we had that are going to just aware of people, so the commission of the copyright law thought that was kind of the law and kind of not the law, but they as a value across the German law that you were actually wanted to be a value that they can be an court of the copyright law we thought that we may still use law and the value to have and they just trying to be able to get to know like the infringement the directive I would like a non-scale sector. Like we get more common license making the first we should be able to the software, but I would be open source decision. It's not necessarily a law, but sometimes, we do we can't have of the license, then we've got to think that the license or at the problem that by a law that we have seen that the law. You need to do it. And I mentioned it, we're looking forward to worry about GPL law. There's not just a copyright that. And the value to the licensee would have a law in a copyright for the law and then the law, the AI law of the could be really exist as it's not a copyright and then we had to think about said, so that that the software act is a policy field the same law to just very challenging I just a copyright should be the law of law. But and that is important year, I think they don't know that those act even think that at the first and they don't think about it's like that time, I think, I think about this is made by the idea, and I think that when people apply a law. But of the methodology of the law law is it's also something happened in terms of the law and law, is very only always a law society who will be trying to the policy that data. Because that they're not as far the license rights means there might be the right place to the free standards, because they have, they will be around what they will be able to as far if the law, you want to have heard, if you're your copyright issue of the license act, but in their laws should be a copyright problem that the copyright copyright policy is that it might be the only about law or the government has to ensure that you may understand those issue and you think, you know where we just was just are going to the copyright has to have its two sector to be. First of them and then the copyrightability because a problem that you are in the law in the value and the transparency that the license law had that the German law, if they have any laws and they've had to see what they're not actually some space in the UK copyright as you know and they're doing this copyright value of freedom would know this way but there is a value to mean the value of the policy value that is what it and it's not much, so it is in general and to do not to the value and then to be used and although the right or license thing for the end the law that the law to be the copyright policy has effectively into the law as a data so obviously means that would expect that a GPL is an interoperability country of really important to have the commission value that the community think that are often think that the political law if you can be this because the license is in the copyright mean by that the copyright could being found so the copyright of some law so often but a copyright. So the law is good value of the value of your law is when it's going to actually in a copyright law is the law law does then you take like this copyright world is actually the license law, really long term in copyright in the copyright so it doesn't necessarily have open regulation and as well, but of this would be taken exactly the law that copyright value in the law and so like be in the copyright was just a GPL license copyright value of license has to should benefit of our copyright holder is aware of copyright copyright law and therefore I would be involved in terms of law and but no copyright directive at copyright that at only that's the law and like they have a law law and they're a copyright law mean at copyright in government law license and they mentioned also the German law like in- infringement in energy the German copyright law. So what GPL that's the problem that I would like it was working law or if there is the license copyright law and they don't have the law. But it may not the copyright copyright holder is intended to that we have to say the license work. So that is also this court law law license clearly I said that the license to was that the law in fact of law that the law is actually there said, and the copyright copyright value should be a proof of legislation and may be the GPL law will be important for the copyright holder has just ask that that notion for copyright infringement were aware of just one regulation, an GPL law has an copyright holder law policy is not that in and the law and a a license open street because you know that means the law directive that the law is what copyright that the copyright it's in law mean open copyright law court would be used or anything only product law market that does it's what regulation of the problem of copyright law that the person to be a value has been copied by copyright directive and an GPL is said by the law. And as she said the law, we've spent at the law in time, especially in the the law that can the law being the law law law as often, then they have as if they're an law isn't have the copyright holder. And as the law that we should be asking for a copyright license. And they have really understand was doing the license is that the value in law would be great to you might be something that they did, but no no license license, think it's a law has to that's the German copyright legal law in the GPL law, one of law and of the copyright law, but I could that the copyright law could say it was in a copyright copyright copyright as copyright or the law in fact actually copyright policy law directive. It's the law and that needs is being an interesting thing of copyright that the copyright law court of law directive the law. So for copyright is from the first person on the law as law where they give a copyright law still in the copyright parliament here. The law court is, it might are there this copyright law is copyright and that she said about an open license of GPL copyright report license has no copyright licenses, but it's a copyright policy. It's also should be just in just to copyright rights to the law and the copyright holder, which was the law as the market act of the law that copyright, a GPL would not always have in another copyright licenses as copyright directive and clear what to and, that it is trying to get the value becomes an injunction was enough sector directive and didn't have to it anymore. And, still in the license public commission was part of the license it was doing at the law was not the law. And of AG license was just heard of legislation in law value that she made license for one political law. And you know that I believe that last law, which has had the impact of political person to be an parliament who was able was just just going to get to know something that had the
