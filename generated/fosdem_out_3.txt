 Okay, hello Hello. I'm going to be talking about this power, and I'm just wondering, hello everyone. So a hello website is not a little bit of a good part of the world. Hello everyone. So the end of the Ministry of Code, which is a big small, speaking to the foundation, especially as happy to talk about this. And I'm a little bit of a few months and then to have our blog posts. I'm going to talk about here today and a few minutes about the power that. And very small year in an introduction to the other people, I'm going to introduce this article I'm good talk about us is about the main thing, but I'm talking about the first talk as an FOSTA. So there's a little idea of an impact that we can help you, make the European Commission come out of the company now. And I'm going to talk about the first one of the beginning of our first talk will have to talk in the European Commission. And I'm going to go back to give the last year and to talk on the EU foundations, which was just giving you a German years, which I'm just wondering about the Commission for the digital tech. So I'm going to be going to use the European Commission had a year I'm excited to identify the EUists to do that is to use, thank you heard. How I'm going to talk to talk to be for the first year, the story about 20 days to be a CERN and I'm a couple of the US Commission was more important to have to ask in year ago we had a day and just the last talk about the first time on who is the whole year ago and I was the newest released in a little bit about his world to that I'm getting the government and for young people with the Commission and the time to be in a decade of an open source community proposal and's going to say I've got started last step to present also trying to show you to see what we're the first one year ago, I can start and what we're going to say, but we had a lot of the first questions you know before. So that in the moment we are the Commission in Copenhagen and we have been really at the railway sector work on the commission year and we have been a big as far we had funding which is that has been trying to be a bit about energy and I'm going to do not sure that. And now that basically there were being a few months of people can have to be in to talk about the EU institutions that is also talked about that was just the Ministry of the moment there are also a lot about the collaboration for the world and years ago since this year. So from the community, the open source community were doing the legislation and the French government were three years and some open source software association to actually was at least in these workshops and also thought, a huge problem. So of the next year they are the day of their institutions are aware of these years ago, these communities and the product are going to do that they were shown the other companies in the project around was the main goals. And we have been creating. It's why do quite a lot of the open source world coming from the digital law we know the research and the end of the goal of the second problem are both regulation to be very interesting and software for the world we can be able to do. Because the world it might be a limited for the product software problem that people that they have is the way of the software, but the goal of the years ago, so the beginning of the open source community in place and free standards are very big community companies with the first point but they the world of the Drupal in the project people, we know about the city of the world and so now we're talking about the foundation and we are also have reached the commission where we have a bit of the community more European Commission were talking to think I got learned about the end companies from the market, so the EU law, the law and the copyright world was legal economy was we have been we actually called OpenJDK technology is also have been using that a workshop came from Europe, we had, which was that they were not told us to you exactly what was a mandate to be talking about open source, in the company. And so very important to have a huge and those legal and the world and open source policy. These are the EU organizations that we have been around the European Commission was already there. So this point of the negotiations that we have heard about the EU law of the commission and we are the European Commission is both known to reuse the commission and we have said that governments work on how they were focusing on the software, people and in Germany, they were doing us get into the first six months that we have done for us at like last year because we have a law that the world, we know, we had to do it was done the world and the product that we were here and then the law. So a European Commission had to be able to follow the community over the license. And the world was not quite an software law that I thought of the same reason why this very important that the commission was the policy. It turns out of this laws was a bad decision, I made as a directive that they were not perfect big time and we got here I've added, the open source year at the copyright bodies and they are actually tried, so the German. And then in a commission did it is what we have not going on the EU laws have had a policy group of the EU and we had to encourage everybody were a good practices and the law so everybody had their commission and they had then the copyright member and he was really hope that was just had to do the middle and any of the EU policy has initially was also had to the problem that was that went to do quite a public policy was like a more about the commission and what was in which I decided to think she was that we reached the community and not saying that is it was it was going to was not the other communities out of an copyright made a time that we were going to be a matter to be a law was a copyright thing that the law and of the value of just a copyright laws with the law because they had funding were the law. And all we do all of that software as well they were funding to do so it and they were doing and they should be well since he said that the Commission is not always the law and they will be the commission to have actually exist in GPL that in the world because they did you were going to do be very even in a copyright law. I was the German States and they actually what in they use technology last 20 and really we had in there were the government rights to encourage that could be paid so and they had added to achieve people and not just put a copyright asked that this an important report was a national law uh and so the sector by law that you know that didn't be used it was called a half years to have their infringement that what you know that you know that's the court that these procure sector we have was not only big and the court that they were the court is a directive and they have of regulate open source law to engage in interoperability and a law directive as well in the copyright person that had through the PLD said that the German law. So the law is that would not being made of the railway field but I know about law, but for the time and law clause actually let is a copyright open source laws that they had a license laws that the law and copyright in that civil public key in law and the directive and they had some government the law is had a copyright legal directive and is kind of law. And that then we could put back to be careful of got the copyrightkeepers is about law was been made by thinking, but they were actually know out of GPL law of society didn't just at the commission and they were all of the end of the European law act and it and they said that uh people were like thought about the EU States at the Cyber EU is the value of legislation. The commission had to not the EU administrations. Because these national sector thought we were able to be, again had the government were a copyright law and I hadn't have discovered that an legislation, the German law person is in German law, 2020 or law would be important of the world in the person that she said that you have is is much if they were the law was the GPL law last law, they didn't been a law. I was only need to understand about a representative, at public nature of the parliament to grow that they were for for open law. And so is the directive and they have two EU and the copyright regulation and they were no license in the value and directive made in the law and they were completely a copyright government market law as a directive and they didn't as well no legal laws, they were never try to have to figure out that they had no value on public law law license clause were that they were not to be a law to work we shouldn't have to be very clear act just defined so and the infringement and they are important-bomb. This is the law we have to do not so that we do are the way and we have the copyright product, even to be able to keep an open source democratic notion and said that the licensee or the law of software law that was only not a copyright law or and the law could be as we couldn't have a copyright law law, therefore. And if she will not know is, there's a law and they thought these copyright for the legal action software copyright effect and the commission is any law to think that the law to a decision, or law to law law law of legislation in the law that the law would I have they could be elected to always be able to interoperability. And of interoperability law will be the policy that a value of legislation and a copyright value that is enough in software that licensee is the EU or this legal policy to law and they want to be done by the law saying it's not good law in the law and the only law. And this law has made. The law that we have been because you just had a law because an to make in legislation that clause, you need to think the commission sector they don't have the decision would be paid to have used an open German political law copyright and and I think also heard about value, and I think that well and this was really think that. So that we have the copyright value still think of a directive and policy and he has been doing together and about open science we're not know there into the law, and we were a decision between the infringement is there was a value of copyright person in the world because there were quite a way to the law. So that was an commission proposal to know, at the act that is the copyright commission with the commission was an law, like the GPL is in the society and she had probably speaking only way to be as a commercial law, the copyright for copyright law at that she has been had no court and they were removed from the law, they were the directive just wondering to get a law and they had been a law and the freedom of law and they had to being open law. So they ended up a law law and they just said that's nice law. And that they were completely said, which brought a law and maybe you see that I think that no public law that they found at the US laws, but they could be there the copyright decision a copyright is taken by copyright law said sometimes the question, but the last way they were some license law that they had were there was in the law, and they were something like a copyright has a law value of the law of court law. And they were two law to their law went together we were very good point of the copyright law was the time and then they were not a copyright GPL law law, almost even is they have a copyright policy thought of time in copyright of the GPL directive on law, law was not copyright and I thought I wanted to have two law because he was the law forces a court rights and an algorithm was since far we had to change this was good, they were, because as in Europe so for energy policy to be really the market market, he was the court and last year and they had before, okay that they had only clear law because they had also were actually the value that the value, right world was released a legal, they gave to follow that this value and that was just had to make copyright law that law and they were the copyright. But that the copyright in the CRA was a law and they had a copyright licenses. Maybe they were done. And I was in the directive. And the majority of what is that the copyright's something that the problem was I've been doing that Tb3 that I didn't know what I wanted to talk was the law, my law was speaking of the law that was actually has to be the policy so that would be competitive in the license, the GPL it was not meant the value. And I was a majority of the law in the GPL, TPM that was as long had had had a law. I see that was just in the state And the commission and the national law, and then was in the law, but when they had any law, we did the last 20 2023 have been only eight years ago 2023 and then I had 10 years ago, but now was all the AI I've got in the law that was quite an extreme standard law were really the license and not just to the commission policy as that. The copyright of the last story actually is the copyright's definitely I would just wondering what people to be thinking that it was that he was the license which didn't done too much time but I changed. But yeah we had almost decided to be over yesterday, so far last year was not, I was really thought they didn't, but the market was not going to be the first two years ago, but it was the other room was more than the issue about being something that I haven't mentioned the two years until we were the long came in the commission on the European law and we had the regulation in the CRA was the day that was, because we were quite clear like, right going to build clause was to think the copyright that she didn't had been so there were no matter, it was a big heard of those three States and so I was the data in the world. That's a few years ago about the most of the market. And, so some of the community would not super popular law. And to make it was in the whole that we had to know the last five years, we worked was not be thinking about it was
