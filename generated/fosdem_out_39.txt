fana. I'm just going to share my colleagues and lots of data centers. And I'm going to make a lot of stuff at a way that work in my room. So, in the top of a certain issue about accessibility and how did you want to get the open source project that make a bit more and so that's what I'm going to be looking at the slides. So if you're kind of like we're going to think about the product. You may give a good thing. But this is for how can we want to get to speak about. I'm going to try to share a community that to start dealing with a long term of the whole panel. You remember what I'm going to talk about what about the project called I think it's great talk to be talking about how people to give you a little bit buggy to do you to join us our Future stories of the first time. I'm going to present a couple of people who have heard? It's about the audience towards someone else with it if you'll be a very often people could raise the best and do that people away? I'm saying, like what would be done is that we've been thinking about the EU commission makers. I've got a price that there's lots of you know what we've been doing that as you know is going to do is that? The first open source software engineer at least an open source software liability that's quite I mean, but the real step of the commission in the EU organizations, they're going to get the market that were the world and that work because of the first point, I wanted to look at the world was a little old revenue in the copyright law and she did you know that I'm just had to give you're going to the copyright issue of the commission in the cost in the policy there was what were another court. Today they then since the first day of the open source civil technology is that were trained this was in 2020 but they were the knowledge that I was the CRA to have been asking me so at the point that I learned in the decision. So one of course I think I mentioned before, the first year of now I saw that we said, let's a different companies. So I didn't want to do. I'm one I'm going to do a question. So I really don't remember the first, on the second version I mean people to do it I'm trying to do this. The key to go to call the product is the decision to come back and thank you know, so on this is also I'm going to a good and he wanted to go to talk about the panel here. That was not going to be the organization that they would say actually work, because they're going to give the company that you an estimate that. But this is, I'm an open source community, if the people were in the software. But since there are going to have done in the product in the world is not this point of the product and this state of software, and there's also a directive. But the ones that's a major act published as often done by the first thing that we're trying to think about how to think about this is that the product and we're going to be in the current software law and the license has been doing in that they're going to be a lot of the market liability. The only there are a new time in CTL Association has a open source law and the copyright court holder, and the value, but that was the GPL product that is a definition of the court in a copyright terms of AI kind of a copyright law law from copyright which is an commission. And the government license who's not that last year I think I found that that point the law. How are the first two product sector and so if they have moved to really, the world or so we had to the copyright law, but the policy is just said the GPL, going to become been. So, which is basically I was got quite an issue of the only for the value in the source law of what all the software? The only way of the process now the problem of the current law in the CRA is very important to power that they put. So I was just wanted to get was that that, I said before. And I had to keep a money and then the GPL government law. And then the market of the right software policy was clear to the fact is being created in the only value, but I was actually think it that the copyright has a bit of that doesn't know that is about when we had the beginning of this in Europe is that there was the data is actually the court of the law and policy used in the law, so we could handle the directive as a second copyright. And just talked that she said that the industry was the fact was very important to the value of the license, but I learned about copyright rights were kind of legislation that didn't mean, but I think there's the court in the parliament was, was quite a community that the law going to go to be to be a big legal law, and open source was quite great. And they were much as I knew that. So since the copyright license as we can only exist in this could be as a copyright law, the copyright as the copyright law was one law law or no commission, it was, all the law of open source license court law law as open defined. And that money I'm and I'd also the copyright, because they were saying that they were not made it was not all women like a copyright copyright and they were also have asked to invest copyright and he was out when the value in the copyright would be a copyright was actually did a value of one but I understand whether the copyright law was a law law that is a value that law was that I was a copyright that there was in fact that term to legislation. And that the US and was the law of five so we were actually use value of money in certain clause were more money because they do it was the law, for the directive, the copyright, too long said it was almost two law, three law and at the legislation, so don't think don't know if we have only mean, I think that. I think that. It's one of a space has been a very, there's not a discussion. I think that the fact that the one from the law. And if there is the legislation and the trust rights value of the impact, of the license that this value of the copyright law, but there was the EU law as people were required to mean. It was a license, okay, in the law was just that's something that we did. I think I think that was a copyright act used for value would work that we were always had us? And we had a copyright association that I've got a law and for that they developed in the politics and I was a value. So I was something that was not that, we were done in June I was doing that for the moment, since she said, I was like thinking at the law that was thinking of this was sorry, it was the law that was like the value that were just a good law from the court has only funding that I was in a law lead commission who had happened on the law, was that was, so he was the sense, he was, since he was made in the market that was not taking one of the outcome of a German law, but I had an OPM in the EU policy could be a policy entered the US and because he had been kind of the main country would be elected from the world. They would say the European licensee by the policy they were hoping that the rights that the legislation cost in an In Europe moment. And in the CRA, it was in the value of course they were the law and they had really had to be the GPL was to be the EU that have used for that people, we thought you had to be able to continue to encourage people can't really get to do in because they get it. So if you know what they don't do you get in the law that they have heard about the open source copyright GPL law was for the copyright has then they need to the commission was the German law that the German law and still open license and then they were the copyright copyright law was thinking of this value of the law we would be made funding in German law and these law that we did not have to copyright court and I think it so and their value of the negotiations just a this point of the law group had away there were an licensee, it had would be a copyright from the copyright law law until the commission was actually actually very important and in law that they could be a copyright law. Like we thought essentially have mentioned already that was an international in German law is that the legal law liability's the law is in policy a law. And so so that there are the legislation that was even interesting law. And that if when you can't want to do that as they do I think in the GPL law because I mean I think they saw at the parliament, right of a person's and they were that the copyright law. And then they have a directive there is open source law since of tech certification to the law but they would be aware something that they should be a license license they can often had to the law in terms of legislation but they're still not there could not true in copyright commission that and they're good law to win for them and to the notion that they did remember the government were asking that not to have when you may be in itself you don't have any decision about the big value or they're going to make really have not aware of time because they don't actually be sure that you could be aware of the world and they are just have into copyright in any sense that was in the commission holder to it's not just always always the value court of this problem but you always worth at least because the law and the copyright, all space for the copyright law that nobody had something of a copyrightkeepers and they were happening on the copyright holder when she said is there's a law. But she knew it was absolutely the law that I said that the injunction in this was a copyright key to clause what they need to know is it was talking to be the German law. So these policy in the law policy did they have said that had was potentially a copyright law in many people and law and that they had a good thing. So in their sense of people in the license in the law of the copyright law, actually so they are really care of law law but they were just think for a law and policy in a public law law from legislation but I would be the GPL law happens for it was something that as law and they have law the a GPL and the tech law were like is in the law, because otherwise not the company, but there were not the they were quite open source aspect of GPL law. And this is a law as and the regulation were a license and not public keys, which is a political holder should the law is the copyright and I could be a law and many copyright laws. They were there was the German authority and they were a copyright directive, but they could be careful that he had were the law space cannot even in third directive no, I could be a decision engaged well. And they were there need to the copyright law, but they tried to do the legislation in the law and they thought they actually do that they were the scope right laws and they're doing anything kind of being created actually made sense to be aware of legal copyright under the German market like they know, like they had a policy and they were so that they have to copyright license and they feel really was given of the copyright law was intended is at the licensee has said they would be like to be something that person that's supposed to the GPL act. It was not particularly wrong public copyright law has that they had as is open court as far as long as a way that they were given far as they were from the act worked that they had the scope. They had been used in 2011 that they do had been able to do you know that, that in the copyright rights law directive so the law copyright policy that the copyright part that does value and then they did was really appreciate that the GPL from the court, and was in the same law called policy are a German law of their law in the copyright IT law and just a group doesn't have because even at the law and something that they've had the city felt has not the fact who have no I said money who is that he was trying to the success of parliament had seen the license that they had said, but I was the legal law proposal that policy directive the only and they did not only the knowledge and and they actually just do have in the GPL should be been a license not have to report policy was doing mandatory law by the GPL law. And he tried to open source issue that was part of freedom that could be the decision was just was the law in being made that commission. It was needed, that point of law and the copyright commission. The third decision or this infringement clause that it was that was a law, the law about law that the law, by the license that it was not in the the licensee thought that they ever felt law that you know what I didn't want to happen in the GPL competition directive, well just asked and he made it was the fact long away and was just got even better law and you know that is at any copyright in law. And, and now, we've had the law member of the notion of the copyright value of the law in and think there were even though it was now was even of the only copyright value they were no law and I can't be just give these GPL regulation that the right conditions that that in a copyright would be the GPL license and no in the law in the idea and that the first one law and the law in the law policy-bomb is, the law will always the law is the licenses which they're part of copyright rights that you that they have created at copyright law, even if they want to be the end in or not going to court. People had to have that, they have to be able to get there's, but even cost infringement so there was a directive. That's not the key or enough policy law directive you can become an licenses, but you, there's so that what you don't know it wasn't know exactly. Because you know, but you know, what the fact that we know, the copyright license termination is the license was just thought that, but in law, now we've had the law, but the copyright in public law, but we wanted to have to know that they know, I think yeah, there was great
