 Okay. And we did a way. Okay, a very interesting thing to make a lot more power, we have a big project, and you can build our application and how can we build a more, get a little bit more more detail of a very job that we want to go to find me. And this is a real question. You can see how can we can talk about the things that you're doing. You can take a lot of things in your tool. You can build a different container and have to say in in. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 
 Okay, thank you. My name he's Daniel we have a little bit about Jl or Thomas. This is a little bit. I am a little bit about an open-Sanver between the Internet of an open source project of the various main ones are basically using OpenSSD and the Openbuth and the University of the EU Association is actually using the EU developers for our next talk of the OAuth community from the first goal of this. We have a year and an open source project with the first place, which is also a lot of things like in these tools. We have one in the third thing that are these kinds of the first year again, some other projects, we didn't want to be there are, we have to have to make a bit of the first one which will be here about the end up the OpenTLP or AI and the EU and how much as the history of it's really important to each one that are the EU. That's why we have initially talking about a very interesting problem. And I am I'm getting here, because I'm going to the last year I'm wondering. People are going to do some of the ones, but there are going to be a lot about two reasons. And I think is the beginning of the only one of the way to explain to do you can you keep everything that the world of the rights of the definition of open source technologies, trying to the EUI is happening in the EU and a US and the context of that the value of society were used by the EU, of that policy so on the last year since the middle of the market, the German Commission are then what the liability was on the commission of course at the EU institutions are the end of elections and the EU regulation of course of the whole ones that is important that is that we need to do with the policy and on the policy has been said that it was actually been used in terms of the parliament to be surprised to the parliament is the end of society and they are the end rights so the commission would and companies and to have to get involved in an open source law that we want to get into sector. So all a notion that he was already all the one really doesn't know more into that those EU laws and that the EU government law as a public space and we have been discussing and thought that's not the moment where the market of these regulation of the first act on the software to think this German is not allowed to law that you can be able to be a national funding that requires the scope we also being open source decision has to keep in Switzerland today but it so that we also a part of the German regulation and to be possible to move to say not necessarily a much because they can only a little bit of legislation they want and they may be doing this by looking a long term of legislation that I think we haven't have to take away. These two years ago since I don't heard that they're all necessarily need to that the federal laws that in the German law does it's not a good no longer open software that only principle of the community should be focused party in the major regulation and because they're going on software in the commission could be a problem in terms of that was like there's what have been faced and in the commission would be a bit frustrating and the PLD is very recent issues that was some of the law and I was a point okay far we had before there was going to give you think there, I could be a thing and that we've been trying to have been heard about in the government and we've got heard a cost and so far now I think in this issue and then we're getting to get rid of that we're looking at the whole act in this mindset of our organizations have one big question. So I was about this is that was a good to talk which was that I'm saying I had a way to understand in the foundation was there was trying to be so yeah I was important to keep a little bit of the GPL and this conversation in the commission because we had a good to go through the open source perspective and for a license value of a good point and they had done it was so on and so we can't have to be using much more of software related to ask you know and how it was very far as well as well from how we've had started doing the moment and we have their product and how they had to get a strong copyright stuff when they had what we had to speak a bit of a very often has been to say which would like a little year we should be a day-to-bomb so these year and we should get a thing and we have had to look forward and I've got the new release and there was to work in the commission to be talking about and being a nice even though we made for the same thing with the group of what I was we had a little bit of a few months and 20 years at the foundation and were talking about it was because it got asked about the best and that the back to work was actually has been kind of had is a big and there was quite a bit more people on doing a lot of what kind of went towards our co-res is a lot of money to, which was trying to our feelings and we had a little bit of challenges and they had that were like so I think that I've been working on the ones that's what was that the technology was kind of this is there was an A little bit of a huge open source of a open source project to be quite interesting ones to be out to make and they did it in the way to go around and get started with the last been trying to the communities that was also very important thing and that we've been working on the social services which were in Europe and the community were in the last year we were just realized that was just a lot of a community developed them. So we've seen when we were a, because I was quite a lot of the organizations that we have looked at the open source projects. And at that was a huge. And I'm just back to do many people here that are going to people. I think about it was you know the open source projects we had said it was just had to be willing to say which were mostly working on the right now. So we've been doing this project, I'm going to it was wondering about work at some of the open source community, but I was we were going to get our work on the first year or a good time in June 2023. So I've got this whole open source projects. So I've gone here was the number of the development And I looked at the future here. We're going to use in a lot more and we've got to keep a lot of other countries since the years ago. We've got a good funding in practice and we had some of just had to do this talk with over. And we had to deal with the problems and what we started with our own companies, and we did is going and we can be using open source product into this point of course our software. We're trying to be had to build of our data sets of it within a very cool idea to do that we even in our open source software engineer at open source software, but we've been doing and the community as people here we want to spend the organizations and then we've been doing and we think we can also have been going to make it. We're talking about open source citizen of the forum that was working with it was just funding in the person who was also to be in the open source code to be kind of time. Because we've been doing this is a lot of what we want to explain what we want to have to have to do yet. We're looking for the question of of that we've been thinking that we have been we have been presenting a lot of your own open source project in there yet for us from the end, and so we've got this year now and we did we have quite a talk about this big one that we're going to pay these days before we're going to make a lot of our products. The time over the next thing is going to work on the last year of course. It's there's more question was any of the most important to be able to be talking about where the maintenance of the government in the world the world where we're at the world. This I think's what I'm hoping there's talking about who's our things that I'm going to start to be talking about the long time. I'm going to start with this right now I'm wondering in January? I'm going to talk about it's wondering. I'm afraid to have this question? I'm not saying, and I'm not sure that I'm thinking about the way to come just going to talk about the one that you now. You're in this question. I'm working on the room at the open source was just trying to talk was going to be at this. I would be here. I'm going to talk was wondering about very clear right? I was an issue. But back in these questions. So I think it was going to go back left at the right now in the details in your question. Those are coming back at and I'm just wondering. I've got a little bit about the developer, right now. I'm just going to speak a little bit more questions. I'm going to being a little bit of just wondering that I'm in the lightning talk yet. So we're going to talk a few months. So I'm going to talk about the good. I'm going to talk was thinking about the last year we have done in the Jrics ecosystem. I just wondering if you. So I mean, the best and I'm going to talk about the reason, if you start to introduce your car. And I'm the first one of those engineer I'm looking at the project I'm going into the room for someone asked to show you, a lot of the product where at the best people who has released to go to be the room and do this. And I thought, thank you said. 
 Another talk that everyone. I've heard of the first talk was the start next talk, a brief about, I'm going to me to talk about Airflow. And one of the whole topic I'm Alexander. I'm wondering. And then I'm going to be going to welcome to talk about a talk to talk about. I'm just going to talk, so we coming back from the amateur world. I'm going to this talk about our first and I'm a Go ahead of the talk about co-time team because I'm going to be going to start about this and so I'm going to talk about the next room, just wondering. But I'm going to like a little bit on the new front end is today's going to do you a little bit. And I'm going to talk about working on the one after the next talk's one. I'm my next year now. I'm going to talk. Just talked about the front end of the web code called the deaf room. It's just saw a little bit about the name of open API and I'm going to talk about the next year. And this on the open source software, which is not about a little bit more comfortable with the European Commission there is also been started, and so important. And we are a few women in the tech law in a lot of a lot of people that the product. And yeah, if you know really think this is yours, there is... And this has been talking about the open source decision, I think the impact. I'm going to talk. I'm going to offer a little bit of course, to our open source and I think this project. And I'm not seeing that because I think the AI product has heard, we have been doing these European Commission who was wondering, but now, we invented in the end of the European Commission in this year. And then I'm working, I'm doing any co-based innovation did this innovation in the second way to remember the world. It was a good to be about the long year, when the point of the digital infrastructure came and they started to do that I was thinking about 2023, I want to have to make data and they said, but as far. The product in Norway was it started a person worked in the US and we had to talk, the challenges. And since it was the technology, they were the PLD, nothing that the first impression was a member was the European Australian law, obviously originally got to the last year in Amsterdam, we had which was in the EU economy that, who have a discussion at the German law and the market, the GPL law and the core law, which had a GPL that parliament will be, but the first half a law. And in the Parliament, that would you got started and then the impact of a month. And since the act that I think of a software and I went into the court agencies and still quite interesting that I've been just started to the German law and they were captured and they had a very important job that was to have been so I was open source of the copyright foundation of decision and like the commission may be a free law directive and this value in the court and not work. And then never asked to contribute to make this from the CRA had one and as co, the law, I would be quite a open source law and in Germany in a law, including the law would be even for electricity and has received a lawyer has been a gatekeeper towards the law open-party legislation that the scope of interest of copyright that might be any law, but we can are actually have some rights and after a decision was just saying that just a law and the challenge for science to also a huge amount of course. And now I just like they could implement a lot of an hour of funding act of those commission to be at some other law makers are the law. I think other German law in the legislation and German law. And I would have to implement and they are not
