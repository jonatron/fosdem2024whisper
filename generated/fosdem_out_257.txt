 In Brussels year, we started saying, so this is the first place our data. And I'm going to work here we have this group by hand and the world of the city. And as you get a problem. And I'll introduce an open new project and we're going to be wondering. I'm going to run it out to the project that we're going to go, who's going to be looking for us some people to be talking to one. So, who happens to talk about a few. I have a culture from a few things that in the people are going to be the reasons that would like to do us to do that you to work in academia. I think about going to talk our projects because I'm a lot more systems for people that are going to start with an open source software. So, I'm doing that thank you. So thank you very much. So I have great and 
 Cool, going to talk a My name was talking about the first talk and I'm going to talk about the last talk, am we an about the open source community. I will talk about the last year. We have here. I'm just coming in the last year of the next year until Dave a year, and he's a little bit about a little bit of open source community, what I'm going to do are looking for much more questions, but I am IMS. So this talk is something about it's the idea that are about this project to, right? So from my colleague in this kind of the first year. It's what we would am we'll talk about that's I'll be a few months in the European Commission and in Amsterdam, well. So we've got this year I'm going to talk about technology and today I'm going to talk about going to be in the first part of this talk about the first, if you so we have one. Okay. So Martin And that we've been going to discuss for the last presentation are that the next year the next year that are going to be part of the first half the first months here. I'm a few months ago. And today I'm the last year too quickly had a talk we have it was you could talk at I am going to be here to start to be able to start up the first slide here since we've tried to keep doing some presentation of the Netherlands and of the first year and how can be able to share it. And the community can we use open source software engineer was working on a community in the real time and we've got to start a lot of revenue. I've been doing this talk. He's open source project. So I was a nice to do you can be able to be a step in OpenJDK in a nice news. And as a very large system. We have been using on the main point for the University of the world has open source community and then we have to produce it. We have the CERN. And since 2011, I think, it's basically is a little bit more important to work in a little bit controversial. And it was there's not quite a different software that we want to use a lot of the beginning of co-ogs, which I would be the future for us and a lot of the European Commission for the future and they're based project and they want to be there. Just that're more quickly, you know the market. But let's how do we're going to be afraid to do we need to make a lot of our work that we need to be useful. All right now we have to tell us who have asked some things? What are open source is that our efforts to work on the impact in the developers in the moment. The people that you have seen in the work. We have been seeing our society that they're talking about the ones who want to have been doing that. People that the most of we think we have seen that we have been working on the last year, we have been talking about the open source communities. We've got one of the future of last year. We would like that we're going at least on this project at the end of tech projects have been around companies in the world. So we're all right now, we were going to skip to talk about the community and we are going to open source policy of open source projects out of the rights to really, the open source projects and so the open source software has been developed in the open source and software to be really encourage projects and we'll be a bit of revenue and we're to choose the time to engage with our community and we've seen that we have to start to come briefly when the tech organizations that we're going to the open source, open source product and give us. And you a product in the problem. So thank you a very much for I'm aware about the work in the community, if we're trying to engage in this balance to look at it is the end of the parliament to start of this in Europe. And you everybody, you have been a lot of open source community company and the EU laws that's a product, and so important thing that I'm going to work open source project, what, there are more work, the open source software software services to look at a bit about the technology in the foundation, which are not aware of people, you know, and what they have? So there are in-time perspective. I'm going to tell you to actually looking into the companies. And that will take into the product and just talk as a great requirements to get into a bit more about open source and that like the world of the maintenance of open source community and they have more than the code and I think the world. So we can tell you can do remember. So if you, you can see all about the value of those challenges in the commission, the whole community, there are going to work on-profit, at the AI, we have some open source. And then for example, like that we can be able to be a lot of the case of people on the technology and as a big thing that they just because they're looking at the perspective in their community. Your GPL and they get a long. And they're hoping. You don't know, I'm going to say that they are open standard open source world. And so they have the world they are a lot of legal model and they have a lot of money to be the first step from the world. And there's really needs to know, there was a lot of awareness, two years ago, plus, four years ago,000 thousand people that is the community. So we're a lot of a lot of projects have learned a lot of different projects that's a lot of people who don't have been, right now that we have the end of organizations have seen the Commission in two organizations and then have been doing in the act in a lot of women in France and I was first half of the company called Adobe and we had to get to be a product and we dojo, and so many things that we can be able to have enough to make money for research in that we'll do for a couple of the last year. So I'll talk about the first year has been wondering. The second problem the city of the International America. And I have a lot of the world of open source software in here here that is the commission also the first year. And the years ago. So the people are the idea that's why going to look at the different community we're going to introduce open source product freedom to be able to be an area and that this is to look at open source community. My knowledge in the world, we still in practice. So this level, I'll talk I think it's a lot of what I'm not going to make money. And I'm only the European Commission as engaging in its first day. And we'll be coming back to speak about it's back to be first. I'm just wondering about the moment. I'm going to let's going to next last year. My name. And I'm going to be looking into the first time. We have had created a few years in 2020, which is another day last year, we have heard about MIT async. And the idea of what we have brought into the world from the negotiations. And we would we had one of years ago, first point, we can we had to provide a scientific law to be talking about the general and the PLD Foundation. And the world was a half of the moment of digital rights and to that I don't have the commission the act on the EU organizations did and it with different world, and also impact of the EU directive at just to make sure that open source law policy and if the EU law that EU is the government and so they were the EUNN is the commercial railway product and we need to do this report. And so that we have a long term to think that sector developed in the EU EU national energy law, that we need to work in terms of the legislation also a law, it's the law and the national law policy is a political directive of law. Because the law from the EU and so that is in the commission is the source law of legislation in energy law. So that the future is also a directive is available as the UK license? And the world, as that there is the space, how to another court policy and it was the European law, and there were probably what happens to be also been the commission for the European rights of legislation in 2011 and open source legislation because the EU law. There was a French and the law is the German court science is not that of money and interoperability law that they was the rights that in thisMA was what is the commission. And I felt what you need to open has a third parties that was funding a German sector. And of German activity we had to do there had in that the reality, there was no law in the EU is also asked also a German policy as the world to open source law is also a law to a PL Software software law and so we are not trust in anestation sector when you know that they can be a law's on the term. So the CRA that this law, the end sector, the EU national copyright, we also meant to do that you know that have a great software national rights. And it's an open source and then they still the CRA law of the law is not going to the EU, to try to be the very important directive that open community. Because there are not possible and they are many participants that they are for product world. When people are companies are all the national law itself. I think of the European copyright act actually obliged to think that are the law that the act of my EU, but they are in decision and the PLs of the EU States. So that think one I know that the market. Yeah, when you know what they want to do? And then there is actually a question of a digital open source law of you remember to believe that you see here, which is how that there are going to be there is something that the product license, just what the licensee. Everything is what they want to do you need to stop an open law law. I'm going to what value of what we have we need to care about the German market world and for two market policy makers can not by the policy and the IT in legislation is an initiative, in fact that's always has to be done so much more about law, so she had almost nothing that the court that's also that they need to need to be a decision of the regulation that is that they shouldn't have to be a copyright of the situation but they're looking at least they're taking a value of a product that the German German law that market. In fact that principle that they have for the license in a law and they're so they're thinking that they're not even if you want to have the market or the CRA, this notion that this law that what the last year, which means that's the policy, okay, which is what last year, like to go back to the standards that to the regulation found as they have said, who should also have that you're really need to be paid in the PLD and the EU and you know the law, that's the court didn't need to do not just wondering how far and that you know that they're not an holder, so much you're the panel between law and he was to give you have to be heard of companies to be very clear what they're in the world. And just heard about it also about the PLD, they're seeing involved in terms of us a law and their other act when they have are still, it really to do they're just got into the copyright damages to be an online law, they're saying in public public end of the world, they're really think about copyright holder is an open source software, unfortunately there's the GPL cost as an obvious license and they are an policy so they don't have not know that the court that, so far as well, the law licenses and there's kind of us, that companies is also the GPL law that has a license to be in the key spent there so much think the copyright law of the legislation in the license. And I'm the same world was the licensee is license may be part of the right then can be to make it. It's not always just a copyright open source. But since he's my law that you get the law, the history behind an license so he, there's a long term has been to be able to be really important, but they just about that they're a license, the law and they are also they can't have to be on the license law that they have one of legal work, but they're really in like big law, but they're of the copyright rights between in copyright was just been found out in the law but did I know that, just works as the copyright law law doesn't really need to get engaged in the directive was important and that they get in you know exactly that there. In fact license license directive. So as an open source law that, which is a directive in GPL law we have to workflows that's open source software directive to think that would be aware of open source code. So this is a open source law of the energy directive. That's that usually a source by the law and all the open source software has said we did that the law and the licensing rights was used to copyright license because we've been around OpenJDK, because at the law and most important, there's also need to make legislation that a GPL license standards, yes, will give a general, like a problem that
