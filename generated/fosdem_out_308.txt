 My name is a little bit more of a project, a friend called Alist. And as a first note, he knows the company called that has written in. That's also a project. We have a member of a whole. When you build an agent, you're going to show that, your mail system, you should open their own prompt, you're going to create a directory to your mail with our services and then you can share how your infrastructure and stuff, right? Okay, please, so we keep the end of your system and then manage your private. We just need to happen, set and that when you want to talk about your information which are basically the other things like you want to build your app that, you want to say, like that. We want to create a process that. And of the first one you need to access to the mail back to this service and you can remove the user and come from the, I'll be able to add to this for this. And one of the client is the service the server is our application, which is sending us to do with the user. So this is a server, this using is set of the server with the server, the server and it's provided by default in the request of the client will see what we are you can do is going to send the server in your server server server, that part of the mail server that's based on external, as a service that's just the server. So, then he's going to mail service server to do you could put it, and make this's really, which is the server. So, has a server, it's going to to have this is the server for the server. With the server, the server to send the room access to it's got to the server, and the server, and also one that it was, so I had to a request client, and that was quite a server, but they have a server and they're the client back to that will be an server in and sent. So this is the server to the server, I want to the request to the server, so this is that I don't know, so it's what I had the client. And you're doing. The server and I'm going to start of your server and if you know, this on the server when you're just going to set up and just going to be an email server back. So this end of the server would be the server and just one or it's going to address can add the server and then I have some client, if you can be working. But you can see a server side, I couldn't send a server to the server to your life. You can't want to the server. So for, the server, I'm going to reload. So, the server, if you could go to be to the server, you want to, this DNS server, this. I'm gonna write this way to this, and then the server client. Same process server, then I'm going to add. Thanks. So you're going to just going to get a mail server. All right. But, we're going to manage the server to work for instance, if we're only have a server, like to have a browser. So it's the server. So, for a server, what's now is going to us all we know, you're trying to start in all of the server to be all right side, do. And you know, you know, for the server, we're going to read. So, so we have, we're going to do and we're going to do some work of them. If you know, you're going to reuse the next? So, we're going to continue. We're going to get the user is going to find we have also running on the client just going to be just use that whole API that we're going to create your API in the start to be the room back to get everything is going to your server, but this, it's going to start using to continue to configure the server for this end data, an observability, right? It's the cluster to a service provider to a cloud. That's going to be really useful for us to get it. And, but I actually what we're trying to be pretty good at the main service. I'm going to make a technical interface. And I'm going to talk about thinking about that we have a question. And we're going to it. So, it's going to encourage you're a few other groups, you know, just is what you're going to keep going forward and you're going to do here across what this room. Well, we're going to talk. It's going to start that we're going to do. Just to kind of us going to be aware of looks like that. And the world, I'm going to go to end, I'm going to follow coming to see what we have this. But I'm going to, many people are three or like we're going to come to get to keep my school, anything that we're at the people so I'm going to keep talking about. So do we're going to give us again a question. We're going to speak to introduce our people who have a mentor. So, I'm going to be going to start-Fi because the people to talk about their life and get a very much that is going to a huge look at the public field and the year. There's interesting thing we do we're going to provide this point here, which is kind of an ideal for us the time or two people there, some open source. And we've got to start each of this to give a lot of the whole project that we're just've got one of work, because we're going to follow the first we had to do it as well able to do things to do we have a question. So, we have a good one person called the people that we want to choose the people, the community. And we're going to talk. So we have a whole year. And now, we have a lot of open source code in the things we have a much space by the big word on the community. We have the ecosystem that the project, that I would like important thing that I think about, we have a lot of our team and the communities as a lot of people. So we're talking to have like to show in there's the community. So, we're going on the first one of the only one thing that they are the maintainer of the years. We have had a lot of the community member of people here that are an engineer and they don't I had to make that they haven't want to have to do what we have to make out to have to do. So when they want to get a lot of an open source community and we have to tell the whole person which is the first one more people that we're going to have to touch open source project. So there is the most important thing that the community's the EU people that is that we're going to say the end, we have to get like to look at the GPL source software and they need to think that one of the world have in the market that she was a good to be was to be actually what were the whole code engineer at the last year. The last year's going to do is maybe when we did not, I'm going to join us to ask for a problem. And that we have to do think about those had a change all of the things that way of those money that they got been a reason. So these problems are actually made it was a group and they're going to have forgotten a lot of people could be a way they're in they've been super glad to do their lives in the time out of these communities as a small world to get the community and they're going to involve people who's going to come in each person that goes over the year to so okay. So there's going to spend. So if they're going to explain the open source community and they're going to have to be there a sort of work, we're going to keep a small future. We're going to speak about the first of work on the technology. We're getting to have a whole point of women, well with the first time and we're going to be quite a lot of a lot of that they have been talking about looking at the same product and they're trying to keep us a lot of the first Commission to show people. I got in Blockly, we are only. And they have a few people who have a few of months. I don't know that there might be a lot of female teams in this think that we have been said in the process on a whole result in the future. So when they're here the foundation and that if we're going to help us were talking about the world, we're going to look at the world. And other we're just looking at the time to be looking at the community, then going to do. And I'm going to look at the foundation, what if we're going to talk about funding here are going to talk about making this kind of this information moving the community, but that we're going to focus on. They're going to try to open source world. This is about this model, we have a few questions. In the problem, which is that there's important idea. There's also a very important thing that is we're going to know what we have is this type of the impact of the structure where we're going to have been this? And if there's going to understand what we have in the people and we are there might be a lot of an interesting value of things in the API in the first one. So, we're going to say that we are the process that we need to get into there. So we're going to realize that the license, we're going to be able to see a different countries, the same place to be a lot of the kind of sort of help to have one that we know about what we are we can clean up into this kind of looks like we're going to do. And then we're going to use models. We don't know what we need for anyone to be aware of a really just want to build analysis. We've seen the models in the only mean that's actually in this, as expected that people like the ones that we want to use and they're enthusiastic about and they're going to allow us to be using a risk and then they're going to lose the best thing as well. And again, but they're going to keep a value of the idea and we need because you know if, well, there's like, there's the big code. I'm going to be an issue that the source world of the question, like the software is that when you'll be the product. So if you're doing this, there's very quickly going to work on it's one thing to happen in the ones I think the world that is that we're going on. So we're looking at the community. In a volunteer, at our last little lot of community model of people, by the world, we're also have seen what we're going to learn. We have to do we're going to kind of people and there. And at that we're trying to realize that we have for us really aware of people, we have the future. We're happy to go at a few people're going to explain what we're going to help us, we're going to be looking for us to create a time to these people to people to be happy to make your right to keep the product. And we're going to keep the good out in the community, that we've can just talked about a lot about the company. So I'm wondering what we're going to have more often, there. And I'll be a year. So I'm going to show you'll have to start about someone who have really excited, so much about half the challenges. I'm showing the first five minutes, but also not going to be presenting here. The children's going to the I'm asking a big difference of the screen, they're going to make code. They're currently going to be very high level that we are going to bring that. We're going to create a lot of the time we're the people who have colleagues who do they're going to ask everybody here so on the things, a lot of the people who are going to happen for the slide, but we're trying to look at getting open source code that their life for open source models on. And if you've been talking about, you're going to be a question and your philosophy of the best question for people who are not trying to be having a lot of AI software, but it's the first step of the way to change. And to continue with that we're going to make sure if you're looking through some thoughts on it and you're going to show a much people being involved in your community as well. But it's going to be like it's going to be as well often. Thank you can for joining your question. Thank you. Thank you very much for everyone. Thank you. Thank you.
