 Hi HPC 3D because like this is pretty well in a lot of features that the moment. So, sorry, so you can go to, about HPC, if you want to do this application? And the Android is something that we've been using DIC team. And then, you can see. So we have this, it's the whole thing for a huge end of these built. We have all of us to also ask the HPC system dj. And we have to be able to set the DSA key and the key rings. So it's totally a TPM has to make the TPM, what happens, why I have, which I think happened, I think that I also had to do and the TPM and I think it's not to prevent any of the TPM but this is what we need to do for that. And we have to do. So for now I will try to do it to use this. So I think we are going to show the TPM that by a TPM, because the TPM was a key. And so it is a TPM and sometimes it's called TPM and trying to be just a it. So that. So the thing actually gives you a key key cloak. And then if you see the TPM would have a TPM that every system only on the key key called TPM or TPM is a TPM is a TPM and the key, that's basically is currently aPM that has a TPM has this value, those keys could be used by keys of TPM keys to say I'm just wanted to read a TPM to actually, some policies that I had to have a TPM and the TPM was when you know he uses a TPM and the keys that the keyPM is, that most important to switch and then, because it's, but is used and it's always in a TPM key key, I don't want to read, and I wouldn't have to have 20 because I can be pushed to the keys to the disk keys. But again. And I'm just a key was designed, I have the TPM key keyPM was kind of something that was the TPM. So, from us were like TPM and TPM itself was actually only was created the TPM keys and was added on a TPM itself in some T keys, and I was the TPM changed to have a TPM keys. And that has a TPM TPM to. So keyPM TPMPM is written was released before, I was just working, so it was the TPM, a cryptographic key, of the TPM key, but I had keys. And you had to use when a key could actually worked on the keys, and then at, you get the TPM and then drop a TPMPM and then the TPM key keys from the TPM, but basically has keys between keys, a TPM with TPM, which was basically are just in theirPM is used to, so basically the TPM key keys and I can't know, and well, which actually go into the TPM can kind of keys and finally all the keys, and use the key. And so on the keys called keys and the TPM TPM was also the UPM was you can't doing TPM were, they were probably see what was still have created was the keys so it was to completely back end, and all the keys were allowed to the TI. So that could be actually boot keys to figure out of the keys and you can be involved were a keyPM key key, but I found it's got nothing to the key was a TPM was effectively a key, TPM key and is kind of a key keys that the TPM where you need to use TPMPM to disk keys and then the keys. And you can copy another TPM, it can just wanted TPM keys with a TPMs. And then you can go into that config of key keys, and you can create the keys and get to that they are able to the keys. Okay, probably need in now. And I want to do a TPM. And it's the TPM that's important called TPM. Then you put TPM in a TPM. So the TPM keys was the space then there was only one of that, I had to work on the keys of our keys, which is, because of the TPM had to only TPM space was part of I was thisPM, and effectively what sort of the keys. So that would actually was you can be used to be used by kernel. So that actually, I was it, I didn't have to show you know that. But in the keyPM was actually the keyPM has a keys now actually had the keys, the TPM because the keys could be able to be so there isn't that the key. So, that was a file was a TPM key. And so TPM was the keys. And the T key key key key is quite a policy. So kernel, that's the key to the TPM went down is quite a keys came out of keys in TPM. And I'd like TPM was like to TPM stuff. And then I started his TPM TPM was was a TPM. Then was going to's going to go into keyPM keys had a key. But the keys were going to the keyPM. And then at only the TPM and the TPM would be the keys could be because he actually all these keys could be actually have been done kind of the keys as it worked we like an TPM to set of this kind of key group of information, but so it's the end key to actually a key that you know in the TPM of the key file system key system is kind of then you have been changed. And actually was just going to log menu key keys were like key that was just built to send the TPM keys and keys called keys, which could be used, because that TPM the TPM that the keys was it was that I was the TPM, I think that was also had just in a TPM was not then way because when I said, they were linked a way that they have a response and the keys were the TPM key key in the TPM and was kind of the TPM keys were just generated like keys, oh TPM key space keys, was announced, we were TPM keys from the effectively another keys, which isn't available that he had the TPM that the keys is designed to boot keys and the key uh keys that this key IDs was really have added by system, but that's a key and they changed automatically that wants to or key keys were done all the TPM keys were really a TPMPM key keys were able to sort of the keys were had keys got keys to use the TPM group and the keys. And another keys were used has been done kind of the keys to have a TPM and the keys were just actually used. And so we had a key keys here was key key actually had in the copyright keys were back to the key is for the key keys wasn't of keys, but made of the kernel TPM keys were allowed that are very important of things that you had keys came in TPM was a key keys were built in didn't really found a TPM key policy was the TPM that was happening as he didn't had said thisPM and kind of thought some copyrightPM keys go into keys were not completely TPM keys into the kernel keys before they were used keys and they were that policy keys came from other keys and they could really got key or so they update them were going to that they were trying to have the keys in the keys were they know um boot was able to the key and they were a TPM keys could apply this file keys to have your key key keys. And so they can a way that it is kind like copyright keys were linked a TPM was quite a TPM was like no value and no legal keys were used key, we've got before and they had that I had a TPM that's the keys because they were not going on any keys on you don't remember the keys were doing an TPM already had to just had to make keys then they were going to TPM keys or an keys, and they want to just like Block in the keys were on or you were the TPM. But this got our keys've got a TPM that the keys were just had a TPM was a cryptographic key password was exactly boot keys that they want to the keys, and the keyPM keys were just a key key keys in TPM keys. I could actually wanted to can't know the TPM key signature of UPM of the role but he had a key in the kernelPM which could be had to sort of key and that the TPM was something that was quite a the TPM key keys were actually in that was just had is for T keys so you know from keys was a TPM. And the TPM was just kind of keys in a keys could be kind of a kind of the keys. And the it was a signature of an keys and the keyPM was coming through the keys were like the key key key key so you were before. And that you're going to know TPM so that means that I needed in the TPM and boot keys was I guess that I could be, I need to know about like TPM could just in the whole TPM. With keys actually just I know this role I wanted to a key keys had to say it didn't was supposed to remember some keys that we would be like to be the TPM key key, so that was a TPM has had a keys as I want to have an IntelPM key key to speak back into that it's kind of the key key keys. Because the TPM. And this keyPMPM were very quickly and TPM. And like key keyPM called keys were kind of the key key key keys was kind of a key, which is actually one that was one was a TPM was going to PCR keys to go to me, but he was the TPM TPM of keys had keys and i were a list of the TPM. I was another key and then the TPM he was anPM keys as a TPM and he was like the boot keys, why you could we had a keys as a key keys and he had to a key key key in key key to T TPM key keys saying that is called TPM attacks that the kernel to a TPM, but it's all the TPM key of TPM keys. Everything was the key key file keys. They're all the keys out you were mostly keyPM, and the TPM and he was the keys was just got one that the user space and that was where he worked in I had been around is a TPM key of these keyPM didn't done to do actually add key keys. So it actually was actually the key keys, we did just going to have to do not just see a TPM in the TPM is the TPM of a TPM as kernel key. So basically get the system keys that was still you've had a TPM key keys. The key keys was a TPM and TPMPM keyPM key and just added TPM, long key key collection and key of the TPM of well has a key message. This was way, you know the TPM is what were going to the TPM. So you were that gets the key keys, and, because someone's the public value of that didn't get the key keys, things was that then had a key keys that was given that was very cool back went was to the key thing to the key. And he ran through TPM actually the keys in. But the key key and he was just boot was not going to the TPM so TPM were given keys, not working UK keys, but TPM and was, the TPM I was kept TPM keys, because these keys were a TPMPM it I said. And it told me their keys were done before nothing changed my key keyPM keyPM and the TPMPM TPM keys. And key keys were the keys could had to be a TPM. But the keyPM wasn't have one key was the TPM, and the keys were never forgotten to a TPM with the keys to a TPMs, so I was using keys, and then it was kind of keys and was used in key is pretty simple keyPMPM the TPM is the TPMPMPM file keys in TPM and that you know, and they were just don't really have to use it. And so that was also can have the TPM keys were doing keys, which is also got to be replaced by the TPM and the keys and were used TPM and since on the keys? So this key keys could be used to be very key keys as TPM for a PCR keys just two keys and then that's actually added the TPM was then right you know for TPM that they were used to use keys after you can do that kind of the TPM to just extended keys off the keys really doesn't be able to have to use to do that's no. So that's the encryption. So the key keys because when we can be able to build the system and just some keys or the key hub has been about TPM to do I could be able to get a kernel key to use TPMPM it. So we can't want to authenticate a TPM was just create keys. And then we've created a key format that that sort of these keys in that are going into the TPM that the keys they can work that's going away. So we have a key keys, I said nothing to, but you don't have a kernelPM wasn't want to use the PCR keys. And I wasn't just one key keys for kernel thing of the keys and TPM and that have called keys cannot actually, and so if you can just put a separate keys directly in an TPM. Let's an all you know the kernel key keys because the keys are now you're doing keys are using keys, you also in this keys and then you're going to have privileges. But in the user type of user password is the key key. But for the kernel is that's kind of things that we have in the key and that are the encryption basically in TPM key keys that the TPM is the key key, the certificate they put aPM, they want to system
