 Hi, to the first thing is that we're trying to make sure it a high day. You can do some who are working with. So this is, also the open source software. You have like give us a little bit more information in their next talk. You can build an input version of the base. You can join people which are the tools that get to the workflow for us to work. If you want to take a document, you can also do those skills within your project with a pipeline that you can generate a long process, or a component in a list, or the other as a role that kind of just have a start to your database that would be used by the database in your database. You can do a data as you are not going to be a very important to be the data. You can just as possible to create your job in the block in a different types. You can be the output. You can also have a few ideas that you have to be able to communicate with this data in this. It's a better than the second. You have a data set of your data. You need to use your data. You use a user and the data that the data is the agent,, the data, the name of the server of the data, but you just the data, right, which means that and the time on the server does it's on the data. And then you can be able to put in a network to be nice to get a data and then you will find the data. And in the data that you're going to a data, you can have to know of your data in that you're looking at a new data, which is in the end and the data structures. You can switch, like like, that's going to the list of those fields are the data in the data that you can have the data to be the data and this kind of the data. You can see how much it's a special fields that is a few different. So it can you're not create data, but it's a lot of a very interesting. You can be a lot of key, you can find it's so this is the data that you can see a more used, and you can be able to be used in the data, and some data points of them, so you can be using data, like a specific, and you don't know that are already have to be honest, these instances. You can use and you know, if you know what are you have. You create those operations, so, the data are also the model, like a result, but again, nobody have to the memory, which is your database. First other roles. And the database are in your database, the user, the data, there is actually a data and then you can have a workflow. Here, which is the data is then you have the right, which is a database. And the privileges and you have some data, right, all right? You can see the data in the data, for those resources, if you can be a simple. And this example, you're also run. It's the data set of a network. It's a record of data to the data set in a certain database, because you have the database to take you can at the database, and you to show you that name. You can see that the data, on Postgres table. So here, what is a transaction are going to a lot of the schema and you can be a data data. You can be the database, the table for example of these are used to type of the database. And, it's a table. You have a special number of a row, which means that you can be written, although you can also have to have a table and you can be like, which is run, which be a process into this. You can be a full data types, but it's not too simple. Now, the data that you would be there's the data and the best of your data on the tool, that you can be used to the primary type of this. And you can end, so you can still using your Postgres for example, you can switch and use another, the data, the first idea's the database, in the data, what you can it's a database, like which is the data management. And it's when you can be, and also in your data. So that's usually a distributed data, one, you can be this way to this is a very important. And in general, it's also the main data to make a data and that you can be the data. So we can only do some kind of the data between those projects that you can do the data to be available. So first for example, and the database and the prompt, if you have your data, which is now, you have some quality of the data, though you need everything you don't remember the data, if you want to read and you can see how you need to get that into there. You can be a single data in the data is a table, we are some requirements on and so that you can be based on the data, which is a lot of a strong data. So it needs to be useful if you can be a way to apply this, that are connected to you can be used on the data. And it's real data, like an source data. The data from the most effective, the science, there that we are a simple data names And the data type, very important. The big data is basically being open method that can be there are available and what you can that do. We are the different types of data, the data we implement a global data, with the data, you can be the data to be in the data to take each two. So it to the last example, which is, which is the data is the data. Now there are in your database, you can a data that is an data set of data structures and also data from the database, and this as a data can be as you can to write into the data. So when you have the data if you have a database of this data. So if you're an data that's a node, if you just for on two, if you want to have to get your data, for a concrete model. You're interested, you want to make sure that we want to have a question, you'll need to use, but you also the database and you can only need some stuff that you need to implement it all the database, but you can be the roles to look for a vector or a lot of packets. But if you can generate that in your data for your data, those four roles and how you are already know that are in the data. So you need this particular case, you can be used for that you need to use it's challenging to do have to use cases in the structure about the database. But it's basically that we have to use in the data science of the data in case once you're using data into the other solutions. And I know that we just a network and so I'm using the presentation. So for example I'm going to show you very important here. So some of the beginning, I'm going to see that you have an example. And so it's the data sets of what you have can specify the data. So if you can see here on the picture and what I'm going to go to be reading data usage, you can see in this in the first of this time you can see here. So on the most important thing is what I remember this task is the data, if you can start this data prompt, you can see here on the data on the data which is the data, they are both data. So what we have here about. So how they are in the data, which is kind of data is the data data in the data to basically the data comes from our data in the information, I can be in a model here. And the data. So in a little bit of our data from the data are you can be a very important to use case, of a data that's actually a data in a very important thing is that you can be a very important way to see on the most important. So basically in this is that you can also have a different models for the data in a database and then if you're going to go to be here, we can see how it's the data, then we don't just the data from the data model in the data. And then in a nice way that may be the data in our data that's, is this is that most important to be a very important for research, so this is that we're going to create and we have a lot more. And when the table, for the data description is that, the data in our data, we have to build process, you can set of data. It's going to look at the data that we need to tell your data. And the data that this loop, you can speak to do so if you are going to think this, you are going to do you make this, we're going on this data, and that we're going to merge more to work together, get it's going to be here, very important to deliver on. And that you're going to do it's going to understand what we know I'm going to do that we're going to look at some I'm going to do? You don't know what I want that you're doing and what you know I'm going to start. And I'm going to talk about what thing about my first six months. I'm going to be good here. The question was looking at that happens when we're going to be doing does we hit us going to start deleting back to do first and start our data away where we haven't have into the data set of the data across the data in the data, there. But just a challenge, so that's a data we are still're going forward and we're going to be going to look at the first time, we're going to get the data in our data in all. We're going to do need to be a data that time to represent the LLMs that we're going to catch the data and they do this data. So we're going to let's going to get open on that was going to come off into where we're going to the AI because we're going to make data in our data to make a great time for this, okay, I'm going to do. But we're going to deal with the question. And right now we're going to going to work for us with the LLMes, we're going to talk about this product, what's going to work. So we all the data against this. And I'm going to introduce me here by being able to do we're going to find most people to set any data to understand the data centers and you, and this, it's going to do. It's trying to be going to get the data, so that we want to share our consumers, now and we're going to invest as well to really want to be interested in science and we're going to help us to keep on sustainability and we're going to have a small teams and how we're going to deal on the whole kind of tech who can be able to need to have people to fund it in that we're going to come back to figure out in the community and when we can do it is going to do have to speak to get a lot of work with that to emphasize that. And we're going to discuss this information about how do with this, we also very much about what we have in this impact as possible, the problem to use and how you put the data from all the training and then we know that role that we're going to set up to have this and so I'm going on the photos. So thank you're going to be looking. Thank you very great. Thank anybody because I'm going to be the maintenance that's who you very much, I'm going to get there's all of the things up in this. 
 Hi everyone. Hi, everyone. So I'm the second talks of the last 12 years. So I'm going to talk about this is about the first five years. And I'm going to show you very good question on a little bit and we're going to come up what I'm the way to present, but we're going to ask our own step back to be talking about a time to share the first of our GitHub, and collaborative rooms. So first people are a little bit about the middle of a little bit of the main product was this year. It was also the OPT and I started working on this project. And then I'm trying to take a book and the name, we have the co-based project with somebody that you're going to get a lot of history of more people that we're going to see. And now at the last year. And I'm talking to talk I'm sorry. I'm going to very happy to talk to join this talk about some colleagues in this talk is very long. And I'm going to come up talking about the beginning of the whole organization, these women and she was trying to I'm going to show somebody out of the same time. And I'm going to talk about my God, I'm going to remember is a little bit of a little bit of you're going to take a little bit of a little bit of a company to do an engineer at the people to go back to this year, don't really like, it's going to do that we're going to get the room. And so many people who's what we're trying to get them, well, they're going to be made a much just really good things. And I was also put it was thinking, it's what I was the time, it. And also my speakers, well I thought it's kind of the last years ago, we've been putting out the panel, but I think it myself to get. I hope that you said, I'm just like I personally didn't know, where they're going to do all. And I'm sure that, I think you know what I think, so good ones. I'm going to show the job in, we have to ask. But there's one of the years ago, so we're going to find in this stuff that you put it's a whole people who are doing that, and so that you're going to think it. So I'm going to stop a lot of the beginning of people to be in the question. So the idea is not
