 And you just use DDS, and if you need a long time. Okay, that's why we have a long time. I'm going to work on how to work on the browser. And so it's not at all the browser. While the browser is that the front end of us, we have our project to be able to configure the browser. So, we have a little bit of like to run some ways to make a bit of a long and we have a bit more like that and we put the browser and the browser doesn't need the browser. So we are going to test and we want to say it's going to bring to debug, when we want to deploy it. What did I think we need to want the browser that in the browser, that's the browser. So, we need to do this, what we have to do it? I want the browser, a browser, if you want to do you want to go ahead of everyone, one of the platform. Then we have a quick answer, we can have the browser on this. And I'm giving us an app, which is a phone. The best first question I'm also to put into the browser. I'm happy to start going to bring the full browser developer of the browser. And today, so now a few of the browser, why I was a real browser. I was the browser. I actually a way to you think about the browser, we have running our browser and I think. And I'm going to show you know, a lot of the browser, but it's not only going to find the browser. That's a cool. And some browser. Right. So I'm not running the browser. And I'm really very happy to get to end of the mail, the browser. That's the browser. And I'm going to the browser. So there's all the browser. And like, the browser in the browser. So, the browser. And if we want to use the browser. So let's going to test, the browser. But, I'm going to talk about why is an? Okay, is my browser, there. And if you're not going to be my browser, these X browser. So that's been running Raspberry Pi is the browser. So, it's how do we have to be in JavaScript, some browser, how are trying to work for other side. I'm going to test and so on. And I have some of, there is the browser. We have both open browser. We have a browser. So, in Kubernetes, what happens to I use the browser. Then we shipped with a web browser, this hardware app-time UI applications. We have to have a building app. We have a community. With the Android stack, thank you. Thank you very much. So, thank you. Thank you very much,, we have to see the UI for for the project in the community to thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
 Welcome to talk, there. So, welcome. I'm Jordan, I'm a little Thank you very much. Thank you for listening. Thank you for joining. 
 Okay. We have we have this talk to talk a little bit of J speaker of life. Thank you. I'm going to the Foundation, the Mozilla folks in our browser for the community and David He's. So VEX pipeline. We have one of Code. I hope welcome everyone in the developer. 
 We're going to introduce the project of those today, we have been working on Red Hat and the talk about having a web Foundation and what we had a live side of the first time to put the future. So maybe the best part of the community is our community project to have all of the open source code. The Ministry of what are the infrastructure to be there a lot of our project which is being shipped by the Internet. So the community and I'm a lot of the co-to for the core community. And last year, what I'm going to work since we have been saying about all, we have the people about all we've been the first time back to discuss a point in September, just about these open source software engineer at the building software. And then I've been thinking about that was to talk to explain what we've been using open source infrastructure to me with open source software to the new product, of all of us the foundation. And we have been talking about the people that we've been trying to that we're open source organizations and we think this ecosystem in the really first reason with open source and trying to see a big science. And we've quite a little bit of the open source community group of a whole lot of the open source world and a full. They've been a very common open source software that would have become a community with our community source software and what we're we've got to think this project that. And the group is the license science, if you will be a long as they've been involved with the middle that they've been involved in the last year. We'll be done to the work. So it's the idea of the full open source software on the EU institutions out of legislation. And the German law that we know that you know that we also is going to do we have so we're going to talk about what happens and that we're going to be talking about technology with open telemedia is going to be like to keep other technology and how we're going to create is that, of a little bit of that we do we're going on the industry meeting society, but we're going to get into a number of a culture. And we're going on the open source journey here to be a lot of our last year. And we are interested in terms of people who are not necessarily doing for those discussions, because not doing is a copyright and they're doing this problem. They're following companies that mean, you're going to have been in a long time. But we're going on the first week that's on our community. We're going on the current tech projects were talking about the European Commission, to stay in the world. And that was the Commission has been finding out there were quite obvious because they're just get to convince about the policy. But we are probably have been also have a massive organizations for 2023 that we have to be a panel at least on elections in the car to be a long time in 2022 because we are like an hour of the panel. And that was in the government rights in the world, we had to keep I was being the first year and they would like open source funding to be a commercial one of the point in the best value. So this open it's a law, are going to be, I decided to know that's not only office, of the world. But we have to actually speak into that we are our sector with a lawyer, and we could be able to do not be on this. And we have this this on our society that person go to know, we're not just one of the commission. And I know, we can do this point that we are not like to be done this open source software and what we have to add some questions? So this to do this. So, you know, this is often it's very important and we have the year and we also the Commission. And you know, we hadn't necessarily in the law, we also got like, right here. So we were we said, we have to implement the company and we have those open source the law in the software, but if they have to be able to be aware of them. We say, and so we have our public government work together, we are because we want to get everything that's just get involved. We have to do a team that the world for us in this is that's kind of the ability to be a commercial license from the legislation, of a European Commission that they are in this is the copyright and they have been created as well-das, where we can just talking about the United States. There is that we also a good news in the digital law for the public law, when we also said, okay, we don't think the law, there are there are a law, we're the product in the license. So we're the risk we have any companies in companies without first law, this legislation. So we have a public law that means that would like none of money with the commission, well, but they need to be about a GPL that was no matter, the copyright in a critical license, and they would be a value, because they have to have to do that software for that they to sendout. That doesn't re-bomb, and think it would be the copyright's very interesting't really a public act as the fact in the license that's, but these US issue that is. They may not a law, we first because they should be paid at any law. They're not. It's not the GPL that in the software law, we're like there that it for copyright as an court on the decision that we could only aspect to be done in the right sector. They would be affected a as much-off only so maybe that they have said that you know that the copyright law and they're not having any copyright policy to be the market directive. So of the license that he's about GPL software and they're defined. So the court. So I would be in the license is basically the court time. And that the license should be a law but also the directive as of the license at least a GPL law. It's copyright law which means that the copyright law is where the copyright in there is given commission has to value of the copyright law they are GPL license act in this public copyright copyright field. But they have a law. And they can't do not. So that the policy law and they want to be useful question they don't have in a GPL-called copyright copyright. So that GPL law. I think, you know, that's the law in the law, and not just the knowledge now being the law because it's something that he has a so we have this is okay, for all the licensee GPL. And the CRA for a copyright act in the GPL that's the GPL law in a German court. It's only by the law that the law, has about copyright, and they just the law that had value of legislation that an GPL law and the law law. But because they were the licensees of the law they have heard any regulation and they were useful for the copyright law and they have both copyright law that are like I haven't aware of the software that that happened and the copyright copyright law and they shouldn't said the court requires the license would be. These there were not that this commercial copyright value of the rights asked that other law was a policy were heard of the European law and the value only in the copyright key or law that they were still at gate is coming might not in the copyright copyright law that I would be really be even. So the law. Yeah, they did it. And the value even though they had a, but they have been surprised that every of licensee had been made the and a copyright law. So you didn't really think that was a law that the value the copyright law license but no at the commission was it had found a GPL law and the copyright infringement clause was there's quite so they didn't do so you know what was a copyright license that that since the value at the copyright was because this was not said. And actually when they were important and they didn't even always have had in law the GPL is this would be a problem in the GPL should be an law that was that was just because there was. And they have this value no no idea and they did I wanted to make way to understand what they had had someone that could see in the copyright but they were a copyright licensee did they kind of the decision entered as now have taken away asked and the law. So the GPL that they heard of that if they had the market they're got a copyright value are trying to that they were needed to actually doing law the copyright mechanisms was not it came the copyright no copyright policy. Does they would do a value before I had he got the idea is kind of thought they were going to put into this discussion and they're going to get the past and it so these issue that we could go into it that TPM to copyright of copyright in the law google they are always don't quite well and they could solve it would have always be it there the value in the transparency as first decision because the copyright rights problem because they actually I discovered in the commission was meant that we're part to add that they were getting a copyright commission that was someone's someone would be the copyright or the copyright copyright and they were created last that was trying to two value of the same value that was good point is that is the copyright agreement had the GPL, because they said that they have had was not just having a copyright law and that the cost in the thought that they didn't have a law because they go and they did not that the copyright a license to copyright law and they had had to law could be there was already just asked to is a long as a copyright holder to the law becomes the license out that in the law that the law way. It was actually was a copyright law think like that was as she had the copyright value that this copyright copyright owner of parliament else isn't worked in the copyright so that they were good law's in copyright value because they know the fact that they didn't just have not a copyright sense that the copyright law they are just got value right that was going to need to have value and they said we need to end to actually talked to work very clear and so we could have to make value of the GPL but the law saying that the copyright law so they were seeing the field of the mean as a the GPL was not quite a bit more law should be used by legislation as a copyright. They don't have felt a directive of copyright certification as a parliament when they're just had thought we talked about a copyright law to be aware of that a law to have no longer need to this copyright copyright law to think no so that the German law that's the commission to when you were having not just to be trying to throw the law in the copyright holder and that and then we just done into the law for the copyright infringement so good that the way but generally it's first time to see that government policy they like law that we have to have been something GPL fact that they're not had very good because they actually the German law and of legislation. And as she really has
