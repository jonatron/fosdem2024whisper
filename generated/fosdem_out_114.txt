 Welcome to the first talk is the first thing of all the main thing that I see a bit of. Put the UI of the web browser. So you have seen the community that. We're just want to be able to stop the front end to find that the code about as you want. We have one. We have a little bit of a way to add a web browser and we're building a future. We want to say that's fine. So we have an important to start with the end of this library. We want to talk about the new code. And the documentation to try to do out to try for the video. But we have some of the work. So this is what we realized. We have a whole software is there to try to go to change it because we take to the box and we've got our API to go into this. It's kind of open source code and I just a small feature. And for example I've never going to look at the main thing. There's a lot of things that we've got at the one to the right and there. And there's something. So I've listed here are like I'm just looking at current version of the different but I'm going to talk to do that we can say we'll talk about there. I'm a little bit. We've seen about okay. I'm going to talk about like I'm going to talk about that are for a lot of the end up the end of people who at the way from the first place is the world. I'm going to go through this talk about the issue from the world of the first one can we hope that the scope of the project and the big issue we're going to give us having to have those in a better and I think the biggest talk from the product is all these five words and so you guys are looking for all the technical things in the systems. So I'm mostly talking about putting the same time I think I'm going to be talking of this is the topic. It was two years ago we did I've still using in the DBA. We have the first of the way the tool, we have to have we saw it. I'm just saw a good issue that we are in the compiler back to make anything that the people when a few minutes and we're going to do have. Just there's going to be a time to be the whole model that they're going to work on the whole product, but they're going to look at the team in there's going on the process of that we're going to going to be a lot of a lot of a very clear and the things that I'm just about working. I think that we've built on it's kind of the ones out of give people who had to be interested in the world in the right now, we're going on the work as I did was going to do that because they're using the next thing the first one of the kind of the tech to do we have to do that we have to make it. You're going to speak about the beginning of the user experience of the source community that were using the community. And we had to have had a lot of the money because you to work on the community is really we are writing in the people involved to make out. We've done the community and the way to follow up with us to the time, and we're going to emphasize it. We've been having a bit know about the community, who are talking to work on how you know that we've got on the whole company. The organization was made in the first one of the best product. That's the community members of the way that we've actually have been doing something that we know that people are kind of the open source community can see what we're engaging in a national companies and they're at once people from the experience that we're doing with me to build and they're in that they want to think there are there's these teams, how they're probably like just looking at that's really good job and we're the time? The kind of course in the community group and I'm going to talk about the community in the collaboration. And so quickly here we're moving back to thank you. Thank you my right.

I'm one of you a really interested in 2003 to run on the time first time to say I am just wanted to talk about the speaker, was wondering. I really a senior foundation of the back. I'mateurs from the first day, I've been working together and I'm going to present to present to speak about Matbia, how a little company that we've been talking about the university to talk for the second year. A couple of the first year I'm going to who's going to talk about the team. I'm just made a few years ago.

So I want to remember we're probably know, we have heard, we heard about the beginning of the first step in terms of us, the fact that I'm going to do it was just made from the license from the product that you know that from the previous one and it was quite a long term of the EU side of these years ago, the world. So the open source is made as the idea. So I've got to speak with the last one of the law that I was I found this talk, the EU in the directive at the future. And I was just because I think the world, this, just have been in those areas. And in the work was there are also a very active decision that you know what I like the issue.
