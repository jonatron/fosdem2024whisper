 Okay. Okay, I'm going to work with a specific question. So the answer is that there are the question is that the way we are using an update ID and how I think I'm going to use this type of the first iteration of the query that you have on your address some type of a user of that you have to have to replace this information because if you get the address if you want to go this and just write to the data points where it's slow and just pass it's going to be like it's interesting if the desly to do the way that has a user will be a struct and then it's just to get the object so it's because it's basically that's just a read to the function as an error in the fields that if you try to see that the same way to do a value or the string for a variable for a value like a result which is return and then just a value or a value to type to add this table like a string but it's very easy to an error for the query that type of it's like an error some value of an error and this so it's not generic string to this result but if you will save the table would say if a map then you already have any more like put this and you will tell the kind of the value so okay this is the variable how you might not that to a function that I'm going to have a table that object here are written and the result and the that's going to be actually have a different and why I'm the object to look at least go and if you just put the only the value and you can create a value to me and then you need to look on the deserialize for example you if you can't have this so that you have to go into that your object here's done in the same so I'm a variable like it's where the object to each result is like one which it is just run the CSV or one and then we have to stop of the files so on the desolver and it's going to have to put here if you have the if you so that it's going to have a table because it in here are right thing you get it's good for a couple more fields that we have the one which is we have also make a bit more use cases being used the type like markdown string to use it's on the number or maybe of lines and it's it's used and you can be and it's just a register and even to be some of course you can be able to be a lot of the same way this is not that the code that we can be cool to scale it's going to modify and the model is doing it has a lot of what the result is that we have the result which is going to have up so we have a lot of a lot of code we want to function is to do that we have this and to be given that in the first instruction space that we change that we have the example that is back the memory and we have the program so it's just the string but yeah we have a row and I'm going to match a number of the first one is the name is only one and last step, I just have four so we have to actually I have to show you need to define the two two four four so I'll be more details in the three different instructions of 200 five less I'm going to be I see here. So you so it's going to assume it's going to do that we have the five threads here that I'm going to be the number of the three or three thread that is from two attributes. Okay. And I'm going to be going to make this is one I'm going to stop on and one. I'm wondering why I'm going to be the time to talk about these things we have 10 or another and how to have heard about what I'm doing is it should be there. And this question was this one three or more or three. So this is my one? I just showing you I'm sorry. And I will show you for the one here, one. I'm just start using a lot with infinite function and the scheduler that these read in the input like the value that was sending kind of this before that's the code. And I'm going to kind of the same thing. I got to get my memory. So I don't have the one I'm going to the inputs until I'm going to show you the program, okay. And this is an array. So does it's going to go to add it to the end. So we have the query, I'm going to the table. So. I'm going to show you can go into the table. The key, I'm one, I can see the state, you get to do it's going to be able to the path. The time I have the kernel. And I'm looking forward for those kind of the table. And I'm getting a little bit about the new one that. So I'll be saying, my question I'm going to show that, okay, the question. I'm going to change the heap. So I'm going to pick a variable. Let's the file. I'm going to do that. I'm going to parse the file. Okay. I'm going to create a lot of the user to go in case. Thank you. So here. I'm going to create a client end of your account because I'm going to build the server. It's in the user's like the server, I'm going to start and here, if I'm going to encourage you're going to introduce a login extension server, I'm running in the client to go to come. We want to start to the server. And if you're going to see what I'm going to do is going to try to find a part, but if you're going to give a server to update the server, the client, you're going to just going to take a server part of an SDK for that's going to the client. And then we need to send an IDP's probably a server to fill out, and then not as a request on the server and then it also do it's going to the server and I can start using the server to be able to start using client, right. And once you can add the client, and click. Okay, you're going to end and so I'm going to enable the server. So from the server is going to play the server. And I'm going to show this client and I'm going to know this is saying I'm going to have the server. And then I'm just saying there. Okay, I'm running, I'm going to just wondering. So you, I'm going to show this is going to take a key to build a key, and that I just a password. Why do you about a client server. And the server and you can see the server comes into that already using, I'm going back to use time? So you talk about the server and what we're going to present. So if you are a server access to, we can put the server that they're even run the server. And on the application. So the server, the server is a server. We want to a request to create a server from the server. And in the server. You may bring it's going to the server user. And that is, you can see that you can run your encrypted service. And this servers, like a server, these is using the server server. And then run on the server and server's a server or and just run. And so that, there's available. And once the server. And now this is going to host. We can have to demo and to go on the server. It's, our server. And if you can we have the server server. And then we are kind of the server, we don't have one, if we are just implemented. We have the server is the client, we have something. It's the server, we need to have the SSH server to call the server that we have the clients and room. We're doing a client side of the server. And then the mail. We have to authenticate to the server. It's doing it's basically we want to publish the server. We have much some server, the services of course, we want to enable it the server. So, we need to get the server or we want to use the URL to add the server side, where the client's something that's the server, we will implement the server, but we want to do SSH and client that we want to build key, for a server and, a server, if a user back, if you would want to deliver the server. You can provide DNS and these client client service server that are able to deploy DNS, so that are in a application will not just connect to a DNS. If you have on a mail client is implemented in the server application. We have a server. So the server, for this is going to the server is an Open server server, all the client is the server service, why we have our server, we want to enter. We have your client server? We want to we can want to test event client, but we're going to have this out a server server server service or will be using mail server server has a server right? So you can to another client ready to the client side, but it's going to have to just a server API that work on the server, but if you want to plug-ardland server, more extension, so I want to let's going on. I have the client says, I will be our server in practice. Okay, this one server will share, right side server server is, I can already to boot command, what I have to make it. So there are the server, the server at the room. Some servers, I do, yeah. I mean, I'm going to make the server, I'm going to offer a server or a server, and get the server for example of the user application, what I want to boot it's going to configure server, and DNS server, it would happen. There's about the server to ship the DNS and then take the server in the server, for mail servers will then you. So, I would be able to actually showing you need to access to have this service that the server, so now I'm able to the server, in the request. They will need to be able to get it of the client and then. So that's like this, I add to send to do anything to client server. Or you just want to the server, the server for the server. And if you want to use this. That's the browser, the server management server to create some DNS server, you want is going to to be a client. And now, you just the server and the server server server. You, on the server or the server can actually don't build the server, well. Probably the server or other browser. And the server is missing on a server and the server client would pass server side. And in your server, like JSON server. You have to your server, that will not only offer of a client server to the event server. And there's the server. And if you can be for the server to client will going to user, which is already make the server in your services. If you're interested in the server. And you want, you as this future. That's still trying to try to do the same end. And the same server's going, so you won't want to stop the server. So you. But you can just have us, we're going to be ready to run, it. There's waiting for the server. And the server, the server. And then, we're going to just to have the server server to put and see the server. So you're all of now we want to specify the server. And if you have a server in your client there are going to end. So, the server. So what we need to start up a time to have to work on the server. So, you can do you have a server that's using on the server. And that side. I'm going to're going to start on the server. We want to see what I want to start up to explain this. So it's going to be you to start doing and keep this, and view. And to get a server. Just as I'm wondering. So what's going to run the server or the server up. And we change in the client. But once we have some open server, we're doing that we're going to install it like that you don't have to show you. It's a software working. And we want to think our server is a server interface a server. He's all that's going to connect to be sure that we have to the server. He has been up. And this is user might be able to give you want to the client user interface of the server. And if you every server. Just a server can see a server. So you can actually just read to send client. And if it's waiting to the server. And then you'll, you can see the staging and it's going to see it now, you can see the server. And these requests that's going to talk. It's going to send the server to the server. So it's not going to send this is a mail server. So client will close to have our server. That's going to connect to help us to your server to the service to the client. So back to enter the server. So we need to the server. And if you can run this in the website. So when you want to have this configuration server to do the server, we on the internet mail server, we have our client client server at the session. Let's going to the server of my server is going to have what we need to create over to know about our server. We just using one client server. It's not just going to a DNS server. We have some server. But the server server can do you're taking a server or certificate to have to make this room of the server. The attestation is the server. The server, the server. And if I'm looking into the server. You can be the server to call server is running server and server. And you're going to send the server and share the server. So this for a client server server is going to server. So, how it's going to it's going to request, if you can be easy to translate the server comes to
