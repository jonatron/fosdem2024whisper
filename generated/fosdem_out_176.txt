 Let's say that's take a whole name. But a second thing to give a very specific thing before that we had to see here it just a button that we need to play today. We're using Jans and we have some of us and we have that have a new call a signal from the second situation. We have this specific path and we have a bit of this one of the service which is a full of the bot and the other where we have to use it later a node to see that we also a lot of people from the data the left side and we also want to be able to do this in the data and how do we call a bit better and the data from our own project to actually going to join us. I'm going to be going to look like this version of the first time that we need looking we have to have to show us the best we don't get a little bit for. So this. I just a bit more like a bit of how we would like to have to do. So, if we are we talking about it's going to be interesting to we are so we have a template to give up with a few years ago. And when we have decided to go to our LLM to let's start and get that we were going to implement a little bit more better and we got in the LLM and we want to do some work with me and we want to discuss a good slides together on a new prompt we are going to try to have a seat to handle the best time but we have a good time to have to have people that we have like the right now on the information about our issues and this. But we want to show you can we're open source applications that we use the whole community services on to have a lot of our website and we have said we want to scale of those tools out. And we have different community projects which we should have probably need to have a topic and if we have more than the whole project and the question but we're going to think we want to stop and we have a and we want to make sure that we're also just going to start doing that but we have data making our research in terms of this with these small topic in IT community perspective in terms of our community we are we want to do the beginning of how many people can we are we're looking forward to do they have to look at all trying to make an organization and so far we have an insight to use these two different things that the first time we can be a question was open source in the EU community, in it's a lot of the good point around this the EU institutions's a huge issue. And we have a lot to be a we have better to make a small university first time and in the last year. And we have these organizations that I'm aware of the project was also in the community in our first time and our project for this case we have we have to put a couple of a lot of months to have been trying to ship in this infrastructure and and we also a lot of examples on that we have we have a lot of tech foundation into this of people from the challenges that the kind of these things we have the current CMSs and we have four people and they want to try to come to ask for the commission and I wouldn't know that we don't get a European railway team and we need the beginning of us about the money. And we have the most important ones that the CRA has been working over the European Commission's sort of the community. And the last thing I was to actually kind of an open source community of a few weeks. And we got started using open source project that we have had started in the community around a really had to spend a lot of like this problem to the organizations who are the product strategy now still a lot of the world and they had a way to the first time I said and so I think I said earlier is not always like I would like a couple of the community people a great open source and I said it and so many companies work again the people to make this was a lot of discussion of folks. So I think the first problem we are the last year, can be like I didn't do this is, there are like that we have been maintaining and we can be there's a problem, very important thing about the EU of the community and the world you know that would say let's the last year, a lot of the knowledge of people, and I got about the world and there was the time they're going on government, the council and the world. And I've been and they've got just had another challenge so we had to look at the co-day work and I could get at the day community and what was giving you were going to get to the IT and we had to keep about our political group and I didn't care about the community and the year. So I'd been going to give me a talk about what was going to me to tell the years in the whole point was people around in the last year. We'll be in the day during the last year. We've knew that we got time. So we're going to introduce the last year of the big ones are going to spend like a long week now. We've done in the room about some time. So we want to put some discussions in different types and I'm the time in this year at the best to try to go over the year at all of the time for them was very small year, we just got to continue to read a lot and talk to work and I was really wanted to happen to make everyone in the last year who was just been using the first year. And so we had a really seen in the very little bit into the panel and the process and then came to have the world. So this of the last year we had the year. And this is very, the years ago, we had also saw a lot really interesting things here in Ireland. And the last year. And the next year we did was going on the University of the open source community technology of science and in 2012 and that we're interested in 2018, the energy and we had a few months ago and we had. People did we had the I started to take the foundation and at the first year. The first year were just present open source code was about the co-time government and he had for the first big workshops I've had three years ago, two years of the years ago. I was introduced an last year and the day is how we had up a bit more than that was a kind of been used in the foundation. And getting a little bit of mine had this year ago. He was in a great story about almost six years ago. He was the 3 Association to get one of the month. And I was to have now I arrived this year. And I am that was wondering what was about the first just the first year in the sort of the PLD and I kind of learning about the University of work and he had asked before from the US and originally have heard to be that he had a really been kind of a lot of the end of a screenshot of people. He's mostly had to find myself before we were moving to run out of months. And I was at this is a lot of the parliament were doing it was just the good back to give had a software who were in Germany like a third year now TPM that I did he had been just began and the US 2019 and I get the commission in 2018, we had years ago and it took a successful a year to what I started and I was trying to like just been doing and I actually went into the past days we knew the weekend since we had a far after I started with a lot of this year I'm doing a little bit of the key was some of people were going to actually a small car and I had to offer for me on the FPGA in 2012 because the EU and he was thinking that was like the world he was like the US was like He was generally in a little story of all the next year was great sentence at the co-founder. So I didn't know the newest question was wondering me, so I had a lot of the Commission was in November 2022 in 2019, well they had this year we made in the release they want to reusing the slide because the last year was called the first time, we're open source year. But so we started the last year was able to mention it was a law that it was it was working since now a 20 years or no, really it's really at this project, they had a time for the best time at a long time as a bad company that and the TPM and they had to be able to make this open book. And they need to have an open source software and they had the commission was a scientific software policy is a small day. And they started a little bit as good idea that they were there were as a bit of open source projects in the license and there were a month I got now that the next year ago I had a lot of contributing from the European Commission TPM team from the UK law in the EU was working community and I was and this year, but still a bit of projects with a second year and I'd like the EU was the European Commission and they were in Germany were quite a really a number year in Europe were using FOS funding that were made in practice with the technology freedom and this software and they were organized, the final law. And just happening, well to be a half as a digital law that wasn't work in the EU license and of the directive in the rights. And if they've got and the law was very few of the EU directive because they were doing over the history was like that was released in a directive because they had this person that were in a successful in 2010 was coming on the first and I said I had to the market and I was wondering that had this was like I have to be able to find the way? So 2023, we had the challenges to make it was more or open source that we have been working between national law. And in the goal was not just a regulation. And he was to focus on this was the fact that we have been making sense from the US and we were just going to speak to work. I know what we had a point. So we can I was saying that over time we have, after, we didn't get some good concern about a couple of my open source software over now, but they didn't think they didn't really know it was, we had this like a lot of course. And so I was to speak about these are thinking, if you know, you know, you know that you know, and I think the commission and like the German impact of. So that. I think, the only got a question was that's about the community. It's a good to understand, I said this is that will say, so I think, what we have the right now work that the world. So that the big gap was not mostly interesting and we had to spend the government law. So I think I think this is I guess and now and we've seen a hard to mention it's time ago, so that the part of the German law was for our first big Commission, we also been doing the risk that we've done had something to be a French, but something. So far so we've been thinking about to say that we have a time that we're talking about the first, we've seen workshops, but I said, before we've worked at our world because we're trying to accept a lot of the commission and to see a lot of the EU institutions look at the value of really well, the technical, I'm not about being a lot of OpenStreet't actually in the product, since the world, but it's a software because we can be able to do it's a good reasons in the legislation, we're going to get into the commission. And we have, so we've got any point that we're the people only the EU world that companies don't at least the left is to be in the future. There are very important is a European Commission's no open source world. And we have a lot of a couple of research community. And I was open source, with the open source world where we also a community and this talk to look for free software engineer that the people may be the end up to a huge change of the community, which are a bit of the European Commission, we hadn't really large decision to say the community of the market and it. But I think that the organization is a lot of the world is actually the last year. And last question, I'm going to do we went a bit of the first one. And there's like, which is there are some of the world. We've been a few years. So yeah, the question to look at the market are a problem, I'm glad that there's good question of open source community? And obviously the European law. And we're a general, that we've been using the PLDD. And also about the first one of the PLDu Foundation. And I'm not just wondering, and the ones that I don't don't think, because you know, you know, so and I have this is what you know, like okay, on the way to understand about the time. And I think we were here, the way we've had the most important to use is we've shown a law and I'm going to worry about the thing that people who's a lot of the policy was not as well for thoseGI before I thought I was, because it was they have been curious about in the moment. But I found that I was the money. And it was working was just the political party is going to trust in the only time. Why should be made $4 and the organizations that this year at FOSTin, they have been a very happy to be talking to think. So a little bit of the company which was saying there were published by the European law in the beginning of the end. And so that the world was the CRA on the CRA issue. And this law, let's in the commission needs from the world and I was it was doing was. So I was sort of German legislation that this is supposed to be like the world, seven last year and a somewhat different law is that the foundation. They just something of that's what was the EU, that they are making and they have got to be the UK to be given that they were a company. But when they had that they were very happy in that came over the EU law. I actually the commission are that this
