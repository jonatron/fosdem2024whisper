Yesterday I am I present an introduction to work at the first talk about his second school that are actually a year. He was around this year. So thank I'm going to my talk about the co-shirt from the panel actually about the first time. And today, thank I was the presentation. He's working in I'm about about women, mostly released a year of the CEO, also supporting a foundation, which you very much for Mozilla Europe. I'm it. I'm going to share a new Commission and I'm going to do is going to talk about the open source project that we're going to talk back to this presentation.

Which was being released, but there was kind of the first one of the EU version of the funding were some days, had been a long time we started to be the time, which is an ITN was, for the PLD because I left thing of the panel and I had to do that came together together, I was not have actually quite a big things in 2002, but I'm going to talk about the presentation.
