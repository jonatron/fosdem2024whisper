 I was wondering on the end of these days and things that I haven't worked on the social phone. So now you say, I mean, I don't have to make a much time. You can get a video. You click on a little bit of a few questions. You should see too much. I'm going to go. I'm going to talk a little bit of that we have to keep. We talk about that. We're just going to be going to talk about a workshop sharing on each other. And you're using a little bit about me. This is a few of this and then you're going to be good. We've got a bit of a lot of time that it's going to be very excited about. We're going to be a little bit before at the room and you may get fast. We've got this one. It's going to be a few people from a few people who are talking to be looking at the room and they'll talk about somebody who have a few people who have been doing this panel. But the room had was thinking we've got into the staff and we're curious about the room and I think you're going to go to the panel. And I'm going to keep a week up to the first session team in the next week at least in the the University of the Commission and I hope the law that we have a member and that we've been going to welcome to work on funding here. And you're going to start. And that has all these ideas in our open API. And if you know there which is a couple of the participants. I would happen in the right away to see this person that they're going to ask for the people that. And at all just ask a little bit the open source. So that the whole group was really fun but maybe we're going to make this area of why a certain people were having a way. We've got to do we came up doing this stuff that we've got left and it more people can be there of technology and we'll see that we had a good we're going to have a little bit in the AI issues in the first step of some of the German community that the conversation are kind of the most important idea is our open source and in the first thing that we want to see so we have to get the people then we need to start to do some of what we just have. We have heard about the first things that we have some people we have to do to be able to be able to be able to do. We might have our projects from the projects that we have seen like the other people to be able to go to build with the things that we're just a commercial area that we have quite thought about finding somebody's and we have a lot of open source people who have a bit of people that we haven't have been doing them but so we have to say back to be looking at least two people who can we're going to be trying to look into the community in the product and we're going to do not going to invest to make sure that much time for any other people to deal with like to look up and how we're going to encourage you're coming over right now going to know what they're going to share your communities or they. So we can us about how we're going to get an open source contributions to work with the future back to find the one person in the world making this thing that we have been thinking about the right and we have for ourselves this today at the world and we're going to do that. So we're looking at it's right now very often looking at some open source so much the reasons I think we also I think it's a bad one of the way of the project that we would be aware of the quality of a very well we're looking at all the world again we took over the parliament. We have us all that we had kind of this year more popular talk to make a couple of like going to be good question. This is this nice we had a wonderful point for out there's a little bit of people. So we were something I've seen if you're a lot of your question was some people who made out to care about doing so there that I have been doing it with a lot of open source world called A lot of people who're just came up and she's just going to get to be a good for you're going to have a few months of months ago and I didn't know about a lot of people just about. Well I would be more detail of people asked about people and just going to need funding a comment on some people who are out a bit about how and we're going to do we can get a feel pretty much money and you're going to be a hard to get the focus on the important chance to the problem point and get a little bit more people who's very important to keep focusing on and a gap. We're a lot of what we're going to work in the ones that we are going on what we're going to talk about the year to talk about myself at the question was the future we're going to work full step that do at what we're going to talk to wait a lot of the satellites here is going to read off and I'm going to go to explain the time to a bit more about the talk about these issues of people I'm going to talk about how I'm going to me over to give us a way to let's going to repeat the talk and see as much money and the technical revenue. So first one is you shouldn't know in the fact that I've been thinking about the very first one of the open network is that's also a problem about it's good thing to see and the first one of the user management and the community so we've got to have to work on the challenges from the world the way to make the user management so that we really low decision from the next thing to have the grid and I'm going to get into a lot of the only one of the end, so we think about and we've got like we've got the community and so but we're going to share of the European Commission. The first talk was basically what the EU and the years ago we've got the commission from the last year of the world was about the commission and we've got to be able to be talking about what we had to do with the political and then we've been thinking about the European Commission University of my government and on the railway government and I can really looked at a long term which is the French and the end of us at this year so we heard about the Cyber Resissholder technology and we have been happy to be in Amsterdam and about the PLD is really is being also a pathway to be a more and you please think an idea was here and I've got a lot of just have been even a little bit of people in there so the first year in Kododo we had about technology and they had to know about that was also for the European EU Act and they worked very often know that the world and that are working a European Commission in German community in the first and then in 2019 and then back were a bit of the day and then I was contacted by me at the community for 20 or that I went to do have said in June years ago and he was an area and the one open source community that was on the government and the software and then finally last year and we had three years ago because we had to been in 20% and a lot of months and I was talking to you the last year later but it was half of people were in the last year at the years ago's a year. But yeah a lot of six years so one of all a couple of our biggest thing in the foundation and the European Commission which was that came to be used it was just to do and so or but that the European Commission was happening we've been around the same and we have really know what was about that were from the German German legislation were in the legislation and now were there were there were five years ago and in the EU countries were a German EU as well-maker and also at the Swiss law so far as long year where they wanted their society in Norway were to work out a long developed standards so they were discussing the EU panel because we didn't know to think that he was the last year I had done at their government because in September 1 we had done 20 years. And they were a member was a very happy period in 20 million of that we had that they did not seen so we had changed it was just that the EU and it was a really in 2021, we didn't give a bit in year ago because the European Commission was a big thought we could be able to have to start at least the law to be a lot of German law and their politicians that was a lot of companies we had to think they have a lot of open source world that we've had in the EU elections were seeing the future point is kind of funding and they were just to be just that just a problem that we had had a few years to share as a lot of a bit difficult that we had asked them and we had a lot of value in all now to discuss their two years and what society that also just being paid as possible that we need to do in Brussels and we also know that we would stop public policy that stuff in terms of the first year we have to make the EU directive and we had the same kind of the German agencies to do the government and a cost of a much money to be in the law was a directive that it was not really a very early and as well as a law that was removed by the commission to look through the law in we had a law and they were able to work is always is very closely the government and the city we had the political year and I wanted to have forgotten because we had a long been a years was basically I was in this one thing. And there were just to do at the German CRA was just really a last year we were a lot of each government is being first year and I was a year and we was a good to be really interesting thing at the moment and the world of the best they had their technology so if you had to do not really need to put in the German law is not really great nature of the European law is that's not the value that she was actually not just to. And an educational law is certainly been quite open law and was well more as I was meant that the EU is not as a really a good decision of the main GPL and so I went forward and we were discussing which is good problem of the digital the one of law that they were created and they were the in the moment but they were not that they are in they found that they was only learned the way they were not a directive for only one a year and the commission policy because they were like the value which was the idea because it was allowed to that he had a political decision and it was just the same it was actually a copyright organizations had to do they were saying it made that they found that just a law and google law in a copyright as a copyright law they saw a way to think they were being the law but they need to it into the law for the copyright legislation and it was made's a GPL the commission from the GPL law would be a they would be incredibly well clear a law that this as really was a court holder had nothing that there was a sector that we might be a standard because when they were not no problem because they ever had to understand for people actually and they can't know a licenses I didn't say the copyright law felt more license. But they were not only clear that the German law. And the law copyright conditions that they would be going to there will be a directive is no, and they just doesn't know kind of the law is that they was much less in particular law and the copyright holder they mentioned it was no gatekeeper can ask it was but they said they don't do you to understand of the copyright court license was the legal law or but and they didn't know nothing was there were in a copyright no cost in risk that they had any license in in the copyright license would not the copyright value. And that would be that there couldn't know the law and the parliament had that we think this is in that just talked about the license law a copyright copyright really it's what they've got a GPL and there that we had to understand is not only in a license because it's even if the problem to use in the no need to just maybe no, so we only the GPL and we need to do some copyright anymore so that in a problem is that the best person has to mean in of it was right in and they don't need to think they're not really interested at least the policy so this point of the copyright law to the copyright license anymore is the license in the policy and they don't exist in the only value but so that the only thing to be messed into this is that is that would be the end has used for a value of value is of the license. So the copyright they can would only on the copyright of the software could be messed to map the law and they would be part is in law that they will in terms of the nature of that GPL law because a law then they don't even you can't have that and they cannot. But they have said is a value of the license for a license license law. I said there are a law the copyright law may be developed is an court market is the license gatekeepers and license that license law license license so but there were a copyright policy that do this this value that if we actually is that the license as you do the German law and this copyright, I think is there are aware of as a copyright copyright law was a license and GPL, but much I took the copyright of law in that respect to their license, really mean there was still some notion but the license for the gatekeeper should be copyright assessment law at that was just be a public law. And this law I started their laws that's not been done to not not aware of the GPL was so I was just to know exactly what the GPL that you know that I didn't know of getting a copyright but for always put the clear could be even see that the copyright copyright law and if you know, and no longer value if that if that you are really like copyright value that there was often for the commission will be an open source supply be copyright. I think that regulation. But they could be fully open source value field in the way they use might always well I think so we will have had this policy that in Europe was having it was kind and they was the past to be the EU. The only two parties actually has
