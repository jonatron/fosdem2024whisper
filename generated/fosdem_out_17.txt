 Hi everybody for I'm happy to talk about thinking about me about how you're talking about the work, about that, it's not the, is going to help you to be able to have time or who are going to do this? But if you just wondering about the people on the internet in a long experience, for that. So I don't remember a great question why? What I made as a year, let's see in a comment on the talk is going to talk about today about it? And to keep my colleagues, I'll take an energy and I'm not sure. I'm not sure that it's going to help and get the time to talk to people have a little bit about in what we want to make a minute of the people in a lot of people and we're trying to really using the future we're thinking about all our users and we're planning to speak about it to the market. We're going to keep in the government and the negotiations for now who have been also had in the world. They didn't think that we just have to make the community that it's what people're even harder and we need to be competitive on building the good and that are trying to see what you're in it does. And I need to do is what one to get there is, she said that's a minute. He's still a little bit of the project that we've been doing in the moment. I've got a little, and he's what I've been a couple of time that's going to join us come to make this is for two years, but I'm going to be looking at the idea of the best one of the last year. He has funding that was coming to be speaking at this year. I was kind of the other and we didn't know about ethics and I had asked about a bit about the year then. And I was a bit of the last year was very interesting to a long time and I was a matter. It was like I was just wondering if he was going to take the first time before. He had to discuss and then I was just have his talk about a few more important to three years ago. And we did that he had another year. And that I'm just like one of the last year. That came to mention was invented and he was just a lot of the reason to stop a really an hour and a couple of magic in the best, but I'm also've heard about who started going to you in there I met Thompson are a little bit less people from the people in the fact that started with people who remember the last year and he would like the commission was the guy from Matthias Leas of this. And there were sort of the panel. It was also had to get this was a lot of a lot of people in the the copyright law. And I could be that he was told you know. I was an issue of things I do that we're just wanted to, in the second year ago in January, but I was still not a year I'm just to make sense of what he was I said that we had to solve was gonna just wondering that? Well, but hopefully right, I was over time to be just one in these people who had and in the question right was the year and getting these workshops were being able to bring off from you know a big workshops for more information of the money in the decision on this panel that I started just worked at the question, and I joined the world in the right now started. So the city of course I was quite a lot about saying I was like, we did I was the next year ago and the last year's now because of what I was a lot of the first days. We were in the project. He had a lot of people were on the people started doing now he was. I've got a lot to give his goal of people asked the beginning of the money away from the policy was that we had changed. I had said that were looking after that was the law. And some panel was the way we decided to achieve it had in the way to be a long was a world. And they made a law actually had was about some the best law. And then needed to they had to make it. And they were trying to remember I was getting the American society were a community perspective. And it, very excited about the first other people were interesting news had to give care of people to be talking about the idea that happened yet, everybody just the only one of the next. And that the first year, there was I wanted to turn on the first days for the German law, the law and they had that they had the commission and they didn't just started. And they wanted to make this was. And then they didn't work on the first day law is at the real project was a national law did the European Commission was what was asked and the German law was also done after the legislation of the other law. And we have made the German sector were the law. And said a German law, we had before a law that I was the law because I had been talking back in 2020 since. And I had an law key-on and I had said it was at least in this point of the copyright, I had in the law for political States for the law, to a public law to not act in law and the copyright of the decision. And that I was just learned and they did not enough, but and the value they had at this value that she didn't, but they were good and they had into a member legislation. They were that he gave the policy in it in a funding would be really just a law to court they didn't work to be no IT, there was thought in the world. These are a GPL, no court law was we really an incredible law. Most of copyright thought that was since also known and then he said before and he actually was just said that didn't had a law. And they didn't just saw the activist policies were a sense that women when she said to happen was still could be in copyright space. It was not as much just was just for the law. For this is just the policy policy in copyright directive and well. Again, we had to do a member of legislation, the law, I heard about they did is, but I'm working in the government law already looked into copyright of the law and I said when someone is a law would be the GPL law as I was, I think I remember whether we haven't read that we did not at least it. And I remember, I'm going to have the court, one interesting thing to be using no and that, so we had time to do really hope that we had to go back to the rights that when this year we had. Which was a kind of the copyright, the court and we were part of need to be part of... Is that had to have that the licensee was not a European law had the rights. And so we had a copyright law for the, we didn't feel that only had no, which means that last year. But we had to make sure that the one that I've got to be a long time to get us, but they had an appeal of the Swiss society were saying a very important thing that are the copyright clause was actually is that you know we are that the money to exist in that it was going to solve the world but that we're going to take in the world. And you're going to be on the directive of the reason what's great thing about the energy sector could you know a given point of copyright rights. I said. So the first, I said, okay, with a good audience was more energy law were being the court and then first. I had a decision should be a public copyright law, but we might be a copyright law into law, of the EU is free law and I said there was really an license making that last but the idea of the copyright directive if there was to be quite an law value of the law because there I think then it became a copyright license of law cost for copyright law, but the court. I think that was we were really thought they had been like that decision to be there was not for a violation and they didn't even just wondering and they didn't care about copyright that she was actually had to that the rights and they had a gap would always a law we were not know that I was very important of a law from the copyright happens on the law and we have only trying to be used to know what you thought it was that I ended up in law in the European value of the copyright public value of the copyright law is to think that the GPL, in GPL law, like they said we haven't want to be going to be the copyright value which the the copyright copyright law of the decision was the conditions and part of a value of legislation because they were doing so they were paid so not just asked as you know that's probably don't made as far as a bad as an law in law has said, and that a perfect law's important that law that is a law. I mean that the GPL as this is. It may be meant an infinite sentence to win as the politicians in the value once the copyright sector and that the law have should be a key. We have no to do I think is a legal holder and has been that the right space. And as being a value of the GPL and not defined because nothing is pretty important to happen, but also a good information that they're not like by one longer termination that are aware of the GPL wasn't even a huge win for that's not in the law for them, in practice that they're not enough software, but they still, they were not only quite aware that they got that they were a copyright is no value in the copyright and they were just didn't want to call it or no license in the law law and we were using the law because we saw on the copyright. We have to take care of the European directive and their licensee were so much for the upper values are essentially and they were supposed to the public law in the parliament and as they had to have in open source software defined in the digital society and open because they may be a bit of the German law from people're just mentioned the German society could be in other law and they all the open source regulation and this person to a market and the copyright market in the national Commission in Europe we had said that to also have become been affected by saying to make that the parliament and the factories and will say that money in June June but you can be the energy is just the scope of the railway sector. As I think it's all of the commission and we have been on the European Commission that they were a huge invested in the European commission need and they were forgotten the member regulation, but it's about the world that they are available at European market law we were the EU one directive which was not only the government organizations to law this regulation and it was some group and I just legal law conditions to law are not only a law field of legislation and last thing that the data that the German law and so the law to invest into the last I said that was in advance and that the Swiss law at that they got a value of German liability in court from the courts and they're interesting and they were able to the principle that we had the directive and they are planning and the first time they can be able to be open source directive and we're only have a challenge that the government laws was only public directive in legislation is to be used to be made in German agencies I were a directive in last year. And we had to be open science from the law to fund open source law to do 20 2021 so that we have been trained as well and there was like you know that actually would be incredibly like to participate in Italy and to share standards of the PLD is going to some commercial legal sector and also in the law and I know that is the fact we do that was in the important in the IT agencies started in the overall year and a free public software since the EU sovereignty and market law. And I was the law, to the parliament in France. And there was even in the GPL law but this is the scientific legislation. And that there was very clear directive in German license citizen has had really a source in the political law, that there was also EU which market in the legislation and the European Commission actually a copyright and we had a case and it was the act and an injunction would be a directive because we did in terms of revenue and parliament would be the impact of the civil society and the German law for these law and it has even quite easy to continue at the German court law driven license has been a sector and is also at the European thought in the law and they knew that we found out open source EU had a mandatory law and just announced that they decided to a last year to keep into any law was to be that, they said that they were not available for funding there were like in the law and many court civil world and they were not the licensee. But that the best licenses as the GPL but they were not have had to be the law policy, you know that the moment to be a and's the copyright state was all the law we had quite a law and we had been using funding they gave the German law, which got they had could only a huge court value under this one that the value of and I would be a public law of their legislation because they didn't exist was absolutely be a copyright law of an important in the German market was always wanted to be the government think we just to have, they had from the GPL law is open German law, which was just happened of a key and and not because there was really nothing that was asking in the commission, as not really there was copyright law perspective. So but it was good of the law in the politicians to find a directive. What they were this license policy was on the copyright law what the law to something that they were made their clause and the copyright GPL, generally had a copyright law in an first of copyright and is a law report of money and they were not just the law and they had a law and had a directive but that was is always the German copyright holder. And this copyright idea is the commission to have had to other law. And they had wasn't considered good to be aware of this GPL one of like not necessarily affected only of a way to be like the copyright conditions in the court decision decided to open law on the copyright law law so far when they don't need to have more law license and the city has had the copyright argument for government law law that don't have to be a GPL value of money that policy, it had to have
