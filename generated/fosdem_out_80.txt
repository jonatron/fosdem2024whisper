 Hello everyone for App2. Thank you for your attention, like back to me. Thank you. 
 I'm going to talk to ask what I've been using the last year. I'm going to mess my first one was one of you about that with the very interesting. I haven't seen the things I worked on a few days before, but I'm going to talk about how early versions of the year of the rest of the maintenance and I can be here for being a little bit more than just talking about a lot of people who would work on a lot of stuff. You'll have a lot of people will get the moment. You can also help people really choose to work and say okay? So how much does you do you keep me? What is you want to have when I'm looking into the next speaker. This is this was what I think we had better than playing on doing and when you keep you start using and that you want to do your right and so far as a little bit more or less than my experience for some of people come in and keep having a lot of people to know about you need to get the room on. So we have here in the next year and I have an event to the second one year of the bottom. Today I'm just said I'm here and in the room and then we have here. But there's the day of the beginning. We have been a different rooms today. So the top, it's a battery. And we have a whole room to do a session. And then as far as I can create a little bit less than the right now we have a while going to we have to get the room. What are using the room and how many things? I think that exist at you can start the room to do you, for the room to think, I was we need to do this. So, how can see that. So we have to go is actually fix the deaf room. We can see here and we are ready a picture. And the deaf room. And in my. So, the talk is the room, the way we are the next year. And we have to want to provide a little bit too much as the technology, the first thing I've been present here, and we have to find new home room for also saw it. And with the questions. We have any questions, like, yes, where we have some questions? We have any questions. And this talk we are the next speaker. As people, we are very much of the same time for further in the speakers that we can open source room of the question. We have a researcher we have a few questions. Okay, which were.

 I'm we'm Robin back to your everyone. My name that I am We have here at Next. I am the folks in a very great talk to my very much for the slides. I'm going to the first talk today I have a stand and I'm doing and I am mainly talking about the first FPGA meeting room at the time. I am I am I am I here. That is going to talk about our next speaker is going to what I first talk is in the CRA. So today I am I am present a talk about a talk about where I Alz. I briefly about the PLGyter, today. And of the second thing I am Robin on the history of the European Commission and I here are thefounder years, and what am in France and I'm going to stop, so it's how I'm going to be going to go back to share. So my time today, let me about when you about we have a new project that we do we are going to start around the whole process in the talk about the government and the European Union in this year. So we have is that with the software stack that open API is in the most important thing is open source, the big thing. And for us here is that for the first of Rail community is that the world for the challenges we are also we are here around many I would like the last year last year, you let me and encourage you said, we use case, I think 20 years ago, we have three months ago because, we have been to do something of these solutions to start up or S2 because I think, because I'm not, of a lot of what are working on the decision-R community work, for the European European EU European Commission's talking to do is to the educational administration, but it was very important to the EUs already the moment. So at the problem here we did I think this, I am I need to engage with that we need to spend a standard and we've seen this talk about this question of the most important to do we know what I've seen from the first year, our EU product was a German impact of the open source law community. So we want to make the public sector and they also important question was just call funding to be open source research, the world. So this is that we do we have a year. One that we're trying to measure the CRA. At the rights member of the time to be concerned with software, which is that there are really a few major question was also the European proposal to be open free software. There were their methodology that we had to be a long as an open source world of open source and the UK license that we had a EU. So I'm using the open source software and they had. So the question was also the EU directive in the biggest aspects of the foundation. So it was a big for example is an internal society and the possibility to make a lot of the CRA. I was about them. And what I was, what I was the law, it's an obvious, there was the one more important thing to do is that is the most important point. It's what we released in the EU, but we did I think of your nature of a value of the world. So that you also want to look at the future. The problem it's what was in the idea was about it was the government of the German law and the issue I was to do to keep the national sector in the things. So this is the copyright law. And we have in the legislation. We had for German license in the GPL, we're just care about in its law in law policy was more law, and we just discussed in the past law. And this law was a law is huge law that law at least two laws could be our country and in the commission law, to know that was not possible to invest into the European market of the copyright law was a regulation in terms of open source law and co-the-party law so well and we try to do not having their scientific technology and also a liability in law of licenses and they come to help of German law, and think in law that they will be able to funding and they are open neuroscience, and they need to be not do this law and the court law, mandatory law in that and digital law. Because they were able to make a GPL law the law. So what they didn't even get the time to get to be for a licensee to really important value of decision because this panel because you know that it is not so you know. And the market is an law of a, they're spending the first government policy companies in a sustainable law was. So if they were not. So I thought that this was not a time. It was just the last I had to they were that was not even heard that a of the beginning, but in the copyright think that GPL license in the legislation decision legislation was surprised because I was designed to an standards. So when they were this basically the copyright to be the good the legislation. So this law, it was what was a directive there was mostly an open secret was paid at was that, but they were quite a really just heard was a directive of these law And he knew a law that was to open source law-profit, since then they were found around this legislation so just that was about the law and we had never gave to be a society and they can't get quite a US law that's a software industry license that the long term and is quite a traditional law court was
