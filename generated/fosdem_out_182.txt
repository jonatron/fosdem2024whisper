 Hi. So I was wondering about my name you for the first talk about all in the European Commission and the next talk is is a lot of open source and CVs where I'm connected to the first year. Now we will tell you a lot of open source projects in, I've got this year. We'll give off to a little bit of a lot of stuff. Still one of people to continue to ask this. It's a lot of projects. You're looking for the top of the world that we got a lot of a lot of the panel we're going to build with us all about the products. We're trying to give you to get started working on the first step of my presentation, today, which I'm going to deal with the latest and this and I am I just going to open source community, what I'm going to do. It's going to see it. So I'm going to call a bit, I'm going to talk a bit about my talk about what we created in open source software. Then I'm seeing the open source community project at having a bit of that sort of open source program, and I'm going to build a way to see the talk about. That's kind of the open source world. So I'm going to be in my talk to talk to, am I'm going to our funding to get a long time. So we're going to turn the first and what I'm going to try to take a survey? The first of the culture of the real to tell you're going to discuss in this work on the world. And I'm going to be going to have to do with the door. And I'm going to show my first thing that I'm going to start working on. So I'm going to share up a lot more questions. It's going to try to talk about the most of of the people to talk. But I'm going to introduce a little bit of a lot of people to talk at next talk about how we're going to, we have time going to do you, but please come up to me. We're going to talk. How are going to give you a name of the last four years. And we want to say, what we need to introduce a good one of this is already having a year. I'm going to have a little bit of my question, I'm going to keep using the information. So in terms of the first five minutes of the quality of the other projects, this point of the last year. So I'm going to talk about the same time that I'm going to be talking about my hand from a problem. And then the question is done. I'm wondering. So, I'm an entrepreneur is going to write is that you to turn on their own person to bring up in that. We have to go to touch. So I'm going to be here, we know what we're going to talk about them in the technical. So I'm going to be going to talk about. I'm saying I'm going to use, we have some questions. It's going to join us to answer. I'm going to see the best time. Okay. I'm going to talk to join us to be happy to keep the next to talk about the next slide. And we are some questions, okay, we're here. So, I guess you about the first of the first time we've been doing this year, the first. So we have are trying to do very important to work, we open source projects and I'm going to build and to get to be a little bit of the slides. So, we'll talk about the developer. So there's the co-end project, yeah, I'm going to present. So we'll talk about how to VLC into the GDBO. So we have the, all the part of the reasons, which is in the next talk's the first talk of Kafka and we will go into the talk about performance in the question. So I'm going to four years. So I will be an API sharing, right now. I will talk about the question to, let's what I'm running? Sorry, and I was in the question about this talk about we were going to try to talk about the slide today. Okay, a talk about the moment. So you have a software engineer for running. I'm just to introduce us and I'm basically present to the internet and I'm the beginning. I think what I'm going to have been talking about the front to be here? I'm just here. I think about the internet. But I first one of the question was being paid to get more than the next is that's going to me. I'm just have heard about the things about the first one. The version of the question is it's the problems that in the board. And there are many other for the Linux, I'm saying, a good question I think, but thank you can tell me. I'm not for me what I'm going to know, because yeah, on the time to be able to of the presentation. And so I'm going to talk about the end of the EU and I'm not sure. I'm going to talk. I'm writing this is here today and Karen for now, and he's going to work and I'm going to talk, so I'm going to talk about that I'm going to start with the past 10 minutes. And on this talk here, what I'm going to talk for us today's going to talk about this initiative to present some of some good part of this talk about the talk, and I'm working on. The talk about I'm going to I was about the two years or at the goal was going the countries, but I had like to get to be very good to have the end of the first time to the things that I'm that I created by the European Commission. And I'm going to talk about the community, the project, for me. So I'm going to talk's going to be all of I'm very happy to talk about the EU institutions. And I'm going to thank you know. So I'm going to talk about some of the open source code in open source software for the negotiations. And we have the things in our work work with the world. And then for example I think this code is a lot of a lot of people who are going to me and most of people in the community and then maybe a thousand people. We would be a lot of open source projects are going to make this what's the future. It's going to make this kind of the great because people really something like to have some of how do as a lot of the job that people have heard about people. What I would be a problem. And of people are the world that they are the things I think that we're kind of documentation of a sort of fun. These that we have been doing quite at a focus on the future a lot of the source code that are getting available. It's probably a lot of ways to be aware of people, but they're going to be very important to be to say the product or if they want to think about the things like that. I think that comes to the question is supposed to be something we're doing with the right questions to be able to be on a little point of a new code for questions and we're going to focus through our ecosystem of all the whole idea of the way to be in as much like the community so it was like we are speaking from the code right and the community working on the people even the source code was the code and the software, the software's why they see is going to ask well, we going to start on our goal of our community. And so you heard about an open source project. I'm going to be going to start up to talk about the ones that we're really have hired in, there's the community when we're going to have to talk about the back to get into the last year. I'm going to our communities and we're going to have lots of you're going to be able to be very interested in that you're on. I'm going to make open source of funding to talk to the maintenance of course. And I'm going to talk about the community and things in the first. I'll talk about this is we have been used for us up that we have a couple of us about the world and I'm going to talk. I'm going to talk about these parts of six days. I'm going to be wondering it's going to be around in collaboration and there because we have learned from the market and we're got the community and I'm going to make sure that we have we need to be on the years ago the challenges of energy movement. And the current EU Commission that we have the open source community open source project in the German Association company are able to be what is as I'd like free to have a first to have to to give more people by academics, you a great to help us one and they want to help us help us. So I'm not just wondering. Because we can be sure that the first time. And that we want to have to be a bit, so much of energy impact of which I'm going to be quite a major round of energy and we have a little bit different organizational players here so much of you're so they're going to share into the parliament and we're trying to have much money like how you know what we have doing and what we were thinking about European government and what has been in the big work that we may had to think we'll give us a big to be able to being done here and last year at the world and it in a few women and there was going to do that also say I'm going to be going to get a question here in us to do better at least until it a lot of the project I'm going to be a bit of money for five years because he's been just wondering of time. And I think from the question. So let's a question and the screen and how you hear that I'm going to inspire us? So I'm going to talk about here, what that's going to be is the speakers, I'm going to show you the microphone. I'm going to come to be going to be going to work that. So I will start getting a round of an open source, are doing. I'm going to talk about the sticker between the time, what you see are going on the question, but just looking for the slide. All right? So if you should I'm just wondering what happens, I want to take a little bit of the first more than I'm going to talk about the mic,. And I'm going to take a little bit of you who most of course. Okay, but I'm going to start and they're going to talk about how to talk about the workshop about getting in the morning. So I'm a bit of the beginning of the very excited.
