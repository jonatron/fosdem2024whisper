 So hello everyone. 
 Hello everybody. So welcome for us thank you for a lot of My name. I'm going to the first. My name is the world, I'm just a lot of talk about today. I'm going to try to present about, we, back to talk about the project. I'm giving a little bit. I'm going to present a talk a short talk about the first talk about how an amazing talk that I am I'm a couple of the first year, or am I will be an Open Source program engineer and more in this talk at Fosin SpiceDB and she has been a number of Oos. The first step, the beginning of the first release will talk is a month to say, and a couple of time back into the C and it's a lot of years ago. I'm on the I'm going to talk about a few years in the I'm going to talk about open source in the C++ project, which is the C. But I'm going to be something I'm going to talk about the second one of the world. I'm going to show it, I'm going to talk a little bit about 40 years ago. So let me, of my main talk about the talk about AI and I think about the thing, well. And the first talk is I'm the way to open source community and how we also a research perspective about people have a lot of open source person. So here is the next talk, we have today at the law, the co-profit. So we've got a sort of a new government in the last year of an German law that I was just had people who really have a lot of thought that was really want to ask me to ask about what are living in Germany. And before, by the moment, there was not one of people who are the world. There is a lot of the European Commission's two years ago, which was like the first of people using the open source software and how can be a lot of the funding and challenges, this case of times in the German science agencies are public sector, how I use to get into the years, is the world and so maybe be the EU Commission had to be clear work. One of the community, any other ones to have this is only world. So we've been trained through the second one of trust EU funding of your CRA. So as a question was like that everybody's a bit of that we really quite a bit of a big release of the work at the point of the workshops and we're really don't a common law that we wanted to make the license at least we had a discussion. And we were they actually doing this and they and maybe you know what they need to look at the beginning of the beginning of the technology so you have the year. So the second one that is in a few months ago. It was really important to ask to do that I think about this one actually all thinking about the directive and he has been actually going to bring this to work and we're looking from a young people have more people a lot less capacity to the community because he was the source project. And then the world by the open source community of the product and they have been not the organizations that we were in terms of the open source project was the company was open source value which was in the world or the open source world that was only. And in Germany've been a lot of companies in 2019 was the most important thing that the product and there was really useful to be a good and they felt that they weren't need to be done and they were they are just for the middle of the first point of open source by the foundation that we would come to talk and we don't have to emphasize that was going to just not on their product on the court law freedom they're going into people and they want to do funding that to be able to be the OpenAI-to-position around the time many developers of these values that we had six months on the world but they're people are the impact. And it was the software the things that we wasn't really a huge court where you're going to figure out of course that they have been able to do this and it didn't really hard to have not be the years was doing that I'm hoping that point of the legislation that they're not one right and there was actually it was making sure that these as well found that was a big. And they're at the only time in a long as a legal directive and got a technology in 2011 they're the market the decision who got to be a lot of it was the principle of the European Commission was just been to do some of work in the value that was actually because they're like they were very happy to think we had been working on the EU value of the value of the company had to been into some point of the main value we were saying there were talking about one to you know what to think about is that was in the fact that is organized that they were the government and they are really the law copyright forces the European institutions and a huge value that the parliament were trying to do they're going on the scope of the law certification as a policy in copyright and they had heard that they had got their roots. And and they want to be a young people who found out in policy and they were like they get the freedom that you can exist in all we can't use and we have to take and then they had that they would have the government had learned to know what they're doing these values that they don't actually and they're using a community person is the parliament across their Commission they kept applying an parliament and they were in a whole field of the copyright copyright value of legal person I took us and they did is an open source law that we actually it back to the law to. But since 2018 were the big law that were a bit only thing that's going to the freedom no license rights who just that initially said. There's nice that actually a long term and there were never talked to give a directive because of a license. And they also a copyright the policy away that they said that the person has been just kind of the law law report. Yes. Then they had a law that was that policy. When he was mostly would a law in the commission that way they used to be able to change and maybe they're not. And the person who should have made it too well and this copyright sector need to go off to the value value that in the law and he had a policy in the license to read from the licensee has no and they would be adapted as clear time that the world we could, but the copyright holder would have heard about legislation that people in 2019 and they were asking care last piece of the licensee would be a copyright of the copyright directive to actually is the CRA field of 20, but he might be made a legislation. But it was even in June is what we hadn't feel that I was like law as well I didn't like to keep and then they're just didn't really have it only seen in the last could be just an law, but he was one that was gonna, he just had a long time to give us for a copyright law and a copyright term, and he was just had keys and still was not just the license. I was had to come back to it doesn't looked at the decision from the one person has no matter and so it was actually a license or not really someone would be a copyright technology, but that would be the law in the law that. Or that could just has to have, this has heard of copyright commission of copyright law, I didn't know that a copyright is, especially for license. They didn't have been found out they know that he had just wanted to summarize I was not a value before that that was also in that were the value that at all needed to solve what they did I had had the UK law way that he got there anymore if many people, the license that could seem to implement both license to and the value was in that the license license ever had to have to be to implement the court law value to be the value and they didn't work and they want to their copyright infringement, of the source society of the decision can represent the copyright value of the point saying that the license law, this regulation can have probably be represented and so the organizations often going to have a copyright law could just they could be the people will not need to report that and so they should be the money and the license will be open up for that you if you that society could affect the value because they can't need to. And for the public copyright law itself might be a copyright or decision is actually make it becomes a that if you need to think it's doing so they would be sure that I don't know that it's kind of the sense, we are in the UK act in that and now at least they will not even forward. So that there is done that they've been living in the majority of work in 2019 may be a copyright licenses and they were to kind of the problem and they want to understand what for the money and they cannot use civil policy could provide so we'll be in order to realize that this one of money and we're giving a decision themselves and to each other question to the GPL and what they just gave a directive and so he's the code. But that's was really important to work a very good word that I think about the commission and I think so I think a very happy to have said that the people to realize it means we may think in a lot of the world. These who want to do have been made again those laws of good experience to have. We need to share and we have to be aware of course the commission to be given people, so much money for a lot of having the court law economy. We have learned about the law and so we should be aware of a scientific law and we can only about a copyright infringement of the nature of the world and was trying to open from open source software should be legal thing to think that product actually there in 2019, but I think that law around another issue that people who have to have that they have also use they're interested in the community and they're also some people know and they're the legislation has been having a CRA issue of the question that they have more important that to get the decision and they will be the time to be a market. So it was my question is we have three people that started and decided to have companies that's still that don't have to do this law that is basically open source and we have been doing the problem between open source were trying to do we would work in the decision and they have been here into this was not really likely to have to look at the technical science organizations have been doing a huge value of the world in the place to do at the commission in the moment of they are the liability in German law is so we are like you know that there and funding for us and so they're not that I think this really important thing for open source license but that they know that this problem but I think it was a only an activist is that there many European institutions only has been was kind of the commission that they're done a rights in the rights agencies and they've been removed in the parliament were used and so we were now want to go and they just
