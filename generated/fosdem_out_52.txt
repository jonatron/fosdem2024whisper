 Our speaker, hello, if you don't want to think about it, so we've just showed into the next presentation and when I'm some minutes. I'm going to talk about this great. I'm not going to show an introduction of the first the beginning of the ones here and how we're doing JavaScript code? So I'm going to listen to give a user of all the patterns and how we've been going to look at how to start with Jambon, you can do it or the code that you can see what I've been asking what you've got to talk this, of one little bit about how we're only like in the code that you're trying to use the bottom. And the important thing you're trying to generate command line. And then you're describing about a result that we're using a new version of the machine and it's wrong. And then you get a while just going to wait for looking into that you'll see them, it's going to do this little bit into this case, I'm going to speak about this into the numbers, hey, they're going to be like this, right? Just write the next in Postgres will have there and sort of what's the best thing about the code if you're going the function that I'm going to be talking about the execution. It's going on this type of a function very interesting to look at the value of another architecture. And the idea, the way, you're going to create some of the best kind of it's this one of these things, y-defined function that there. And you're going on and then you're going to see what I'm going to go to point. And you're going to pick in the documentation. And I'm going to talk to go on the compiler in the first one of this case, right hand. And what I'm here. It's going to write to put the code and the code and this API, and the function is all the memory that you see that you need to build and you a kind of my application you've got the memory code which is quite the things. But now. And then what I'm going to do is that's going to be going to work with that we're going to work with the class. So we're going to figure out and we are going to see a function doesn't going to use cases you can see here. So this code to allow us a number of a table that we're going to the example, but we will give you. So that's the most what we did is going to do? So if you can we're going to try to get it to say, and we want to add this stuff. So we call the code, is the code, we have also talked about to build code that. And if we're going to send the C++ code is an open source code compiler, so we're going to C code base is, we're just do this, we're going to a whole code, so we're going to start waiting for our code base, at this code base. And this week we have a long. We're going to look at all the C++ code that the code, we're going to build code, we're going to provide a first step to start the code that we're going to allow this. So we've got a function base was going to keep in a version of the LVM and how we're going to do we're going to be looking at all of the code, we in many other code, but how hard to come to do we're going to be doing the error. And we're going to do we look a back. We don't want to our, we did we want to just want, these one thing is a little bit about the Rust is we have a Rust code base functions we know and we also had to be able to be able to happen. We need to change when we are going to give our four languages. So we have a huge one thing that all available and we have a look. We have a few questions, we have an C++ code. Of course, we have. So we have something which we are going to start going to build this first one before we'll be available today here. So we're going to wait for us a lot of one one of those things we're talking about the first in the Python code. The people that I'm going to build thing I have to call point the program before. We're going to make it's going to be a lot of a lot of tools that we're going to talk about how the native code are thinking about different features in C code. And first one are going to build and we're going to kind of the most developers want to come back to make sure free code as a lot of when we have a lot of new code base in the kernel code. So we want to show you also for this and we're moving back to do the code so we have to get this was going to the left and that were kind of the implementation on the package. Some things that we're going to do is going to have to keep it's going to be going to work that work on the actual code and then we're going to be like the sort of the code and just looking at the software stack and we're going to go back to the source code which has to our code which was kind of the code that we're going to that you think about this is how we've're doing it's going to work and we have also because we're going to do something more ideas right so we have a lot of that we're just doing so the source code and our code of like we're going to work out to talk about is back to see how it. So there's really so of how to look at the code and the code is that we're when we're making the Rust and what you're going to deal with the ecosystem and what you can we just be talking about right word? And if it's what their very good thing is that we're going to start looking at what we're going to look into here you're going to be kind of our code in the class to be talking about it in a little bit in the standard for example I'm going to make it. But we're going to call the other tools to want to start to be the code base is good, I don't have to go to be something that, but we need to contribute to go to the right side and do that are looking at all the community and if you're looking at that we're going to share and maybe you're quite a lot of time and they'll take off the project. And because it's going to build up to work if you're going to work with us to work on and make sure that the challenges that you don't really know exactly the work on the community companies can be doing stuff like good? What like to choose. This is that are right now in a couple of the code that we're just have to look over this to. So there are here's a lot of other use cases that we have been talking that the years ago? So we are the difference that I think that you know, but really of all that we've got to think it in the things. But I've got here's quite an excellent. So I think there's the ones that I think about the question. I'm very far as I'm saying that I'm going to use. And I'm wondering about the other we are like I'm going to keep a software when you know, but I'm doing a lot of a lot of people that they have been a few people. No, I think the people are going to use a senior community of examples. I'm just wondering they're doing that they're going to do that they're going to come back to the software I'm going to go up to a little bit about a better thing. And that people who's, one to get back to be doing. But that people go to see what we're interested in the people were working on the world because they're going to actually very often like that, right? And this is really like in the future. So I was one of the community and we have some people with more people who had to come up and people got the whole community work in the first talk is that we had a screenshot here, the room to build came, like they have and they just seen a lot more people in over time. And their product, I thought it's just was somebody died down, like everyone about what's like it, then he got to come to do, they spend the end of a little bit of the people. And I was wondering on that happened here was you know, and I was just going to stop that, even the time to get in the last couple of the agenda, so many people like he got a lot of years ago, I was something that's actually has got was probably know, you know, like, because they ever had kind of people were the world now were just saying there were going to you know, but the history, yeah, I think I was people so many people work into the people's a person, so I thought, because I would come back to you know, so we have maybe I was someone and I saw like, I was people, and we started to say, right? But there has was a while I was not going to come off. I was like I thought, okay, people in five years ago. And we thought from this was I got to know, right now, if I don't think a different people back to just wondering, right? And I thought, I was like, I was the time I remember this was wondering, I was surprised, I was, okay, okay, just wondering, you just a question, so thank you said, much. Who was a lot of time and thought, I was you know that the problems was the, this? 
 Thank you, I was... I was going to the way. Thank you. Thank you. 
 All right. Thank you. 
 Hello. Thank you very much for everyone. 
 Thank you. Thank you very much everyone. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. 
 Hello everyone. 
 Hi, very far. Thank you very much. Hello. So from my presentation. I'm wondering, thank you very much for the next talk. I'm mostly have started to look at the talk about this talk. I'm going to I'm here for coming up this year ago. I'm going to talk about the speakers on the first two years, so first year, and I'm a few months and from the next year and I will are here is mainly one of several years and I am I'm wondering about it. The first time I'm going to talk about one of the RISC-upy? So a lot of the power I'm going to speak to talk we got some open source projects in this talk about the first point of the question was a lot of the speakers in 2016, which is a lot of the day ago, when I have been adding $15, and I think there, or really a couple of you saw all, but then have also create a little more and I'm going to talk about how this talk, I've been talking about this talk on the first one of all of the future. I'm from the internet and I'm we're going to introduce a bit of these months ago. I'm looking over. The first time I'm going to present at the first one of the rest of the end the microphone of the time I'm happy to be, see in the thank you remember yet in my colleague and the first talk is one in this talk in the next year was, five years ago. And then the conference, and I'm going to be on the panel, 20 years and I've been contributing to be a bit of open source community, but it's worth and so much. So I'm sorry. So hello everyone. And I'm going to you everyone. No, I'm just wondering, I'm just sorry, you can do some years today and I'm going to open source project. So thank you see a couple of the real talk at the future. So I'm going to talk to talk. Yes. Thank you to jump to talk about the talk, we will be wondering the previous talk here. Thank you Benjamin. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

 Thanks for everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you very much very much for welcome to the first talk. Thank you very much for anyone. I am I'm one in the room for the mic. I'm here, Benjamin at this talk about this first speaker. Thank you. Thank you. I am Chris everyone. Thank you very much everybody for a day of being a little bit for this but I today I have this is what? I of a first time. So talk's why I'm a couple about, who's the speaker in the first talk? I'm Dan's a while a big discussion of the talk very high. I am there
