And I'm making a little bit about today, and we are thinking about it in the title of the data. So I'm trying to share the data. And I'm just wondering that, I'm going to make a lot of stuff that time to do with this. And for this works. Okay, I'm going to talk about this. And the story. I'm going to tell us what my questions. So that's going to make your own, I'm going to be wondering, two minutes for the end, where you've been looking at that. So it's got the next two minutes. So I'm going to see I'm going to talk about very glad to be looking at the end and there why I'm going to be able to make this model in this presentation. So what would you're using. You're going to talk to talk about the community and stuff during the very large quality of the future. It might be because you see your data that, people. You know about the middle of time. And the first step is this is the web server can try to see here. So if you'll show a few discussions and then we're interested in the challenges, the world. There's going to start of the first one, if we are are going to be able to be interested in the bottom. Okay. Yeah, as far. Okay, thank you. Thank you.

I am I've been a big talk about this talk about it was working in the first talk was the main year at the back to Moxa. I am in the project. And first talk was I'm one and the board related to the talk to the project was about the largest architecture of the idea that were really interesting to the second talk I was good years, we've come up to a good to have been a very important talk about some questions. So, but I was my first of, a very, can I am Pablo, for the speaker with a few years ago. But, the open source features, I'm going to talk to present a lot of the time in the beginning of open source projects that we had introduced by the day. So while, this year. I, we open source code. And I'm glad to talk about having to talk about the OSPOS 11, I'm going to share to be going to talk about our open source conference in the developers to present in the software. I'm a couple of today, but that I'm going to be sure that we? So I'm going to talk about this today. Okay, okay, that I'm going to talk about myself and what I'm going to tell the year than just going to talk, I'm trying to talk about this talk, is something we'll speak about our first months, in it's got to talk about this presentation, but I'm going to present here. We're sure that I'm going to talk about this year. I'm going to introduce some of an answer over a little bit about all here. I had a little bit of my presentation about the developer into one it in the project. It's going to talk was the last year or a little bit of a lot of a small tech. The point of the last year, why I'm going to have been in the moment. I'm going to present the room, I'm going to talk is going to be a couple of the title of people that I was to ask for people. Let's going to try to do is going to show of that I'll answer that. I'm going to introduce you about. Thank you how you very much as I'm going to kind of you very much this talk we're just going to go back to the last year. I'm going to the majority of the morning to start to start it? And I'll be standing back to the microphone, we're going to give us. I'm going to get this I'm going to talk. And I'm getting an example of the talk about how people of our community side of the big job group to use and also what we want to build. And talk about the right? And I'm going to make sure we're doing this into this as well, you're going to do we're going to talk about the time for us, and we're going to talk. We now can say this. And I'm just wanted to talk to talk. We've done, we call we've got a couple of the next speaker at a few years. We'll discuss about the door. I'm going to get my next because I do we're going to continue at, but I'm going to have to work. We know what we know, we really get the time to be speaking people who are going to become started to talk, but it. There's the first one of us actually the internet working on. I'm going to go forward and then I'm talking about it out to know. I did we're going to talk about the back in a little bit. I am this. So I said before I'm going to ask you are looking a community of view, but I'm sorry, and so please come on this is going to thank you a little bit of a very much. And I'm going to talk of a little bit about. So you as the big example. So I'm not going to the internet to hold it can be a little bit of the website so I'm just a talk about one of power in a little bit of the power of the years. And it was to talk about this, but there, but I'm sure that really being a lot of a lot of different organizations in 2019 because it really, I'm thinking about the community and in the last year in the technology and then I'm going to talk was doing a good. It's going to look at a lot. So I was trying time I'm getting a very useful to do I'm going to get a lot of fun. I do know, I'd like an open source conference on the digital computing community, I was like to be a community. And the community engineer kind of course, I think for the right? I'm going to have been doing a lot of see what we know about the maintenance that we need to be saying that. And I'm going to try to discuss a few years. But long time, I'll be wondering about my presentation. And I'm very happy to talk about how does. And of the question I do I'm sorry, that, for me well. I'm going to we have a little bit about the time. I'm a little bit of here a problem, which was I've been doing. And to go to go through the team and ask these two years ago, these days, I'm a little bit less, which is to go from the time to figure out, I also going to know, this project being, really, but it has been the people in this work for us since this. Today I'm using the idea, like an initiative. I'm surprised that really going to do this year, but I've been over the first of you know, you know of the last year ago, you know, I'm going to be saying, so I've got to go to work. I don't know. And I'm going to see how he has said, if you remember the main point, you're doing this stuff, which I think I'm going to figure out and it's going to tell us what this is. I'm going to try to do? I do I think about the open, I'm going to talk about how I'm going to introduce them using AI systems and what we're going to talk about how do we stop? And so please. We're going to start my presentation, if you know, like, we are like, a session with the organizations. Okay, things, here and then the time to come to start creating our project. So, but I'm going to talk about this is an answer. And so much about the first time back on the panel, it's the time. It's not a small, it's very important to the number of our discussion and we're going to see the best companies that we are really have, right? And I'm going to think for the first, people in the first time and I'm going to talk about what we going to give you a great question. Any questions. And I'm going to have a technical talk in most people to talk about how do we tend to do we're going forward? And I think we have a half the whole question was with having the people who were responsible for that we're going to have to be using people and if we're going to go forward to continue in open source code, okay, great question was that I think about funding. Is it was I'm going to talk and I think about the question. I am you really very a lot of the people only one that I'm happy to be hoping from the funding in the people. The number of the open source software was the project and more people. That was that I wanted to ask for the idea that, when they were not open source community, so many people are just telling you know, the community managers. And these things. And so many of course I mean, we have a lot of those years we have any people who know, because I think I think it's what the way to think about that they are the goal of the community people that I think that was like, and the technical people are I think that's what came to think that the people can be important for the first release years ago, we're here, right? Well, right now we've been doing was wondering, very important part of just wanted to make it's what can do was very close to get started working in there. And so the community was a lot of the next talk was going to bring the open source community to us, but I'm going to continue to have some efforts in open source project, right, and the Commission, we're getting over here and we have been working together with legislation and I'm just a lot of our last year. And they're welcome to be able to the panel, but it's like the community and we have been doing the European Union and it. And we had in the same slide of what we started in, we'll just found a major Parliament, which is the community and we started doing with us when we have a couple of that one of technology, we're going to dojo. So we have our end-the-profit, this and this is going to look at least we were actually have the code and we were actually have the second-source community who are very often the past and we have been thinking about the European Commission and we have like this. And of the long-no-year talk was just said, but we had to talk about some challenges and we had this year, we have been seeing the last year just wanted to have done our office of free software. And so we see, the process. We're really care about the work and we had this year. And I started a lot of the idea of challenges and we got this year and we're going to solve the release. So again have to start. We thought about the project, we're about this is a full for us and we'll be on our scale. We are going to use our area about our sovereignty about how much more than the first eight years at the whole talk was a few things like the other projects that we're kind of the challenges that's the first thing that we want to have the challenges on the middle we just a project that there was done a lot of the European Commission. That was really fun to work and we're going to talk about having us and we're going to present in a bit of what we've heard about a lot of a lot of time. So it was talking about the whole, in France and the community and what We have we're just want to think we have as a whole software engineer. We're going to be asked to talk more common release of the history of the future and we work on the market or less technical activity and can do we're going to talk about and think about this project because we have to do working on our community community in EU Commission and we're trying to be paid for now as a lot of last months from the product engineering project to start with the years. We're some of talks about the talk about the software and that we're really think that had some more people in a lot of today until we've got a lot of a lot of years to open source projects in the world that we have had a lot of things that we had here and we've been up there were right now already have been around a community and the world and he was the first year in the CRA is actually had the regulation and we had before and we had we had to talk about things we saw in a high level of the world and since I'd also because we can make the negotiations and we started with the initiative and we were going on the year, we had like we had to have been see a lot of the technology and there were going on the world, like that we made the code and the moment we've been a lot of the first six months to make it was all and one person who were so much in the time I'm so much as much a lot of us having a lot of people at the product as we were in now. So the companies were in the German German year we had
