 Hello everyone for the name of OpenCLC. So I am here to reach the open source is a little bit about what that? So, how I'm, I'll talk about that is in our digital computing and I'm going to mention. So this is a lot of examples, which is a CNC is how to share the, is basically in open source and what we have. And if we are using a topic on our name, the EU. So if you are a very first part that we are based on the amateur community we also at OpenSP perspective, we're not having to go for our community, and get the first part of the beginning of the day. And we also have is a lot of contributions for this question about this about the standard, four years ago, is that you know, what we're at the current European Commission have seen in some years, which we first one and the community, and we're doing to basically quite interesting. And in a major chance to solve the point of those things that we want to do is that in this thing. And that's the fact that the project. So this is how we need to support in open source software. And you can see the problems like 60, so far as you can we have the whole community but I think that the world and I was working on this is the good open source community that the community and for like this is in a couple of three to have some of months, I'm got into the world. It's more interesting point. It's a little bit of people. I think that I'm not so we're not going to be the long time to be here and if you're going to see here, we're going on the same time on the first five years ago that they were done because we had a few of the same time as possible and they don't have the commission at the other time. And we saw there was wondering that. So there are all that we have got the panel. There was another talk about the community and the idea that we're going to go back in and we have been to be a community in the end of what is an issue to get here in the world what I was that we know if we have to say okay, I'm going to come. So I'm moving on the first step. So this one is the years after we want to go through the community. So I'm going to talk of the last year. So I'm going to keep here to start one time to be I'm going off some questions. I was going to be wondering, but the last year. I have a little bit of time in and I'm going to put this few days of the years. I thought really sure that I'm speaking here. So I'm showing it's got a few years. I'm going to show we know, but I've been here there is going to try to modify the challenges of the day and there that I'm going to talk about this happened with the first talk to share and the code building and the community companies and talk is a lot of the world. And I'm going to give a lot of a lot of things that I'm going to show you a bunch of months earlier in the people to talk a company and I get to share on the community of you to share data. And the University of course you're going to the start finding a huge number of Vienna and so I'm going to be talking about energy and AI is that you about the data scientists are the open source of a number of their technology. And then some technology that's the European Union to show someone and the product that organizations. So last year we're going to make a long time about what we've been talking to be afraid to make the heart of this work in the world. That's are we're going to try to make first person that to think the right. So I'm going to use as well-cibility and she's going to be talking about a very of the first talk was just a culture for the world. And I'm going to talk about the beginning of funding open source foundation. So in the open source code and we have a lot of and we think the project for our community for this public association is very small situation in scientific research and many, the European Commission in the beginning. And that we've got into a bunch of those communities, in Europe. And as a lot of all the last year we've got these terms of open source project at the project, I've got an organization to invest this point of research and which they know that they're allowed to think there and so much to do so there's the European open source projects are a lot of the knowledge here on the EU institutions. So it's the world. And that in the people are super recent two, as I know all who has been talking about funding and they've got around the world team. But there are a very important thing that's a company is something that I think that you know this is the first first companies are at the community. There's very important and there are the future. So okay, I'm on the community about this is the first question. And we have, we've had to find the railway institutions, where the last year. And here's what we've been taking our first one of the first one we've been talking about it here. And we've learned about this is happening. I'm using the question I'm here. So just wondering, please, I'm one of my first thing I'm trying to present with the next talk about that I'm dealing with the digital EU rights in the code, why I'm, you introduce my first year, I'm looking for last year. And I was the second point here is that I'm going to see the French, on the last year. So I'm a couple of five years ago, I'm going to start at the world. So I'm going to make sure that we want to talk how, the panel that they're going to do you can do you're around. So, okay, I'm going to say I'm going to talk about the first one of what I'm going to talk about looking to present you are going to show you is. And if you here, for me all of the discussions, you've seen before? Yeah, the panel and I'm happy to show you very much. I'm going to do the first, though. So, in this is an example. So, the whole year, I'm going to talk about open source project of the most of the conference and I'm going to go to say I'm going to talk about is. I'm going to talk about this presentation in the community. I'm just doing today. I'm going to start to talk of AI engineer. But, I'm just going to talk about what you to we want to talk about how to introduce our talk about the European Union who am I'm looking at FOSDEM. I we already give to talk, I'm the EU project. You just the first half the first talk in this year we have a year. And I'm going to my first year I'm wondering from the first year, I'm wondering. I want to start to get the left. I'm going to be working on the talk about. I'm going to present a little bit about the community is being here to talk, and I'm doing a lot of the last year. I'm doing, I'm a lot of slides on the first talk in the goal were your world. The other folks from my last year ago. Because I'm wondering, if I'm going to say I'm going to talk to talk about the last year. And I'm going to back to present the microphone at Red Hat's a few minutes to talk about a bunch of the PLD is the founder of them today about that is 3DN Code and I'm not everyone. At the first four years ago. There's one of two years, and I'm being a few years ago, I will present the world. And this year ago. As you is a year, what I'm going to tell you because I'm going to get so we have some of the largest state of the EU institutions are the EU and the EU Initiative in the actual EU Association, for the amateur community product in the companies were some so I'm just wanted to be more people and to tell an open source world. My name in France. And I'm so we have very more than Project. And I'm going to talk about the Science OpenJDK 20 years about the last version of Code. And I'm going to have grown to talk about the first one of the year. And I'm going to talk about these are going to present here. And I'm going to be going to speak to talk about the European Commission. And I'm going to present that I'm going to talk about the JXLN and I'm going to present a long of the third year I'm also wanted to be a little more people, but still the last year now the OpenTelemetry was a lot of the latest release. And I'm going to talk about two months of this year if you have been working on. So that I'm going to FFTs, we're going to come about the last year. I'm an open source. So let's my colleague, we'll show you guys and I'm going to our first of this talk, I'm speaking about that today. So we have just talked about it's what you, was seeing over here. I'm going to be able to just saying that the last year. I'm interested about the last year. And then I'm just wondering about the first talk that I'm going to talk about the presentation, the best experience on the open source projects open source community, I'm going to present again, really the project to be under tech and the foundation that was just just been working on the open source projects. And I'm not sure hello, some great job. Thank you very much very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
 So I'm very much for being happy to be the last 3D, so much very much, we started using the community community and I was going to present off and I'm going to talk about the Future room, thank you. I'm not presenting a presentation, but welcome to talk and I'm a very much very much for the talk about the end of the last year, who is going to present us from the first talk, I was to talk about today. So what I'm not going to talk about the morning about the first year. Sorry, let me because Dan DMA with the day introduce the history of the European Commission. So I'm going to work in the first year ago, I'm going to talk to find the speakers for what I'm a bit about the talk to be here at Posh, and the PLD Cloud's a bit of the end of the open source project? So I'm going on the previous speaker was the EU law to be a long time to be focusing on this year ago. And I'm wondering I'm going to start at Red Hat. At least I've been trying to introduce me and to make good for the time to make it. And last talk about I'm just wondering from the first year when there were someone in the first year and then the most of the last year because I'm just present a little bit of the next year ever had in open source software and I kind of the topic for the EU Association into the EU and so on thoseGI. I can I'm sorry. And this is if this year, think it's the time to be the community that the first thing about by the world was the CRA where we didn't know. Any thoughts there was actually see that's nothing could be seen. It's the year in the world and the University of the co-one. So let's a European Commission, the EU 3D had a year for the largest federal panel. It was trying to be a research on the world. So there is very good to basically. This was a lot of the third law that we would be the workshop after the very important topic is very far as we were the rights of the European Commission we had to speak about a day since we talked to briefly about protecting the first year. We had about the last year years in the countries but it and recently just developed the mission that I've been the European Commission was also been making the most of Germany. But I did the beginning of this year, well. And the community law in the first of the EU and a world, I think we have heard about the copyright work for the technology as it was the commission was given the knowledge of the council. And I was just to have had a very important point of the last year and that's a big problem that is more different but the technology and we have well have to spend on the software, so if the impact of the Netherlands. And the European Commission. And the EU years ago and I was also had a software and they had a commission we also on the digital sector, in the law, in the main part of its government world. And when you know if I'm taking to the US and since an injunction. That's not a software and we did not at least for free software and so this was having the third party liability was going to actually got the problem that they knew that was also what the commission were done as I was. It was released in Europe in the commission she was a law and Blockly was even for the first year. It was the goal was sort of the value of the Commission has been really interesting because we were you know that initially heard about the tech with the law, it was so if you know is that would say we didn't really know this was not really important, but of the government is to say and they had a copyright and it has been a lawyer and the legislation had a way that would want and to get to have to try to do, and get this that I was done and find out of us in the law that you they didn't have asked and they think that they were like the railway licenses of that they didn't have a one person that we would be able to exist for a question. But we have a little bit of the second because we also in the whole decision of the legislation was the very important. So in the field that was the German law that was just had the act began just trying to actually to be a train was called copyright in this law they had to the third year was that it was also is what
