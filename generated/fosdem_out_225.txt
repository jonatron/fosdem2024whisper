 Hello everybody. Thank you very much talk for a first presentation. Thank you very much. 
 So I'm going to introduce me talk here, going to open up again Simon everyone for a welcome. As you. 
 We talk, Mozilla Toucha. I learned to the first welcomea. Thank you have a lightning talk. My name is very much to joining. Thank you very much a very much for everyone for the last round and I have first talk, we're going to the main speaker is about the end of the one of the open source community. So we are the second talk about the project called In the University of those Open Science Foundation which is the US organizations. And we are the European Commission and we have a lot of Open Science. We have been working in Amsterdam and we also about Europe and many months ago. The first year I think I was speaking of the last year ago we had some we had a name here at the European Union in the community. I have the amateur radio community of our first year and the European Commission. And the project. And as a thousand first goal in Germany we are the foundation and he had at the end, and decided to provide a little bit of the time. I guess that covers from the University of Brussels at the European Commission in the beginning of these year. So I would the first days and I am the EU, so I wanted to see everyone in Europe and I'm going to be a national Germany. So, last year. So I've been doing this briefly have also a little bit of my name of our first of this talk last year. It was I'm going to the first day at the next week. I've been trying to go to be happy to spend a more in the European Commission in open source world of law and I'm glad that you. I'm wondering if you know about the beginning of the commission they thought. So in the second talk is that the European Commission by me, you thought he was released very, they had to start with an open source foundation and people can have been involved in the years ago, I'm just tell you know, and so well, you know, as I haven't know, but they were doing a little bit of the years ago, trying to think it because they were using the UK and they were in the main matter of money and they're talking to, and they are in a community. So he was from the problem to really know who are open source software and they learned, no, I'm not just wondering, I mean, it's worth getting it was quite excited. But the people to actually got the community for so, how much as many people were the community we are and we're on the product. And they are we know that I have the success of the tech of the EU and then there have the law, there were a wider field, but there's also a company that it was no way that was it was like the notion that as a law that was a first court by the society, so I was the law and was the US and I had to some of what I thought that he had was the idea of it was related to have, was a directive and they decided to the copyright could be made a national law. The law was called TPM we had a law and said there was also been these key, it was a directive saying that were a technology in and they was a directive and that had no that was a copyright was a that was coming they were a copyright, which was been at TPM and their rights, and they were working keys and that was almost an was a way to a law was saying it was that and then they were like that was a law in law. But I think from the law in this thing and in a civil society that was the law that the European Commission was that the US law. I was kind of a second and then they did I always give a clear open source and what it worked around because there was not a law, which was to be available because once and the fact that as okay. And the European law didn't always care about that the license of what we have was something. And out of course an important to be really take the law where every copyright law of the person was the value in the law of the legislation and it was a state was more rights and the GPL as the only really important value of the parliament that I don't really wanted to buy. And the GPL has said that's what's important point of what I was that I'm that often taking from this big competition law that the EU keys was more copyrightmaking in fact that they had I thought was the GPL. Now we've said as much more difficult And there's quite been a regulation because a lot of the license, the negotiations who said, and said that kind of the commission didn't need to be a decision really did that the copyright license law were affected as far on the law only one of the law that notion that is a law because the copyright and the law would then GPL law didn't be the law. And the law, there was actually infringement would be at the law in law was a law they might be an owner of law because open source law to the EU copyright this copyright law and the legislation was not used to public law. And I said this is no GPL and they could be the rights a copyright act of the public law in the law of the GPL and they wanted we had the law in the Commission was not have on the law as long term is the license to open value for the key in GPL was the German GPL law that they were made in law of sense that law of open science so you know that this other law of law that an GPL law is the CRA, and just don't have to the value so that clause for it's going to have as that a
