{"text": " Hello everybody. So for our next speakers we have Nicole and Philip. So Nicole is from Electomatis and Philip from Bosch and they'll be talking about how open source projects approach functional safety. Thank you. Thanks and welcome. As the title says we're talking on how open source projects approach functional safety. There are so many projects out there so we just took three examples which will be the Xan Zafire and Linux part. So we do together so just to give you a short intro on who we are. My name is Philip as introduced. I'm currently a product manager for embedded open source inside Bosch. But the time where I'm speaking here I mainly do is the chair of the technical steering committee within the ELISA project which works on enabling safety and I'm also leading a work group there which basically puts the different pieces of open source projects together. Then I'm currently also a member of the Linux Foundation Europe advisory board which has been started last year and personally I'm open source into the S since like 15-20 years or something where I'm using it mainly. And this gives time for Nicole directly. Yeah so this works. So yeah I'm Nicole. Yeah I'm mainly a safety person. I started off in production maintenance so not maintenance like a maintainer that you might know but really like yeah something breaks and somebody has to fix it. I went then to software development, been a software developer and tester mainly always with some safety background in the automotive and the defense industry. And then changed to do more safety sort of safety centric work. About five years ago we decided we can do things better and founded ElectroMetres so that's where I'm currently at. Doing safety consulting a little bit of what we heard before the license compliance stuff. I'm in and out of the open chain project. I'm mainly involved with the ELISA projects in the system and the medical group. I'm in the SPDX project in a safety working group. The safety manager of the SEFA project and so on. So yeah if you want to know about open source and safety maybe we should talk. Yeah if you talk to me and I won't recognize you again. I'm not arrogant I just cannot remember your face so please just you know if you know me just tell me hey we know each other. That's completely normal for me that I won't recognize you again. So you can also text me so mainly each social media platform. I have the same handle Nick Pablo so yeah please feel free to reach out. So starting with the real thing. So yeah we're starting about functional safety so who is in the room familiar with the term functional safety at all. Oh that looks good. So for those who aren't so we're not talking security we're talking safety here so that part of the system that should not kill you in case of an internal fault. So yeah it's mainly it's a do not harm thing that the system behaves always in a safe way whatever happens whatever input you have whatever thing that breaks that's a part of safety and the stuff that you need to ship with your product to really prove that the system cannot kill you or most probably won't kill you let's put it like that. So with functional safety the main things that you do expect are yeah that software behaves as specified which implies already that you have a specification that it does not interfere in any way with the system components you have and all around us events are addressed somehow so that you even can avoid them or at least detect them and have some mitigation efforts in there and yeah that you have sufficient evidence that's really proof this. Right and I guess the next one is for me. So as in the title we talk about the three example projects so we have one as the Linux representative while there's so much more we'll later see this. We have a real time OS with Zepfire there are recently also others coming out which claim to have safety certification and may all be open source but this is the one in there and we have the last one which the Xen hypervisor has a virtualization solution and they all run under the Linux foundation projects and to just get an idea on who's in there so we have a large number of members within the Zepfire a few people in Xen actually and then the middle size in Elisa and as you could see from my introduction I'm coming from Bosch so we're doing a lot of automotive work also and with this respect I just wanted to show how different members are because if you think about like medical devices, automotive, railway, industrial parts that's where really safety standards come into picture and if you look into Zepfire it's not really our mobility or ever space member in there it's mainly hardware driven and so we have microcontroller companies, sensor manufacturers and so which really have this visibility in there while for the Xen projects you have some mobility suppliers but it's originated from the server process there's no real car manufacturer in there and what I had here in my also to mention is that they have a bunch of other members in there but we're just not supporting the project as a finance while if you look into the Elisa project there are mobility aerospace system providers in there so from OEM to one supplier base and so we will now go through the different projects one by one just say where they are and how they have common parts on safety and how they differ so the next slide goes already again wants to because she comes from Zepfire. Yeah so I'm not sure how many people in the room already know about Zepfire so Zepfire is let's say the coolest real time art class that you can find out there it's open source it's permissively licensed you can bring it down to a really resource safety as a safety size really even smaller than the Linux kernel we're currently heading for safety certification we have yeah the safety working group that now currently preparing and let's say enhancing what's there in the project so that anybody can take the project artifacts to go through their own certification or qualification or at least has a look into it to say hey that really brings everything that I need for my application at the moment yeah the safety awareness honestly in the community is limited there's a high awareness but quality but yeah safety sometimes really is the hot potato nobody wants to touch but yeah we have this working group and we're working on it and we're getting more and more support in the complete community. What's important still yeah it's posicompatible so for all that that come here from the automotive domain and think hey we need something it's you can use your posic stuff on that and the main part of Zepfire is hardware agnostic so there's a very strict hardware abstraction layer so it's really easily to port from one application or one platform to the other. So yeah San is you. And in contrast if you take San so we saw that it's a much smaller community but they are really coming from a strong security background they were used to have virtualization to isolate systems so in there from the beginning of the project they had a very strong quality mindset which you can see that they have every commit tested they have two different CIP pipelines for this testing they also have a strong rigorous quality process so that they really just have full commit traceability so from the first commit to the end you can see everything which happened which is organized there due to having it in official production also data centered it shows you how much care you need to take because there's a lot of chance for intrusion there yeah AMD silings are those which are mainly driving the San project they are also the ones which work on the safety certification and that's also what they said if you have an open source project you need to do this continuously right because traditional things are often safety certified for one shot and then you have hard times to update things so it's a challenge which many have to follow now and what they said in the first phase they show that actually open source is certifiable that's what they have as the certification concept approval and then they go for what for an assessment if you want to do the same thing in Linux just imagine all the distributions out there the flavors how you build create things life gets much more complicated this is really the open source superlative you have so many contributors such a large code size and everything and then also very large community much more flexibility how user use cases and also in this way I just took some by searching the web some examples from all the companies which making their attempt and how to do this either together with others or independent and it was having a first activity with the social Linux and P project so it was roughly a range of 10 years back already where they worked on it it stopped a little bit it transitioned into the Lisa project which I'm representing and it recently get a new momentum due to what's called the software defined vehicle where you have much more centralized high performance compute cloud connectivity and so on and there is a we want to have more open source usage and bring more things into the space but then the first question when they come to the Lisa project they asked to me when will you have a safety certified linux which I can simply use I was a well that's something which we are not able to provide directly because when you are in an environment you need to make sure that your system is safe and we cannot make sure that you do your engineering properly and we cannot also not guarantee that you follow certain processes which are required we can just give you guidance how to use them and the last thing is like oh will you just have one snapshot which is then safety certified and for that this doesn't make sense because you know how many fixes are getting into a product so there's most likely a vulnerability coming up things are connected you want to enhance features so we need to go on a continuous path and that's something completely new also for traditional safety part works and we always put the disclaimer in you cannot be relieved from your responsibilities so it's like legal notice here but yeah we have different projects which can provide fast forward and as we share same burdens on regulations that goes together certification will be the key part of it at the end and this gets complicated because certification is very expensive so it takes some authorities a lot of checks audits and so on and how this is financed you can see with three different approaches so there's for Zephyr their Platinum members which finance it they get the full access for Xanad's AMD Xilinx which is the business in there they mainly spent the effort in the project and as for Linux there are integrators so the strongest people in their involved is currently Red Hat and Coating they are really trying to bring the things forward and you can also see this difference in there on how open the people are so Nicole mentioned there is the workgroup on safety the safety workgroup when Zephyr it opened last year so there has been always safety activities from the beginning considered but to get a wider outreach this was opened also to the non-platinum members so that there's new inputs new activities the requirements management is a good example which came out of it and a little bit things keep behind the scenes because it's basically then a benefit also for the Platinum member to get the commitment and to guarantee that there is financing in Xan has the approach from AMD they are working on getting code MISRAC compliant which is some special activity which often was asked by automotive and they also provide documentation and their parts upstream so later on for Zephyr and for Xanad if you have the software at hand this is a software which is running on safety systems but you don't know how to use it because you miss maybe a manual or you miss certain test cases or you don't know how to really bring it into picture in the ELISA project or so we really focus on the enablement we don't do a safety certification and it will just enable others so we want to pre-helping pass why we do so code complexity is one reason of it so if you see we have million lines of code in Linux and small footprint in the artist in the hypervisor due to the nature of the software and I don't I put it in here and said it can be easier so I don't say it is easier but due to the small code size you have a much better chance in reaching these things faster but to get code coverage testing and so on you need trainings which Nicole for example does a lot with in the past and currently so maybe Shoddy can give a word on this yeah so yeah asking for what do the people contributing to the safety element have enough skills it's a it's a frequent question and we have different approaches in the different projects so in Zephyr we had a training just by a usual training provider for who was interested some while ago there is the option to have another training for that and we have two committees we have a safety committee and we have a safety working group which are full with as a seasoned safety experts that can guide and train and are just there and to to help people out with open questions the sand project had a little bit of different approach they are very centric about their code quality and about complying with coding standards so everybody who wants to contribute needs to know about Misra and they had even a training by boxing to do so and yeah they have mainly one safety expert that really spreads the word in Elisa we again have a different approach so for the complete community we have open web in ours that you can yeah either dial in or watch them again on YouTube there are the safety experts again in the working groups there are different working groups so there is no direct training provided but you can have the webinars and you can yeah just learn as you go from the experts in there right and then if you think well that's a lot of things which I have to do I just go with the traditional approach I save some money I take a normal artist but then I just took the Linux example you can read it from the left the right or from the right to the left so you don't have hard real-time requirements you don't have safety certification yeah these are some topics but you have a really rich ecosystem portability features experts any kind of hardware support it's two tackle complex products this something which you don't have with a certified artist because it's often proprietary and just for a very limited set of devices so it depends on which point you are you need to tackle both sides you need to see how does my system look like what do I want to achieve where is my complexity and how do I want to solve the complexity for this we put together different working groups within Elisa and created the largest system so it's also why we have this talk here where we really bring an on a microcontroller micro processor base we're bringing different Linux flavors and all put things together to showcase this is the reproducible system however you can make use of because from our mission we say we would like to give you elements processes tools software documentation which brings things forward and this especially means if you have safety critical systems you need to get understanding about the systems so this is what you need call wants to take about yeah so I think everybody here in the room will agree with me to say yeah to assess whether a system is safe you first need to know about the system you need to understand the complete system to see if a system or a subsystem in the system is safe enough so then you really need to understand if this element or subsystem that you want to qualify for safety is in this context of your complete system in a safe enough or capable enough to do what you want it to do really needs to yeah choose which features are important for your safety to evaluate them to qualify them and identify the gaps that you might want needs to fill yourself with your own application with your own basic software with your own whatever so in safety there's this approach for that called safety element out of context so I think the market approach is that you have a safe a generically safety qualified or safety certified system software component whatever that you can integrate into your system and it has been developed without knowing where it will go into so in fact it's not a safety element out of context safety element was an assumed context so whatever you do for example as a sefer or a son you assume what you will need for functional safety and you write this down and you work according to that so typically these elements are then come with obligations they come with a safety manual that you need to adhere to you prove that for your assumed context and that the features that you identified as maybe safety critical for your user that they are developed efficiently that they have requirements suitable implementation that there is test that there's completeness that there's planning and that there are these obligations of use when you want to integrate it to your final system and yeah sounds all very great but we still come over some community challenges or some general challenges when we want to bring open source to the safety world so we will we get a lot of pushback still from the safety world that yeah open source is not behaving like commercial software and we can't do this as a death sentence yeah it's true in the same in this open source project you have less influence on maintainers you can you're not the boss you can't tell them do this what you can do is hey I need this and I'll I'll propose the change to do this and I do it and we will do it together oh yeah it's not it's it's not a top down hierarchical approach there it's harder to bring skills into the community you can just say hey these 20 developers will get this training because they just don't care people tell us hey who so often who will be liable for a certified suffer who will be liable for this who will be liable for that so this is something that still needs more understanding out there because the community will never be liable whatever CRA will say we need a development process that somehow is present in the document saying hey I need to ship this with requirements there needs to be a system architecture there needs to be auditable code whatever that is so really to map map what a safety integrity standard needs from a product and how yeah I guess as we approach the last three to four minutes already yeah I just keep this one short so what we do is we cannot do this alone and we really try to find communities areas where we can collaborate so that's why the project really reaches out to all the different areas seeing what are related activities to go through development and really share ideas and for the sapphire for example can be something to learn from also for other communities yeah so then I also keep this very short because so yeah we try what we are currently approaching is to apply something like a v-model as a knowledge model not like as a process model to the sepah project to really have requirements and traceability and everything that we need so there's a lot of stuff there and there's a lot of stuff happening so we have already said we have two committees working on that there's this safety committee consisting of the platinum members that really do the strategic decisions about a final certification and there's a working group really creating the value for everybody that you can have all the artifacts and all the information that you need for a safety qualification this is a current snapshot of our requirements work we do requirements using stricter stand from stricter is over there and for everybody who wants to know more about that we do have a talk on sunday in the esbombe deaf room around lunchtime for that we also get asked what to do if you want to contribute same thing as always just show up please when you show up and you have ideas you have best practices please share them the communities are all open to that even when you don't know much about safety just show up because everybody will just tell you hey listen and learn and we do this together and when you're a safety person that wants to contribute or that wants to bring open source to their products yeah just become an ambassador for open source and safety because the quality usually is really high the functionality is very high there's a lot of stuff around that can be used and where we have the value through collaboration and not just through yeah purchasing license agreements and all that so we have many value here yeah final thing yeah there is no certification date set so please don't come to us and ask we can we can collect money and bet on that when we are ready we are very far in a lot of projects there won't be a certification for elisa because elisa should help you to certify or to qualify and this yeah elfen and sefer we are on it we are creating the stuff let's say soon and that's it and before you leave we have a little bit swag left over there but not the hat this is
