{"text": " Well, welcome everybody. Lorenzo here needs no introduction. He brought the crazy contraption to give his presentation with. It's almost a dangerous demo in and of itself. Yeah, yeah, easy. And he'll be telling us all about AV1 as we see. Let's go for it. Yeah, you can hear me, right? Yes, sir. So thanks so for the introduction. Yeah, so I'll be talking about specifically AV1 as we see. I'll go, it's in some technical details. So it may be boring here and there, but I really think it's important in order to get a better understanding of how it all works. And this is just a quick introduction over me. So I'm one of the co-founders of a small company based in the south of Italy called Miteco. I'm the main author of Janus, which is an open source for Bouticy server. And there are some links if you want to get in touch with me or learn more. And basically what we'll be talking about today is AV1. And if you're not familiar with what AV1 is, it's a new, relatively new video codec that was designed within the context of the Alliance for Open Media. That has a lot of companies behind it. There's Apple, Cisco, Google, really a ton of them. And what they really wanted to do was to create an open and royalty free video codec. And of course emphasis on open and royalty free because we don't want another H264 or H265, which was specifically designed for real time applications pretty much like Opus was also designed as a codec for the internet. So that was quite important innovation with support for higher resolution, so for KM Beyond. And most importantly, it was also conceived to have support for SVC baked in the codec specification itself. And that's quite important because some other codec support SVC as well, but many times they come as, let's say, later additions. So basically codecs are extended to have SVC supported. In this case, AV1 was conceived with native support for SVC. So all AV1 implementations are supposed to at least be able to decode an SVC stream, for instance, which is important when you start working in hardware decoders and stuff like this. And of course this got me and should get you all very interested because these are all very interesting features to have for different reasons in WebRTC. And SVC is important for a few different reasons. So we all know what CIML Cast is. You use a single M line to basically carry multiple quality streams, like you have a high, medium and low quality stream, both sent at the same time, so that different qualities can be distributed to different participants as needed. But with CIML Cast, each stream is encoded as a separate stream, which means that each stream is also decoded independently of others. But this does mean that you have to encode the same stream more than once. And the fact that they are decoded independently can also cause some challenges sometimes. With SVC instead, you still use the same media source, the same M line and so on, but the different qualities, so high, medium, low, whatever it is, are all layers of the same thing. So you have a single video stream that has like an onion, different layers, that basically make each layer provides more detail if you want to look at it that way. And so the key difference between CIML Cast and SVC is that with CIML Cast, since you have different streams, you also have different SSRCs. Each quality is a separate RTP stream. With SVC, all layers are the same SSRCs. So as far as the recipient is concerned, it's just a single stream, which means that it does require less bandwidth because you can pack some things up and it's more a layer kind of approach. It is sometimes more CPU intensive in terms of encoding because that's a bit more tricky, but it does have some advantages over CIML Cast as a consequence of that. And an interesting aspect is that CIML Cast, as we know it in WebRTC today, actually did already make use of SVC somehow, because when we say, for instance, BPA to CIML Cast, and then we mention temporal layers, temporal layers are not a feature of CIML Cast. Temporal layers are a feature of SVC. So we are basically using a feature of VPA that allows us to use a partial SVC functionality where we can have different frame rates within over the same RTP stream that we are handling. And this is just summarizing it from a visual perspective. So you have CIML Cast sending three different streams and then we can choose which, an SFU in the middle can choose which stream to send to other participants. With SVC, we have one big thing that has many layers. One participant may want to receive them all, another participant may only want to receive the medium layer, and then another participant may want to receive the lowest layer as possible. This is just to give you an idea from a visual perspective instead. And so I was very interested in implementing it in Janus, and here are a few links if you want to learn more about Janus itself. And so I started to figure out what we needed to do in terms of what do I need to do in order to get that working. And so first of all, of course, we need a way to negotiate AV1 and the SDP, and that's of course a given. It may be helpful also to be able to detect keyframes in the stream, and that may be helpful for different reasons. For instance, when you are doing Siemulcast as a server, it helps when you know whether a packet is a keyframe or not, especially if you want to switch on a keyframe or stuff like this. It's also important to be able to somehow interpret how the AV frames are spread across RTP packets, and for us it's especially important for our recordings, because when we record stuff in Janus, we just record all the RTP packets that we received, so that we can go through them later on. And so basically getting a recording in a playable format just means reorder all these RTP packets I received, get the AV1 frames out of those RTP packets, and then put them into an mp4 file to make an example. And this means that we need to know how AV1 fits within RTP, and we show how that works later. For SVC specifically, there is another important thing that is called the dependency descriptor that I'll talk about in a minute. And so that means that we also need to somehow support that in the server as well, which first of all means negotiating it, or extensions must be negotiated in order to be used. We need to know how to parse an extension of that sort, and then we need to figure out how to use the information that we receive in that extension. And as we'll see, 0.5 is the one that got me the most in trouble, and then I'll explain later why. But starting from negotiation is very easy, so you just negotiate the codec name and the relatively clock rate there, so that's easy. Detecting keyframes and support m basically being able to extract frames from packets is a bit more complicated, but that's because we need to start delving a bit deeper, and so figure out how AV1 is packetized over RTP. And that's actually something that's true for all codecs. So for all codecs, you need packetization rules, and that's especially true for video, because for video, typically you have larger frames, and RTP packets cannot be that large. They are usually limited by the MTU size and so on. And so you need to have some rules that tell you if you have a frame that is this large, this is how you split it across multiple RTP packets for this codec, this codec, and this other codec. And usually there are some similarities, but usually each codec has its own rules, mostly because of the nature of the bit stream, let's see. And this is an activity that typically the ITF carries on in the AVT core working group, because basically all packetization rules as RTP and WebRTC are all standards. Unfortunately for AV1, it did not happen in the ITF, so they came up with their own specification, which is provided here. So in this specification, they provide information both on the AV1 aggregation header, that is those packetization rules that I mentioned. So how do I split an AV frame over multiple RTP packets, and how do I get that same frame back when I have access to the RTP packets on the other side? And it also talks in great detail about this dependency, the scripture, which is a beast of its own, as you can see. And this is basically how it looks like from a visual perspective. So with RTP, you typically have an RTP header with all the usual stuff that you all know. You can have some RTP extensions in there, and this is where the new RTP extension would appear. And then you have the RTP payload. And the RTP payload is where this aggregation header plays a role, because as we mentioned, we cannot just dump an AV frame in there because it may not fit. And so we need to have some sort of information that tells us how an AV frame is actually split, or if there are more than one AV frame in the same packet, we need to know that as well. And the AV aggregation header, the AV1 aggregation header is fairly simple, because it's just a single byte with a few bits that you can set. Like, I will not go too much into the detail, not to bore you, but just information about whether these OBO, and the OBO is basically the equivalent of an AL for AV1. So if you know what an AL is for RAS264, an OBO is the same thing for AV1, more or less. So it's basically a unit of a frame. And then basically these attributes tells you whether or not an RTP packet that you just receive is a continuation from a previous frame, so that you know that whatever you're receiving now, you have to append to whatever buffer you had before, whether or not this frame is complete or not, whether you have to actually wait for something else before passing it to the decoder. You may have some information about how many OBOs are in place, which is actually optional, and we'll see why in a second. And then this bit tells you whether this is the packet that you receive is the beginning of an AV frame, which is, again, all of these pieces are very important when you have to reconstruct the AV frame when you receive it, so that AV1 frame when you receive it, so that you know that this is the first thing that you have to put in there, then you pass this year, this year, this year, eventually you again end up with the complete AV frame. And basically it looks a bit like this, so in this case, for instance, we are actually aggregating multiple OBOs in the same RTP packets, and in this case we are not specifying that there are that many elements, which means that for each OBO in there, after the aggregation header, we have a variable size element that tells us how long each OBO is, so in this case we're just going sequentially, aggregation header, we know there are some packets, we check the size, then we read exactly this amount of bytes, and this is the first element, second element we read the size of that, and we go on and go on and go on. And the W attribute over here allows us to save a tiny bit of space when you use it, because if you say that, for instance, there are just two OBOs in this element, then this means that you do need to provide the size of all the elements except the last, because then you can read them sequentially by checking the variable size length until you get to a certain point. When you get to the last element, you know that all the bytes that are left are actually associated to that frame, so you don't need that additional variable element in there, so you save a bit of data, maybe not that much, but in some cases it may be helpful. And to use the aggregation header, I mean I mentioned that it can be helpful in a few different cases. In my specific use case, I basically interpreted that, for instance, not a continuation and a first packet, I can more or less treat as a key frame. It's, of course, not really always like that, but it at least gives me the beginning of something, which is something that is very quick and simple to use when you're actually just routing stuff. You just read a single byte and make some decisions based on that. For instance, when you need to do some symbol-cast-related switches, for instance. For recordings, I needed to do something more complex, because as I mentioned, we need to traversal the RTP packets, reconstruct an obu frame, and an ap1 frame before we can put it into an mp4 packet, which means that I had to actually implement all that de-packetization rules accordingly. And also I had to implement the parsing of a specific obu in order to get some additional information, like the video resolution, because if I'm creating an mp4 frame, I don't need to decode the frames, but at least I do need to know how large it is so that I can put it into the mp4 header, for instance, or maybe use the RTP headers to figure out roughly the frame rate, these sort of things. And all that I've mentioned so far is really all that you need if you want to use everyone normally, just as a regular codec, so we forecast all streams are independent of each other. So if I want to go from high to low, I can just move to the SSRC with the low quality stream, and I don't need to do anything else. The low quality stream is encoded separately from that other one. I don't need to know anything about that other stream, they're completely independent. With SSRC, that's not always true, because you may have some dependencies in place. So if I want to go from, for instance, the highest quality layer, since we are talking about an onion, will very much likely depend on one or more packets from the medium layer and the low layer, which means that I may have to forward those two, otherwise the high quality layer will not work, because that alone is not enough to decode something. And these are all things that you need to figure out at runtime, because you have a stream that is coming in and you have to make a decision right away, otherwise you cause delays and stuff like this. And most importantly, most of the times you may not even be able to parse the payload, because, for instance, if insertable streams are used and the stream is end-to-end encrypted, you cannot have a look at the payload to see what is what. And this is what the dependency descriptor is for. The idea that you have an external component, so an RTP extension, that contains all the information related to the packet that you just received. And this one would not be encrypted as the payload itself, and so it's something that an intermediary like an SFU can use to do something. And this is just one example that comes from the RTP specification over there. There are really a ton of examples. In this case, this is an example of how L2 T3 dependencies work. L2 T3 means two different spatial layers that depend on each other and three temporal layers. So two video resolutions and maybe 30, 20, 10 frames per second. And this gives you an idea of how the dependencies work as a frame goes by. So this is the first frame, second, third, fourth, and so on and so forth. And so you'll see that in this specific kind of approach, the first packet you'll receive will be related to spatial layer zero, temporal layer zero. And pretty much everything depends on this packet over here. And then if I want spatial layer one and temporal layer zero, I definitely need to relay this packet to otherwise this one will not be able to be decoded. If I'm interested and basically you follow the arrows and you have an idea of the kind of dependencies that you can do so that you can choose which packets you can actually drop or not. And as you can guess, the problem is, as an SFU, how do I know these? So how do I know that this is what is happening and these are the dependencies that are in place? And this is basically what the dependency the scripture provides and I'll explain how in a second. And so continuing from the requirements that I described before, it means that if I wanted to have SAP or for this component in Janus, but this is true for each web artist is around there, again, I need a way to negotiate the extension. I need to somehow parse it so I don't, I need to know how it is encoded so that I can figure out what is in there. And then I need to find a way to use it. So for instance, to recover those dependencies there. And I thought that negotiation was supposed to be the easy part, but it's actually not that easy because of course you just need to negotiate that extension with that name as an additional X map. That's how it works for all extensions in the SDP. But it turned out that I also needed to support the so-called two byte header extensions using X map allow mixed. And this is because RTP extensions by default are supposed to be quite small. And so you usually have the so-called one byte header RTP extension where in one byte you provide some information, which means though that the length of the extension is limited as well. So since you are using one byte to convey a lot of information, the size of the extension itself cannot be more than, if I'm correct, more than 16 bytes or something like this. I don't remember now exactly. And the dependency, the script though can be much larger than that. And so you do need to support two bytes extensions with at the time I didn't. So I needed to implement that first in order to get it to work because when I started testing it, nothing worked and it turned out that this was the issue. And then we need, once we have negotiated it and we start receiving the dependency, the script, as part of our TP packets, we need to figure out a way to parse it. And this was really a nightmare for me. This is like therapy for me right now because I'm sharing all this with you. And I actually run to the about this in a couple of blog posts where you can see the nitty-gritty details. But just to give you an idea, basically it's, let's say a mess. I will not say that word because I don't want to be bit. But basically you can see that this is a specification that was written by somebody who writes codex, not a network specification because all fields are variable length and often at the bit level, which makes it really a nightmare to parse sometimes. And from what we regard the specification itself, it's indeed quite flexible because there are a few mandatory fields like if this is a start of a frame and end of a frame, the frame number, and the template ID for those dependencies that we've seen before. But also everything else is optional, which means that you can either have a dependency in the scriptural element that describes everything, so the whole context of the SVC or just something that tells you the scope of the current frame. And when we look at how a dependency in the scriptural really looks like, this is a simple parser that I created to basically debug things offline. And when we receive a keyframe, typically we have a 95 bytes extension, which if you know RTP, that's a lot. That's basically almost 10% of the payloads that you have. So it's really big, but that's because it contains a lot of information. So if you start parsing it and serializing everything that you receive, you have information about the different layers that you have, spatial temporal and so on and so forth. TDI, I don't remember exactly what it was, but this is just the output of that tool. That's a lot of stuff. So blah, blah, blah, blah, some more chains, some more stuff, the code layer targets. I have some stuff about resolutions. And finally, we're done. Basically, all the parts that we've seen before were basically the media center telling us, these are all the information that I used for this specific SVC context. So in this case, this was an L3T3, so three temporal layers and three spatial layers. And all those, that huge stuff that you've seen before is all the information related to chain dependencies, all that kind of very low level stuff. And so if you want to use it, it's there. And then at the end, it also tells you the resolution streams of the three different spatial layers. In this case, it was low because I captured really at the beginning, I think. And finally, it tells you that for this specific RTP packet, this is a spatial layer zero, temporal layer zero, and it uses template index number one, which is indeed spatial zero, temporal layer zero. And this is the information that we need because then having a look at all the stuff that we've seen before, we know that the resolution for spatial layer zero is, in this case, this multi-mover here. In practice, it would be something like 320 by something else. And this is it. And of course, likely not all dependency descriptors are so long, only for the meaningful key frame packets, it's usually like that. And then other dependency descriptors will be much smaller, like only seven bytes, because they will only tell you, for instance, the temporal index of this specific packet. In this case, it is a spatial layer zero at temporal layer zero. But I only know this because I received this before. So I received somewhere in time this huge chunk of information before, because if I only receive this and I get temporal index six, what is six? Six relative to what? So what does it mean? I don't even know how many layers there are. So you do need to have that information first if you want to make sense of all these smaller packets that you receive later after that, which means that when you start to implement stuff in a server, it does mean that you start need to keep a state, which is not really true for single cast or other things. I don't mean it's partly true, but only in a very limited way. In this case, it does mean that anytime that you receive that huge packet and you parse it, you need to keep it somewhere so that when you receive packets after that, you can reference them and use them for something. And the idea was that once I have a knowledge of those templates and I receive information and I know that this packet that I just received, this spatial layer X and temporal layer Y, then as a server, I can decide whether or not I want to relay it or drop it. And you can do it the relatively easy way or you can do it the hard way. The hard way is figuring out all of those dependencies that we've seen before. I went for the easier way, especially right now. If it is temporal layer 2, then relay everything related to spatial layer 1 and 0 as well, as long as it's the same or let's say the temporal layer is smaller or equal to the one that I'm receiving. So I may be relaying more than I should, but at least I know that everything is there. What's important is that once you use that information so that once you've parsed it, you cannot drop it. You need to relay it anyway because it's not only helpful to you, it's also helpful to the subscriber that is receiving that video stream because they also need to know what is what. So you need to forward that information as well. And very important, you also need to update the RTP headers accordingly, including the marker bit, which is what really drove me nuts the first time because I actually implemented all this for a long time and it didn't work. And eventually I figured out that the problem was that I was not updating marker bits as well. And this is the reason, basically. So if we have a sequence of RTP packets related to different spatial layers and temporal layers, this is basically what it looks like from an RTP perspective, including marker bits. If I am dropping spatial layer 2 because I don't need it, then what it means is that I'm dropping some packets over here. So of course, all the packets that I'm dropping, I need to update the sequence number so that it keeps on growing monotonically because otherwise the recipient will think that they are missing, losing some packets, but they are not missing them. They are just dropping them because they don't need them. So I need to update the sequence number so that this is one, this is two, this is three, this is four, five, six, seven, etc. So I need to make sure that they know that they are not really missing anything. But I also need to update where I'm setting the M equals one marker bit as well because this is needed for b-decoating, especially from Chrome. So in particular, you need to set M equals one on the last packet with the same timestamp. So since the timestamp now is changing on the second packet, because that's the last packet with that timestamp over there, I need to set M equals one on that second packet before I forward it or otherwise nothing works basically. Sorry, wrong direction. And basically, if you want to test all these and with Janus or with anything else, of course you need to have a browser that supports all this stuff. And the kind of bad news is that at the moment I think only Chrome supports it. I don't know if other Chrome-based browsers support it too, but definitely Chrome supports AV1 as a codec. And you can check that by using the RTP sender get capabilities thing to see. If you see AV1 in that list, you do support AV1 as a codec. But you also need to support SBC functionality and most importantly the dependency, the scripture. And the dependency, the scripture is not offered by default. So you do still need, I think, to first fill the trial like this. I don't remember right now if you can just manage the SDP to artificially put the extension in your SDP in order to make it work anyway, but that I should check, I should double check. But you may need to launch, for instance, Chrome with that thing over here so that the extension appears in the supported extensions by the browser. When you do that, then your browser is capable of encoding AV1 SBC functionality with dependency and scripture, which is quite important. And if you want to test this, I also made it very simple because if you go on the online demos for Janus and you check the eco test demo you can provide a couple of attributes to, first of all, for AV1 as a codec and then for a specific flavor of SBC, in this case, for instance, L3T3 to send three temporal layers and three spatial layers. And when you do some small buttons appear over there and they allow you to check one thing or the other, which means that you will send the big AV1 SBC stream to Janus and Janus will send you back only what you asked for. So in this case, for instance, spatial layer one and temporal layer two which is why my resolution is smaller and the bitrate is smaller as well. So by playing a bit with those things you should see resolution changing, bitrate changing, if it does, it works. And the same functionality is also supported in the video room, of course, which is the SFU to do video conferencing. So at least in theory you can have a complete video conference that is based on AV1 SBC as well, even though we haven't tested that much but it should definitely work. And I think this is it. I'm not sure if we have time for questions, but before that, I also wanted to announce that, I'm sorry, I'm bothering you all, but JanusCon is back. So JanusCon is our own Janus conference. So it's a conference devoted to Janus and WebRTC in general, which will happen at the end of April in Naples in the south of Italy. We have a few sponsors already which I'm very grateful for. And the call for paper ends in about a week. So if you have anything interesting doing with Janus and WebRTC, you can feel free to submit a talk there. Well, tickets are also available for sale as well. And of course, if your company is interested in sponsoring, that would be great too. And that is all. I don't know if we have time for questions because I didn't really check how fast I was going, maybe too fast or... Okay, so are there any questions for anyone at the C part? I see a couple. I think slow me with... Generally, would you say that the SBC is like the generation of simulcast or if we continue, whether we look at the future of people on the platform that will replace it or they will need to get the sale by sale? I mean, in general, if you look at, for instance, if you look at that... Oh, sorry, sorry. Slow me was asking, is basically SBC or evolution of simulcast or does it make sense to have them both at the same time? Which one will take... Which one will be more important in the future? Which one is the technology to invest in in the future, maybe, as well? And functionally, I mean, they serve the same purpose, if you want, because I have the same demo for simulcasts and if you look at the demo for simulcasts, it looks visually the same. So you have the same buttons to say, I want high quality, low quality and so on. The difference are really in just how the thing is implemented. And the main problem, I mean, in general, SBC is supposed to be more advanced, of course, than simulcast and more resilient as well, probably. But the main obstacle right now is that it's related to what I was saying before. So right now, if you want to use AV1 SBC, you have to do a custom flag, which means that right at the outset, it's really not something that you can ask your customer to do, for instance. So for the moment, it's not really something that is production ready. You can use the SBC flavor of VP9, which provides a similar feature, which is now available out there. But still, simulcast is overwhelmingly favored in general for production environments because it's been battle tested, it's been there since day one. Everybody supports simulcast, it's easier to work with and so on and so forth. So for the moment, it doesn't make sense to just use force SBC in your production environment right away, if not for experimental purposes and for testing how it works, for dipping your toes in the technology. But for the future, I definitely think you should pay attention to that because AV1 will be the code that everybody will adopt, hopefully because it's better quality, it's royalty free, it's open source, and it has SBC baked in. Sooner or later, hopefully Safari will have AV1 as we see, Firefox will have it, Edge and other browsers will have it as well. And you definitely want to be ready when that happens because otherwise you'll be the one stuck with the old codec and everybody else is taking advantage of the new team. I think learns that you can munch the SDP to make it work. For the extension, yeah. Because we have it working new team. Tuzlomi, there is one thing that in some environments might be relevant which is as many hardware decoders don't cope with SBC, but they do with Samocast because they look like a normal strain. So if you're in a resource constrained thing, maybe receiving SBC is no bueno, but receiving a normal Samocast will be better. But in theory, these will not be true for AV1 because AV1 was conceived with SBC in mind. So in theory, all hardware decoders, too, even smaller ones, will know how to interpret that. And since it's a single stream, they will be able to decode it. Of course, it's just theory and... Ideally they would. For VP9, for example, Chrome still does not use hardware decoders when you use SBC. And I'm not sure because AV1 hardware support is hit and miss yet still. And there was another question here, yeah? Yeah, I was wondering what the forward error correction strategy here is, like, is this patient, if there are... I'm sorry, if forward error correction is used, how do you use it with do is I mean... Yeah, if all the use forward error correction is SBC, then you are like, helping out some tactics and then it doesn't work. Yeah, that's a good question. And it's actually related to one of the doubts that I have related to FBC, mostly because I mean something like AV1, SBC and CMUCAS as well only makes sense when you have a server in the middle. It doesn't really make sense if you are sending something from point A to point B and point B is the one that is meant to receive it because in this case you are sending everything anyway. So unless you are using SBC as some sort of a... of your redundancy mechanism because you say, if I lose some packets related to two, I can still display one. That's one thing, but that's not really what it's meant for. And so the moment you have a server in the middle, it also means that you can offload the forward error correction stuff to the server as well. So which does make sense also because, for instance, when you use FlexFec, which is the thing that was described in the first presentation from Chrome, Chrome by default will not put any redundancy information, so it will not put any FEC packets until the peer tells them that they are losing some packets. And this is to optimize stuff, so you don't add redundancy unless it's needed because there's loss reported, which becomes a problem if you're doing something like a video conference because your uplink find may be perfect, and then you have subscriber X over here that is experiencing loss and you don't have any redundancy packets to send them instead. So the idea and probably the solution to that, this is something that I'm still brainstorming myself because FEC interests me, but I have some doubts there, is that probably the forward error correction stuff is something that the server itself will need to add on each subscriber leg. So from the server to you, I will have a dedicated FEC channel where I add some forward error correction stuff from the stream that I'm sending you, and for the stream that I'm sending you, the layer 2 may not be there, but I have a consistent stream because packets are in sequence, and so the forward error correction stuff that I'll be sending you will be different from the one that I'll be sending to somebody else who is receiving additional layers, and that's probably the only way to do this if you don't want to forward FEC and to end without treating it, which anyway wouldn't be useful at all, especially if the sender is not providing that information themselves. Yeah, in my experience, and this may be an implementation choice, of course, I did have to forward it because otherwise it would not be decoded properly, basically. And I don't know if this is actually really needed, like for instance, even the marker bit 1, that's not really needed from a specification perspective because as a receiver, you do see that the timestamp is changing, so you do know that it is a new frame and you can decode the previous one. But it's simply that Chrome expects that marker bit set to 1, otherwise it will not decode a frame, basically. So in my experience, you need to forward that information too. And I guess it makes sense because the recipients themselves also need to decode possibly differently the video stream depending on what they are receiving because they need to know if the resolution must be this size or this size or this size or something like this. It may all be part of the 81 bit stream, so it may be redundant information as far as they are concerned, but at least when I made these tests a few months ago, it was needed, so just relaying it makes sense. Yeah. In regard to switching this layer, like saw your previous talk somewhere was on bandwidth estimation, maybe you can comment on how they do go together or is there something specific to 81? Yeah, no, I mean the bandwidth estimation stuff is important for a few different reasons. And in this case, I'm talking about the bandwidth estimation on the subscriber side. So from server to recipients, because on the publisher side, there is transport-wide control CC and basically the browser themselves are capable of using the feedback to figure out if they need to send less or more. And so dynamically, you may see that some special layers are not appearing because the browser doesn't have enough bandwidth for that. On the subscriber perspective, it's really useful because it allows us to it helps with the decision. So for instance, right now I just mentioned just generically whether I want to relay or drop a packet, but this actually depends on why I should relay it because a user may want to receive the highest quality possible, a user may want to receive the lowest quality possible, but this may be because they only want a lower quality because the video is going to appear in a thumbnail and so they don't need the whole thing and that's an application logic decision. And now the decision may come from the user doesn't have enough bandwidth for all of that stuff, so they don't have enough bandwidth for special layer 2 and 1. Let's just send them special layer 0. And this is where bandwidth estimation helps because if I'm sending stuff to the subscriber and I'm starting to get information that congestion is happening, then internally the server can update which special layer or temporal layer I should send to this specific publisher dynamically. And so this will impact my decisions to relay or drop stuff and so it allows me to dynamically dynamically impact the quality of the subscriber depending on how much bandwidth they have. And in my experiments right now I've only done this with Siebel because I haven't hooked it up to SBC yet, but the key principles are really the same. One minute? Yeah, just related to that is there a way or Wipen Web to signal the final cast of the publisher and the subscribed site? Yeah, I mean for the final cast or SBC. Of course, yeah, in Wipen Web do you with Wipen Web is there any need to signal Siebel cast or SBC as well and does it make sense? And in general, I mean it's definitely important that you signal it on Wip because you want to make sure that the stream that you are ingesting is recognized by the server as a Siebel cast or an SBC stream so that the server can also parcel of those dependency descriptors in case it's a one SBC for instance or in case it's Siebel cast it knows that it needs to take care of, let's say, three different qualities. On the subscriber's side for Siebel cast it's really not important because you're just always, as a subscriber, you're just always going to receive one video stream and as far as you're concerned it's a consistent video stream. You don't even know that there is a switch behind the curtains that is happening from high to low to medium or whatever. You just see a single video stream so you don't need to be aware of the fact that it's Siebel cast. For everyone as a SBC it may be important to negotiate the dependency, the scripture extension as I mentioned because if it's needed for decoding purposes and you want the browser to be able to decode things properly then you may want to negotiate that extension as well on the subscriber's side. But as I was saying before it may or may not be needed so that's something that we'll have to check. And I think I'm really out of time now so. Thank you.
