{"text": " Okay, thank you. Good morning, good afternoon. Thank you for having me. My name is Luca. By day I work as a software engineer in the Linux systems group in Microsoft in the Azure organization where I manage the Azure Linux OS that runs on the infrastructure there. By night I'm involved in various open source projects. I'm an assistant demantainer, a debian developer, a DPDK LTS maintainer, a bunch of other stuff that I consistently forget about. Now, if you read the title of this talk, you might think, hang on, was that really intended to be that provocative? And the answer is yes, yes it was. This is my yearly talk to make new friends. But of course I tried to mean it in a positive way. So I want to provoke some thoughts and discussions, see what we can do about this that I consider a problem and that I think we are in a good place to start fixing. But first, even though everybody lives and breathes secure boot, some background, if you're not aware, if you work on bootloader, so boot system, you already know all of this, but just one slide. So in the beginning we had BIOS, everything was great. The security model was low as if. In the 2000s we got Ufi. So Intel, Microsoft, a bunch of other people got together and created this new protocol for firmers. And it actually has a security model, which is nice. Now, it gets a lot of mud thrown at it. Every time there's a bug in the news like the logo face stuff, people are going, oh, why do we need secure boot? It's always broken anyway. Well, having a security model doesn't mean that everything is perfect or never breaks. It's software. It runs on computers. Of course it breaks. The point is that we have a process to deal with it and we have a natural security model to follow. So the way it works is that there's a chain of trust that starts in hardware. So for example, Intel boot guard. So the hardware verifies the trust in the firmware. The firmware verifies the bootloader, the bootloader verifies the kernel. The set of keys and certificates used are stored in the firmware. I won't go into details in that because it's not too important for this. This is generally called secure boot in a nutshell. Now, this in the 2010s, thanks to the work of a lot of people, like the government and many others, Linux joined the party finally. We were shut out of that ecosystem for a while and by default, distribution couldn't boot on new hardware. You had to go and fiddle with the buyers on this secure boot. This changed in the 2010s. So we have Shim, Grab 2 and the kernel lockdown stack and distribution can work again by default. They are signed with the U-featured party CA. You get your Shim signed by Microsoft and then you sign your second stage bootloader like Grab or System Eboot with your distribution key. And then we have this patch set in the kernel that was called secure level in the beginning when it was out of three. Then it was merged as the lockdown LSM later that basically tries to protect the kernel and the firmware and the hardware before the Xeboot service is called. Xeboot services is an API call in the U-fe interface and when that happens, a bunch of things get locked down. You cannot change secure viable anymore. The firmware goes away and a bunch of other things. It's very important to protect the system before that. So this is what this ecosystem tries to protect. Secure level also tries or lockdown tries to separate UAD0 from ring zero. So the theory is if you are root, you shouldn't be able to change the hardware or the kernel memory outside of what should be allowed. So this is not perfect. It went a very long way and it fixes a lot of problems. It's not perfect. Of course, it's softer. It's never perfect. But yes, the idea is we have this boundary between UAD0 and ring zero. And this has been working for 10 years or so. It's great. We moved, we have no trust whatsoever to having trust until the point we start the user space. And that's great. But other operating systems are way far ahead. My course is way far ahead. Android is way far ahead. Windows is way far ahead. We do nothing for user space so far. But in the past couple of years, we've been talking a lot about how to fix this and things are starting to happen. So this is the next level. We'll have a unified kernel image. And by the way, Renard had a talk this morning about UKIs and I think he might have mentioned before as well in the previous talk. I could not get him because the room was full. But we've been talking about this stuff for a while and there were at least three or four talks talking about these things. So you might have already heard about these concepts and we'll repeat them again in a different context here. So what we are trying to do is extend that level of trust and security and authentication to user space. For example, the E30 right now on any generous distribution just sits on the boot partition on the ESP and anybody can offline or even online that has write access that can inject anything. And they're just built locally. They're unverified. You add a backdoor to the prompt that asks for your locks encryption password and you wouldn't have any idea because it's completely unchecked and untrusted and verified. Unified kernel images try to fix this. The unit RD is part of the PE binary that gets signed so that the shim or the firmware verifies it before loading so that we can extend the chain of trust a little bit further into user space. At least the first part of user space, the unit RD. But that's not enough. We want to go further because once you go to your root file system for the unit RD, well, that also is unverified. Now, Wacuzov is working on the IP, Intervity Policy Enforcement or Execution or something like that. It's a new LSM that basically allows you to write a policy that says any binary that runs on my system in user space must come from a DM Verity volume that is signed by a key trusted by the kernel. DM Verity is a mercury system to do online verification of block devices as they are loaded and opened. It's a very, very nice interface that has been available in the kernel for 10 years or so. And with IP, we can use this to move the chain of trust into the full user space. So now all the code that runs is fully verified with a chain of trust that goes back to the hardware. With discover of these images, we can also protect further payloads, so containers, end-spon containers, portable services and other things that are attached to the OS. If you're running a read-only system, you need some way to attach new applications there, of course. And with DDIs, you can further extend the chain of trust again in the same way for those payloads as well. So we put all of this together when we have the shim and lockdown stuff for the boot process and then UKIs for the InterD, IP and DDIs for user space. We have a very nice system that chains back to the hardware and implements a full root of trust. And that's very nice, except for the kernel command line. This is just stored as a plain text file in system debut type 1 BLS. So it's a type of boot images supported by system debut or in grab as well. It's just plain text file. If you have root access, you can write whatever you want there. If you don't, it checks, that just gets out there and run. It also can be edited on the fly if you have access to the keyboard, which probably is fine on a laptop, because if you have access to the laptop, you're probably the owner. But if you're on a server, owner of VM, or a confidential VM, that's kind of bad, especially for the Taster computing case, because the serial console is just a device owned by the supervisor, which is outside your PCB. So why is this a problem? Because it has become kind of a kitchen sink. Just for the kernel alone, there's that document there, which is very nice and documents a lot of options available. It's 7,000 lines long, and itself says this is not a complete list. So we don't even have one list that says, okay, this is everything you can do with this untrusted, unverified interface for your machine, which is not ideal. Also, I checked, I'm not a kernel developer, but I checked as far as I can see, the very first parsing of the kernel command line happens in the kernel's EFI stub before Exiboot services. Remember I said before Exiboot services is a very important point in the boot process that before that you want to protect your system. You'll be really careful about what happens and what is allowed to run and execute and change the flow of execution. Now, you can use the kernel command line to configure the kernel to do things like disable a Cerenox, disable IP. I talked about a moment before about IP. You can disable all these security components using the kernel command line. And it's not just the kernel that you configure. It's called the kernel command line, but it's just a command line. You configure everything and anything in user space. Everybody sees it by default. It's approximately aligned. It's there. Everybody has their own parsers. The custom written to parse it and read it, and it's used for absolutely everything. And again, this is bad for confidential computing. The Cereconsole is outside of the TCP. So this is a difficult problem. Now, of course, there are historical reasons for this. It's super convenient. It's amazing. You have a problem. You just press E to edit a debug, and then you can get some debug logs if your machine doesn't boot. That's amazing. That is super useful. But I think we're getting close to the point where we need to make decisions and whether we want to allow this always or in some cases or disable it completely in some other cases, because it is the last bit missing, as far as I can tell, in the security story of the boot process on Linux. So for system reboot, we have decided to stop allowing editing the command line and supplying untrusted sources of input to it when you boot UKIs. You cannot do that. And we made a lot of friends with that decision, I can tell you. So the problem is, of course, the flexibility is gone. Can we get it back? What are the use cases? So one of the main ones, the root FS auto discovery. In this case, you would do root equal, devs, da1, or whatever. Now you probably may be using a UGID to identify the disk so it doesn't switch partition. You don't lose booting. We have something called the discover partition specification system that is supported by our tools. So basically, the very quick resystem reboot tells the intrad where your root is. It automatically finds it based on UID set on the partition. So this use case is very well covered now. I already mentioned UKI, that we mentioned very frequently as FOS, so I go very quickly through this. You can add a command line to the UKI when you build it. It's very easy with UQFI, our tool to build UKIs. But of course, it's one entry. It's a fixed entry. The UKI is meant to be shipped by the OS vendor, and that is very not flexible, of course, because the OS vendor doesn't know what you need to have on your OS to make it work. Now we have a future plan. We'll get to this this year, but you'll be able to actually specify multiple options. For example, your OS vendor will be able to say, I have my kernel command line, which is the default one, and then one that has debug, and another one that has factory reset, so that you have multiple options. And in your boot menu from system reboot, you can select a non-default one if so you wish. This is very hard to list, and I get Leonard to implement that very soon, but he hasn't done that yet. The other thing we have, so system is tab is the small UFI stub that is embedded in the UKI, the first bit that gets loaded. So we added this thing this year called addons. Again, they can be built by UKFI, and what they are is they're just PE binaries, so they are signed, so the firmware verifies them using the secure boot certificates before loading them, but they don't have code. There's just a kernel command line configuration. So you can use this, and system is tab, we automatically load them if it finds them. Again, through the firmware, so verified and signed and trusted, and then you can use that for extending the kernel command line that was in the UKI, and that is fixed. This is really meant for platform owners. So for example, if you want to set crash kernel equals some amount of memory, that's probably the same across your whole fleet, at least for the same devices, so you can use the same addon everywhere to set these cases. Again, we want to add selection to, right now every addon will be used. We want to add a menu to let you select which one you want a boot in case that is needed, but we don't have that yet. It's again on the to-do list. Next thing we have extended extension images. This can be used to extend the IninterD. So you can drop them in the ESP, they are the invertees, so again they get verified by the kernel, and given the IninterD 2 is fixed, we can use this to extend the IninterD with additional code or configuration. It can be used for both configuration, overlay none ETC or code overlay none USR. Again, we don't have any way to select which one you want. We just pick every one, every extension image that we find in the ESP. And also you can embed them in the IninterD if you want and extend the router fast with this, or download them at running time to extend the router fast when it's read only. Finally, this is my favorite one, and I think this should give us enough flexibility that we can start to talk about actually disabling this stuff by default. So credentials are a very simple concept that we added to system this some years ago. They are just key value pairs. The key difference is that they are scoped by default. They are only visible by user space and only by services they opt into them by key. So in your service you say load credential key. If you have a credential for you name it there and it will be loaded. Everybody else will not see the content because they can be encrypted. And we are, I think we have that already, if not it will be ready very soon. You can encrypt them ahead of time if you know the TPM's public certificate for the SRK. You can encrypt them ahead of time for any machine. And they are decrypted only when the service starts and reads them. And only in the namespace view of the service. So they are fully isolated. Nothing else outside of it can see the credential. And you can drop them in the SP again in a per image or global directories. Again we don't have selection. Everything that is found in this location is picked up. And we are starting to add support to every system component and outside of it to use credentials to configure things that used to be configured with the Cora command line. So your networking can be configured credential. Your users, your autologin, your root password and a bunch of other things can all be, which you need to start. Like literally hundreds of things can be configured using credentials. I have a pull request open. Hopefully, as soon as I figure out the TPM measurement story, but we will also allow you to create new credentials from the boot menu. Like when you have a system boot with type one or grab two, you can edit the Cora command line. You'll be able to on the boot menu to just type credential and then a name and then a value. It will be passed to by system D and added to the interface so that it can be used. So I think this is very powerful. It's something that should give us all the flexibility, most of the flexibility that we need. Maybe. Is that enough? We have GPTO to discover for your root for a system. UKIs, add-ons, extension images, credential. Is this enough to cover all the use cases that we need in the 90% or maybe 95%? Of course, there will also be a case where you have to go put your hands on a machine that is completely broken. What you do in the case is you disable security. You break glass. You take your node offline. If it's a server, you take production workers away, you debug it. You disable security and then you can do whatever you want. Let's say 1% of the cases. Are we there yet for the 95%? That is an open question. I hope we can have some discussions about this. We also have a Secure Boot 2.0 comment. We are starting to think about it. Should this say something about what is allowed or not allowed to do to the kernel before execute services? It's kind of an important topic. Should it be a specification or should it not? Now, as reviewers and maintainers of your space components, I think it is time that we start to say, hey, if you're adding a new option via the kernel command line for my user space program, please at least also add a credential to it so that we can use both at the very least. And is this a full term? Most likely, but we still try because we are trying to push the envelope a bit forward every time and hopefully we'll get somewhere. So I think that's it and we have three minutes for questions. Oh, thank you. I was fast. Questions? Please. So you said about selecting crude partition, there was this discoverable partition specification. How you handle multiple installations of the same distribution like free fedora installations on the same disk? So the way this works is that system disk... Sorry, repeat the question for the microphone. If you have multiple partitions, multiple distributions, and start at the same time, how do you find out automatically what their disk is? The basic stuff is that the way system deboot system disk actually finds it is that it tells the initardivia EFI runtime variable which disk the ESP that was used to find the system deboot or the UKI was on. So you get the root of the disk. And then the auto generator there takes the disk and only look at that. So if you are installing with multiple disks, then we select the right disk like that. If you have multiple root partitions on the same disk as well, then I have no idea how we do that. I think we recommend to use different volumes for that. I think there's some way to do it. I don't remember to be honest. I need to look at the generator. There you go. So use a different UKI for the different root of FES basically. Yeah. Or again, with the credentials, we support credentials then for the auto generator yet? So we should add that. So that's probably a good way we could configure with the credential. But this is made so that by default you find the right thing for the simplest case. And then of course you need configuration for the complex one. If you use the same disk for multiple root file systems, well then you need to tell which one to pick. And that's one way. And I think we it is configurable and we should have credentials support for that. So you drop in a credential and then you decide which one to use. Yes. But it's a good question. That's a BTFS question. How to deal with starting from difference of volume on butterfests? I have no clue. I don't use butterfests, but the meta people here do. Do you have any other? I don't remember. Right. So yeah, it's not supported right now in the specification, but there was a buzzer, I think. Patches welcome. As usual. Yes. Yes. Anything else? Please. So the question was, can we use the auto generator when we create the UKI? The answer is yes, because then you would use the kind of command line. But if you are generating UKIs locally, our idea is that the UKI is generated on a server somewhere by your vendor. So I wouldn't work in that case. You could create a credential when you install it, for example, to tell it actually going and figure it out from that idea. But yeah, if we do support building UKIs locally, we have kernel installed plugins for that. It does work. And yes, you could do it that way. Yes. Yes. That could work if you're building locally. Yes. Sorry, that was according to the UUID in the UKI itself. And again, yes, it can work if you're building it locally. Yes. Anything else? Yes. And no, it is not a workaround for broken EFI variables. We added this so that we could configure autologene in VMs. I think that was the first time we added this back then. But this is a way to, again, the main use case was to be able to have secrets that are encrypted against the TPM and are not visible by default. So the services don't have to implement encrypted and decrypting all the stuff because that is hairy, especially against the TPM. That was the main use case, to have this as sealed stuff that is only visible by the service in its main space only when it runs. That was the main use case because normally a lot of times you configure secrets by environment variables and things like that. And of course, that is bad because environment variables are inherited now on the process tree. And you don't want your secrets to leak down to all your child processes. So this is one of the reasons we added the credential concept. Yes. So another question for credentials. What is the scope of credentials you load from this ESP? Is it the whole EUNITRD you can see it or some? The worry, so again, they are obtained. So sorry, yes. What is the scope of credentials loaded from the ESP? Does the whole EUNITRD see them? Yes, if they obtain. So your EUNITRD is trusted and verified and signed. So you build a configuration, you say service, full and bar can load this credential. Service, ABC, don't. So only full and bar that have opted in will see that and it will be decrypted for them. But yes, anything in the EUNITRD can obtain and I think we transition them across as well to the full OS. So they will be available also for services running from the after EUNITRD to full OS transition. Yes, credentials are awesome. You should check them out. They all, by the way, the slides are online and all these things are links to the actual documentation. Anything else? I think we have two minutes. I have a pretty dumb question, but let's say I want to put an RO on the kernel and online. I do that with the prediction. No, because that is for the, depends. Is that for the kernel or, oh, sorry, sorry. If you want, if you want to put RO on the kernel command line, would you do that on using a credential? Depends who's reading that. Is that for the kernel or is that for a user space in EUNITRD setting up your root file system? It depends on the case. If it is for your kernel, well, probably you want that in the UKI itself, because it's something you want your image to run in that configuration state, so you put that in the UKI itself. If you want that to only for certain cases, then maybe you can use addons and only deploy that on the machines that use the same image, but with a different configuration. So the answer, yes, it depends. There's many ways to do that and depends who's reading it and what the use case is and if you want that to be the default or the non-default on whatever else. I think we have, okay. Thank you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 16.04, "text": " Okay, thank you. Good morning, good afternoon. Thank you for having me.
