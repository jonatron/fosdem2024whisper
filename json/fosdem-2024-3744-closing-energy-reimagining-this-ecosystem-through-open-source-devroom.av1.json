This was our second year we had the energy deaf room. We started, maybe we can put this off. Well, we started with half a day last year and we extended it virtually. Yeah, you were attending the virtual room last year. Yeah, and we kind of had a feeling that there's going to be more attendance if we have a full day. And I think this demonstrated it pretty well. Like, from the beginning in the morning until like basically now it was only like a few sessions maybe not completely full. So thank you very much for sticking around and I hope to see you next year.
