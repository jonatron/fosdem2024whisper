{"text": " Thank you very much. Hello. Good afternoon. Hope you're all well. Not cooking up too much in this room. My name is Manuel, so I'm a radio amateur. I renewed Nerd if you prefer. I like experimenting with new or older equipment, see what we can do with it, or use existing software or hardware and deploy it as widespread as possible. If possible, within the amateur radio community and keeping things open source whenever I can as well. So today I'm about to talk about cutting-edge technology straight from the 1990s, pagers. So if you've seen those things, well, it might bring you back some memories because they were heavily used in the 80s and the 90s. It was used by mostly doctors, drug dealers, or businessmen, sometimes the three at the same time. So basically they were everywhere in the 90s and started to disappear later on when GSMs made their operation. But this was something really common. In those times, you can still see it in TV shows, medical TV shows, getting paged, the doctor's getting paged because there's a code blue, whatever that means in room 204. Now, I'd like to explore this thing because behind this hallmark from before, they're extremely simple communication systems. And I think it's worth exploring them a bit more and see what you can do with it today in the open source community and the amateur radio community. So today we'll be looking at what is paging in itself, what does that mean, how does it work, generally speaking. We'll go a bit into the technical part of it. So how it works, the modulation types, how you can make a pagering, and then we'll bring that into the amateur radio context. We'll talk about the DapNet project, which has been around for a few years now, what you can do with it, how you can get started, and then I'll be open for questions if you have them. So coming back into the techniques, let's talk about paging in simpler terms. Paging is basically sending a message, making a small device ring one way or another, very often to small, low-powering, compact receivers. Most of them use a standard which is called PoxSag, which was developed in the 1980s, but much older standards exist and are almost not used anymore. So PoxSag is one of them that remains. The other one being developed by Motorola and proprietary, but we don't talk about that here. The topology is always the same. You've got one big transmitter, high power, and then you've got your receivers around that receive the messages whenever there's one. So the frequencies, you have them starting in 8-chef, I should have put that. So you've got pagers on 27 MHz and then all the way up. Here in Belgium, the national services use 160 MHz. In other countries, you will see them in 460 MHz and sometimes even higher in the US, they're all up to 900 MHz, if I'm not mistaken. So you see them on a lot of different frequencies, and you also see that compared to a classic two-way radio, the antenna is built into the device, which is itself a challenge because it means that your signal needs to be higher in intensity to be received by those antennas because they perform a bit less than the standard WIP antenna. Use cases in the commercial world, you'll find them, for instance, for one single hospital to be able to call doctors or industrial scale systems or sometimes a bit bigger. National scale being one of them. Here in Belgium, we have one single frequency for a distributed system of transmitters operated by Astrid, which is used by firefighters, ambulance services and others, so it's still being used today. You will see them also in foot trucks or in order to take away food courts such as if you've been to the wolf two days ago, you'll receive a little pager that would have rang, sorry, whenever your food was ready. So this is also a pager in itself. How does that work? As I said, it's using one single frequency, a specific carrier that we modulate in FSK, so simple frequency shift keying. You send a zero by shifting one way, the other way is a zero, so just by shifting one from one to another, you send one zeroes and then format it into very simple packets. So very often, please mute your radio, just saw it. If you want to send a packet usually, you send a preamble that wakes the receiver up because those receivers usually sleep for long periods of time and wake up from time to time to see if there's not a preamble for them there. And once it wakes up, it will start decoding the signal and then it sends an address and the linked message. And if the address doesn't match the pager's address, it will just shut down, go back in sleep mode, so that makes for very power efficient receivers. So this thing can last up to one month on one single AA battery. So yeah, that's pretty much the idea. Again, if you want your pager to receive a message, you put the address into it, basically. So if you want, for instance, to program this message, which is aimed at the pager with the address 101, you put the address 101 in the pager. If it receives it, it displays a message and rings. Otherwise, it will just stay asleep because this is, for instance, a message for 102, not aimed at the pager itself, it stops ringing. Now, you can also make group alerts that way. So it's quite simple. You just put the same address, recall the RIC. You put the same RIC across all pagers and if they receive it, they will just ring altogether at the same time, displaying the message. So that means that for individual or group calls, you basically address one individual ID to a single pager and then you put one common group ID across all pagers. So you can select if you want to address one person or a specific group and you can organize your system this way. So it makes for a very simple type of receiver and then you can see yourself when you're building the network how you're addressing each pager or each group of pagers. Poxa-Agonamator Radio is not new. It's been done since the 1980s. I think it appeared at the same time as paging itself, so we started filling with that a long time ago. We use the TNCs connected to old VHF systems and yeah, the thing is you had to modify the pagers themselves very often by changing quarts and retuning the receiver loops to make sure that it felt between the amateur radio frequency allocations. But very often those were individual stations used for bulletin board systems at the time, for weather alerts or that kind of messages. So it kind of disappeared when packet radio really folded after the 90s. So right now the only thing we know on packet radio is mostly APRS or the more widespread you use is IPRS. So BBS, you don't see them anymore and the technology got lost in the ages. But now we have easier ways to interconnect stations together using HandNet for instance. So you now have IP links that can be made on amateur radio frequencies quite easily with modified Wi-Fi equipment or others. And there's a team from the Akan University of German Radio Amateurs that developed a network of internet-connected Poxa-Agonamators using free and open-source software and that is the DapNet project. So DapNet stands for Decentralized Amateur Paging Network. The idea is to have various core servers that are geographically separated, interconnected via HandNet, that exchange the messages through multiple nodes. So if you have one, fails, the others will take over. Now of course if you're outside of that HandNet link, you can always get a bridge through internet and this is what I'm doing here because I don't have an HandNet link here. We still haven't brought the HandNet links from Germany up here until unto Brussels. But you can go either way. The frequency is almost universal. Depending on your regulations we try to stay on the same frequency everywhere which is 439.9875 megahertz. That's a mouthful but that's the one we try to use everywhere. The only exception right now I see is the Netherlands because they don't have the access to this frequency so they're using a frequency on 432 if I'm not mistaken. But I mean from with this pager I can use it basically in Belgium, in Germany, in Switzerland. There are some transmitters in France as well so it's growing little by little. Now for addressing transmitters they have to be synchronized one way or another otherwise you have several transmitters that start keying up at the same time and then we'd interfere with on another. So they split up in time slots so if you have two overlapping transmitters you'll put one that transmits on one time slot and the other one that will transmit on another time slot. Just make sure they don't transmit at the same time. So what happens is you send a message on the DapNet infrastructure and as I said this only records basic numbers so there's no call sign you can encode in there. So there's a database on the DapNet infrastructure that links your call sign to an identifier. Very often we put the DMR ID because this is a way to identify hands with numbers and then it matches to this specific rig, this specific address, sends it to the transmitters that are linked to the area we selected so you can key up all transmitters or regionalize your calls. So you can say that if you know that the person that you're trying to reach is in Belgium you put Oscar November dash all. If you want to reach an area in a specific province well you can narrow it down and try not to use the network as extensively and just try to reduce the load if you know where your person is. Same for Germany, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France there's this same kind of geographical way of cutting the transmitters. You can also make group calls so there are we call them rubrics and you have some for weather alerts, DX clusters etc etc. I'll come back to this in a moment. So what can we do with that? Well pretty much whatever you want. You can send messages manually to a specific pager via the handpager.de website. There's an Android app, I think there's even an iOS app but I don't know what's the status on that. Via the DMR infrastructure from Brandmeister, from APRS, from Tetra, so basically sending a text message from your radio will make it land on the DapNet infrastructure and then it will relay it to to your person you want to call. Then there's an API you can use to send weather alerts. There are automated messages for urgent alerts which will make all the pagers ring for example. DX clusters as I said or status on space solar flux conditions etc. That is something that also is also sent every four hours on the platform. You could also build something for a repeater telemetry or any IoT advice that you want but again keep in mind this is a network aimed at amateurs, for amateurs non-commercial and please keep in mind that is maintained by volunteers that do it on the free time with servers they have access to so don't start bombarding the network with telemetry that sends every second to the status of your fridge because that would be kind of a problem. So say reasonable but this is the kind of thing you can do as long as it's non-commercial. Now how can you get started? As long as you radio amateur with a call sign you can register right now there's a website to submit the tickets and we'll create your account. So once you do that you have access to the platform you can send messages if you want to receive them you'll have to buy, modify or build your own pager for the 439 megahertz frequency. That's one thing but then you need a transmitter somewhere. If you're lucky enough to have one within your living area you're good to go, enjoy. Otherwise well you can go your own way and install a hotspot at home or you can make it a nice project for your local radio club and build a wide range transmitter for everyone to enjoy. So there are two ways you can go. Speaking of specifics, acquiring a usable pager is relatively easy today so as I said before that you had to buy second hand pagers, replace a quart, retune the receiver chain but today we have more frequency agile receivers that have PLLs instead of the quarts that can be directly retuned or directly bought to work on those frequencies. So one of them is the AlphaPok 602R which I thought I had, yeah I have it on loan but here it is. So this one costs about, I think it was 90 euros when we checked on the AlphaPok website directly from Germany. You can buy it on Aliexpress but your mileage may vary. So that's a way to get quickly into it. You could go higher range and buy those commercial ones which are a bit more expensive but work as well or you can go the DIY and free open source routes and build your own using open source software like a project I've been working on which is the ESP32 pager which Bastia also improved a bit on the UI side because that's suck at UI but basically using a ESP32 Lora deathboards you can make it a Poxhack pager and have a receiver for quite cheap. I think those deathboards are about 15 euros on Aliexpress as well right now. So it's built on on radio lib so also freely modifiable so have a look if you're interested. As for transmitters you have two options right now for hotspots you can use if you already have an MMDVM hotspot well you're all set you just need to register it on the DapNet and activate the transmitter so that's one way if you want to build a wide range transmitter things can be extremely simple because you just need a small single board computer such as a Raspberry Pi, an FM transceiver you fit it directly into the audio unfiltered path of your transmitter and then well you're good to go so basically it requires four components the transmitter the Pi a transistor and one capacitor so you can get on the air quite quickly. All our transmitters are being worked on again Bastia is working on a ESP32 transmitter to make a small hotspot even cheaper if possible so again quite easily reachable. So where does that leave us? For me it's quite an elegant solution to receive text messages on our own independent networks having fun in the way learning how to use basic systems implement them and deploy networks that everyone can enjoy and it has its uses for telemetry or others you can do weather reports emergency messages text your friends via pager send silly jokes and the challenge of having it to fit within 80 characters so there are ways to make snappy jokes and intelligence ones at that but I think that thanks to the DapNet network the arrival of audio cars that can act as TNCs instead of using an external module it really made the thing much more accessible so if I'm able to SSH into my hotspots I can make you a quick demo of how that works so give me a quick second who's got a pager here? One? Nice? Nice? Nice? Very nice that's already one depending on what you registered in it I don't know if I'll be able to make a drink but so basically here you have my personal pager this is one from a friend I just borrowed and this one which just died on me which is not a problem in itself I'll just make this presentation shorter oh no it's alive there you go so those all have their own individual addresses so this one is 2069009 206500 sorry this one I don't remember this one is address 100 so I can make this one ring specifically I just key the transceiver up say I want to make the trans the pager number 100 ring please work don't make me look silly there you go so right now you have only this one ringing so I just made an individual call to this one now let's imagine I want to send a group alert for I don't know some weather storm weather coming up or a rare DX spot happening right now on on 18 meters 18 megahertz sorry so then I can make everything ring at the same time 1040 and then everything rings and it's just a nightmare and I need to confirm that otherwise it will ring again so there you go quite simply using basic addressing basic open source software this is just the hotspots just an MMDVM here running in the background and I can directly key the transmitter up if you have access to the DapNet system right now I think at least two or three of yous have access make you can make an individual call to myself there you go he just sent me a message on my on my pager and what did he just say how does a SQL expert get it how does a SQL expert get a date okay nice very nice nice so there you have it if you have any questions oh yeah there's another open source project that is just coming up with it where is alexander hello didn't see you yet if I'm not mistaken you worked on a pox hack decoder which is getting finished up as we speak for sdr plus plus so yeah I think it's important to report that as well sorry I didn't get the time to fit it into the the slides but again if you have any questions I'm I'm just Jesus Christ thank you for your attention and yeah I'm only yours all right I hear a question do we have a microphone or I'll repeat the question so I live quite close to an old school pager site yep they transmit very high power on vhf they do what causes interference a lot of other stuff whoo okay so you know in practice how much power do the transmitters in this network need to be useful and what happens when the pager misses a message is there a transmit or do you go to get one shot um well very often in professional network I'll start from the I'll repeat the question first so you have problems there's an interfering pager transmitter next to you because it's using high power so how much power we're using and second question sorry short term memory is what happens when the pager misses a message if you what happens when you miss a miss a message so the first one being yeah for commercial systems very often they who use 200 300 watts for transmitters because it needs to reach inside of parkings and the antennas are lousy at best so you need high power to get through for amateur radio systems it's less of a god now everyone is trolling me now in um yeah for amateur radio systems very often we don't go to that imperative of being able to reach everyone to through parking lots so very often the transmitters are 25 watts to 50 watts I mean higher up would cause problems such as what you're talking about but yeah usually we keep it low and we just add more transmitters here in Belgium is a problem because every time you add a transmitter you need to pay for an extra license so I mean we're still limited a bit legally speaking but it's not a problem in Germany or other countries where they don't pay repeater licenses or they're much cheaper speaking about missed messages there are two mitigation measures well actually just one is repeating message if it's lost it's lost if you don't get it that's it because there is no way to send an ack so either you receive it or you don't and that links to the first problem that's why the commercial systems use high power so there is no store and forward system in paging so yeah that's a small small limit other questions yes you don't need a call sign to receive signals specifically on radio amateur bands so you could perfectly use an sdr or I don't know buy a pager and put some public public messages but to be able to receive individual to you or to be able to transmit or you know at least access the platform you would need an amateur radio call sign but I mean radio amateur is much more than paging and I think it's worth looking into it if you don't have a license yet I'm not going to start into my big talk about about that because I've done it for about 25 times today but yeah there's a lot to discover and that hobby and might be worth looking into it if you have the time to access that hobby other questions yes yes it does it does you can change the ringtone you make it make it go beep the blue whatever you can even compose your own ringtones on some of them yes p32 pager actually has a provision for you there are different tones and you just compose a music you want so if you wanted to make play Tetris go ahead there was one question here and then you no question here okay what's the frequency range of the receiver the receiver so the receiver itself could be tuned pretty much anywhere on the UHF band so 43440 but the problem is it's using an antenna loop so a loop antenna so it has a very high q so you need to tune it yeah it's 70 centimeters yep yep there is one there is one I would need you have internet you're connected to the custom network here yeah if you're looking to hand pager dot de you should be able to at least get the address book so yeah my time is up thank you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 10.46, "text": " Thank you very much.
