{"text": " Hello. So this is our talk about the spot nuts. It's a Techist Tinkering project. So first who we are. I am Pingu. I am 14 years old. I'm a member of the Techist community. I began hacking like four years ago or something like that. I'm interested in Python, home automation and stuff and obviously Penguins. And I also work at the Alexis project. And my name is Snick or Dominic if you like longer names, three to two. I am more or less the founder of the Techist community about which Penguins will say a few words right after my introduction. And here I'm working in the intersection between education and free software. It means I'm showing young people what free software is, what the values around free software are and also helping develop and promote free software for education institutions. And in my day job I mostly spend my time as a trainer for Linux administration, PostgreSQL, Rust and Python related topics. Yes, we mentioned Techist. It's a community based in Germany. Our goal is to create a comprehensive technical word for and with children and like to empower young people to question things and hack and build stuff like this project or the Alexis project. So here you can see where we were. This is an Alexis meeting. This was in I think at the Frostconn, the second largest conference in Germany. This here at the left side is our summer camp, name taking sun, where the trials come and then learn something like I think they are soldering things together and then programming it. So now what is an offline finding system? It's basically you attach something to something like a small tech, you attach it to your backpack, then you lose it and then you open some app on your smartphone or on your laptop and then you can find it or search it or don't find it. And the more technical offline finding thing. So the tech sent a signal via Bluetooth because it's offline. So there isn't a connection between the tech and the internet. Then an app like a helper app on your phone gets this Bluetooth signal and then says, hey, I found this tech there. And then I as the owner can go on my smartphone, search for the tech and then my phone search in the database for the tech. So how we got into offline finding. I'm very steady. So my scooter, like my scooter to drive in the city got stolen and then I had a Samsung smart tech like an offline finding tech attached to it. And then we drove to the approximate location and then with the feature that we can send a signal to the tech and the tech response I'm here, we could see where the tech was basically so what where signal was. And then we did three literation. So we went from multiple sites to it. And then there was a signal at one point and then we got a scooter back. And also there's our sketchy chef there. And he always loses stuff and wants to get it back or find it. So offline finding basically has three components. But the tracking tokens, the small devices that you attach to the things that you want to find, they aren't connected to the internet because then it wouldn't be offline and sort of use like some like and then there are the smartphones or some small helper devices. They get the signal from the tech and then send it to the internet. And then there's obviously a server where the messages like I'm here and there is a pack are sent to and then I can get them back from there. So there are obviously some challenges. Some are privacy related like a stranger must not abuse the beacon for tracking over the long term. And they should not identify the owners because then I could know where the stuff of some people is. And the back end, the server couldn't identify the owners either because then I as the owner of the server could identify the owners. And yeah. But some are also technical like the encryption without knowing the receiver because then I can identify the owner then Bluetooth because of the range and yeah because of Bluetooth. And then because of Bluetooth also the energy efficiency. Yeah, because at one point we tried out in ESP. How long would it last? And I think we did it with Shah 256 hashing and like lasted for a couple of hours. Because it's small and I think a couple of hours aren't enough for checking device. Yeah, design overview. All right. Thank you. Yeah. So after we somehow got snubbed by this by this topic around offline finding how this works, of course we wanted to try how far we can get building such a system. Of course, somewhat motivated by our grumpy, sorry, I mean, a sketchy, sketchy chef who asked, hey, is there some system like this based on open hardware, open source? I'm not so very excited about Apple controlling where I lose and find rediscover my stuff. So first, what we first it was we looked at how the Samsung smart tech system worked, which is the sort of tech that Pingu had attached to the scooter. And we found out that it sends these strange beacons of some sort using Bluetooth low energy. I will come back to that in a minute. And in the course of time, while we looked at how this works, we've it's more or less became obvious that actually this sort of system is an enter and encrypted mailbox system, because there is an owner device and this has a public key and yeah, what you can do with a public key, you can receive some sort of messages. And there are helper devices that can see these beacons and more or less just send any sort of message to the helper device. So if I lose something as the owner and let's say Pingu wants to help me find it, then they walk around in the city and their smartphone receives the beacon signal and now they somehow need to get the information back to me, telling me where they saw my beacon. And that's where these texts come in and they are as probably as dumb as you can imagine, they just send out a public key and yeah, so all the information you need to somehow get the location sent back to me. It's a macro incident that these messages carry location information. We could just as well put anything in there if any of you are into this sort of systems. Apple had a few vulnerabilities discovered in their implementation. One of the most interesting ones in the recent weeks was that people actually used the beacons themselves to transport key logger information out of otherwise air-gapped environments. I think using your favorite search engine or the search engine you distrust, least will bring some really interesting information up about this. So what we really want to build is a mailbox system and some sort of key management system because that's the really interesting part as far as I'm concerned, how we solve these privacy issues and some of the technical issues with cryptography. So this is the big picture. If this works I can zoom around in this a bit and now it shows that I should have used the headset. Can I do it with one hand? Yes, I can. So here's the big picture and what you can see here is all the red circles are showing secret keys that I use in the system, the green circles are showing public keys that I use in the system. Let's get a short overview of how this works. So we have the owner device and we give the owner device a sort of main key. This identifies the owner device and the easiest thing we could do now is we could make this Bluetooth beacon and simply copy the public key of the owner onto that beacon and attach it to some bag or scooter or some flash squirrel or whatever you don't want to lose. So at this point we more or less are done with the mailbox part and with the encryption part but we got into all the privacy troubles because what you now can do is you can follow the tech around. It always broadcasts the same public key information. You can just walk around the city and always rediscover where one person is moving and make a nice motion profile of this person. Also you could discover several tokens that are linked to the same owner device and get the information that all these tokens belong to the same owner. These are two of the most inherent privacy issues that you obviously don't want to make when designing such a system. So the next thing we do is we derive using hash based key derivation some keys or one key pair for each token so that we can unlink the tokens from each other. And the rest of the system in case I think many of you will have heard about this term a ratchet algorithm and the rest of the system more or less is very close to what for example the signal messenger does with the scriptography. We transfer this this key pair this device key pair to the tech and now we do one key derivation every let's say 15 minutes at least that's what Apple does. And the interesting part here because I never worked with cryptography on this level before is that now we can derive new key pairs on the tech and it will send out another elliptic curve public key every 15 minutes. So we fix the privacy issue of following someone around. Now you can follow someone for 15 minutes and after 15 minutes you see another beacon and you cannot distinguish whether this is the same tech which rotated its key pair or some other tech of another person. Yeah that's more or less the main secret of the system and then if I find the tech I can send a message to the public key it is currently broadcasting and there are some other things mixed in here but I don't want to go into too much detail about this part right now. And the second secret is that when I try to retrieve my location information that all the messages that other send to me I just ask the server for all the information sent to all the public keys I know my tech will have generated within the time frame. And this request can also be encrypted because we also use another set of keys so that the server can also not find out that all these keys are linked to my device. They should have zero knowledge about the ownership relation between the techs and the owners. Okay our experiments are implemented in Rust. We have split it into the spot nuts crates. Hazel OS is what is supposed to be running on the techs and the helper device in Rust based mobile app and in case you happen to need or happen to find the time to review an implementation of signals, X-Ed SDS implementation in Rust. We also factored out this crate so you can tell us what obvious mistakes we made in the cryptography there if you like. And the JG crates are a general implementation of this message of this mailbox system which can be used for the offline finding system but actually for anything that is supposed to carry public key information to someone and allow them to anonymously send back some sort of information. So what we have? We have this implementation of this general JG key exchange and Maywork system with a library usable as an alpha version and a small server implementation that actually does not care whether it is used for offline finding or whatever other purpose. And we have an experimental version of Hazel OS for ESP32 with the limitation that Pingu already mentioned that we get the ESP32 development board to run for something like five hours. So how long did you take to get your scooter back? Did you manage to do it in five hours? I don't think so. Okay you have to be quicker next time when you switch from some. Best thing so we can either fix the technical issue or you can start a running career so whichever is easier. Okay so next things we want to do is we want to find a decent microcontroller. I happened to give a Rust training last week and one attendee told me this ESP32 this is nothing to do with microcontrollers. This is a toy. Get a more hardcore microcontroller and I think this is what we will try. And for Hazel OS to this we need to build an experimental companion app. Maybe design a nice PCB so it don't have to attach a breadboard with a development board to your scooter or stuffed squirrel or whatever. And maybe we can find others interested in open offline findings standard because Google and Apple and Microsoft and you name it are working on something like this but of course it's not so very openly developed. Spotnuts is a tinkering. Thank you for the talk. The question is how do you allow the helper device to send the message to the owner device and at the exactly same time don't allow some stranger to track the owner. Somehow at the feeling that at least one of my slides went missing when refactoring the slide deck. There's back an infrastructure. One thing I mentioned is JGD which is just a small mailbox server. It just has two API endpoints. One receives messages. It does not care what these messages contain. They are just JSON encoded encrypted messages to the public key we saw and the owner devices they just ask hey do you happen to have received any message for this public key I think I might have had. So the thing here is you can actually even in the Apple ecosystem you can ask the server for all messages you like. You can just send public keys there and they will give you the information about all messages that were sent encrypted to this public key. The nice thing is so you can download the whole database from Apple servers as well. The nice thing is you can do anything with it because obviously you also need the second half of the key pair. If you don't have it you get a nice bunch of random data. Over here. Hello. It's here. Over here. Would it make sense to make this key rotation time period not fixed at 15 minutes because if I was following a tag I could time the key rotation based on the period and then know that it was rotated at the exact 15 minutes. Yes. Bit of silly question but have you considered Linux mobile support for the helper device? Can you repeat the question please? Have you considered supporting Linux mobile phones? Supporting mobile phones to carry the... Is it a part? That's running Linux instead of Android or iOS. It's supposed to be a web application which will need web Bluetooth support in more browsers than Google Chrome but actually there's this Rust library and it should be easy to use it in any sort of app that you like on any platform. That's great. Thank you. Thank you again. Thank you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.56, "text": " Hello. So this is our talk about the spot nuts.
