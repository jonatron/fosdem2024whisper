{"text": " All right, thank you all for coming. So next up we have a very exciting topic, 5G and Modem Manager. Have a round of applause for Alexander. So let's talk about Modem Manager. Let me know if you don't see me because I'm not sure if this is going to work very well. I read about me first. I think I'm going to keep it like this. I have been the Modem Manager, Maintainer and Developer for the past 12 years and I've also been involved in developing and maintaining the two libraries that we use to communicate with Modems, which are the QMI for the QMI protocol and the MBIM protocol. I'm not working at the Google Chrome OS team since two years ago. And this talk is going to be about not only how we're going to add 5G support properly in Modem Manager, hopefully, but also how we added 4G and which are the issues that we had when we added 4G and how we are going to overcome these same kind of issues when developing 5G support. So we will look at what went well and what didn't go that well with 4G support. So before I joined the Modem Manager project, there was already support for 4G in the sense that you could connect the Modem, it was using 4G and the Modem will tell you, hey, I'm using 4G and then we will expose it and that's about it. So we were treating 4G yesterday as a different mode, we had 2G, 3G and now we have 4G, nothing else. So when I joined the project, I started to review the 1.0 API suggestion that were in the main list and the major focus at that time was to support multi-mode devices. So at that time we had two separate families of Modems, we had 3G, 3G-Bb-Modems, GSM, MGS, LTE, then you had another family which were 3G, VB2, you had CDMA, EVDO Modems for 2G and 3G. So 3G, VB2 had its own standard of 4G they digitized and then they started to use LTE as the standard 3G, VB2 Modems as well. So we had these strange 3G, VB2 and 3G, VB, Modems, multiple modems that had to be managed kind of in the same way, but it was very different in nature. Like 3GPP modems require a SIM card, 3GPP2 modems, most of them require to have some kind of activation with the network to bind your user account to the device itself, and it was a manual activation, automatic activation depending on the carrier. So there were many different things. And managing these new multi-modem devices, we thought this was the most important thing, but it wasn't, because 3GPP2 no longer exists. So can anyone tell me which main feature of 4G we missed? Because we didn't think of it. What's the mind here? No. Much more important than that. Actually related sometimes. So what we missed is the idea that when you attach to the network in 4G, you are actually creating a data network interface between the modem and the network, even if the host hasn't seen it yet. So you actually get an IP address, full data setup, communication between the modem and the network in the user plane, but the host knows nothing about that. And why did not we catch that? Because most operators didn't really care about that. They would allow you to send a blank APN during the touch, and then that was fine for them. They would tell you back, which is the APN that you are using. That was one approach. The other approach was that the settings used for data connection were actually going to be the same ones as used for attach. So you actually, when you kind of connect, you're actually configuring profile number one, which is the one used for attaching Qualcomm. There were lots of assumptions happening at the same time. There was also no consolidated approach to define these settings in non-protocols. The NBIM 1.0 spec did not have a way to specify attach settings. And many of the APIs that we developed at that time were based on looking at what NBIM capable modems were doing. So there's a use case where this does not work, which is when the settings are different. And so in 1.10, we added the support to explicitly specify attach settings. This is the case of Verizon, for example, where they have one specific attach APN and one specific date APN. So now we were able to say to the network, okay, we want these specific settings for registration, and then the network will tell us, then, yeah, you could have those, or you could have like a subset of those. You may ask for v4v6 and then only get back physics. So that's a very, very common thing that may happen. And this was added very late in 1.10, like many years after the 1.0 device API was introduced. Another thing that we missed in 1.0 was the support for profile management. So right now, up until that moment, the way you connect the modem, you specify all the settings that you want in the connection attempt. And in 1.18, we added the support to say, we already have a set of profiles, maybe even provided by the modem itself, because when you insert the sim card in the modem, the modem itself will build, not build, but with some carrier-specific settings, with some predefined profiles. This is very common in US carriers. So you insert the Verizon sim card, the modem boots, with already profiles defined as the way Verizon wants them. And then in that case, you can just say, connect profile three, and that's about it. So we did miss that. We missed some other things, which are maybe not as important as that one. Where did we do it? So the first API that we defined for 1.0 had multiple PDN connections in mind from the very beginning. Even if we did not support them in the same way as it's implemented now, at that time, we had modems that would expose two network interfaces at the same time, physical network interfaces that we could choose, okay, please connect this one to this APN, please connect this other one to this other APN. The multi-PDN support that we have right now is based on multiplexing, so we can have one single physical network interface, but then we can say, okay, I'm going to connect three different PDN connections, I'm going to create three different virtual network interfaces. And then the host can assign different data flows to each of these PDNs separately, because you have three different network interfaces, so you can do all the routing logic in the host itself. And this very same support was used to support Qualcomm SOC boards with the IPA driver, for example, which requires multiplexing by default. Now, where are we right now with the 5G support in Modem Manager? The picture is very similar as what we had before 1.0 for 4G. We just have the way to say that we are using 5G. We can say that we are using 5G SA networks if we only expose 5G access technology, but we also have the way to say that we are using NSA, so we are registered in 4G and we will use a 5G extra-barre when the bandwidth requirements happen. And that's about it. We don't have any other 5G-specific feature for now. What are we missing? So I'm not going to talk about 5G-specific features that apply, for example, in the radio interface because Modem Manager does not really care about any of those. We only want to be able to support things that the host is aware of, and that is completely hidden to the host. So one of the things that we are going to try to support is 5G Slicing, which is this important word that if you investigate about 5G, it's everywhere. So in 4G networks, there is no clear separation between different types of UEs. A UE is the combination of host and Modem. And so in 4G networks, you don't have any differentiation between different UEs. They are all treated in the same way. And in 5G, they do define specific types of UEs with different quality of service requirements. So you may have a UE that wants to have a bigger bandwidth. You may have a UE that wants to have an extreme low latency. You may have UEs that may send data to the network once a day or twice a day, but they need to be spread across a very big area. So in order to support all these different kinds of UEs, 5G introduces the concept of slicing. And so with the slicing, you have one single physical network, but then it can be logically divided into separate virtual networks. Each of them with its own quality of service requirements. And the separation, this is very important, goes up to the base station, which is something that 4G did not have. So imagine this UEs case. We have thousands of people here and for them, all of them with a phone, and all of them trying to get access to the network. There's congestion, there's a lot of radio interference between older devices. With 5G, what you gain is that you could have a phone using that slice that has a specific base station only for that slice. And so you get priority access to the network through this slice. And this may happen even with the same PDN. So you have one single APN that you want to connect to to the internet. You may have different paths from your host to connect to that same APN, based on the quality of service requirements that you have. Now 5G, as I said, is a logical partition of the physical network. And they are defined, they are specified or named by something called single NSS AI. It's a really bad name, I think. And so how are we going to support this in model manager? There are two main things that we need to support. One is during the registration, we want to specify which is the slice we want to connect to. At the time of registration, and we can't do that. And then you may ask for multiple slices, the network will give you back, okay, you are allowed to use this, you are not allowed to use this one, and you also have available this other one. So this is one simple way of binding, for example, all the traffic of the system to a single connection, to a single slice. This is the case that I told you before, single, this is a UI connected to two different slides separately, or both of them going to the same internet APN, and they use completely different virtual network connections in the operator side with different QoS settings. The complex way of using URSP rules is by using, the complex way of using five-year slices is by using URSP rules, in the way that the operator will tell you which is the way that you need to route the traffic through that network. So they will give you rules, the UI receives the rules, in this case the modem will push the rules to the host, and then the host needs to make all these separate traffic differentiation and move one data flow from one slice and one data flow for another slice. The UI should not be capable of deciding by itself which slice to use, so because this is mandated by the network, and so if you try to use a slice that you are not supposed to use, they may kick you out. So that's a way that the network has to control the access to the high privileged slices. Any modem manager that supports the slicing will look very much like a multi-PDN connection. We will have virtual network interfaces created for each slice, and that is about it. There are all the 5G features that we could consider, but I'm going to name them here only. So non-GPB access support that's basically accessing the operator network through Wi-Fi, for example, you can authenticate to the network through Wi-Fi, and then you also have non-IP based 5G connectivity. If you have a network connection between machines using different protocols, you could virtually create a 5G network connection between them without using the IP protocol. Now, how it's going to look like for the next 10 years? I think we need to focus on what went right and try to avoid the mistakes that we made in 1.0, but we also know the limitations because everything changes, and what is important now may not be important at all in 10 years. So the planning needs to be done carefully, and actually made it in a way that if in the future you need to change cores, then you can do it more or less easily. The first thing we should be doing is remove legacy features. A lot of the structure in the modern manager code base is based on this logic of having 3GPP devices as a separate type of devices. We can remove all that. Same for the ports, plain old telephony system, like these dial-up models. We said we would implement them 13 years ago, and we did not do anything. I think it's time to say that we're not going to do it. We had enough time to try to do it. And then obviously, all the plugins from modems that are very old, we can't remove them. There is no point in having them anymore. The focus should be on 4G and 5G modems, and on PCI and USB modems that expose the network interface. So we acknowledge that there are other types of modems, that is serial modems or USB modems that don't expose the network interface, and you can only do 80 plus PPP connections. Those would still be supported, but let's say like in live support only, like bare minimum data connections set up, and not thinking about adding many features to those as well. For example, not thinking about trying to add 5G S-Lacing in those devices. It wouldn't make much sense. We may want to have a new API. This API that we are using right now has been mostly untouched. We didn't break API into more than 12 years. I think it's time to do some some breakage. As I said before, remove interfaces that we don't want, and probably not the same process as we did for 1.0. In 1.0, we spent, I spent one year and a half with my branch, until it was mostly ready to be launched. I mean, I want to change that. That cannot happen again. I don't have as much time as I had that time. So the idea would be to do it progressively and start to add new APIs, at least the basic ones, and so on. We will have registration settings as a first-class citizen in the APIs. We no longer treat them as something automatic, which is what we do right now. We now want to configure 4G-attached LTE settings. We want to configure 5G registration slide settings and 7L-over common settings that you may have in the modern, like the manual versus automatic settings. All those should go in its own separate API with the idea that in the future we may have more. So it should be open to updates in the future. Regarding connection management, I think it's time to use profile-based connection management as default whenever possible. There are many reasons for this, especially when you use carrier settings, where the modern gives you all the settings that you need to use. There's no point in trying to add new settings on top of those when you already have them. So using profile management is the way to go there, and enable multiplexed connection by default. So as I said, the primary modems to use would be the ones that expose the network interface. All those allow you to do multiplexing. Most of them allow you to do multiplexing. So we should enable that by default. This is one of the main things that I would like to change as well. So right now when you have a modern detected by modern manager, and it happens to have voice support, even if you're in a laptop and does not have any audio connectivity, modern manager will try to configure voice-related stuff, call waiting status, all that. It doesn't make any sense to do that if you know that you're not going to use it. So let's move that to separate interfaces as they are right now, but as a way that you can actively enable that. And if there's any application with the intent of using voice capabilities, you can, hey, please, not a manager, enable voice capabilities in the modern. Then we will enable all the URCs, all the unsolicited message support, and everything that needs to be done to support voice, for example. Oh, no, that's another one. Yeah. This is extended to each list. So things that I would love to have, even if they are extremely difficult. So we have QMI proxy, NBIM proxy. Why not have an 80 proxy? Other programs can use 80 commands through modern manager, through the proxy, to do other stuff that does not interfere with the modern manager own control. So if you could have that, it will allow many applications to use 80 commands as well. Then we could move our GNSS location out of modern manager completely as a separate team. There's no reason for modern manager to have all this support for configuring AGPS and injecting extra files to the GNSS module. We do that because the modern has that. But if we have the proxies in place, there would be no reason not to do it out of modern manager. And, yeah, draft maybe for binary parsing of messages and all that. That was something that was already investigated. And that is all I have to say. Thank you very much for this great talk. Do we have any questions in the audience? Yeah. Thanks for the good talk. I was wondering how do you test all this? So what is your CI? So in Chrome OS, we have a lot of automatic testing for the moderns that we use. So I do rely a lot about that. Like when I joined Google, I found that there were a lot of information metrics about crashes and things, back traces. I was like, I need to fix all this. But I do rely also on my own testing. I do have a home network, a home LTE network with SLSLT, open 5G, as I have my own SIM cards. And that allows me to do a lot of testing that otherwise I would not be able to do. Because all the slicing stuff that also is very core network dependent? Yes. So you might run into problems. Oh, yeah. I know many operators are doing pilots and like private pilots. I do some open ones. I think also in the US, T-Mobile is doing it. But for example, for a 5G slicing, I think that my home network is enough for this kind of testing. Thanks. Next question from the back. Hi. I'm debugging voice calls from my device. And from what the manager I see messages like gained, audio, lost audio. And I have no idea what happens after that. And whenever I try to... So how do you use 80 commands to control the modern? No, it does it by itself. When I'm trying to get to the bottom of what's going on in the code, I only see interfaces behind interfaces behind interfaces. But where can I find the actual code that makes the audio? Like where should I look? Is there a problem? So modern manager is only in charge of starting the code and hanging up the code. That's all accepting an incoming call. Nothing audio related. I mean, modern manager knows absolutely nothing. About the audio path. You know, who is responsible for getting the audio? It depends on the platform, of course. So if you're using Libre and Firephone or something like that, then you may need to talk to them. Thank you. Thanks. There was a question from the matrix apparently. I'm rushing to the matrix. So somebody's asking, can we anticipate 6G features such as sharing machine learning data for connection optimization? I have no idea about any of that. I'm still in 5G. Maybe in 10 years we will talk about. Same talk for 6 years. You talked about REST for the protocol parsing and how there's already been experiments. And it's on your wish list. So I assume those experiments are somewhat successful. Can you talk any more about what those experiments are? So not much. I mean, it's useful. I think it's very useful. And I still keep finding bugs. For example, in the 3GPP PTU parsing, which we wrote 10 years ago. And there are still bugs there. Nasty memory related bugs. So REST is very promising in that regard. Cool. Thanks. One more question. And I'm back. Thanks for the talk. So the question regarding the AT proxy. With all the possible vendor crap, etc. So how do you plan to define if the comment is going to interfere with model manager or not? So is it going to be a low by default or is it going to be for be by default? So that's why we don't have a proxy yet. That's the main reason. Especially because model manager handles a lot of crap that manufacturers push in the AT port. So the idea would be to, in the same way that model manager disables a lot of URCs that knows that may happen, the proxy could do the same. And so we could still need to work with known URCs as they happen in the world. But I hope that manufacturers will start to use other things than AT at some point in 20 years.
