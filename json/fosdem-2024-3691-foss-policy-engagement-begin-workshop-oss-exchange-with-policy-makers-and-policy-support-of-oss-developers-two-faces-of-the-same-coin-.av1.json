{"text": " Okay, everyone. So we are ready for our second workshop in our death room open source in the European legislative landscape. We have some general rules. I think Simon want to talk about them. No, this is okay. So we have some general rules for the whole death room. That means for the next two hours, this is true, but also for the rest of the day. Please, we have some issues here with like the sound quality in the room. So please, remain as quiet as possible. And if possible, please only change rooms in between the sessions. So we are having like quick changes in between. So there should be enough time to like leave and enter the room again. And also we have this microphone. And there's only this one microphone. It looks a bit strange to talk into it, but it's important for us that people in the livestream can follow us. So this means if you want to address a question, please wait until we are around to see microphones so that people in the livestream can also follow us. We in this workshop want to build on what we just like discussed in the workshop before. And I think Mirko put it very correctly to say we should stay in the dialogue. And the question is how do we stay in this dialogue? And how, yeah, shall we do this? What have we learned? For example, during CIA, but also other debates. And this is basically what we are going to discuss in the next two hours. So we will talk with Martin and Enzo about their CIA experience. Then we will talk to Jean-Luc and Clementine. They will show us about how important open source projects to the European Commission and how they are funded around NGIO. And then we will talk with Cyril about future EU free software regulation. And then we want to turn this workshop here into a panel which then turns into a fishbowl conversation. And I will also then later explain you how this fishbowl conversation works out as soon as we go to the panel. But now I would be happy to see Enzo and Martin. Would you be so happy to join here and then we go to our very first talk of Martin and Enzo. Who wants to start?
