{"text": " Hi everyone. So I will present IROGAM which is a multi-region IMAB server. And so the goal of this talk is to discuss about this multi-region thing. But before starting some context, so my name is Quentin and I have a PhD in distributed systems and this talk will be a lot about distributed systems because that's something I know. And I try to work as much as I can for a collective. It's called Duffler and we try to build a low-tech, etic internet and if you want to know more about the things we are doing, there was a talk yesterday about garage where the infrastructure, the self-hosted, geo-distributed infrastructure we have is presented. And IROGAM is part of the strategy and the project of this collective and also a very nice thing. It is supported by an internet and they are very nice. I have to mention it. So first the problem we want to solve and I like to say that with emails we want to make other people available when it would be as always impossible due to distance. We can achieve this goal only if the underlying system is working. And so this talk will be about distributed systems but also about availability and reliability. And so I have three main ideas that frame the decisions when developing IROGAM. So the first is that we should not trust the cloud and hosting providers not only because they can fail and when they fail your service is not working. And the second aspect is that we think there is some space when it comes to IMAP server designs to study and to try new design, new trade-off. So there is no perfect solution. We don't have a magic solution but we can try new ways and new designs. And the third part I will try to convince you that this new design can work in the real life. So first don't trust your provider. So generally when you have the title of this talk is multi-region. I think the first part is to define what is a region when you talk about a cloud or hosting provider. So it's the Google Cloud Platform Region Paris. So its name is Europe West 9 and it's made of three data centers. And last April the whole region, so the three data centers, was unavailable for three weeks. Not totally but the outage lasted for three weeks in some part and it was due to a fire in one data center. And due to some tight interconnection between the other data centers and many software, the other data center were unable to work not due to hardware failure but due to software problem. So three weeks without emails you can imagine that it could be very hard when you use it for very important stuff like I don't know paying tax and seeking for a new job and so on and so forth. So the idea, it's not new, is that you should move to reliability first design. You should think reliability in your service and not rely only on your server. I'm sorry, the book is named Cloud Native Patterns but we could have named it Distributed Native Patterns and it's the same example with the region in, this time it's Amazon in the US and we see that, so the author of the book, Today's Three Services, Netflix, IMDB and Nest and only Netflix took the effort to deploy in a multi region and there was only one that were still working when the US, this one region was not available. I think it's the secret source of Google when it comes to Gmail or when it comes to Google search. It works despite data center failure, despite multi region failure because they are designing their service as reliability first. So it's easy to say that we should design our services as reliability first but in fact it's hard, like many things and something which makes it hard is that when you are in the same region, latency are very low, like one or two milliseconds but when you consider multi region deployment, I have made a test so between Paris and Warsaw in Poland and we jump to 30 or 40 milliseconds. It's not a lot but when you have distributed protocols, often this latency is amplified and there is such example in yesterday's presentation too. So we know that it's hard but it's even harder in the context of the email systems and the Apache Jambs documentation summarizes it very well. So the hard problem is, yes well done, the hard problem is about the monotony QID generation. If you are at the beginning of the dev room, UID in emails have been explained and so they say you have basically two solutions. Either you choose to doing weak consistency and so you risk data loss or you choose strong consistency and strong consistency is very sensitive to latency so it will be very slow. So currently the answer of the Apache Jambs developer is you should not deploy Apache Jambs or the cat-sandwrap part in a multiple data center setup. You should pay for consulting. Okay. So if we make a wider review of the existing work, maybe I have missed something and let me know, but you have some leader follower design which are for example, Cyrus or Dof Cut and you have some consensus or total order based design like Stalvart, IMAB, Gmail, Apache Jambs, Wilder, and so on. So this consensus or total order is often outsourced to the database. So for example, FoundationDB, Cassandra, lightweight transactions or MongoDB. There was also a research project named Pluto and they tried to design a mailbox server on a serial DT design. So it was very, it works very well in a multi-region setup but they have an incomplete implementation because they do not support the monotonic ID. They only support sequence identifiers. So yes, it's interesting if we don't implement the whole IMAB protocol, we can do multi-region way more easily. So our solution was, we wanted to implement the full IMAB protocol and so it's a trade-off. It's not a magical solution but we decided to live with conflicts. So in fact, in IMAB you can have conflicts as long as you detect it and you change a value that is named the UID validity. So it's not free, it has a don't sign, sorry, it will trigger a full expensive resynchronization for the clients. So for example, we see two processes, so you can imagine that's two IROGAM processes and at the end for UID4, the two processes assign the same UID for different emails and when the other one learns it, there is a conflict. And so in our implementation, assigning a UID is a log and we have an event log that is not totally ordered but only causally ordered and we have a proven algorithm to solve conflict and compute a new UID validity. Also there is a proof in our documentation, if you want to read it or to review it, we are interested and we try to be as clever as possible when we synchronize this event log to reduce the conflict window. And so you might say we are cheating because we are changing the problem. We don't try to have monotonic UID but we try this time to handle correctly conflicts. And yes, it's true but I have two arguments. Often people are tweaking raft and they are doing bad things. And I have two examples when in Kubernetes, an issue that has been opened like six years ago and it's still open because they are violating some invariance due to a caching of raft for performance reasons and another one is the post-mortem of GitHub where they also use raft which is a strong consistent algorithm. And they say that and they show that they have done some optimizations that break some invariance of the protocol. And you can reduce the risk of conflicts as much as you can. So the most important was to have the correct solutions. And so if you want you can put a multiplexer in front of a irogram and redirect all the same user to the same server and so you will reduce even more the risk of having a conflict. So talk is cheap, show me the mail server. So I will be quick on this part but I've tried the deployment in France, in Netherlands, in Poland. And so you have some screen shot and you can check the IP address. There are some IMAG server listening on. And on each region, this is the deployment. This is connected to post-fix through the LMTP protocol. We have implemented in irogram. And irogram is a state-less software and so all the data managed by Garage which is in fact doing the magic behind the scene with is a geo distributed design. Yes. And I have a demo. So I will try to show you. So I'm just using something like NetCAD to connect and show you that there is an irogram server listening behind the domain name. And after that, I have configured this iMAG server on my phone. And you can see that I have a mailbox. And now there is a Gmail. It's the Gmail web UI and I will send an email to this server, to this multi-region server. And so the email is sent and now we will wait until it's received both on the phone and the computer behind. And that's it. So that's the conclusion. So we started with three ideas. And so this is the answer. So irogram is designed from the ground up for reliability. So it was the most important thing to us. And we decided to tolerate UID conflicts instead of trying to be to enforce monotonic UIDs. And so we tried to handle them correctly and minimize them. And finally, we want to prove that irogram already works in real environments. But irogram is still a technological preview. And it's not yet deployed in production. So be very careful when using it. Don't use it for real workloads. No, I think during this year we will deploy it on infrastructure for real users. And that's one of the future work we will do as much user testing as we can because we don't want to lose important information for people. And we also plan to implement KALDAV and CARDAV. And maybe in the end, envision irogram as a group. And something that's so important is performance measurements and improvements. And I can say that many design choices we have done will result in the fact that irogram might use a bit more CPU or memory than your regular email server. And you have to take also into account this fact. So thanks for listening and I cannot start questions if you want. Thank you very much. I see one question over there. Gentlemen in red. So first, thank you very much for this design. I've been working on distributed email for quite a bit. And UID generation is part of the story. What is your approach with keeping the IMAP session synchronized, especially the modification sequence to UID mapping, IMAP ideally, and other things like that with such design? OK. So we are handling the synchronization, the rest of the synchronization in the IMAP protocol. So we have a view and ways that we are maintaining. And so as I've said, we have an event log. And each irogram server sessions are watching the event log that is stored in garage. And so when there is a change, we compute the difference. All right. Further questions? Last call? OK. So. Ah, there's one. Can you say it just again shortly? What is garage exactly in a few words? Can you say a bit about this? So we say that garage is a distributed data store. So there is one API that is S3, which we call often object storage. So it's like a file system, but with way, way, way less features. So it makes possible to have efficient distributed deployments. And garage is inspired by a research paper entitled Dynamo by Amazon. And it's a design of a key value store. And garage has a second API, which is named K2V, which is very similar to also Raya KV. If you know Bashow, it was a company and they don't exist anymore. So garage is really about replicating your data and making them available. And you have this API about object storage, but we have this key value API. And so it's really the foundation of your data layer. And that's a new way, I think. And that's what we wanted to prove with Irogan. But we can design applications a bit different and use not only for a garage for binary blobs, but also for that lightweight database used. So I think I understood from the website that you also encrypt data addressed. But you haven't mentioned that at all. Yes. You're doing it, right? Yes, we are doing it. It's in the code and it's a choice. Maybe we are keeping it for the next year, probably. But sure, yes, in garage, all data is encrypted with a key that is derived from your password. And so when the data that are stored in garage are always encrypted. And the data is in plain text only in the Irogan process memory. But it's not really ready. We have to find as many things, but we have many ideas about that. All right, thank you very much again. And I think we will head over to already mentioned Apache James.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 5.96, "text": " Hi everyone.", "tokens": [50364, 2421, 1518, 13, 50662],
