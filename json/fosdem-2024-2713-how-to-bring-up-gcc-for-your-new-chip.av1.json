{"text": " Okay ladies, if you'd like to get yourself settled down, because of the way we're running this room back to back, my talk has already started and I haven't got much to cover but we'll do what we can. So, yes, so that's everything that makes up the GNU toolchain. I'm going to go through some of these slides very fast because it's reference material so you can go back and look at the video afterwards if you want to check something. This is only going to look at GCC so I'm not going to worry about the assembler or any of the other stuff, I'm just going to look at the compiler and how you add something to a new chip. So how you get the back end up and running, where you can get more information, what the key things you need to do are and what I hope is at the end is that at the end you won't be able to write a new compiler but you'll know where to get started. So first of all, source of information, there's loads of theory behind compilers, there's an excellent beginner's textbook there, you can still buy it second hand, I believe someone bought one for a penny on Amazon, second hand, so and I've been recommending, I haven't used the second one but it has, I strongly recommend it by someone else there and this is the Bible. If you've got a lot of money you can buy the one on the left, if you haven't got so much the one on the right is still rightly available. But this is what we're going to worry about today, the GCC internals manual, everything you need to know is there, some of it's out of date but it's generally a pretty good document and it's online so you can just go and get that. So, we've got a new chip, our new chip, this is an entirely fictional architecture, it's taken from my textbook I showed earlier and it's a simple byte stream architecture used for just as a target you can compile to for demonstrating how to write a compiler. So, we've got arithmetic, we've got logic, we've got shifts, we've got the ability to store and load and we've got some branching and a branch and link so we can do sub-routine calls. And there's all the details of it but we'll come back to it. So, getting started, first of all you need GCC so you can clone it and there's a mirror on GitHub as well. You've seen this from Dave, here's the structure and the bit we're going to be concerned about is within the GCC primarily the config because that's where you put the configuration for the new back-end architecture. So, we're going to, there's one, there's one for RISC-5, there's dozens of them there, we're going to add one for VAM. So, if you were to look in RISC-5 you'd find these four key files, there's loads more in the RISC-5 directly but you have a .h file which is where you define a lot of parameters that says what my back-end looks like, you know, how big's a char, how big's an int and so forth. You have RISC-C which is where you put C code and it's really helper code to get you off the ground. You don't need, you need hardly anything in .c to get started. The big one and where we'll spend quite a lot of time is the machine description. It's a, it's the thing that describes what your architecture looks like and GCC will then pick that up and use that to be able to compile to your target. Okay, and it's written in a, nominally in a dialect of LISP called scheme. Okay, and lastly there's a file called .opt and you don't actually even have to have .opt but it's where you've got target specific options and our architecture, we're going to give it an option that says you can have soft multiplication where you do multiplication in software or you can have hard multiplication where you actually generate multiplication instructions. So first of all, we need to see how do we configure GCC for my new target. Well first of all, we actually need to go into the whole auto-conf system and actually add it in there. So at the top level in the repository you'll find a file called config.sub. Now that is actually pulled in from a separate project. Okay, so if you're doing this properly you would go to the project listed there and you'd make your change there. But I'm just going to hack it today and I'm just going to add a line in the, if you look in there you'll say case dollar CPU where all the CPUs are there and I'm just going to add VAM, our architecture. So now the auto-make system will understand about VAM and then inside the GCC sub-directory, so the GCC proper sub-directory, there's config.GCC and that's where you put all the GCC specific configurations. Okay, now our full name of our architecture is probably our compiler will be VAM-unknown-elf-GCC because we'll put the full triple in front. So VAM whatever you like, ELF will match that. So if you go and say I want to configure for that target, what do I define? And there's a whole load of variables you can set to tell your target what goes in there. The thing is you don't really need to put anything because it'll know there'll be a, if my target's VAM you must have a VAM.C, a VAM.H, a VAM.CC, a VAM.H and a VAM.MD and maybe a VAM.Opt. I'm going to say actually I want one other because this is bare metal. I'm going to take the standard ELFOS file for bare metal operating system file and add it to that and that's the target machine list of files that make up that architecture. So that is all I need to do to make GCC to know that. And now I can say go and configure GCC and this, you'll see it's a bit like Dave did, but this time my target is going to be VAM-unknown-elf and it will configure for that. I'm going to do, I'm going to put it in pre, I'm going to, when we've finished it, it'll get loaded in, it'll get installed in OptVAM. We'll do it without headers just to keep it simple. We'll just do the C language and as Dave said earlier disable the bootstrap, just the stage one which is on a plain C compiler and there's loads more options there and we'll come back to that later. And then I can just say make all hyphen GCC and lots and lots happens and then it will complain and say ah, but I can't find VAM.MD, the machine description, okay? Because I didn't actually create a machine description. I just told it that was here's my machine. So we're going to have to do something about that. So let's start adding those files in. Let's start with the header file and so let's create our configuration directory. So we're going to the source directory, we're coming out of our build directory, going to the source directory, create a sub directory within GCC config for VAM for our architecture and I'm just going to create empty files, VAM.CC, VAM.H, VAM.MD and VAM.Opt. Come back into our build directory and make all GCC again, lots more happens and then I get an error message. It says ah, in somewhere deep inside the GCC world I haven't found a definition of first pseudo register and maybe you meant first virtual register. And that's actually one of the variables that I have to define in .h. So in .h there's a whole load of macros I've got to define that I will need for that. Okay, so here's an example, so in VAM.h we've got some things. You define target CPU but those are the built-ins I want to appear. You know that when you compile for a particular architecture in GCC there are some predefined macros there including one that tells you what your architecture is. So we want underscore VAM in capitals and lower case actually defined so if you're writing code you can put hash if def VAM, if def underscore VAM and put your VAM specific code there. And there's a couple of asserts there, I'll assert the CPU's VAM and the machine is VAM. Okay, where does it go, what goes in the header file? There's a whole section on this on the internals manual. You'll be here till 2057 if you try and put all of those in. Easy approach do what we all do is copy an existing architecture and hack it around for you. Open risk is a really good one. It's quite small and Stafford Horn knows what he's doing so it's a good starting point and it's what I used. Okay, and associated implementation codes in VAM.cc and it's things like data storage, data types, register model, the ABI implementation, all the constants that will define that. Okay, so here we are, here's my storage layout, you know all the number of bits that go in everything, what boundaries I'm aligning on, the sizes of all my data types, what the ABI looks like, so I've got a comment to say what it does and then I define the first pseudo register, so I've got a total of 33 real registers and then anything else would be a pseudo register and I'm not going to go into pseudo registers, because I've got my 32 real registers, general registers and I've got my status register. I don't have the program counter as a register because it's not actually exposed in my architecture, I have nowhere treating it as a real register, it's just something behind the scenes. And I've got names for all my registers and some of those have fixed purposes, so r0 is always tied to 0, r1 is the stack pointer, so I've got an array telling me which of those have got predefined uses and the last one is the status register, that's got a predefined use. And then what are good ways to allocate this, so when GCC needs to use a register, what's a good one to choose, so I don't actually end up choosing one, I have to then worry about restoring and everything. And so I can give that in a priority order of what order do I want you to allocate registers in. We talk about register classes, now this is very simple because we haven't got many registers, normally you would separate out your integer registers from your floating point registers and then you can tell GCC to do different things depending whether you're doing floating point or integer. In our case it's only an integer machine anyway, so we've just got general regs and we've got one class for the status register which is the flag regs. You always have a no regs class which is no registers and all regs class which is all registers and you define the last thing in that enum because it tells you the size of the enum is limit regs classes. And then from that we can define a macro called n regs classes and we can define the names of these which are just the text strings. And lastly then we say for each of those classes we're going to have to give you 33 bits to tell you for each of those classes which bits are there. So for the no regs none of them are set, for the general registers all the bits are except the 33rd bit and it's the bottom low bits on the left and the top low bits on the right and then the status register is register 33 so it just has one bit set in the other bit there and then all regs has all the bits set. Okay and you've got a macro to tell you which regs, you've given a register number which register class are you in and there's loads more in there and you can read through it there and see what happens. So we say make all GCC and even more happens and then it complains that it can't see SP regnum. Now you think ah didn't I define a stat pointer, I did but I decided something else because the point is this is not SP regnum as known by a header, this is SP regnum from the machine description. Okay so some of these things are actually not defined in the header, they're defined in the machine description. So if we look how code generation works in GCC it's generic okay it's a pattern matching compiler, it looks for patterns and replaces them by new patterns. Okay so it's how it does code generation, it's actually also how it does optimization and what we have to do is give it all these pattern templates in order to be generated and that is what the machine description is and actually when we come to optimization replacing patterns by better patterns is what you do. So we heard from Dave the different types you've got generic then Gimple then RTL and we're really worrying about how you get down to the RTL level. Okay side note here GCC has its own name for type systems so they're everything from quarter inch to eight bits up to double inch and tetra inch and double float with and so they're known as QI or HI and so forth and you can have unsigned variance of those just when those will come all the way through so when you see those they just sizes of things. So how do you get Gimple to go down to RTL okay which you can then code generate from okay you we probably had a set of standard patterns okay and all you're going to do in the machine description is tell him given add QI 3 that's add quarter inch to three arguments two source arguments and destination and they're mostly three address code like that so add two quarter inch and so forth. There's a whole set of these to define you define all those okay and then GCC has all the patterns and it will generate code for your machine okay so quite a lot of these have to be defined but some of them don't need it you know you don't need atomic and vector patterns if you're not going to atomic if you haven't got atomic ops or if you're not a vector machine okay so I say when we build the compiler it's parsed and all that scheme description of these patterns will be turned into C which is then built it then compiled and put in your GCC compiler and there's a whole huge chapter on this in the internals manual machine descriptions but we will do the same thing is we will copy an existing machine description and hack it so I've this we will take OR1K again okay so let's have a look I want to just describe machine description I'm taking them these from risk5.md just because I want to show a lot of ideas here quickly and they're richer in in the risk5 one than in my simple one okay so at the heart of it is define instant define instant which is the semantics of a pattern this architecture supports the name can be anything but obviously we're worried about the predefined ones and add SI3 is one of them okay and that's how GCC can learn RTL using that name okay so the first thing you see is match op-rand that's telling you how to match the first op-rand and then the second op-rand and you see there's match op-rand size of it single integer number of that op-rand so we've got 0 1 and 2 and then a bit about what it is okay so register op-rand says I can be any register it's it's an allow or deny gating function okay and you can write your own predicates as well but the whole load of standard ones okay and then we have constraints on that now the constraint is not much here equals r comma r and that's saying I'm giving you two scenarios and they actually have both happened to be r in this case but we'll explain why that is so it can and the equals means I'm writing to it so I'm either writing to a register or I'm writing to a register okay now the reason that matters is these pairs go together so the second op-rand is a register a register the third opera the first opera and then op-rand 2 is register or I for immediate and you have to read those if you as though we're there in columns so we're looking at one scenario where first op-rand is a writable register and the other two operands are registers and we're looking at the second scenario where the destination is a register the first operands register but the second operand is an it's just so if you think of them in columns that's how to think of them okay and yeah so the next line which is just empty here that's often for a global predicate okay and that could be where you put one of your flags so you may have to find a predicate like is this soft multiplication in which case I can't generate a multiply okay and just empty means true just always do this and then the code generation template it's just a C fragment and in this case so you say if it's a 32 if it's a 64 bit architecture then generate the string add word blah blah blah if it's a 32 bit architecture then you it's just a generic add instruction okay and the percent elements there percent nor percent 1% to refer to operand nor operand 1 operand 2 okay and at the end you can add some attributes we're not going to worry about attributes in BAM attributes are useful because they're where tagging the instance and sometimes you can have code generation options and opera optimizations that can take advantage of them okay so let's look at what we did for BAM first of all you define some constants that's where sp reg none the numbers of the key registers is defined okay and then we've got a very simple instance it's called no op and it doesn't have anything to match really it's just constant zero and it generates the text string it generates for code generation is just not here's a more comfortable and add si 3 you've seen that bit before we've only got one sort of ad okay the first operand is destination register the second operand is a register and because VAM is a two-address machine okay so add a B means add a to B and put the result in B we actually have to say the destination you see I've constrained it to be zero that means it's got to be the same as opera and zero which is the destination okay and I've got the same for sub i and the template to generate the code okay so the standard names the standard MD patterns machine descriptions and output statements how you do the assembly language templates and you've got some useful files in there and I say the open-risk one is a good example that's pretty simple okay so what about the option file VAM.opt there's a whole spec on this and we're going to allow it to have hard division soft division hard mode whether or not you generate multiply and divide instructions and they have a fairly simple pattern of explaining what it is and a bit of descriptive text okay okay putting it all together so we do make all GCC and almost everything almost everything happens and away it goes and it blew up cannot stat 10 permit 10.cc you know I have no idea what this means it's in deep in the bowels it's journey mitt so what do we do about this I asked for help and so thank you to match a Rizzicky who came up and said there's a trick you can tell it to emit fewer partitions it might be a bug and so I tried with emitting five partitions and it all worked fine okay and actually I ended up with a GCC because X GCC is what the GCC within the build tree is called and it ran it and it ran itself test it said let's check if the compiler is any good and then I got an internal compiler error because I haven't actually finished doing my compiler so VAM.md is missing some patterns and it's essentially blown up because it couldn't work out how to find a pattern to get the code down there for one of the test cases but I do actually have a working compiler well I have a working compiler in the sense I've got a compiler I can run it will crash whenever it compiles things but that's actually that's actually quite an achievement so now I need to just debug it okay but I have actually got a GCC build so I'm Dave covered this how to dump stuff we are so you didn't know you just mentioned so you can dump all the different intermediate codes but what Dave did cover was the wrapper option and the wrapper option is your friend that's where you can go inside we've talked about the wrapper option and how it puts things here actually you can do the same sort of thing as you can do gdb args and then I just copied that error message I got with the internal compiler error and now I can run under there and I can run it and I can generate my internal compiler error under gdb but I now have the ability now to do to debug it okay self-test even better so there we are and this is why we work as a community because we are so make self-test type in gdb we'll do all this magic for you okay so there was a bit of smoke mirrors in there I created a minimal vam.cc guess what I copied it from there was a bug in vam.op.ul's I had to hand create that in the hack round that and that I think is a bug I had to create vam.com.cc and I'm not quite sure why I had to do that but everyone seems to do it except open risk and I had to make it and I just took the template one I used it I added vam to the documentation that's a good thing I also compiled with enable maintainer mode which is used to regenerate some files I'm not that was when I was trying to fix the url's problem I'm not sure I actually needed to do that okay but that's what I did to get there so what next and the reason this is rather rushed is it's part of our three-month graduate training course this stuff was put together by my colleague Max and Blinoff a few years ago it's a five-day part of the course um for eight hours a day with exercises and so I've compressed it into 25 minutes um but hopefully it gives you just a little bit of a touch on how you can get started and there's enough hooks in there that you'll get off the ground and if you get stuck ask for help we're a friendly bunch I have an ambition one day I'm going to create a full public tutorial on GCC that's probably my retirement project but in the meantime everything I've just shown you is on github thank you okay I've got I've got two minutes for questions yeah are there any ready-made um CPUs that are a bit weird like um big guitars that we can use and play around for fun yeah so the question is are there any ready-made ones there are loads I mean there are what 50 or 60 backends for GCC and some of them are really weird and some of them very normal I would look at open risk because it's relatively recently done it's well done it's quite small because great excellent so the comment was about working on power isa power power isa and adding the scalable vector um functionality into the back end please join in ask for help scalable vectors are the flavor of the month at the moment so you said that we have to add the architectural specific stuff in the machine description I was wondering if there is a minimum set of touring to complete that you say that you do the assignment the addition and this yes question for the audience then we start the question is yeah our time's up is what is the minimum set in the patterns I don't know but if someone could tell me I couldn't find that thank you thank you", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek":
