{"text": " All right guys, so back to the matter of the day. The next speaker is Kian who works at Evervolt and I think it's quite exciting to have a bit of a complimentary perspective in let's say this exciting new field where we talk a lot about new technologies, but you will actually talk about how to use them in production. So take it away. Thanks. So I work for Evervolt and I will talk about Evervolt to begin with just so you know why we use enclaves in production and not just traditional computing. So we offer also, I don't know how loud that is if I'm too quiet, tell me so I can speak louder. So we offer tooling to allow customers to guarantee data security in different forms like encryption before it ever hits your system or ways to process said encrypted data in secure environments and so on and so forth. At the core of all of this is enclaves. We're running on AWS so we're using the Nitro enclaves which as far as I can tell aren't as open source as the Intel SGX or any of that stuff. But we've been doing this for a couple of years now and that was when we started the best we could find for doing VMs that guaranteed the security model that we required. So like I said encryption, so yeah we're running in fully isolated VMs where we can basically see nothing that's happening inside the VM without a lot of effort on our part which is mainly so we can protect our users data. So just to give the context, relay is our main product is what I would say. It's an encryption proxy, you put it in front of your service and you define some rules and before the service your request ever hit you, the rules are applied and all your data is encrypted. Sorry, I lost my mouse. So yeah so it's very much focused on web services but it's mainly for people who want to de-scope their environment so they can be more PCI compliant or protect HIPAA data and stuff like that. Relay runs, relay doesn't run in an enclave mainly due to performance reasons because it's processing lots of network requests and we want it to get quick because encryption is slow and we don't want to add overhead to our users. So we store all of our keys inside a KMS that is accessed from a secure enclave. That service, we have no access to the keys then. On startup it tests connections to the KMS, pulls down user keys, decrypts them and then we are able to process the user's requests and outside of that environment we can't replicate anything. This started though when more users joined us and we started to scale. At first we just had a lot of automation. That was stuff like how do you run Docker containers in enclaves and how do you make sure that you can scale up or scale down. AWS Nitro enclaves are guest VMs on top of EC2 nodes. There's not much automation about actually running what's in there so you have to build it all ourselves and get all that running and actually performing requests for our users. So after we got all that running we had issues with just the libraries in general. So the parts of AWS that are open source are all the interface libraries for connecting to them but we found that there's many, many edge cases where they just were very poorly documented or not documented at all about how do you interact with it, how do you work with the proxies. So for reference for those that haven't used it, you need to run a Vsoc. There is a Vsoc on your host for communicating with the secure enclave and this is the only I.O. you have in and out of the VM. You then need to manage all the connections yourself and how you transfer data in and out and communicate. We ran into some really fun problems though trying to use this and talking to the AWS guys about using their library and getting stuff. The funnest one I think was we lost, we were dropping, we had file descriptor leakage. Our VM guests, VMs were dying because we just couldn't connect to them anymore because we run out of file descriptors on them which I had not seen in a long time aside from just like breaking my own machine which was fun. Turned out we just made some assumptions about how stuff worked because we thought, oh this is how it works in Rust and no, that wasn't how it worked in the library and we were just not reading the code but we needed to read the code which was unfortunate because I would have liked it to be in the docs. But yeah, it really showed that there was no metrics or observability for these enclaves. We weren't able to know what's happening inside them or how to interact with them. We started trying to monitor them. This was interesting. Like I said, no metrics, no nothing. I realize you probably can't see a lot of those graphs but these were our load tests. We started to try and get metrics out of them because there's limited IO. We didn't want to just try and put a metrics collector inside them and shoot all the metrics out to Datadog or AWS. We started instrumenting the clients that we were talking to it with and we started sending load data and trying out different workloads. So a lot of black box testing. This was several weeks of just staring at graphs that I may have gone a little insane during but we're here now and it worked. So once we got through it all we were able to find different bottlenecks in the code but based on guesses and automation changes we were able to go from, I don't know if you can see that but about 1,500 requests per second, no, encryptions per second inside the enclave to about 5,000 encryptions per second just by switching our default curve which we hadn't ever considered because we encourage our users to set the curve but it made massive improvements for us. But we had no idea that the encryptions themselves were the bottleneck because we couldn't see what was happening inside of our enclaves or the VMs and know where our workloads were slowing down. So once we started doing the observability we really went in on it. So we did this black box testing and we found the limit pretty quickly. We had to guess where the bottlenecks were and there was a whiteboard in the office of like here are ideas we have to try in different configurations. We just worked our way taking each box off and turning itself on and off until we were able to actually get some improvements from it. We then started working on a level of, so AWS does have a concept of debug logs but the moment you turn it on your enclave isn't actually a testable anymore. The attestation variables all just turn to zero and you're not able to attest your connection. And like I mentioned before we need to be able to attest the connection to the KMS to actually even load keys into it so we couldn't run in debug mode at all. We had to figure it out. So we had to basically reimplement a level of tracing like if anyone is familiar with open telemetry and stuff we had to come up with a way of doing trace requests inside of it. We couldn't use open telemetry because it had no understanding of how to communicate outside of the VMs. We had to take concepts, reimplement them and come up with a way of batching requests, sending them out and limiting the amount of IO overhead that we were doing that. We eventually got there and we were able to monitor our boxes. That's when we started to notice more problems. So we basically had these two processes in the enclave talk into a shutter and we expected the green line there. Yellow line would be perfect. That was our local dev environment. But the green line is what we wanted to see in production. The blue line is what we were seeing in production. I've lost. I wasn't allowed to put the lines of the numbers on it to be specific here but that was about a 20x slowdown I think which was insane. We're still debugging this one. We're not 100% sure where the bottlenecks are. We're fairly certain it's the virtualization of the network layer inside the containers is just insanely slow. So what we're looking at is how can we short circuit that. There's some things like sock maps. You can re-root sockets. But effectively you can't just take a container and throw it, take a process and throw it in or take two processes and throw it into the VM and think that will work. It works on my machine. It does not just magically work. You need to really tune the system to actually be able to talk effectively. We're still tuning it. We're hoping to have some stuff to note soon about ways to speed it up with sock map and different improvements. Like I said, it's seemingly either the VM or the user space networking. The fun one which I think was a lot of people who have worked with Enclave go, duh, of course you had time slippage. There's no NTP in an Enclave. You can mount the PTP of the hypervisor. But again, that invalidates our security model for PCI. So we had to actually synchronize with NTP which meant we need to add another layer of periodic work that needs to be done by the guest box to ensure that the VM could actually know what the hell time it was. We noticed that we were losing a second a day which is quite a lot when you are doing and that was based on traffic volume as well, more traffic, more time we lost. But if we did nothing, it was just one second a day. That really got into it when we had to do anything that was sensitive such as token validation. So, off effectively broke if a VM was running for more than three days which led us to a cron job that just cycled VMs for every three days for a little while until we re-implemented NTP through the VSOC. Fun. These are a lot of, like, yeah. So we kept running into issues and we kind of said, why is this so painful? It should be easy to just deploy a service into an enclave and give other people the ability to, like, say, yeah, that person who hosts my cloud computer definitely can't see the data being processed and I can guarantee it. Really useful for health data or financial data which are our main customers. So we put it all together and have a product called enclaves if you want an easy way to do hosted enclaves. So you can effectively give, we'll give you a Docker container. No, we don't give you anything actually. We give you a CLI and you build the Docker container with a Docker file into a secure enclave. You are given PCRs so it's fully attested. You give us your secure enclave and we run it for you. We push our data plane and control plane into the enclave and it talks to the control plane that we use so you can leverage it, all of that is open source so you can reproduce the build yourself and validate all the attestation. That's the same and ensures that everything is communicating effectively and there's no, well, me or my team aren't, like, messing with your code or changing it or anything like that. So it's just regular Docker containers. The connection is fully attestable and you can connect to it. I see 10 minutes and I probably don't need that long. So, but yeah, we're working on this. We're taking everything we learn from building our own service, putting it into our Everloot enclaves and it's on our GitHub. If you want to have a look and go through it, we want to be able to, people to be able to look at it, see that we're not doing anything wrong and try it out and hopefully have a better experience getting on boarded with confidential computing than we had because it was a lot of like throwing stuff at the wall, seeing what broke, where it broke and trying to figure it out. I'm going to go for questions then. You said you had problems with curse. British didn't be using ECC. Do you have any idea why the curse might have been a problem? Are you hitting page boundaries, packet boundaries or any ideas? Yeah, so we what we were seeing was that it was in the CPU. There was optimizations that we hadn't accounted for. So by default, the box we were developing on ARM Max, who were highly optimized for the curve we were using in default, which led us to like say, great, look at the performance here on our local machines deployed to production performance crashed. Turns out the AWS boxes we were running on were optimized for the standard K1 curve or one curve, a camera, which one it is now, but basically wrong curve. And we were an evening in the enclave, those optimizations still come true. So we were able to get 20 X performance gains from that, I think. Anyone else? Can you elaborate a bit on the nature of the payload or whatever you're executing there? Because I mean, we saw there pretty much encryption transactions. But what was exactly running there? So what do we run in the enclave? So for the benchmark was so the benchmark was basically fuzzing was what we were doing. But we send. So as I mentioned, in the enclaves, we have all our customer keys each in it. So we had one of our keys in there that we would send 20,000. So we would have 20,000 fields to encrypt. And we'd say each of these fields, we're going to iterate through this dictionary and encrypt it. So we'd send just a generic JSON blob. But for purposes of encryption, we could send just that we could just be a Boolean or a string or whatever and just send it in. And we then would iterate through that JSON blob and it would have the it would say, I am this user or application in which would then cause service to choose the right key. And it would then just it and they would say, these are the fields inside the JSON blob to find and encrypt. So it was JSON blob and ID and fields encrypt. Very simple payload, but it was just iterative work. And because of how the encryption is implemented, it's all blocking work. So we'd have to farm out the work differently, not like directly related to enclaves, but when we did the load testing, we determined that we were blocking and dropping connections in the service. So what was happening was the connection we'd schedule the work on the enclave and then the connection from the upstream service would die. Then we wouldn't propagate that connection dying downstream. The enclave would do the work, try to send the encryption back and then go, oh, no one wants this work and stop. So we had to put some keep alive and connections. But these are again the things we missed because we were having to reimplement just what would be generic TCP or or HP for talking over the Vsoc in the enclave. So you mentioned the the architecture you you are using made you adapt your cryptographic parameters. So how would that scale up to the future? I mean, crypto agility facing any words on that? I don't know. I'm the SRE who's meant to make such scale, but that's actually outside of my domain. We have people who understand cryptography a lot better than me and the company who would be able to answer that question. I can give you an email address if you want to talk about it, but I can't speak myself on that. Thanks a lot for the great talk. So I wanted to go a little bit back to like the use case you presented in the beginning. And I might have missed something, but it sort of sounds to me that like the use case here was not really like a sort of protection at runtime, but it's kind of like a long term protection of the of the keys and not while they are used by the proxy, but where they are in store. So did you like consider other solutions for this like HSM's and do you have like any insights there that why did you end up choosing the nitro enclaves for this particular particular use case? So I'll be honest, that predates me at the company. I'm not sure why it is. I will I would say that we did level of evaluation that were probably not too deep. We are a startup for and find our feet at the time and we had implemented a level of encryption just inside a process. And then when we attempted to secure it and build it, the enclaves seemed like an easy solution. I think that we've proven they were not an easy solution. But yeah, that's so we we would have valid what we validated were just ways to do encryption that would guarantee we didn't have access to users keys and we couldn't decrypt any of their data. And yeah, uncle, it seemed easy in reality, not so easy. So there's one online question. Can you explain the TSTLF protocol that you use? Is the protocol specified somewhere and has it been formally verified? So it is. So we actually had to reimplement it. We I can't remember which one we did, but we've looked at one that was done by the confidential computing. Consorting more of the paper that was published on it and we it was attestation in TLS connection inserts as our original implementation. That then I can't remember the specifics of it. So I will have to refer you to our get history on this. We deployed it and we were able to do it. In production because people had to add our root CA to their root CA store because you couldn't extend TLS in the way that was specified in the RCA for customers. So we eventually had to switch to a new attestation, which unfortunately I'm not the expert on. But it is available in the TLS. It's written in Rust. It's on actually it is linked in the talks on the page and the files them under attestation bindings. So anyone can look at the protocol we use for a testing it. Effectively, we leverage the PCRs that are provided by the underlying nitro enclave to and then we have an attestation protocol that we use to test the TLS. The underlying nitro enclave to and then we have an attestation protocol that on connection to what we do a TLS handshake that then performs the attestation and the client must supply the attestation bindings and we have implementations on the client side and go Rust node Ruby Python. Actually not Ruby, just Python and node and go. Oh and Swift and Kotlin. I will ask it like this because the interference with the micro and then you can Yeah, sure. So there was also a bit of discussion in the chat here about nitro enclaves and in what far you can go about the E and I know this is an endless debate and we even had an exclusive debate last year. Maybe can you briefly react to that and maybe also say a bit about the infrastructure you built, how tidal is to nitro and then the next problem can be solved. Yeah, so last, oh yeah, sorry, repeating the question. It's the debate about nitro enclave versus TLS. They are not, as I said, they're not as open source because it's mainly on the client side, they're open source rather than the server side and it's mainly just white papers, I believe that specify how the nitro enclaves operate or just documentation. So and the other part of the question was. How specific the tooling you built in the company? Yeah, so how specific is the tooling to nitro? So we did evaluate other cloud providers to see if we could move off to it. This was done a year and a half ago. We looked at Azure for doing it. Azure didn't have the new Intel SGX or is it SGX? Sorry, TDS sorry. They didn't have the TDS at the time, so we validated that it couldn't fit our model of secure computing. We probably need to reevaluate now, but the tooling is very AWS focused right now and nitro enclave focused because it was about trying to make nitro enclaves easier for us to use. Conceptually though, the control plane and data plane aren't specific to that. So far, they could be reimplemented for anything that wants to do TCP over a network connection for inside non-clave and outside non-clave.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end":
