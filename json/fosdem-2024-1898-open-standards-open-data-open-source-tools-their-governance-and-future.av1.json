{"text": " So, hello everyone and thank you for your patience. So I am Tuto, I'm a project manager and expert contributor with an IT for PT. I'm based in Paris and why I'm here today is because I do believe that the tools, the data that we generate should be used to build communities and inclusion. You have below a couple of languages that you can ask me questions into try not Japanese because then no one will understand in the room. Thank you. So, IT for PT who we are, we are a non-profit association and what we do originally we actually come from onboard units where we created a standard for open architecture and data accessibility and interoperability which means that basically the bus, the trains, the trams, the rolling stock would all be standardized talking together from the actual wiring of the vehicle. So making sure everyone for example use the same internet connection into tapping into the same feedback loop to the back office. So we are a membership based association. We have over 160 members in 28 countries that will have railway operators, public transport agencies and other associations. So as I said what we do really is to build this architecture for interoperability first and foremost. We also gather together a community of open source developers, aficionados and passionate people so that's why we're here and we also have at the end a label for compliance making sure that when people use standards they're not alone and they can actually check that all their different units are compliant with the standard so then from the buyer perspective you know that it fits the norms that exist and I'm happy to have Breder with me. Yeah officially I'm a public product owner for a small team in Norway with 10 people representing and tour company owned by the Ministry of Transport. We are a non-profit. We work building open source tools. We are using public funded money in our development and we want to give as much as possible to back to the society both with open data and open sources collaborating with stakeholders in Europe, Norway and internationally. What we say we do is building an open infrastructure platform. The road authority builds roads, someone builds the harbors, airports, electricity, water supplies. We build an infrastructure platform for mobility data. Open source all the way for my part of the tour and advocate for that for also the rest. This is. So on this one we wanted to show you a little bit what exists today when we talk about data that relates to transport and public transport and also railway knowing that there are different types of standards and specifications that exist. So if you take the European context you will have this gigantic European norm that is called Transmodal that is really to be viewed as a data dictionary and a grammar. So it's not a standard. It's really a reference for you to cross check concepts, how they integrate one with another, how they are articulated, how actually they are defined and because it's a European norm it is also translated in most European languages so it also makes it easier to implement. Obviously a data dictionary, a data model is nothing if a data exchange format is not created. So there were two and way more open standards that were created based on Transmodal. One is netx that is timetable information that is everything that is known in advance to describe transport network, schedule, the fares and so on. You have Siri for real-time information or anything that is not known in advance that you will have real-time updates, vehicle monitoring, situation exchange for example if you need to close railway or public transport services and one that is upcoming that we will start working on defining very soon is OPRA which is more to run statistics, performance, so public transport agencies and authorities can compare one operator from the other. You also have in the screen shown GTFS schedule and GTFS real-time which are probably the most used today across the world to describe real actually timetables and real-time information based on the on these schedules so if you use any trip planning app a good chance is that it's actually based on GTFS data because we're here in the room I would also like to thank a couple of colleagues including Stefan because right now what we're doing is actually bridging what was first created for urban public transport with the rail domain through European project. So as I said I wanted to place a little bit everything that is open standard and open source within railway and open transport and basically is just to show you that everything is linked so as a customer you usually just see the trip planning part which is on the top right where you actually want to go from A to B so you'll get your train schedule your timetable and so on and also real-time information the train is cancelled services disrupted one is late and so on and so on or just the tram is arriving at the station all of that is thanks to the data that is issued from the back office that a lot of times especially for real-time data is actually based on vehicle data where the IT4PT specification exists so as you see we really try to map out all the different standards and specifications that exist to build all of that but that's really the backbone it was more for me to give you an indication that all the data you work on has been standardized and standards are open for you to participate in. Let's go back I will focus in my next minutes talk about the upper right corner IT4PT standards from the vehicle to the back office system that produce real-time data in Norway is more and more based on the IT4PT standards but I will not cover that in my presentation because we are in the upright corner from the inside and we will have demand for finalized data that we can use so the IT4PT stuff is done by the operators. This is a overview of our all components that my team is responsible for you can split it into two which is the input side and output side all of this is open source open at github someone in the room Hannes is part of the team so we are more here to ask other technical questions it's possible and one French company has downloaded this on github and one atender and serves a region in Paris. We seek collaboration with everyone don't reinvent the wheel again in this audience how many produce data or want to produce data for the mobility sector 10? Stevan, raise your hand you want the right way to produce data and make it open yeah and the rest of you you want to use data yeah yesterday in the middle of this week I was in another meeting where the EU country talked and showed what they have done with open data regarding netx and Siri the last year nine country showed up and all of them has a lot of work to do so let's go just briefly into what we have done in Attenture we have focused on high quality data we need that to produce good information to the travelers so the operator and authorities in Norway are responsible for three things we have a national stop-lapse registry so they manually update that they produce planned time travel data in Norway we say note the conversional data so they produce native netx from the start in this context netx is similar to gtfs but have a lot of more data support more into operational data can be transferred to the data and we use Siri protocols for real-time updates that is very similar to gtfs real-time we develop OpenTrip planner open source component we do that in collaboration with that project it's a successful collaboration supports both netx and gtfs supports high quality data in Attenture we reached in January one billion requests in a month in a country with five and a half million people so you want to travel a lot the API from OpenTrip planner is openly available you don't need to register but if you do you can have more access to it and we support mostly the main travel apps in Norway to use that API so we are getting the same information everywhere the API should be relevant for different users so it's flexible so the client can decide what is important for my users to show so the Ministry of Transport wants an tour to be a neutral one the national the biggest railway operator they want to show their offering first so they show their offerings and not the competing ones in the same way and other other regions based apps show only their local area and not enough and all of them are using the same API getting the same correct information everywhere we have one place to correct if it's wrong on the left side at the source we also share data in national access point which is a requirement in Europe there we share the API I talked about we share net text and stereo raw data files and we share gtfs and gtfs as well all of this is open available and what we say to the Norwegian data producers you have three responsibilities stop places the netx data and the return data and we from an tour can take care of the data is correct in all the apps and all the international apps also so we say to them deliver data to us and we can secure that it is correct as Google which is important for them we also see that the data producers want to use the data they have delivered to us that we have merged together with other data and we have quality validation tools so they want to use it themselves to do that they want they need to have more data than we need for public information they need operational data so we have added that into our data pipeline that is supported in netx and it's not supported in gtfs so that's the benefit of using netx in regards to gtfs and they starting now to use the data opens up giving them the possibility to get out of lock-in situations which is something that is usual in the public transport sector they have a big important software provider had it for many years and it's hard to shift and get out of it by going into the netx and doing that correct it's possible to break that circle to handle the extra data we do that with one validation in the previous slide but in open data we remove all the data that is for sensitive for operational part and we give them access to that in a different data set and it's this is worked works pretty nice today open source tools open tri- I can take open tri-planer I'm a man leading that open tri-planer is an open source tool started back in the US 13 14 years ago thanks Hemsner that's it was a successful tri-planning from the beginning increased usage worldwide added a lot of functionality and after 10 years when we started to use it we saw that it was built for big cities when we entered a graph with all the data from Norway the latency wasn't that usable from Oslo to Bergen 10 seconds we shut the stop the search give one answer we decided to get away the community to build a new version so and to took that lead on that development the two first years we did the development alone we had meetings with the collaboration so we secured that we was on the same path today we are around 10 to 15 companies actively develop on it we do that together in the same master branch we have regular product owner meetings to discuss the direction on it and we share resources the open tri-planer is a multimodal tri-planer supports all kinds of modes we are still not finalized with it but it works and we can collaborate even more and it supports the standards we talked about today netx and syria and gtfs and gtfs and it's supported in the same instance so you can use those standards together and then we're getting to the part that might interest you the most is we wanted to present to you today all the open source tools that exist and others that need to be built and hopefully some of you will raise their hand and help us build them in the sense that it is a good good for the ecosystem so what exists is mostly thanks to the amazing work done at N2 because everything is open source so they have as red said an open registry for a stop place registry so all the stop points in europe pushed by the european delegation we have a national access point so it's kind of like open data platform for every single of the 27 plus three european countries where you can find a lot of data sets and not only just public transport some of them for example in france you can have the registry of all the places where you have cal pooling you can also have description of bicycle lane and so on if some of them need for you to create a login a user and a password it's mostly to try and keep up in the kpi of how many people actually use the data and you have a lot of other open source data libraries you used to have transit feeds now it's called a mobility database you have the mobility hub for gbfs and so on in n-tool you also have a data creation tool that is called n plan so to really create your schedule and your data in netx and we have four netx two validation tools that are fully open source and two developed by n-tool and green light developed through the european project data for pt which is basically to check if your netx feed is correct against the xsd scheme and then you have a lot of other smaller open source tools such as the one created by dg transit alkadis abi and so on but what we wanted to show is those are the tools that people created a lot within their companies within european projects within their initiatives because it replied to specific needs however now that we get more and more data that is open we need to create more tools so ideas we had discussing with a lot of people but happy to hear your thoughts are graphical representations of netx and serif feeds for example conversion tools from netx to merits that is more on the railway or bridging the different open source validation tools that exist or analytical tools so that's it for our presentation and most of it we want to hear from you if you have questions on either some tools we could develop or how to actually extend gtfs or gbfs or netx or seri how do we work with the railway industry and osdm which is also one that we did not have time to present today so the floor is yours actually i know the question about netx because it was kind of small on the slide that it's the Nordic profile that's the interviewers what are the difference between profiles or what does that mean compatibility with other countries so your question is on the compatibilities of the different profiles i was asked to repeat the question for the live stream so perfect no netx is a huge standard made by more or less theoretical parts so almost every use case you can think of in public transport is supported in the standard it's allowed in within the standard to model a specific use case in different ways and it's still valid so to make data interoperable and usable for serpartis we need to have profiles the regulation came at the same time that netx was uh valid yes in the european this is a valid standard and the regulation came but it wasn't the profiles existing so the uk started with a small profile first then french built a bigger one and then in 2015 and tour came with our aims that was extremely high we wanted to support what i showed in in the slides both the information part but also support the operational part for the rail operators which is complex and also for bus operators and and more so the french profile was based on the uk we based our profile on the french added stuff and a couple of years ago uh EU profile came which is almost part of the french small differences yes first supports all of the most important parts of the european profile the norleague profile but not the operational part is not supported and not needed in the EU profile but there are this will speak it's just a small the the differences between the norleague profiles and the EU profile uh and what we see now in europe is that too many countries build their own profiles so we started also this one with a norwegian profile but together with a collaboration with the norweg countries sweden danmark and finland we asked our neighboring countries is our profile supporting your use cases if yes thumbs up we collaborate if no come to us ask us and we see what's the difference and they come back they had some uh small things that wasn't supported so we added that to the profile and they had some ideas this is a better way of solving this use case and we changed it and that we was in live production development with different stakeholders producing the data and we changed the profile and it went back to my left side on the previous presentation you have to change your export oh you're gonna have to give them money no you're not getting any money you have to change it we stopped the validation you are not allowed to produce data into our production if you don't change this and then they changed it so the difference there is uh today we see that it's very hard to use net text data from a different country into the same system you don't do something so that's what i spent the last week to highlight yeah we need to solve that as well yeah was that answering your question yes you", "segments":
