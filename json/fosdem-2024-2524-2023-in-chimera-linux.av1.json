{"text": " Hello, everyone. I'm Daniel Kolesa. I'm the author and primarily developer of Kimmer Linux. First, in the first half of the talk, I will give you an overview of the project in case there's somebody there. There's probably many people here who haven't heard of it or don't know what it's about. And in the second part of the talk, I will sort of give you an update on what happened during last year. So first, what is Kimmer Linux? It's a general purpose Linux distribution primarily geared towards client computers such as desktops, but also others. It's built from scratch, not based on any other existing distribution with broad focus to it. And it's based on free BSD core tools, the muscle ellipsi and the LVM tool chain as its system compiler. It's hardened when it comes to tool chain security more than most distros and it's also very portable. Currently supporting official binary packages for five architectures, this includes R64, both big and little and in PPC64, Risk 5 and X86. It's based on binary packaging with APK tools, which is also known from Alpine Linux, but we use the next generation of APK tools, which is currently under development and not used by any other distro. It's a rolling release system, so packages are deployed continuously and there's no fixed releases anywhere. There's custom built source packaging infrastructure, which was written from scratch specifically for the distro. And it's generally meant to be lightweight and pragmatic, so not really focusing on one specific thing like many niche projects, but also overall they're still... I'm not really trying to make it to be like anything else. We also don't use system D, but we are trying to not to be militant about it because I kind of really hate doing that, so you won't find anything like that there. Why make this? Well, I want to make a well-rounded system I would personally enjoy using and also make proper use of LLVM's features, which they give us over GCC, for example, when it comes to security hardening. I'd like to improve software I'm unhappy with and overall focus on robustness and having a deterministic system which will always install the same way and work out of the box, but still being transparent and simple. And also good to default for things. As for some core principles of the system, I believe that some sort of technical purity is mostly counterproductive and makes things in general worse, so we try to not assume too much and sort of just make a flexible thing. I think that minimalism doesn't really mean anything by itself, so I try to focus on other things instead. I do believe that the system should be simple and it's better than being complex, but I also do believe that if complexity is necessary, then it's necessary. It's better than being complicated and requiring tons of setup. I think that development should be opinionated, but I also do think that dogmas are mostly bad and what we should actually focus on is a good software design. In general, we try to be inclusive, open and accessible. Also it's free software, so it's managed like free software. I think it's important to have fun when it comes to free software communities, so we try to basically make sure everything goes towards that. I don't know that mostly anything goes. Now let's get to the system design. I think it's good to always be strict by default. That is try to make sure that people always do the right thing, make sure that things are as strict as possible when it comes to, for example, when building software, having proper lint for everything, having sandboxing and so on. There should always be at least one good and obvious way to do things. I do believe that portability is extremely important as well as security and both of these should be preferred over having high benchmark numbers. I'd like to have self-sustaining tooling which can be retargeted to different environments so that when we need to switch to something else, it's actually easy to do and we do not get stuck with some weird old software. I do believe that the system should be atomic if possible when it comes to package transactions. To this end, I've been working on getting rid of things like post-installation hooks and so on instead making sure that as much of the transaction is atomic as possible so it doesn't get interrupted and could be rolled back. I'd like to encourage doing good and if something is written in a shell, it should usually not be written in a shell. I think there's always room for improvement and nothing is ever good enough. I also do believe that even though we are not using system D, it's not the devil so it's fine to get inspired if needed. Now let's get to packaging infrastructure. We have a custom system called C-Ports and it's implemented in Python. I started this in 2021 when I was still using Void Linux on my machines and basically I was unhappy with Xbpssrc being a massive pile of bash scripts. It had many drawbacks such as being slow, not having sufficient sandbox, being insecure so you couldn't really trust it to do some tasks. So I sort of redesigned the whole thing in hopefully a better way. It's sandboxed, it's very fast so you can introspect all the metadata and so on in real time. It's easy to use and it's optimized to minimize the amount of effort necessary for a small team to maintain things. So right now we have about 1600 packaging templates and we maintain them for all these architectures and there's only a few cometers. It's extremely important to actually have a tool link which will catch many different issues for you because otherwise it just becomes too much. So we have things like nightly update checks to stay on top of things and heavy linting for everything, heavy sandboxing, everything is containerized so all the software is built in a sandbox which has no network access, a read-only file system, sanitized defaults, deterministic installation of dependencies and so on. At the same time it makes it very easy to add new packages if necessary. Now let's take, this is how the C ports templates grew during last year. We started at around 800 and ended at some 1500. This is the comets, like overall comets in C ports. So we pretty much doubled everything during last year and this is how offers of templates or comets grew. So we went from around 10 to almost 50. Now let's get to the updates. During 2023 we released an alpha version which means the project is now ready to take on some users if they are feeling a little bit adventurous. The repositories are receiving major expansion constantly with new packages being added pretty much all the time. The system is usable as a daily driver with some precautions. I'm using it on many computers, many people are using it. There's still plenty more work to be done in all areas. Users are currently expected that if they are missing something in the repos they will add this and maintain it if possible. We have a lot of major software packages, a lot of it being done during last year including all the big web browsers like container infrastructure, office suite, Qt6, Java, different big programs. A lot of smaller programs which are still popular. We gained support for Flatpak which successfully supplements whatever is not packaged yet at least on the X86 architecture. We are still trying to make sure to package things if possible because it makes sure that people can actually run this software on all architecture supported by the distro which is not necessarily guaranteed when you are using Flatpak. There have been tool changes. We are now based on LVM 17. We default to no cement interposition. We default to initializing variables to zero. We have the new Lipsy++ hardening flags enabled. We have expanded Fortify source. We also shrunk the executable size a bit thanks to linker changes. Also since last year there is finally proper infrastructure which includes build bot which automatically builds all packages as comments come in. Somebody merges a request or pushes to the repository. Build bot will pick it up. It will deploy the jobs to all the workers. The workers will build stuff and deploy it back to repos. It is pretty much real time with only the overhead of actually the build time. The infrastructure is very simple thanks to C build itself providing pretty much everything it needs to do. That means it can do all the bulk sorting and so on pretty much by default. Which means what build bot needs to do is suggest it receives comments. It checks which templates were, well it doesn't even do that actually. It just tells the worker find all packages which are not yet present on repos but are present in the C ports. Sort of diff it with the existing state. Then do the sort to make sure that the bulk is built in correct order. This includes transit if dependencies which are not even included in the transaction and so on. And things will just automatically get built and it happens in half a second. We also have a fancy package browser at this URL now. As for low level user line changes we have an initial API for our session tracker which has been created from scratch to properly support user services in the system. We utilize this heavily to, for example, sound server and session bus is run within as a user service so you no longer have the bus launch or the bus run session nonsense like you had on many legacy systems. Instead it's done in the same way as on system D systems where you have one session bus which is started when you log in and then it persists as long as something needs it. We have user line based on free BSD 14. We switched to system DUDEF in place of EUDEF because EUDEF has been going out of date and it's pretty much just worse in all aspects. We have adopted system DETMP files and CIS users in the core to manage all the temporary state and all the system users to make sure they can be recreated as necessary. We also have system D compatible support for BINFMT config files so emulators can be set up in a transparent way and when you install QMU user for an architecture it will install the configuration file properly reload and you will get your emulation. As for service management we are preparing for the adoption of debuff broker instead of classic debuff demon. This will mean fully service driven activation of debuff services which means nothing will, everything will be supervised, there will be no legacy spawn this demon and then don't care about it because that sucks. So for this we are currently working on Libdin CTL which will add an or which already adds an API to interact with DIN from C and as well as over debuff and we will have a debuff broker controller which will use this API to generate if needed ephemeral services you know or like if something already has a service and it will just use that instead of generating anything. As for service management we have new service targets for example for time thing so services which depend on NTP can use this or firewalls can make sure they start before other networking demon starts and so on. The whole early service package got a big overhaul so there's different new helpers for say SW clock which is used on systems with no real time clock in hardware for swaps with CTL and so on and so on so to reduce dependencies on other packages. We have improved support for read only root file system and it should pretty much just work out of the box these days as well as countless minor quality of life improvements. As for hardware support this is Kibara running on a Steam Deck OLED for example which works out of the box. We have LTS kernel 6.6 and stable kernel 6.7. We gain support for Raspberry Pi 5 which is in the same images as all the other Raspberry Pi so we support 3, 4, 5 in one image as was shown before Steam Deck support. We introduced support for Big End in PPC64 which runs on machines as old as PowerMax G5 so that's something people can experiment with. Also we have AMD CPU working on Ampere Ultra R64 machine-sided box which needed some cursed kernel patches which were only present in some trees so otherwise you get garbage in the screen which is currently happening on every other distribution. As for conclusion it's been a very nice productive year. There's probably going to be a beta release possibly in late spring or early summer. The upcoming focus is going to be on service management because there's still more things to improve in there. I'd like to introduce more support for advanced service management features including better support for capabilities, possibly some name spacing, possibly proper config file management. Also session tracking is going to be a major focus. I'd like to expand the turn style API so it can fully replace E-Logindy because E-Logindy has been hugely insufficient for us. The main issue with E-Logindy is basically with SystemD you have your Logindy which interacts with SystemD directly so it can spawn the user session and then do it and it can actually properly interact with E-Logindy. It's mostly geared towards systems which are legacy so they use legacy style service management with system services only and you have no way to properly track the lifetime of any E-Logindy session. This is bad for us because for example we want to be able to ensure that user services can linger beyond the scope of the user session but if we have E-Logindy managing the runtime directory then we cannot do that because E-Logindy has no way to tell it to do this so it's kind of bad and we really need the proper solution. We are already patching E-Logindy to enable some of these things but I'd like to not patch anything and just get rid of it entirely. Also as a part of service management focus I would like to introduce proper logging infrastructure which means something like a journal where you can actually log both legacy log stuff as well as STD out from different services, have a central daemon which will properly deal with things like log rotation and so on in a better way than we have now. I would also like to focus on package management. This will possibly include things like ZSTD support for package compression and many different enhancements made possibly optional packages. Right now we only have reverse optional packages which is nice but makes some things clunky at times and there's a huge amount of work to do but we're going to get to it eventually. Thank you for listening and now if you have any questions feel free to ask. I will try my best to answer them. Yeah? Thanks for the talk. There are many talks these days of maintainer burnout and you know the lack of financing in open source. How is Chimera doing at this point? Sorry can you repeat that? Is Chimera while financed and are you okay in terms of you know load? You don't suffer from, do you feel that you may suffer from maintainer burnout if the project grows in size? Are you asking about financing? Yes. Is Chimera okay at this point? Well currently there's no financing to speak of like it's entirely volunteer driven. There is five server for example for building these five packages sponsored by a community member. The X86 dedicated server used for building X86 packages is paid for by me. I also have my own hardware for PPC64LE. As for other builders for R64 and also for Big ND and PPC64. These are sponsored by Oregon State University as VMs in their open source lab so that's really nice of them. I do not really think it needs financing right now. We are managing quite okay I would say but in the long term sure maybe it's something to think about. Now here. You have the year wrong on your date on the slides. The year is wrong on the date on your slides. What? Oh. Yeah sure. Paying attention. I am curious if you could explain maybe a few words about things like turnstile and E-log in D and what you feel is significant that system D brings to session management that you want to reproduce that other system D free Linux's don't do? Sure. I can explain that. Basically what log in D does in its core is it tracks when users log in and when they log out so it can actually keep track of the session and other applications can check this data so they can inspect what sessions exist, what kind of session type it is, what kind of session class it is, what C group is associated with that, like what processes belong in a specific session and other applications can make use of this information. What it also does is manage seats which means it gives you secure access to devices. Basically since Linux devices do not really have a concept of having multiple users being connected to them, you can ask log in D for a file descriptor to a GPU device for instance and it will give you that and it will hold it in place so that nothing else can ask for it and also nothing else will have physical access to the device node so only log in D is permitted to give you file descriptors to the device. This is extremely important for Wayland Compositors for instance and E-log in D basically provides you this functionality but it doesn't provide you proper session tracking or anything at all and session tracking is also used by say Wayland Compositors or log in majors or lots of different things. For session for seats tracking there's a project called Lipset and it also ships with a demon called CDD which will give you this secure access to the devices but it does not give you the session tracking so basically turnstile is supposed to complement this and make one whole thing which will provide the same functionality and it does so in a way which is very important sort of vendor independent so in addition to having its own solution it will also be simplified API interface to log in D itself which means different software would be able to adapt to this API and have support for both log in D itself as well as turnstile the demon as well as potentially some third party solutions for example for BSD systems which currently has nothing for this and that's why their Wayland support is very limited for example. I think we could take one more, does anyone? So what is the state about software installer? Is this also planned for the BDG? State of what? Of a lacking installer system because of its copy pasting files now? Well as for installer the problem with installers is that they are very complicated to make which means it hasn't really been a focus for now instead the manual installation is extremely simple and you can do it in like three minutes but there is a plan to have an installer eventually it's just not something which has been you know focused for now because it's complicated and it's a big project on its own to do properly otherwise if you don't do that you will end up with bad installer which will have many issues and will be limited in use so it's better to properly think about it and do it right. And a quick second question will be like a rolling release strategy or will be like releases in sync with the BSD user land utilities? Well the distro itself is rolling release we do update to new the user land utilities are using free BSD releases currently at 14 and we do update to new releases as they come out so it does not really sync with free BSD current for example but other than occasional backpacks when something major happens and we want it earlier but in general we stay on top of free BSD releases and use that. Okay thank you. I think yes we are out of time so thank you Daniel. Okay thank you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.6, "text": " Hello, everyone. I'm Daniel Kolesa.
