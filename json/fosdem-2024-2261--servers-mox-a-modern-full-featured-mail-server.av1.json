{"text": " So good afternoon. My name is Michiel Lekin. I'm a freelance software developer from the Netherlands. Last year here at FOSDEM, I first announced Mox, a modern, secure, all-in-one e-mail server. As you may know, running your own mail server has a bit of a reputation for being hard to do, but what have I told you? Running a modern mail server can be easy. Alright. So, thank you. So the goal of Mox is to make it really easy to run your own mail server so that you actually do it, and then you can stay in control of your data, and you can help keep e-mail decentralized. Now, Mox is a new implementation, entirely new, and written in Go. Now, that's a lot of work, and you might ask, why would you do that? Because we have so many open source components that you can just use, and that's true. And for the past decade, I've used many of those components to good use. But a few years ago, I had to reinstall my machine, so I got a completely new one, and I just felt a bit reluctant to install that same software again that I've been using for the past decade. And for two reasons, at least. One is to see. The language with small mistakes have big consequences. Don't get me wrong, I like C as well, maybe in the past. And the software written in C is very high quality, but I wanted a new machine that lasted for another decade, and I see that C is not really going to be part of that too much at some point. But the bigger problem is basically the complexity. Over time, as e-mail has grown, new protocols added, new extensions, new software components have been added as well. So, to make our fully modern e-mail system, you need many components and make them all work together. I think many self-hostings, at least, they stop halfway, so they have a semi-modern e-mail system set up. You can make it easier to get all this configured and set up with a distribution or a Docker image or something, but you still have all these components working together. There's many integration points, a bit of friction, some data loss. Sometimes there's security issues when, you know, message headers are seen as authoritative but added by some component. So, I think what happened is with all this complexity, some people, you know, just stopped running their own mail servers anymore because it just too much work, and they migrated to the cloud, centralizing e-mail, that's not a great development. So, what we need is an easy to use mail server. So, you need to write a set of features. So, Mox tries to deliver many features. I'm at four for reading your e-mail, S&TP for sending receiving e-mail, SPF, DKIM, DMARC for message authentication, because just S&TP is not enough, but that's also not enough. You need TLS, of course, for encrypting your communications, but S&TP for sending receiving e-mail is unverified TLS. So, you want MTA, STS, and ordain to, you know, check that you're talking to the right person, right machine. So, Mox implements both for incoming and outgoing e-mail. Then there's ECME for, you know, your management of TLS certificates. You want to make it easy, don't do any manual TLS tumbling. Junk filtering is part of Mox. So, based on historic messages and their non-junk classifications, Mox will reject, accept, incoming mail, more about that in a moment. Then internationalization, so you can have Unicode in your e-mail addresses and your headers, both in your domains with IDN and your local parts. Autoconfiguration is in their various flavors, all supported by Mox to make it easy for mail clients to find and write service settings for new accounts. Then we've got a webmail included in Mox. We'll have a quick look at that in a moment as well. An admin web interface, so all configuration is in files. We want the full power. You can use the admin interface to quickly navigate and make some changes like add, remove, an e-mail address, an account, or a domain. A web service included, it may sound a bit crazy over the top, but modern e-mail basically requires HTTP stack with MTA, STS, Autoconfig, Jmap soon. Now it's already part of the deal. What I've noticed is people trying to run Mox and a web server on the same machine. That's really annoying because configuration gets complicated. Instead, I just added some web server to Mox for some static file serving and reverse proxying. That problem is also solved. Permit these metrics, structured logging, operations become a bit easier. Then the Mox Quickstart. That makes all this stuff easy to do. Installing Mox, you take a new machine, you've got a domain, you run the Quickstart and you pass it an e-mail address at your new domain. Mox will generate, so the Quickstart will generate configuration file, decon keys, etc. Create a new account. We'll print all the DNS records that you'll copy, paste into your zone file, or you have to manually edit them in your web interface of the DNS operator. That's not so great. Then Mox also, the Quickstart, also Linux, generates a system-d unit service file, so you just enable that and start it. Then you've got a fully working modern e-mail system. All of this is MIT licensed, so you can do whatever you want basically. Then as developers, a little bit about code. As I said, it's a new codebase. It's a modern codebase coherent. All of this is in the same style. It's very self-contained, so few dependencies. That makes it possible to have it in the same style. It's about 73,000 lines of go and 21,000 lines of tests, mostly unit tests and a bit of integration tests and some fuzzing tests. There's 11,000 lines of type scripts, very strict type scripts for webmail and interfaces. The code is cross-referenced with RFCs to make it very, not easy, but to make it something more maintainable. You can look back and see why you did certain things. Of course, Mox is written in Go, so it brings a whole bunch of advantages like memory safety, standalone binaries, completely subtly linked, also includes a few assets, so it's really just one file that you need. Fast compilation time, great for developers. Dependency management is pretty much solved in Go. You get reproducible builds out of the box, and it also works with cross-compilation, which is trivial to use in Go. Now, there's not much to see about a server, but we have a webmail that I can show you. It's not pretty, but it looks mostly like a standard email client, I think. Mailboxes, message list, message view. Let's open up mailing list. There's some threading in there. You can select multiple. I'm using keyboard shortcuts as well. Mark some unread messages and mark them read. Then there's HTML support with or without external resources and tracking pixels. Then there's a little example of Unicode addresses. The search is easy to use. We've got some quick filters on that side. We could send a message, but I'm sending a message from another mail client that should be arriving. There it is. Select some text to quote as civilized people and send a response. That's a webmail. It's not pretty, but it mostly works for my needs of email, sending and reading. Then I would like to say many things about lots of features, but I just limit to one thing, spam filtering in Mox. Analysis for incoming messages is based on historic messages in an account, based on their junk and non-junk flags. It's always per account. Whatever one account does is not related to what happens for the incoming message for your own account. Of course, this means in order for this to work, you need to have the proper flags on all the messages or as many messages as possible. Email clients don't always help with this, but Mox does help with that because in the default setup, you get an account where incoming messages or messages moved to the junk mailbox gets the message flag. If you move something to a archive mailbox, it automatically gets the non-junk flag. Also, if you move it to the trash mailbox. Also, if you're in the webmail and you have a message open for five seconds, that's long enough for it not to be junk, probably, so it also gets the non-junk flag. That means most of the messages in the store will have these flags set properly. There's a difference in how Mox handles known senders versus first-time senders. For the known senders, they're recognized from sender address or just the domain of the sender address. Maybe it's another person at the same company. Or we look at SPF or Decombe signals in a mail message or we look at the IP address of the remote server or various subnets of the IP address. If there are recent historic messages from that same sender, we look at the junk and non-junk classifications of those messages. If the recent ones were junk, we reject the message and otherwise we accept the message. But if it's a first-time sender, we don't know enough about that sender. We do, of course, something else. So, the BEG analysis is also part of Mox. It's essentially a reputation of words. So, you look at the words in the message, then you look at historic messages and their words and their junk and non-junk classifications. If there are too many spammy words in the message, you reject. If there are enough hammy words in a mail message, you accept. Then you can also configure a DNS blog list in Mox, but it's off by default for a few reasons. One, often these DNS blog lists are centralized services. We don't want to rely so much on them. And you would be sending the remote IPs of those you communicate with to some central party, which is also not great. Then we don't want to break existing email flows. So, this is also one of the reasons why it's only on first-time senders. So, if you've been communicating with someone for a long time and suddenly someone puts their mail server on a blog list, you can keep communicating with them at one break, only if that person really started spamming you all of a sudden, then you mark a few messages as junk and then in the future, the mail filter will just adjust. Now, in Mox, being all in one mail server really helps with this because during the S&TP transaction, all this historic data, these messages and flags and words are available for analysis. Then a special handling for messages from mailing lists and forwards because essentially most of the analysis disabled and DMARC policies are not enforced. Now, what do you do with an incoming junk message once it's classified? Well, one does not simply deliver to the spam mailbox. That's not friendly for users and not for senders or recipients and senders, I think, because the sender thinks that the message has been seen and doesn't get a reply. The recipient may be receiving some message and doesn't get it, so they wait or they constantly check both the inbox and the spam box. I think it erodes trust in email. So, I understand that it's done to not give spammer's feedback about their spam runs, but users should come first. So, instead what Mox does, Mox rejects the message at the S&TP level while it's coming in with a temporary error code and a very generic message. So, the generic message means that the spammer doesn't know for sure why it's being rejected and a temporary error code means or causes the sending server to try again a few times and at some point tell the original sender, you know, this message cannot be delivered and then they know they can find another way to communicate. So, you don't have this problem anymore of lost messages in the spam box. But just like with the spam mailbox, Mox has kind of the same thing but different. It's the rejects mailbox. So, anything that's rejected is still stored in this special mailbox. It's a fixed size mailbox. Old messages automatically removed and so you're waiting for some kind of transactional email. Maybe you did a sign up to a website. It's not coming in. Then you can check the rejects mailbox if the message, because maybe the sending website used the infrastructure with a bad reputation. Then I can just move that message from the rejects mailbox to the inbox, Margaret is non junk and the next time because of the historic based filtering, next time those messages from that sender will be accepted. So, the important point is that you don't have to keep checking the rejects mailbox because the sender knows you didn't get it and that's different from the spam mailbox. So, this seems to be a graph for me but if you have ideas on how to improve on this, let me know. Then a bit about the roadmap. There's still a lot to do in Mox. So, I want to implement a simple HTTP based API for sending some messages and also receiving some feedback. Just so web apps for example can just with a simple call make some sense of emails. If you know of any standardized ways of doing this, let me know. Yeah, okay. But I said simply, really the dumbest thing. But I guess maybe it can be that simple. Then I want to add calendaring. It's not email but users and myself included expect it to come with email. I need some more SNTP and IMAP extensions. A JMAP will be coming at some point. So, so far I focused on IMAP because all my meal clients were using IMAP and I wanted to have a working meal system. But, you know, I, JMAP will be, will be coming. I want to encrypt all data at rest. It's not currently done. I want to be able to have a second Mox as a backup, Mx and a backup instance. In order to do junk filtering on the second instance, I will need all the data as well or the historic messages. So I want to synchronize everything to the other one. And then I, you know, the, the, once all the data is there, you can also use it as a, as a, as a failover machine. So that will, that will be nice. Forwarding to external addresses not yet done because it's a complicated, gets complicated quickly. I think modern email is not really set up for that anymore. So, Mox is a different way of applying rules to incoming messages. Then lots more on the list. Too much for today. So, final slide. So it's been a year since I first put out the Mox code. I've gotten quite a lot of feedback. So thanks everyone who sent in bug reports and made feature requests or sent in patches. Very helpful. Then also thanks to NLMet. They've been funding continued developer the Mox since August last year. So that's been instrumental to keeping working and being able to keep working on this. Also thanks to everyone who wrote all those RFCs about email. They're very, they're excellent and they match practice quite often. So my call to action today. If you're not doing so already start running your own mail server, you know, staying in control of your data and keep email decentralized. And you have many options ready. And now there's just another one called Mox. So give it a try. Send me an email. It's a great way to communicate. Thank you. Thanks. Oh, I saw you first. You only have three minutes. First of all, I think it's a quite incredible project for one person. And I was wondering how many third party libraries do you use and how much the code you write directly to implement all this? Yes. So I think the main external library is called Beebolt, which is a fork of the database layer. So the messages are stored in files. The database layer is a database thing and it's pretty much a key value store. But anyway, that's the main external dependencies. There's something for Prometheus. And then there are a few dependencies that I wrote myself. So those are not really all that external. And otherwise it's mostly the Go standard library and the extended Go standard library. So very few external things. So yeah, it feels a bit like a not invented here syndrome. So I want to rewrite everything. But it has been very instrumental because sometimes I've made sweeping changes and there's no one. I don't have to make pull requests, try to convince people to do something that suits my needs so I can do whatever I want. So it's really sped up development, I think. Fantastic project. I have a quick question regarding database. I don't know if it was answered right away because I heard the database was whether the data is a sort of a database if you like or could be changed or whether and whether whatever it is, could we use Unix normal tools to just go through them? No. No, you cannot use normal Unix tools. What I don't really want is say having a meal day that someone else also makes changes to because I have to do lots of work to make sure that I synchronize or chase as well. So I've chosen a simple approach. So messages are just stored in a file system individually at the moment and there's one database per account that has the index for all the messages in that account and that stores also the message flags, etc. So the database is also essential basically for all the history and all the data. I could talk for a long time about the database library but. Okay, quick one. What is your experience with scaling this up? How many does a MOX thing? I've not tried. It caught me because of the Bayesian per user and we tried that and that didn't work out. So I have no idea where the limitations are. So I would like to try to see where it breaks and I don't know at the moment. So I've only run it small scale and really targeting it small like self hosting a bit and not the tens of thousands of users or something. So I see many hands which is great. We have a little more time since we have the switch of succession. Anyway, when people leave in the meantime maybe be silent so we can use the time for a few more questions. Let's try how many we can get. I didn't see the order so forgive me. Thank you. Do you have any plans for LMTP support? No. But why would you use it? Why would you need it? I'm writing a small... Oh, you need the microphone. You need the microphone. Sorry. I'm writing a small like mandrel clone and now that they shut down and for that I need to be able to put an email message into the server. Yeah, okay. So maybe a better solution would be to put it in the go code and make like a fork or something. From what I've seen LMTP is almost like SMTP but just it has this improvement of getting reply codes per... It's just simpler. It's lightweight. It's just a dumb-down version for mail drops. Did I get that right? You reject mails but still deliver them in the rejects mailbox. Yes. Whoa. Wow. Scary. Yes. About the reject. So I think that's basically like grey filtering if you are... It's basically like grey filtering except that you will continue to reject them or do you do anything special if they come back or if they go... Yeah, so if they come back with the same message, I deduplicate it based on the message ID or the hash of the entire message if there's no message ID. But then we'll still be considered rejected. Yeah, it will still be rejected. Yeah, yeah. And does this interact with the junk no junk flag for Thunderbird and other IMAP clients? Well, so I think there's the flag dollar junk and dollar non junk and as far as I see Thunderbird sets it without the dollar. So it's not useful. But it does also interfere, I guess, because Thunderbird does not a client side and it would work but it's kind of duplicate then. So I disabled it. I disabled the automatic classification on my Thunderbird setup and I just let the server basically do it myself. So I now don't get a lot of junk. The filtering is okay. I still get a few pericas sometimes one a day and I just junk it and then it's okay. Okay. Thank you for your questions. There's still a matrix chat. Mikaela will be around. Thank you Mikaela.
