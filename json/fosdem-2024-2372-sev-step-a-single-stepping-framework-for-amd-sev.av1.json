{"text": " So, the next speaker is Luca Wilk from the University of Lubbeck and he will talk about some recent work he has been doing, actually, attack research. I'm very excited that the Dev Room from the start has had some consistent attack research line as well, which I think is very important for this new type of technology. So Luca, enlighten us. Yeah, thank you very much for the kind introduction. I will be talking about SCVSTEP, which is a single stepping framework for AMD SCV, and it's open source and available on GitHub, so feel free to check it out. And this was created as part of an academic paper, which is joint work with these great people down here. Okay, just a quick recap where we are in the trusted execution environment landscape. So as the name suggests, SCVSTEP is about AMD SCV. So we are in this confidential VM area here. However, single stepping is something that basically affects all TEs that are out there right now, so keep that in mind. Okay, with that out of the way, we can jump right in and explore what single stepping attacks actually are. So we start with a quite high level picture. What you want to do here is you want to take some kind of snapshot or observation of our protected application, and we use this for our tech. Now, if our TE runs normally, then it runs basically at full speed, and if we take these snapshots, we don't affect any synchronization with this TE process, and thus the observation and the data that we get is very blurry. But now if we start to interrupt the enclave at certain points, then we have these synchronous points in time where you can start to take our snapshots. So it's not running in parallel anymore, but the enclave is paused when we take our snapshots. And thus we already get a little bit more information. And now if we take this to the maximum resolution and we are able to interrupt the enclave after every single instruction reliably, then we get a pretty clear picture of what's going on. So I hope that already gave you like a good intuition. And now we go into what single-stepping attacks have actually been used for, mostly in academia. And these are all examples that have been done with SGX that really made this popular in academia because it made single-stepping very accessible. So the first attack avenue basic here is something called interrupt latency, and there you basically measure how long it takes from where you like started this attack to when you get like this callback that the enclave has been now interrupted or exited. And it has been shown that this timing actually revealed something about the kind of information that's running in the enclave. And for some instructions like different instructions, you can even learn something about the operands. So dividing by certain numbers takes longer than dividing by other numbers. And thus you really kind of instruction and maybe even the operand with these attacks. Then the second major attack avenue here is called interrupt counting or instruction counting. And here the idea is that certain algorithms and applications have secret dependent control flows, especially true for cryptographic algorithms. We have some secret key, and then I do some large integer multiplication or division and decode the dusted. Executes a different number of instructions depending on the secret data. And now when I do this senior stepping attacks, I can simply count the numbers of steps that I take. And then if I know on which code page I'm currently in, then I can learn something about the secret data just by observing the number of instructions. So in this tiny example here with a conditional jump, and in one case we skip over this move here, and the others we don't. So here we get two instructions executed here, three. And by knowing the code that's currently running, we can infer the value of the secret bit here. Then the third really popular attack avenue is not directly senior stepping, but closely related. It's called zero stepping. And here the idea is that we interrupt the enclave even more frequently. So before this able to actually execute a single instruction. So it doesn't make any progress on an architectural level, but on a micro-architectural level, it is first instruction. It's already starting to execute, then gets a board and roll it back. But on the micro-architectural state, there's actually still already stuff going on. And these attacks are able to measure this. And what we can do then is basically take an infinite number of measurements, but only running the enclave once. And this allows you to measure really, really tiny effects. And then the third column here is kind of the miscellaneous sketch all column. So as you can imagine, just by increasing this temporal resolution, you can improve basically any side channel attacks. So it has been used in many of these MDS attacks here, for example. Okay, so now that we know what senior stepping basically is and why it's really dangerous, we come to the main question of the stock here. Can ACVVM be single stepped? And if so, how? So let's take a look at the basic setup here. So this is like a very boiled down version of the control loop that's going on in the hypervisor, where we enter DVM here. Then we execute some instructions and then at some point we exit. So for senior stepping, the obvious question is, when we exit DVM here, this is what you want to control in our attack. And there are multiple reasons why this can happen. So we can configure certain instructions to be intercepted. And you can also use page for it by removing access rights in these nested page tables. However, none of these two methods give us the amount of control that we want because they are not instruction granular. However, you can also use external interrupts to force an exit from our VM. And this is actually what will allow us to achieve this instruction granularity. And for this, the attacker uses something that's called the APIC timer. It's a common timer on x86 used by the operating system. And by injecting this timer, we will force exits from DVM. So let's zoom in a little bit. This is a typical attack sequence here. In red, we have the coded ones in the hypervisor. It's controlled by the attacker. And on the right here, the blue, that's the three instructions from DVM that you just saw. So what do we need to do now to achieve senior stepping? Well, intuitively, you would think that you would need to hit this tiny window between these two instructions here to single step. However, luckily on x86, it's already sufficient if our interrupt hits somewhere during the execution of this instruction. Because then it will be held pending and will be basically recognized at instruction boundary. Okay, but if we just naively implement this and try to do this, then we are not quite there yet. And we will see that sometimes we will overshoot here and then we will execute two or more instructions. And this, of course, decreases our resolution because now we cannot guarantee that we do something after every instruction. Maybe we have bad luck and skip over very important memory access instructions also on. So this is really bad, this mighty stepping. And on the other side, we might undershoot a little bit and zero step. And this is not really dangerous because then we simply repeat, we don't miss out on any instructions. We just try again and it's a little bit less efficient. So why is this the case? And there has been some really nice papers on SGX and they show that this APIC timer has quite some jitter. So it's not cycle accurate. So it kind of makes sense that we see this behavior here. So what do we do about this? And the kind of obvious idea is, okay, we kind of need to make this window larger because our timer doesn't have the high enough resolution. So we kind of need to enlarge the window at which our timer can hit. And for this, we look at what's actually going on when we execute an instruction here. So first we have to fetch the instruction from memory from the code page and then the CPU can decode it, issue it to the pipeline and eventually retire it. So for the attack, the idea here is now that we make sure that this year takes a long time and we achieve this by simply flushing the page from the memory. So we flush the VMs TLB and that's when we enter it again. We need to do a page that we walk, which will take some time and this effectively prolongs this window here. That is required to execute the first instruction. And now although our timer still has this jitter, this window is large enough so that we can actually rely on the single step. And the ACV step at the time of publishing was the first frame that did this shortly afterwards. There were also some papers that did something similar and it's also open source. So we hope that other people will reuse it. Okay, so now let's take a little bit closer look at the ACV step framework itself. So besides reliably single stepping, we wanted to achieve two other goals. And this is reusability and interactivity for the attacks. And I will go over these two goals now in more detail. So for reusability, let's again look at our setup here. And since we want to program this APIC timer, we want to manipulate these page tables and maybe do some cache priming and probing. All of these things would benefit from being really close to entering and leaving DVM because this is the point. We have the lowest noise. However, this also means that we need to manipulate or change the kernel code and developing kernel code. It's quite hard. It's hard to debug. You're limited to see. You don't have any external libraries. So it's not the nicest programming environment. And also it makes reusing this for different attacks or for different papers quite hard because this environment is not so nice. And your tech logic is basically mixed together with these attack primitives. So instead what you want to do here is we only want to implement these bare primitives inside the kernel, like programming the timer, manipulating these page tables and cache priming and probing. And all of the other stuff is then moved out to user space. And we use an IOCTL API then to trigger this behavior from user space. So then here we have this much nicer programming environment. And other people can simply link against this library and write their attack code with it. And one tiny note is that this execution loop of DVM is asynchronous from our IOCTL API. So it changes only take effect the next time DVM exits. So we have some data variables here for communication, but this is something you kind of need in mind when you program these attacks. Okay, so we achieved this goal of usability. Let's move on to the second goal for interactivity. And to understand this a little bit better, I will go into more detail of how I envision this programming environment here in the user space library. And there we also basically want to have some kind of event loop. Initially we set up some configuration like I want to get a page forward once this page is accessed. And then we want basically to wait until this event happens. And when this event happens, we want to react to this event. We have usually in these attacks some kind of page forward sequence that would tell us when the VM is about to execute some certain function. And then maybe at this point we want to enable single stepping and do some steps to a cache attack, this kind of stuff. So this is basically the process event and the deved config part here. And the really important thing is that once we got this event, we also want the VM here to basically wait for us to process this event because we would allow it to resume. Then we would again lose this precise control you wanted to have to manipulate the environment after every instruction. So we now also need a way to basically communicate from the kernel side to a user space library to be able to send these events and wait for these acknowledgments. And for this we opted for a shared memory protocol. So the library and the kernel code here simply agree on a shared memory page and then use a simple protocol with some spin locks to basically implement this. Why is this not the most efficient? It is very low latency because it's just memory communication. You don't have any user space, kernel space context switch as with the IOCTL here and also reasonably to implement. Okay, and this is how we achieve this interactivity goal. This is basically the current state of the framework. But to close up, I also want to give an overview of ongoing and future work. So one thing I've been working on a little bit already and I would really like to continue on is to improve this API, this programming environment because right now it's kind of basically have these start, track, stop, track commands. And if you start to write your attack code as I've experienced myself, this can get quite messy and quite long really quick. So it would be cool to have some higher level abstractions for this. For example, a component that could track a certain page for a sequence for you and restart the tracking if you get some unexpected access and so on. And then some kind of mechanism or protocol to chain together these components so that you can structure your attack better. Also make it easier for people to get started by reusing these building blocks. And thinking about this even more, this is totally independent of the actuality underneath. So this is maybe something where the existing S3X step community could come together and could build these libraries at a higher level and then S3X step and SIV step. And I think the trust zone one is called load step could basically be initiated as drivers underneath that so that everyone could profit from this. Okay. And this is more or less it. You can again find the links for SIV step and also for SGX step, which I mentioned here. They are both open source and on GitHub. Feel free to check them out. Send me a pre request if you want to change something, create an issue that's something broken. And yeah, thank you so much. And I'm happy to answer questions now. Yeah. Yeah, thank you for the very interesting talk. A new Satchel attack for me. And now you've showed how to break things. Do you have some ideas how this kind of attack could be mitigated possibly? Yeah, so it's a really good question. So for S3X, there recently has been a paper which was does is called a X notify. And then basically the idea is to make the S3X and play interrupt aware and then execute some special handler that will pre fetch this first instruction that I showed so that you can't do this. I flushed the TAB and make everything really slow approach, but ensure that this the first instruction always executes really fast and this then mitigates this attack. And for TDX, which we just talked about, there's also some mitigation built into the TX module. And for SEV, we are currently looking into ideas how we could protect SEV VMs against this. Thank you. Thank you, Luca. Yes, we're back. So can you elaborate a bit on how much of this is SEV specific and how much of it is actually, let's say KVM step? Let's say if you don't have a mitigation in TDX, can you just launch this as is on any kind of VM or is this specific to SEV in any in any way? Thank you. So I don't think it's really specific to SEV because this ability to flush the TAB that should also be available with VMX with the hardware acceleration for Intel. I think that the basic primitive should apply. I also know that there has been like an internal prototype that's what's called TDX step that's on one of the Intel pages. So they basically build something similar for this. So I guess in principle, this should apply to all like VM based systems where the VM can be forced to exit by external interrupts. There's one more question. Can you repeat it if you have all the plans for TDX? It's definitely really interesting. The question was if you have also plans for TDX and as I've said, TDX is a bit in countermeasure, but I guess it would be of course interesting to try to figure out how this works exactly.
