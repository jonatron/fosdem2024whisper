{"text": " Yeah, this is better. So yeah, I'll talk about history, how we made some decisions we made, some things regarding lambda and the project, and basically this was kind of a point where we started to do most of the stuff on our own. Then I will go over the patterns that were kind of influenced for the libraries, so the security and even sourcing, I'll briefly show how the whole thing works in architecture, diagrams, and then I will say why we actually decided to open source it. So the project started in 2019, everyone wanted to do several lists, it was kind of a fancy thing to do at the time, and also we wanted everything to be managed by Amazon and we didn't want to monitor containers or run stuff around, we just want to give our code to the Amazon and run it, and that was kind of perfect to do this. We also had to keep the business logic vendor independent, so this is kind of a regulatory requirement, so we kind of speak that our business logic is the most valuable thing and then we isolated it from the infrastructure, and so the infrastructure part we can always rewrite, but the business logic we want to reuse. You want a simple API, so I had all these query pads, headers, discussions, we always had about API, so I wanted to drop this thing out, and we wanted to keep data so we can transfer it, I know rewrite library and move it to another language and use the same data and so on, so like binary stored messages in Kafka queues were not an option for us. With Lambda basically the big problem is the startup, so we wanted to use closure because we had lots of data stuff to take care of, so the biggest problem was of course the startup, so the ground we had at that time was pretty new and basically most of the stuff didn't compile. We tried AWS SDK, this was a mess inside, they bring half of the main repository back to it when you use it. Also we had like Hockey Recipient, we had to fork it as well because there was some stuff there that they were using that didn't compile as well, even Logback didn't compile for like one year ago with this as well, so then we started to build something on our own to make it simple, so we created our own AWS SDK because everything they do in all this magical SDK is kind of a post request to the AWS, so it was kind of super easy in the end to do. So the first pattern we chose to use was TECORES, just command and query segregation pattern, so the idea is that you have place where you send commands, where you mutate data and you have a place where you query stuff and this kind of influence our implementation, so we had on HTTP site we just had two endpoints, commands and queries, you send in the body everything you want to do in the system, which also make you can take the same body, you can send it to the queue, you can send it and batch of the command in S3 buckets, so this was kind of great because we could just store the commands from the post request, put them in the queue or store them in S3 bucket as a list of commands so it was super practical. The query site is also very simple, so just the query endpoint which made the front end client, we implemented our own front end client for this, it was 300 lines of code together with it mocking, with retries, with deduplication, with everything, so basically just simply having this simplicity on the HTTP site made it possible. Together with Tech QRS, now it comes the event sourcing, so the idea of event sourcing is just we will not store the current state of the system, we will store events that happen, so it is a pattern from 2000, 1970, basically but then they didn't have enough resources to do it, so they decided to event like a relational database model where you just store the current state, so the event source will be, for example, if you take a shopping cart as an example, you would instead of storing the current shopping cart, you would store item edit, item removed, item edit and then when the client asks what is my shopping cart, you would go over the events and figure out what is the current state of the shopping cart but the nice advantage of this is that everything is stored, so basically for us it's very important, the audit logs, basically the event sourcing, they are naturally there, everything is stored, the database itself is inutable, so we are just appending stuff forward, so it's quite easy to handle from the security perspective, information perspective and so on, so for our implementation we have chosen to take postgres, we just store our events as a JSONB field with some metadata around, so it was super simple, we have the transactions because it's just append only, it scales very well, so we have around one terabyte of data and we just add, we don't even think about adding new stuff there, we use optimistic locking, so on the client side we just add sequence to every event and basically unique field on the postgres gives us optimistic locking, so it was super easy to do, so yeah, this is a simple diagram, so from the client perspective how things look like, so we have a command coming into the system and there we touch our service, we just edit the core implementation, edit the core does four things, so takes a snapshot from the view store, then does the processing, whatever needs to be done, stores the response in event store and basically sends to the router all the events effects that were created, so events are, as I said, something that will store the changes and the effects are the things that need to be distributed to the other services, so if you want to call service B or never call it directly, I will store it in the database, the things I want to send to the other service and then they will be distributed to the router. The router then sends also back to the service that needs to update this aggregate and then aggregate this update to the view store and then we go to the next cycle and query is just a simple query, goes to the view store, returns back data to the client. And one more diagram which is also important is how internally the core works, so basically does a couple of things, in the beginning we validate the request, the important thing is what we do, we check if there was already this request process, so we have a command response log where we check if the request was processed, if not then we go, we log this request in the request log, so all the entry commands that come to the system are stored there, so if we need to debug something later on, everything is collected there, so and since everything is a body, it's super easy to store, whether it comes from Q, post request, whatever, then is this processing request, where is the business logic part and then we start the transaction, so we can start the transaction at the very end of the request, which is quite nice from a performance perspective, we store events, store effects, so it commands to the other services and then we just mark this request as completed so that we have a deduplication afterwards. Well, basically that's it, so we started developing this internally, it was only meant as an internal library, there was no open sourcing processing component also, basically this was kind of an idea to start this process as well, there was no alternative limitation because it has a fixed infrastructure there, so we kind of used this as an opportunity to kind of expand library as well, so we mostly started using it as hobby projects, so for the side projects, so edit the DynamoDB support for example for the store as well, for the event store, and this helped to clean up the project, so we did a big round of cleanup of the project with the proper abstractions basically, then we started adding different implementations and then we were contributing the changes back to the internal, so we chose to have the internal project, so we fixed huge amount of bugs outside that help also to get them back internally for the internal implementation and so on, so we set up the open sourcing process, so basically any team in the whole company can open source what they want if you just follow these steps. Yeah, so we had very positive experience with this library, so we are now like almost one year in production, we store everything, this was this space off on daily basis, so we even had a business site messing up thousands of hundred to thousand records, we could recover them quite easily just creating data from database, everything is stored there, audit was super happy because we stored everything, I even ticked off a lot of the audits just because we said we store everything, so they were super happy, and yeah, so the most of stuff like if we had a production bug that basically clogged up the queues, we could clean up the queues and five minutes later we could just select what happened and recover it back in the queue, so we didn't have to worry about finding what was there in that letter queue, what is useful, what is not useful, so and because of the duplication we didn't have to worry about sending against some messages, so we do this almost every week we have one disaster we need to recover and it's super easy for us to do that. Yeah, that's it from my side, questions? Excellent, next we can set up. So tell us a bit more about accepting open source in your company, you can come up. So this was actually six months process, so. So, yes, so the question was the experience with setting up the open sourcing process in the company, so this was actually a very painful experience, so it took six months negotiation with security, actually first to understand what we want to do, then extend it, why you want to do, then talk to management, tell them why this is beneficial, but afterwards yeah, once we figured out that all the rules that we need to follow, then it was it was quite straightforward, so we documented everything and hope that it was six months process to get it, get it there. So, my question is why the architecture decided to use lambdas of the first, why decided to use lambdas? So, one side was because we had a burst, so we like, ah, sorry, the question is why we decided to use lambda functions, so basically in the beginning we had a burst of data, so for example in the morning we would get a bunch of data we need to process and the rest of the system would process like three requests per hour, so and this was kind of a nice thing because it scales quite fast and the other motivation was because it forces kind of doing it fluff clean, there's no caching, you have to really think about what to do, so it kind of wants to push the developers to go in direction of actually making stuff clean and that they don't depend on something being stored somewhere in memory and yeah, the third thing was it was a cool thing to do, so it was kind of a nice presentation, marketing material for the project as well. So, I mentioned you use optimistic locking, why did you decide to use it? Was it because of the lambda bear or was it? So, the question is why we do the optimistic locking, so we use actually postgres in the beginning, but we used optimistic locking because we didn't want to even start the transaction because until we are done, so because we kind of declare all the dependencies we have, we fetch them, we process the data and then we have everything we need to store the mutated database we have it at the end, so at this point then we open the transaction and then we can do something, so that means we fetch the aggregate, for example aggregate version 72, we process everything, we say okay now we'll be version 73 and if there's some version 73 in the bit in happening then we would have a postgres nicely saying there's a concurrency problem, so we didn't want to lock anything database, we just want to make it simple, so this was super easy to implement. I have a comment on that which is our database uses optimistic concurrency control and it actually gives much better scaling up the traditional locking methods and it's much more robust and it's more secure, so we can have a separate discussion about this later. Yes, let's have this, we'll be an interesting discussion.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 8.44, "text": " Yeah, this is better.", "tokens": [50364, 865, 11, 341, 307, 1101,
