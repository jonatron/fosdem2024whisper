We will have six talks today. And so, basically, I'm sitting there. If you need something, if you have some questions, I can help with that. We will start today with Cecilia. Talk about some translations. And during this morning, we have one talk after the other. And we have some time between one talk and another, with five minutes to change the speaker here. So, that's it. I have contributed to Debian with translation. I helped Debian to translate from English to Portuguese because I'm from Brazil, as I said. So, this is a nice idea. I have a translation's Room as we can talk about this topic here. Welcome, everybody. And let's start with Cecilia.
