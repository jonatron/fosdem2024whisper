{"text": " Hello everyone. So I will talk a little bit about Image Builder. I want to talk a little bit about how it works, how the stack of Image Builder fits together, show off some of the things it can do. But before all that, I'll try to explain why it exists. So Image Builder builds bootable operating system images, the base images. It runs on your local machine or as a hosted service. So we also run and operate a service for Image Builder. Now building bootable operating system images is not that hard of a problem. You just put a few bits in the right place, some default correct, hopefully configurations. And most of the hard work is done by the package maintainers, the people who maintain a kernel, the people who maintain system data. They make sure it all fits together. But at a certain scale, consistency and reliability are very important. Because you need to build images for different purposes. I'm talking now from the point of view of a distribution. You need to build images for different purposes, for different architectures, for different target environments like AWS, GCP, Azure, local virtualization, bare metal. And you don't want to have these differ too much from one another. These images. You don't want to have them differ too much from one another between those different variables. You want to reason about them and produce them in roughly the same manner. You want to produce and reproduce them often without manual interference. So as part of pipeline. So you need infrastructure around it as well. And because I also mentioned like target environments, specifically the cloud platforms, well, every cloud platform today often offers something like an image builder as well. I guess AWS EC2 image builder. But yeah, then you're sort of like locked into what the cloud provider provides. Or you just end up using their images maybe full stop. So it's nice to have tooling that is sort of cloud agnostic. Or like specific cloud agnostic, vendor agnostic. And as a final point, while image based workloads are also becoming the norm. You know, everybody uses containers. People build images for a single specific workload. And really one of the things for end users that we're trying to solve is to make VM images almost as easy to deal with as container images. So image builder was created to address some of these problems. Right? So this is the stack. And I want to walk you through the stack just to quickly give an idea of what each component does and why it's there. I will start at OS build. The lowest base layer on which everything is based. So at the very bottom, we have OS build, which is a low level tool that executes a manifest. Now what is a manifest? The manifest describes exactly what goes into the image and then also how to package it. This manifest makes images audible because you have a manifest of exactly what's in it and reproducible. Since you have the exact steps that were used to build the image described inside of it as well. So not just the contents, but also like how do I get from those contents to the actual image? It is mostly distribution agnostic. So it doesn't necessarily have a notion of like what makes up a specific distribution. So what is a Fedora? 38 image, right? Doesn't really know. But of course it needs to support some package manner. So it currently supports RPM and Pacman packages. So theoretically, the distributions that it can build are things like Fedora, Arch, CentOS, et cetera. And as a final note, OS build starts from a pristine tree, so like an empty directory, and then builds it up piece by piece. But to clarify this, let's take a little look at a manifest. So I'm going to need to... That's maybe too much. So as you can see, this is sort of what a manifest looks like. First off, you have sources because the content needs to come from somewhere. So this is maybe a little bit. Okay, so these are just RPM packages indexed by their checksum, so that they're nice and addressable. Now here you can see three pipelines. I will not go through all of them, it's just like very quickly tell you what's inside of this manifest. So the first pipeline actually builds a container because we built the end artifact, so the end image inside of a container. And the reason that happens is because you kind of want the same tooling that will end up in the image building the image itself. So like the RPM version in the image, you kind of want to install those RPMs using the same version because otherwise you might get into a mess. So then the second pipeline is the second pipeline that actually puts all the bits in the correct place in the tree. So first it sets up the kernel, like I think it's proc kernel command line, then an RPM stage, so it installs a bunch of RPMs, then it sets up the locale, hostname, things like this. It relabels the tree, so as soon as it's happy. And then in the final pipeline, it actually goes ahead and packages the image up. So in this case, it just ends up being a raw disk file, right? So the most basic disk file and also like it sets up the file systems and stuff like this. So I guess just a takeaway is pipelines stages very precise way of describing what exactly should go into that end artifact. So now I need to like, yeah, go back a bit. Okay, that looks better. So, but like I said OS build doesn't actually know what makes up a specific distribution. So we have the image definitions. The image definitions contain all the information needed to describe an image of a specific distribution of a specific architecture for a specific target environments. So it describes things like the base package sets, the default configurations, how exactly architectures differ, you know, like install these packages if it's arch, install these packages if it's x86. And like all the differences between those different, you know, that whole matrix of like architectures, target platforms, that's contained within the image definitions. It integrates tightly with Composer. So if I don't know if you remember the stack from earlier, now we're at the gray layer. So we had OS build images and then Composer. And Composer is really the part that brings it all together. It takes user input in a format that I'll get into shortly. It takes package repositories, just as a source for the packages, like, you know, the kernel needs to come from somewhere. And the aforementioned image definitions to generate the manifest, which is then provided to OS build. Right, so Composer takes all of the input from the necessary places, generates a manifest, and then OS build executes that manifest. Because like I, like you probably saw, there's a manifest, they're okay to read, but if you had to write those by hand, that would not end up very well. It's a tiresome job. And as a final point as well, it also orchestrates all the builds. It manages the job queue and workers, which you know, like you can queue image builds and then, because image builds takes a long time often. So, and that's just an important point to be able to run this like in a host, as a host service, as part of infrastructure, etc. So okay, what does, what does Composer need? And as you can see, it's already a lot simpler than the manifest that we had before, right? So say that I want to build a Fedora 39 image. Okay, so I just asked for a Fedora 39 image. I want it to be x86, QCOW. I provide it with some repositories, which are just the default Fedora 39 repositories. Optionally, some customizations, right? So like in this case, I also want to install cockpit. I want like the base system with cockpit installed. And that's it. That's all Composer needs. It will take it, grab the image definitions, figure out what the manifest looks like, and then pass it to us. Okay, so how to make this even easier and like how do we actually like give this to, to end users? I will walk through like two tools that we have. And then I will show off the hosted service that we have running. I just realized I didn't spin up a VM, which I need to spin up. Okay, so Composer CLI. So Composer CLI takes this format called a blueprint. Now a blueprint kind of describes, again, like how to customize the image. As you can see, there's nothing anymore of like which architecture you want, which distribution you want. This is intended as like the on premise tool, and it's all inferred from the host. So like if you're running on a Fedora 38 system, it will build Fedora 38. If it's an ARM system, it will build ARM, etc. All that's left is customizations. And as you can see, it can be quite powerful, right? So like here, what happens is, I source this from a colleague of mine. But as you can see, it puts in place a system, the a little system, the service, then it asks ImageBill to also enable that system, the service, and that system, the service sets up a second disk on boot, right? And also it embeds a user. So yeah, what's left here is just really just the customizations. And this is how you would then like push that blueprint. The workflow is a bit cumbersome, but like you push the blueprint, you start the blueprint, you ask for the image type, which in that case is a Q-Cow. So important point, you use that same blueprint to build a Q-Cow, build an installer, build a cloud image, so that you get, you know, you really just have to specify what you want is common. And like ImageBill would say, care of the rest. And there's also like a little cockpit application. So can I, oh I need to, if it went to, ah there we go. So this is a cockpit application which allows you to define blueprints, build images. It's again targeted for on-premise use, as you can see, I probably should have removed this question. But yeah, so like it allows you to define those blueprints I showed earlier and build images from them. I think if you click, right click here, and you can see like some of the, okay, like the blueprint, like an output type, so there's a bunch of output types that we support. Yeah, voila. So now, okay, so actually the point why I actually mainly did this talk was, which is, so we also run as a Fedora, as a, as a hosted service, and for a specific hat company we've been running a service for a while now, but we are also figuring out like, okay, how do you actually run services, like software as a service for the community, right? Like how do you involve from our community? We want community users, we want community feedback, they often use software in like different or interesting ways. So yeah, that's what we wanted to offer support for that. So if you go to console.stagels.fodora infocloud.org, so it's currently just a staging service, but production is coming soon. It will, it will tell you like, okay, this is how you like, if you make an account there, then you can use the API in that way, etc. Currently it's just an API, but UI is also on the road now. So what's currently supported in that staging service, staging service, it's KVM, BeastFair, AWS, and like, on the right hand side, there's all images that we currently build, but we just need to set up some service, some stuff in the service and enable them and expose them. Also just 8x86 for now, but Arch is relatively easy to add, and in a production service, we'll definitely have Arch as well. So what does a request to this hosted service look like? And at the very start, right before the talk started, I actually sent off this exact same request to the image building service. So this is what a complex request, more complex request looks like. So there's the distribution I'm asking for Fedora38, X86, it's a QCOW2, don't mind the name, it's a bit weird, but QCOW2, please upload it for me to AWS S3 so I can download it afterwards. We host, like, we share images with a pre-signed URL, which are like valid for a couple of hours. So, and then it comes, like, then we get to the interesting bits, like, so can this hosted service, for which you don't need to, like, have any setup on your local machine. Also, integrate with other Fedora services that are currently available. So perhaps some of you know, copper, you know, like, very easy to build your own RPMs, you just upload your spec files and sources and it will go ahead and build your, do everything for you, like, the difficult bits for you, so, and host your RPMs even. So here I'm asking, like, okay, can you also in FCE, YAM repose, whatever, like, make this repository available so that I can install stuff from it. So that's this customization. Then install these packages, right, like, I want copper, I want firewall D, because, I don't know, and then NPM as well. Why? Because I have this awful startup script, which installs revealMD, which is, like, the thing that's running these slides now, installs demo slides, which come from this demo copper up there. Change is to root, runs revealMD, yeah, just it runs, it's a VM that runs slides, yeah. And then the second thing is, like, okay, set up a service for me, which, you know, it's a one-shot type of service, it runs that startup script that's defined above, and, yeah, run it after the network comes online, because I want it, it's a server, it's a service that also starts the server, right, so, and then I want to enable the cockpit service, I want to enable the revealMD service, so that's the little service that I defined above, and then, yeah, for firewall customizations, I want to open this specific port, because that's what revealMD listens on, and I want to enable the cockpit service as well, right, so, like, when the machine boots up, cockpits enabled, and these slides will hopefully be hosted now. Right, so let's go back to the terminal there, so, as you can see, so that's the same request, and I sent it off earlier, and it was building, so let's see what happens now. I hope it didn't fail, because that would, okay, no, so like, the build succeeded, right, as you can see, this monster of assigned URL, which is technically a secret, it's valid for six hours, so, yeah, you can just download it, and, yeah, I mean, that's it, it's really that easy, if there's like a whole bunch more customizations available than the ones listed here, but once you've read the spec a bit, you figure out how to write a JSON file, it's there, and then you can get a whole bunch of images out of it for free, so, let's run that image, right, so like, this is how I'm running that image, you can't see that, so, this is how I'm running that image, okay, so I'll just go ahead and do that off-screen, how am I for time, yeah, good, okay, so I've now booted it up, okay, so I asked it to install cockpit, and, okay, yeah, of course, yeah, just sort of, just sort of, okay, so let's just take a look at the networking, I asked it to like enable the cockpit service, and also, explore this additional port, it has done that, super, then I go to services, so these are all my, my system, these services, I look at revealMD, okay, so that's, that's still starting, and it might take a while because it's actually installing an npm package over my phone, so, hopefully that will do something in the meantime, I think in the meantime we can also maybe start with a question, if already somebody has one, but I want to show like a little thing at the end still, so, but for that I need this to, this to kick off, it's really the most exciting talk ever, isn't it, we all started staring at like, at some logs, so, thanks for the talk, I have two questions, so the first thing is to understand the architecture, the composer thing, it's like a demon or service, right, that's it, yeah, so the composer is the thing that runs as a hosted service and orchestrates everything basically, okay, so I understood that correctly, the second thing is that very expected question, it's not really creative, so how hard would it be to, to, to support like, let's say Ubuntu or, maybe I know, let's say something like that, that's very expected question, thank you, so I've actually experimented with this a little bit already, so like first we would need to add support in OS build, right, and then you would need to add an image, so just to install dev packages and like set up like, what's the thing, the bootstrap, you know, and then you would need to add an image definition, okay, but what is an Ubuntu image, and then you would need to add it to composer to expose it a little bit, okay, but first you'd need to, yeah, write some stages that can handle dev packages, and, and I've been, I've experimented with it before, I've got it to the point where I, we can build a bootable Debian image, right, not UEFI, so, but like, you know, we've got it to that point, it just, it requires some more work in cycles, like theoretically it's, it's, it's, it can do it, right, like it's, it's just a matter of some work, yeah, I'll answer your question, oh yeah, and in the meantime, let's, like, look, it seems to have done something, so, all right, great, yeah, slides are up, so let's go to that, oh yeah, so this is the most efficient way to, to host, I think, you know, image-based workloads, single slides, this is where you can find us, so like, yeah, this is our GitHub project, we have a matrix channel, please can say hi, and then we have a website, and so if you go to service, um, so service and then for door, you can read a bit more about how the architecture fits together, and yeah, if you go to the Fedora service, you can find instructions on how to do it if you want, please do, there's currently only two workers attached to the staging service, so if, if it, if it's not DDoS by like two hours from now, I'm going to be disappointed. Thank you. All right, any more questions? So, um, I'm a bit hazy on the architecture, so maybe the question, it doesn't make much sense, but how much work would be, um, you know, how feasible is to do all this locally, like, for example, for, I want to build a distro, then tweak something, then build another image and run it locally in a tight loop, so that it's like the whole process that you described, starting from the definition with the local overrides all the way to the image that you have downloaded and built locally, can you all do it on a laptop on the plane? Yeah, yeah, so like this, um, so the first, uh, let me go back a little bit, so we have a copy composer, now it doesn't, um, so this is essentially the same thing, right? Like you, you can just, or maybe I'm not answering your question, but this is essentially like, uh, you can do it all on, on your own laptop. Of course, your own laptop can do cross architecture builds, um, currently, uh, but, yeah, is that? So basically I would run the service locally and then talk to a web server on my, it's a unique socket in this case. You can also set up the, the service of, um, locally, but it's, it's not necessarily supported very well, uh, but it's all there. It's, it's all, when you install copy composer or, sorry, when you install, um, OSBIL composer on your fedora machine or whatever, it's all, it's all shit. Thank you. Yeah. Hi. Uh, yeah, probably an annoying question, but so, uh, under the soon, there was like, uh, ISO installers. Can you be, can you be a bit more specific about what soon means in this, uh, in this context? Because that would solve like a use case that I have. So, like really creating a bootable USB drive that a, a technician can plug in and, yeah. So, so, uh, yeah, you're right. So like the ISOs here, sort of installer and live installer are, are absolutely like, in tennis or bare metal. So those are like that you would burn onto an USB or DPD or a CD and, uh, yeah, plug in and, and, uh, they have like the, the fedora, like the anaconda install around them. Um, yeah. And is there like a specific fedora release that's being targeted or? Oh, it's been, this has all been fedora in, um, since fedora 34, 34. Okay. So it's, it's been there for a while. Okay. But we're still like, we're still actively working on it and making it better, like more customizations like that files customization where you can like just basically have like an entry point as like a, you know, just like a one shot system v service. Um, that was, it's more like a recent thing that we were trying to do. And yeah, there's more customizations that I think you can set up your file system a little bit like partitions and stuff like this. Okay. Then I'm missing the suit. Thank you. Yeah. But try it. Yeah. I think we have time for one more. So maybe I misunderstood something, but the whole part of the demo, everything was done locally, right? That you showed us on your local laptop, which part was on the cloud? I thought everything was local host. Everything was local host, except when I switched to here, like in the terminal, what, so right at the start of the talk, I sent a request, um, to wait, hang on. Oh yeah. Here up top here, I sent a request to the fedora. This is this fedora staging service that we're running now. And that is building an image and then that's spit out a URL. Now, of course, I didn't download this one. I built the same thing earlier and downloaded it then to run it now because it's like 700 megs and the internet is not that good. So, um, but like, let me just show, uh, so like, this is like, uh, yeah, the slash composes endpoints shows you all of the composes that I've done. Um, and it's basically all the same thing for this talk. So, um, I think I might have downloaded this one like one before or yeah, I mean, so, so this, this one, like the actual image that the VM that I put it up was not built on this laptop that was built on this on the cloud. Yeah. That I can also, if I have a powerful machine, I could also do it locally, right? Um, so do you mean like, uh, if you want to build the image locally? Yeah. Yeah, you can do that. So that's, that's, um, that's done with, uh, with cockpit composer, I think is the easiest way to get started. Yeah. So that's, that would be a cockpit, cockpit app is I think they're called. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. You're welcome. I think we're done with time. Thank you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 12.92, "text": " Hello everyone.
