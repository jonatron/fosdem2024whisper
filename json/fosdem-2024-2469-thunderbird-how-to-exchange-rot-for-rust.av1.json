{"text": " So, if I could have your attention. When we got this talk, I didn't know Rust and Thunderbird had a connection, so this is pretty exciting and pretty cool. So we have Sean and Brendan are going to talk about how to exchange ROT for Rust. Thank you very much. Hi. I'm Sean Burke. I am a senior software engineer at MZLA, which is the company that maintains Thunderbird. And this is my colleague, Brendan Abolivier, who is a software engineer at MZLA as well. So we're here to talk about how to exchange ROT for Rust. So our colleague, Ike Dordi, couldn't join us. But I feel I need to shout him out because we would not be giving this presentation without him. And I also have to applaud his pun in the title because the project that forms the basis for this talk is Microsoft Exchange Support in Thunderbird. So we're working on adding support for the Exchange Web Services Protocol. This is the first Rust component written specifically for Thunderbird. We, our code is based on Firefox and so there's Rust there. But nothing specific for Thunderbird. And it's also the first mail protocol to be added to Thunderbird in Thunderbird's lifetime, which is a slightly strange statement. But I will explain that a little bit here. When we started this project, nobody actually knew how to add a new protocol to Thunderbird. And that gets into the ROT part of the title a little bit. So first off, a little bit of history of Thunderbird. Thunderbird grew out of Netscape Communicator originally, as did Firefox. So a lot of the code in Thunderbird predates Thunderbird itself. And the 0.1 release was July 2003. So this is a fairly old code base already. In starting around 2012, Mozilla started to hand over Thunderbird to the community because it felt that Thunderbird wasn't self-sustaining under the Mozilla umbrella. That situation persisted until around 2017 when Thunderbird rejoined the Mozilla Foundation. And so what does that actually mean for Thunderbird? We had a pretty big gap in paid maintainership, which results in, you know, a community can only do so much. Thunderbird is a very large project. There's a lot of work to do. Just keeping up with building, making sure that it's following Firefox's changes since we're based on Firefox. And that gap meant there was a lot of time where you can't expect a community to have a holistic view of the architecture of a huge project like Thunderbird. You can only ask so much time from them. And so changes were made without a view to how this would affect the architecture, how the architecture played into things. There was also a loss of institutional knowledge because the people who'd been employed to work on Thunderbird were no longer, and there was nobody there to take over for them. In a lot of places in Thunderbird, there hasn't really been any kind of architectural maintenance in over 20 years. And that also means that, you know, large portions of the code base are written in C++. C++ has changed quite a bit over the years, and Thunderbird has not kept up. So this is a pretty significant challenge, but also presents us with a pretty significant opportunity. That opportunity is Rust. So we'll talk a little bit about why we decided to use Rust. This is a room full of people interested in Rust. I'm sure most of you are pretty aware of the major benefits. We're a large application maintained by a small team, and we take input from anybody who sends somebody an email, and so memory safety is pretty critical. We do not want security bugs letting anybody have access to somebody's computer. Performance is also pretty big. We use a lot of JavaScript in our code, but for low-level stuff, JavaScript is going to have some performance issues. And then, you know, the modularity of Rust, having that built-in gives us access to a pretty large ecosystem. There are a lot of people doing mail-related stuff in Rust, and we can benefit from that. The other, the next reason is that, I mean, we are based on Firefox code, and Firefox already has Rust in it. So the build system is set up to integrate with cargo. We share CI infrastructure, and so that already has provision for Rust. And then, also, Firefox has something called XPcom, which is kind of a framework for communicating between the different languages that Firefox uses, and there's Rust support in that already. And then, Rust also kind of introducing a new language gives us permission to rethink some of the aging ideas in Thunderbird. It allows us to kind of ignore some of the more delicate code paths that have been around and changed ad hoc special case throughout the code where changing things is a little bit scary. You don't know what you're going to break. And also, I mentioned the loss of institutional knowledge. We need to rebuild that, which means a lot of documentation, and personally, I love the documentation tooling that Rust provides us. And I think that helps a lot in moving forward. But as with any project like this, it's not just, okay, we're going to use Rust. Cool, we're done. We're good to go. We had some problems getting started. Part of that is just we have a large existing code base, which means we have existing patterns. A lot of idiosyncratic async stuff going on that doesn't integrate nicely with idiomatic Rust. Lots of features and capabilities already in the Firefox and Thunderbird code base, which don't have any sort of Rust binding, or sometimes some kind of painful Rust bindings. I mentioned XP-COM as a benefit, but it also became a little bit of a drawback, particularly in terms of developer experience. Over the years, Firefox has excised a lot of the XP-COM interfaces just because it can be a little bulky, a little bit painful to use them sometimes, even in C++ and JavaScript. That work never happened in Thunderbird. We have a lot more uses and huge uses of XP-COM than Firefox. And so what works well for them in terms of developer experience doesn't work for us. It's really painful for us to use XP-COM at this point. I also mentioned the build system as a positive, but in a big way that became a drawback for us because in order to deal with the fact that Firefox has a C++ entry point, no single point of entry for Rust, there's a hack put in place to build a single workspace and shove that into the Firefox code. That hack, we're built as a subtree of Firefox rather than having Firefox as a subtree of our code, which is a little bit unusual. Cargo doesn't like it when you try to have a workspace inside of a workspace. We're not in the same repository as Firefox, and so we can't change their cargo lock, we can't change their dependencies. We kind of solved this by basically stealing all of their dependency tree and merging it with our own, building from within our code and using a script to keep that up to date and hope things don't break so far, so good. With that, I'm going to pass it off to Brendan because... Now we can use Rust in Thunderbird, we can build Rust in Thunderbird, we can run some Rust code in Thunderbird thanks to that work to integrate it into the build system. What do we do with it now? It is good to answer that question, it's good to think back to where we're coming from, what we're trying to achieve with that, and our end goal with this work is to be able to support Microsoft Exchange in Thunderbirds. We want to support more specifically something called EWS, which stands for Exchange Web Services, that's Microsoft's proprietary protocol for interacting with Exchange. That protocol is based on XML or HTTP, so it's up to be more precise. That means that we're missing a few key code infrastructure in order to make this a possibility. First, we want to be able to send HTTP traffic and preferably we want to send it through something called NECO, NECO is the networking component of Thunderbirds and we already have a well-functioning networking stack, it would be a bit sad to completely bypass it. We want to be able to communicate, to interact with NECO and to do it in a way that is familiar and easy to use for Rust developers. Once we have the capability to send those requests, we also want to be able to fill them with the contents that we need in this case XML. We need to figure out how to serialize and dis-realize XML in a way that scales to a lot of data structures to give an example of scale. EWS specifies about 100 different operations and about 1700 different data structures. We're not at the bottom of the stack which is sending HTTP requests. Because we want to interact with a specific component within Thunderbirds, we want to use XP-com, which I mentioned, the acronym stands for the cross-platform component object and its job is basically to allow inter-component interaction by defining some platform neutral interfaces and that way we can cross the language boundary, which is good for us because we want to write Rust code to interact with NECO, which is in C++. Let's use that except sending, except using XP-com with Rust directly doesn't look very Rust-like. It's mostly designed around C++ APIs and so it doesn't have a lot of the features that we can find in Rust and it means that there's a lot of boilerplates. This is the code to just send a single GET request and print the results in the standard outputs. We need to define a bunch of callbacks, we need to define a bunch of different objects and because we're crossing a language boundary, we at the very bottom, we need to wrap all that into the actual call into an unsafe block. None of that is very ideal and we obviously don't want anyone who wants to use NECO in Rust to have to do that every single time they want to interact with the network. Let's split this issue into two sub-issues that we're going to solve. The first one is we want to do native, to support native async await, Rust async await syntax. The way we do this is we added a new interlcrate to Thunderbird, which is actually the first Rust code to be added to the Thunderbird code base. The role of that create is to translate asynchronous operations in xp.com into Rust's native async. The way it does that is it defines custom stream listeners, which is that big struct that we saw earlier with a bunch of callbacks. What that stream listener is going to do is it's going to buffer any incoming data, call wake on a wakeer when the request finishes and then we can wrap that around another struct which is in charge of triggering the asynchronous operation in xp.com. Then it implements the future traits to be able to query the state of the buffer every once in a while and to return the result when it finishes. In the future, we're probably going to also implement the stream future traits in order to be able to interactively process incoming data. We don't need it immediately, so we just went with future for now. Now that we have this native async await support, we want to build on top of that to have some way to write some idiomatic Rust code to send HTTP traffic. We do that with yet another internal crate which provides more idiomatic and requests like HTTP clients. It's not a one-on-one, one-to-one replicate of requests, but it request-wise uses the main inspiration for this work. Under the hood, that crate is in charge of creating and configuring all the necessary xp.com objects, wrap that into our future and also provides more rust idiomatic error handling as well because standard xp.com does its error handling with just error status codes which isn't the best we can do with Rust basically. So that's all nice. What does it look like? So let's do a demo. We're going to do a live demo because we don't like to leave safely. So here is some code that lives in on my local checkout of Thunderbirds. It's got a bunch of code infrastructure to plug it into xp.com for the next step of the demo, but the important bit is what we can see here which is that with all clients that are from my HTTP here, we can create, we can actually create a PUS request, set it a custom header, set it some custom body, send it and natively await on it, and then we can process the response or the error depending. We're going to run this code into a local Thunderbird which apparently crashed while I was preparing the demo. Let me just do... So this is the Thunderbird DevTools. You might already look familiar because it's also the same DevTools that Firefox uses. We use it to work on the front end of Thunderbirds and access some internals of Thunderbird when we need to. So we're going to instantiate that xp.com plumbing that I was mentioning. It's basically just a dummy interface that just has a thing to do the thing which in our case is sending an HTTP request. We can see that we successfully sent a request through NECO. It's not because it appeared in the network tab which means that it went through the Thunderbird networking stack. If we inspect the request, we can see that it did include our custom header, it did correctly attach to the right content type, and it also correctly sets the right body to the request. And to confirm that once more, the server... That's just a simple stupid server that I quickly wrote in Python that... Sorry for using Python. Which just takes that custom body and that custom header and just prints something. Right. So that works. Now what do we want to do from here? We have requests that we can send and we can process the response to that request. But what do we actually put in that request? As I mentioned, we want to put some XML into that to be able to communicate with exchange servers. So we started with a kind of exploration, kind of a lay of the land of what the status is with regards to desilizing and serializing XML in Rust. And we quickly identified that most crates that we could find had some existing issues. Either they don't provide a good way for handling attributes and namespaces in XML or N slash all, they're very boilerplatey. It's fine for desilization because we don't necessarily need to process every single attribute from the response we... Or N slash all namespace, namesoces. For serialization, it's not really something we can do because obviously if you omit a required attribute or something like that, the XML server is not going to be able to understand the request. And also we not only want but need to have a low amount of boilerplate in all code because N EWS defines a lot of data structures, a lot of operations. So, yeah, dozens of operations, more than 1,000 data structures. So we don't have any small amount of boilerplate that we have. It's just going to make the codes 10 times more difficult to maintain. So we decided to create a new crate. This time it's not tied to any Thunderbird internal, so it just lives on GitHub. And so we use this... And so in this crate, we basically leverage the procedural macros in Rust to dynamically generate implementations for a trade that we also define at compile time. Almost everyone in this room will just be like, yeah, this is just a derived macro. I'm fairly new to Rust, and so when I saw that, I thought this is pretty cool, so I want to mention it. We don't want to reinvent the wheel. So we built it on top of QuickXML, which provides some pretty nice tools for writing and formatting XML. And we try to design it with a fairly low boilerplate... That low boilerplate approach that we need. So what does this one look like? This is a kind of dummy data structure that I defined, and as you can see, I was thoroughly uninspired for the naming. But this showcases some of the features that we can use in this crate. So we can set namespaces, either default or custom ones. We can set namesets prefixes. We can instruct a field to be an attribute. We can flatten some structures, and then all we need to do is actually populate our data structure, serialize it, and in our case, we just want to print it to see what it looks like. And if I run this, it generates valid XML that matches the data structure we defined here. So that's a lot of useful code infrastructure that we have now for our Microsoft extension implementation. Where do we go from there? Obviously, the next step is we want to implement the damn thing. So implement protocol support for AWS in Rust, and hook that into the Thunderbird UI to expose it to our users. We also want, if there's enough interest, to generalize the XML struct crate, the one in this slide, because at the moment, it's fairly designed around the use case of EWS in terms of configuration and defaults and things like that. So it might be something that, if there's enough interest, it might be something that we will look into in the future. And another point, another point that's another next step is we might also start working with people from the XPCOM team in the Firefox developers to try to improve the situation around bindings for XPCOM in Rust and make them just more, well, nicer to use for Rust developers. So that's where we are. That's where we're going. And thank you for listening. Thank you. So we, I think we have quite some time for questions if you have them. Yeah. Well, as I make my way over there, one question I had. If the protocol support is in Rust, do you think it's possible that it could be more shareable with other email clients? Yeah, this is one of the things that we're trying to keep in mind. One good example is we're currently, you might have heard that a few years ago, we welcomed the K9 email clients on Android into the Thunderbird family. And if we're building a new protocol support for the desktop application, we would like in the future to potentially include that support into K9 slash Thunderbird for Android. So this is definitely something that's one of the, one kind of extra reason that we decided to go with Rust is because of the ease of implementing, of reusing Rust codes across multiple platforms. And yeah. And we are going to make the EWS create public as well. Yeah, I'm going to repeat because I have a mic. We're going to make the EWS create public. And yeah. And also, you see to build it in a way that is fairly agnostic to the actual desktop application.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 10.0, "text": " So, if I could have your
