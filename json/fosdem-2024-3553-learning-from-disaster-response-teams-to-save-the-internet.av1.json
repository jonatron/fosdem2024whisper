{"text": " Hi, everyone. It is great to be here. Thank you for coming to this talk. If you're here for the magic show, I'm afraid you have 30 minutes to wait. I'm here to guide us in an exploration of what we as a community, as open source practitioners, can learn from some of the most finely tuned and highly performant teams in the world. First responders. Through the interdisciplinary lens of social network science. So perhaps there is some magic in this talk. The magic of people working together. My name is Hannah Aubrey. I lead fast forward at Fastly. Let's save the Internet. In a past life, I was lucky to serve as a study coordinator of Sonic. No, not the one with the roller skates and the hamburgers. Dang, I knew that joke wouldn't play in the EU. The science of networks and communities research group. Sonic advances social network theories, methods and tools to better understand and meet the needs of diverse communities. They develop cutting edge techniques to study and improve social and knowledge networks and distributed working groups, online communities, virtual teams, and other large communities like the one we're all in. I am thrilled and a little bit washing to share that with the director of Sonic. Professor Nasheer Contractor is here in the audience today. Thank you for coming, Nash. And my dear friends, if you have any tough questions, please direct them at him. Let's start with a history reminder. Our earliest ancestors not only had to contend with the same natural disasters we experienced today, they also had to adapt and survive to nature itself. First, we became bipedal, freeing our hands to reach and to grasp and also to communicate simply with each other. Next, we developed complex brains with prefrontal cortexes, our personality centers, which enabled us to make snap second decisions based not only on external stimuli, but also our past experiences. Then we developed symbolic language to communicate complex ideas and then finally tools to take control of and shape our surroundings. So you see what makes us uniquely human. Actually, what has brought us here together today, the abilities to ponder, convene, reflect, build, collaborate, and coordinate are not only what make us so special, but also so successful. So then our tools got a lot better. The first fire pump was invented in Alexandria in the third century BCE. Unfortunately, it could not save the library, but I digress. As societies and civilizations began to form, the blast radius of disasters grew. We settled into towns that could burn down and buildings that earthquakes could topple. And so those smart brains of ours formed teams whose sole purpose was to patrol and respond to natural and made manmade disasters in the form of firefighters and police forces. Then societies became more complex. And with that came more complex disasters, not only fire and flood, but we created monetary systems, banks that could collapse and food systems that were prone to mass famine, not always for lack of food, but sometimes for lack of transportation or poor planning. Our close proximity to each other in cities and long distance cultural exchange made possible by ships brought diseases, colonization, and war, which ravaged human populations. We think of these ages as dark or undeveloped, but their responses to such crises were surprisingly neither. In fact, we begin to see thoughtful and multifaceted disaster response, not only search and rescue or medical aid, but tax relief, temporary infrastructure, even what we now call refugee camps, providing long term food and shelter for displaced peoples. In 1493, the Knights Hospitalers shipped doctors and surgeons to the Greek island of Kos after an earthquake. And so we see some of the first evidence of multiple different groups or organizations coordinating across disciplines and borders to respond to a disaster. In the intervening years, we've continued to hone our disaster response strategies. Humanities impact on this planet has required us to do so. And besides, those prefrontal cortexes of ours have a lot more data to lean on than our friends the ancient Alexandrians had. If they knew then what we knew now, maybe they could have saved that library. You should pull it together. Anyway, today we have entire organizations, governmental bodies, NGOs, and community groups dedicated to such activities. We have laws by country and internationally to enshrine basic human rights and ideal responses in crises. And now we're building a new frontier, a new form of transit. We're creating massive new civilizations, hosted on smallish, inscrutable, blinky boxes. In this new world, we can't even really see the threats, the crises. We're throwing people together in a way that's affecting global social structures and people's everyday lives. Like every form of infrastructure, like most every place where humans gather to live, to work, to learn, to play. The internet has grown up in an unplanned way. And we're still scrambling to understand it, to learn from our mistakes, to apply those lessons, to build the best internet, to build systems that protect people and systems that react when people are harmed. But don't worry too much. We'll survive these dark ages. Our species has survived every disaster it's encountered, at least so far. A common organizational structure found in groups undertaking large-scale operations to solve big, big problems is called a multi-team system. A system comprised of multiple teams working towards a shared goal. These structures can be found throughout all sorts of industries, working on all sorts of problems, disaster response, space exploration, governing humans, building stuff. If you're part of a business with multiple departments, you're in one. If you attend or work in a university, you're in one. And if you maintain or contribute to a support or, excuse me, contribute to or support or care about an open-source project, you're also in such a system. Because no matter what corner of the internet you occupy or to which technology you contribute, you're working in service of our shared mission to keep the internet open and free. So what makes up a multi-team system? Within the subordinate, the superordinate team, the entire system, we have local teams working on local or proximal goals, which may even be split further into component teams. And directing the subordinate teams is the leader or perhaps the team of leaders, which shares a global or system goal. And when you examine these teams using social network analysis, you find common patterns between successful MTSs. There are many more patterns we could discuss, but let's focus on three. A plan for coordination paired with frequent, clear communication, highly-performant and resilient local teams, and finally, empowered and effective leaders who are willing to sacrifice their local goal in service of the global goal. So before we explore each of these patterns, I want to share this diagram with you to underscore the importance of these patterns in disaster response. Because that term disaster response makes such activity sound reactive, doesn't it? But in reality, the most effective disaster responses begin long before the disaster happens or second best right after a disaster occurs. So I ask you to bear that in mind through the rest of this talk. After all, the best time to plant a tree was 10 years ago, and the second best time is today. First, let's talk about planning, coordination and communication. I don't think I need to talk about docs too much here. I think the OSS communities know this one quite well. And engineers know all about retrospectives. Like I mentioned, disaster response begins well before the disaster occurs. So in terms of coordination and communication, knowing where to turn for help or resources before a disaster occurs spares valuable time, energy and mental load during a crisis. Effective communication prevents errors in the field, helps the even distribution of resources and helps us learn from the mistakes we've made last time so we don't make them again next time. During disasters, response teams crucially over communicate. They share reports on the situation as it evolves. They communicate with stakeholders on the ground. And they report changes or progress to make the best decisions. Leadership and subordinate teams must have the most accurate and up to date information. Because knowledge sharing fosters a coordinated and collaborative environment. It reinforces the multi-team system as a single unit, not a set of separate teams. And because knowledge sharing makes it easier to be flexible and adaptable in rapidly changing environments. Interestingly, research has found that inter communication, communication between local teams is more important than intra communication. Communication within the local team to the success of the whole system. So in fact, there's actually a Goldilocks zone of inter to intra communication. Local teams should communicate half as much between teams as they communicate within their own team. Any more inter communication than that and performance declines any less than that and it declines too. When we talk about the viability of a team, we mean the success of the team. In moments of disaster or crises, the stakes are life and death. And at the end of the day, disaster response teams and open source maintainers too, they're people. They have feelings. So viable teams or successful teams support each other. They lend a hand. They take emotions into account when making decisions. Viable teams engage in what is called disruption, buffering behaviors, which is to say change management. They try to anticipate changes that may occur, plan ahead and invent that some change or disruption occurs. And again, they support each other through those changes. Viable teams also try to balance performance and resilience because when you work with people and you're so hell bent on performance, then the team's physical or mental health is at stake. And the team becomes brittle and the team does not perform well. So when we see teams that are so, because people do not want to be a part of such a team, right? So I'll say that again. There's a difference between successful teams and teams that people want to be a part of. And in the long term, teams that strike the right balance are the ones that are the most successful. Finally, the most important, the most performant teams strike the right balance between reinforcing the team's boundaries, which is to say reinforcing the identity or team spirit of the local team and boundary diminishing behaviors, which reinforce the local team as part of something larger than the team as part of the whole system. So a little bit of silo is actually good but not to the extent that teams develop an us versus them mentality, which brings us to our last assertion today. Empowered and effective leaders. Strong leaders serve as an ambassador to the team and for the team. Internally, they help teams understand why the team has a certain goal or is performing some task. Within the system, they advocate for the team's priorities and points of view. Those are called boundary spanning behaviors. They make sure that the team has the information it needs, not only the what, but the why of a task or priority that they understand their own team's priorities. In a disaster response scenario, times of the essence. Rapid decision making allows teams to quickly assess the situation, evaluate available options and act promptly to address emerging challenges. Delays in decision making can lead to missed opportunities, increased risks, and further escalation of the situation. And as much as we're proud to be a part of our own team, we must recognize and understand other teams' respect and contribute to their priorities and not be too selfish in our own focus. That's why a crucial feature of successful multi-team systems, of disaster response effectiveness, is that local leaders and teams are willing to sacrifice their local goal, if it means more for the common good. So now that we've immersed ourselves in the theory of effective multi-team system performance, let's illustrate it with a real-world example. I recently discovered this amazing YouTube channel. It's called Brick of Mortar. It's all about infrastructure disasters, ship sinkings, critical failures. It's fascinating. If you're into this kind of stuff, check it out. You'll never look at bridges or tall buildings the same again. The sinking of the MV Ferry Wall on April 16, 2014, off the southwestern coast of South Korea, was a disaster, not only in and of itself, but also of multi-team system performance. Over 300 people paid the price for these failures with their lives. On what seemed to be a trip like any other, the ferry suddenly made a series of sharp turns. But as we know, a disaster such as this starts long before the immediate catalyst. Over the years, this ferry had been repurposed many times and additions had been made that affected its balance point. For this trip in particular, the ship had taken on excessive cargo, which compromised the vessel's stability and made it more susceptible to capsizing. What's more, the ship's crew had drained the ballast that's water that's kept in a ship to make sure it doesn't sink, to make sure it's properly balanced. They didn't want it to sit too low in the water, they wanted to be able to pass inspection knowing they'd taken on way more weight than they were supposed to. So the communication breakdowns. First, when the ship began to list, the captain refused a sendage of stress call during the crucial first moments, delaying rescue efforts as the ship began to sink. He told passengers to go to lower levels of the ship after refusing to tell them anything about the impending disaster. For crucial moments when they should have been getting on to the deck, getting ready to be rescued. When he finally sent the distress call and rescue ships came, they quickly learned that the actual communication infrastructure, the radios that the ship needed to call the disaster teams were either malfunctioning or were broken. Something had gone wrong with them. So despite the rescue teams trying to raise the ship's crew on the radio, vital communications failed during those crucial first moments. So you can see the ferry seawall had no plan for intra communication in the event of a disaster. They coordinated poorly, not only within their local team but also with the rescuers. So they failed to inter-communicate with local teams. So the system, the global team failed. So for the sake of this section, let's quickly divide the various local teams. The crew is a team, the rescuers are a team, the passengers are a team, and the South Korean government is a team. What were each of those teams' goals? Passengers wanted a safe trip. The crew should have wanted to get them there safely but they just wanted to maximize profit. The rescuers wanted to make it to the site quickly and save as many passengers as possible. You would think the South Korean government would want to save their people and prevent such a disaster from happening again, but unfortunately that was not the case. Their true goal was to save face on the international stage. We'll talk more about that in a second. Now each of these teams had goals that were in opposition to another team's goals. And as the circumstances evolved, there was no ability of any of these teams to shift their priorities or manage this change to negotiate the priorities and evolve. And each team in the system saw the other team as a detriment to achieving their own goals rather than as a part of a system, as allies, as individuals worthy of consideration. In fact, the crew had never received proper safety training. So even if their goals had been aligned, they were not properly equipped to perform. Now the next example from this horrible tragedy is an example of leadership, failure, and boundary reinforcing. When rescuers arrived on site, the assembled parties included Japanese Coast Guard and the US Navy. When a ship sinks, often there will exist air pockets within the ship. If passengers can find them, they can survive for seven days as long as they have food. The US Navy or water, pardon me, the US Navy and Japanese Coast Guard and private citizens too all had the equipment necessary and were on site, the equipment necessary to conduct such a rescue. But due to South Korea's rigid hierarchical culture and their government's desire to save face, the teams that had the equipment necessary were not allowed to perform the rescue. It's an example of unwillingness to sacrifice the local goal and a lack of emotional and really life support to the passengers who just wanted to survive. In fact, throughout the crucial hours then days when those high school children that were trapped in that ship could have been saved, the South Korean government lied to the parents who had assembled to wait for news about their kids. They said that all the kids had been saved despite that being quite far from the truth. So what do I hope the open source community will take from this line of scientific inquiry, from the lessons of the MVC wall? Because folks, this ship is sinking. Our planet's ecosystem is failing. The climate is changing. I hope when projects, especially leaders, see someone building something similar to what they're doing, they start to think that other project is an ally. That other project is an ally, not a competitor. They think, how can we help each other? Not, how can I win? Or worse yet, how can I sabotage them? I hope maintainers who make the commitment to serve their community understand the commitment they're making and live up to that responsibility. Because remember, it's not a commitment you have to make. You can make something, you can choose not to maintain it, you can choose not to accept issues, change anything about it. But if you make that choice, I hope you live up to it. And I hope you respect your community and listen to what they need. I hope BDFLs, benevolent dictators for life, focus more on the benevolent part and less on the dictator part. I hope we can take better care of each other. So many maintainers and contributors out there in this room are carrying so much weight and holding so much space for all of us. I hope we can do more to help them or at the very least, I hope we can spare them kind words. I'm not under illusions here. I don't expect what I've said here today to do all that much. People have said a lot of what I said here many times before, but maybe, just maybe, I've touched one heart or one mind and maybe that heart or mind will go out there and they'll make a different choice because of what I said here today. Or maybe they'll speak up and share what was touched today with the next person when they see something wrong. Maybe, like our very first ancestor who looked up and reached, maybe we can make a little difference now that will make a really big difference for the people who come after us. Because the last 10 years, the platformification of the web, the inshidification of those platforms, that was not a new normal. That was a glance at a future that doesn't have to be. Our power out as a community is in our principles and it's in our numbers. If we can convene, if we can coordinate, if we can collaborate, if we can take good care of each other and choose kindness every day, if our leaders stay humble and choose the greater good over their own enrichment ego or fame, we can change the course of this information age. We can change the course of history. But it will take all of us working together and it will be damn hard work. The wonderful organizers of FOSSTEM have given me this stage, so to close this talk, I will now issue a challenge as if all of that wasn't already a challenge. From my perspective, and I'm speaking especially to our leaders, we must focus our collaborative energy and kindness on the following three areas. We must make the internet more efficient. We must make our code bases smaller. We need to reduce storage usage, duplicated requests, and reduce the distance data needs to travel. We are in the midst of an energy and an environmental crisis. Half our world is drowning and the other half is on fire. And as the diaspora of people across digital social spaces continues, we must collaborate across the internet community to protect disadvantaged, disenfranchised, and marginalized people. When diversity and inclusion suffers, we all suffer. Our pursuit of knowledge, societal progress, and the advancement of humanity only succeeds when we are inclusive of all walks of life, of all creeds, of all religions, of all races, of all colors, of all communities. Barring those who promote violence or enable hate. And we must protect science and knowledge. We must stand for the truth, not only from a geopolitical and societal perspective, but also on an individual level. We need to protect people and the systems through which we organize into collectives. We have to make the truth resilient. Whether you recognize it or choose to identify as part of it, you are part of a movement. Whether you're doing this in your spare time as a passion or as a hobby, or if you're one of the lucky people who has found a company to pay you to do this. You are part of a movement. You have experience and passion and you're smart as heck we need you. And I believe in us. Thank you.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 11.8, "text": " Hi, everyone.
