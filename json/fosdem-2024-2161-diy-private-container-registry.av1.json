{"text": " So, welcome everyone. Thank you for joining my presentation. It's my pleasure to open the containers, the room this year at FOSDEM. I've just realized that the title may be a little bit misleading. I'm not going to talk about building a container registry. I'm not clever enough for that. I'm going to talk about making it private though, so if that's why you are here, feel free to stick around. My name is Marc Chagy-Cozard. I'm don't bother trying to pronounce my last name, just call me Marc. I'm the head of open source, the company called OpenMeter. We do usage-based metering. We don't do anything about container registries. This is just a talk I had in the queue for a while. Let me actually tell you a story. This is going to be a story over a long period of time and a couple of different companies I've worked at. It's going to be about distributing images to people, developers, different deployment environments, design partners, whatever you want to call them. We accumulated a number of requirements over time. Again, different companies have different requirements, but often when you want to share container images that are not open with design partners or customers, you have specific requirements like you want to be able to share those container images so people can deploy it in their target environments. They can pull it to their development machines and use it for development, or they want to run services in their CI. You want to be able to distribute these images often in a way that you don't want everyone to pull those images. You want specific people and environments to access those images. You need flexible authentication and authorization solutions to do that. Obviously, you also want to minimize the operational burden. You don't want to run your own storage necessarily. You want to use some sort of object store, and you don't really want to think about things like monitoring or backups. So what do people usually do these days when they need a cloud native solution? Any ideas? Well, you go to the CNCF landscape and try to find an existing solution. If you go to the CNCF landscape, you're going to see that there are a bunch of container registry solutions already available. These solutions can largely be categorized or put into four categories. One of them is the cloud hosted registries. Most cloud providers have their own hosted registries these days, which is easy to use. There is a second category, which is called peer-to-peer. I call them peer-to-peer registries. They are mostly about distributing images within a deployment environment. Those are not really for distributing images with other people. There are all-in-one solutions we're going to talk about, and there are plain old registries that you can run in your own environments. Now, obviously, and again, this is a story we had our own requirements at a company called Bonsai Cloud to distribute images, private images with a bunch of customers, and we started with cloud hosted registries. They are easy to set up. There is no operational cost, basically, but it does require for customers and people who want to pull your images to register a cloud provider account. You have to set up IAM and a bunch of other stuff. Surprisingly, this is something I learned. Companies who don't have an account for a specific cloud provider are not really eager to register one if they don't use that specific cloud provider. Cloud hosted registries may not always be the answer if you have customers who don't have accounts for those cloud registries. Now, again, some time went by and new requirements came in. Obviously, one of them was the no cloud provider registration, and the other one was more flexible authorization. Obviously, there are many different artifact stores out there with a wide range of project. We use it for a long time. I believe it's still in use, where we introduced it. And it gives you a bunch of different tools for distributing OCI artifacts. It gives you robust authorization solutions. It gives you things like image replication, so you don't actually have to push your images to the hardware. If you just want to use it as a distribution strategy, you can replicate your images from your existing solution or your existing registry. And that's what we did, actually. We replicated the images we wanted to distribute across clients from our existing registry. And again, hardware has tons of more features. And basically, what we did is we built a layer on top of the so-called feature robot accounts. It's basically a service account feature in hardware that you can use for service to service authentication. And we built a layer on top of that to distribute credentials to customers so they can authenticate with hardware. Now, the thing with hardware is it's a great solution. We loved it. We did find a few issues with it, though. So first of all, the group-based access control, it has, it's only for users, not for robot accounts. So we had to manually set up the authorization for each robot account every time, which means if we need to update those authorization policies, we have to update all of those robot accounts, which was a bit weird. The other issue we met was creating robot accounts for multiple projects, hardware structures, everything into projects. Basically, it's a namespacing feature and creating cross-project robot accounts requires using the admin credential, which is a single admin user with a password, which was a bit of an issue for us. But overall, hardware is a great solution, maybe a bit overly complex if you just want to use it for just distributing images. But it's great. But obviously, new requirements came in, like building a sub-serve portal for users. Obviously, we could have allowed them into hardware, but since we used robot accounts, that wasn't really an option. And again, as actual customers started to use these products, we need the closer integration with sales and licensing systems. So this is where we started to think about maybe building our own solution. But before I talk about the solution that we came up with, I need to talk a little bit about how container registries work. How many of you are familiar with OCI? I guess, fair bit, all right. So I'm not going to talk a lot about what OCI is. But basically, OCI has three specifications. That's relevant in this space. The distribution, which is the registry API, basically the image and the runtime. And the interesting part here is the distribution specification, because that's how you pull images from a registry, basically. That's what defines the API for pulling images. And the problem is that there is no built-in support for authentication and authorization in that interface. The distribution specification is basically just an HTTP interface. So technically, you could use basic OCI if you wanted to, if the client that you use to pull images supports it. And actually, I think the Docker registry OCI actually uses or allows using basic OCI, but again, it depends on the client. And there is no authorization built into the distribution specification at all. So that's the operation. That's how the Docker CLI works, basically. When you do Docker login or pull or push, that's what the Docker CLI does these days. Whenever you try to pull or push into a registry with authentication. So that's how authentication works in Docker. Again, this is not a formal specification. It's just something that Docker did. It's great. It works, but it's not a formal specification. Not yet anyway. So let's try to put this all together and see how we can build our own private container registry. So first of all, we need a container registry. And as I said, I'm not going to talk about building a next-year registry. Fortunately, we do have a couple of options. We have the SoCo distribution project. I always found this is a bit weird name. Like, what does it mean? Distribution. I mean, I understand it's about image distribution, but anyway, it's basically the reference Docker registry implementation. And the other project is Zod. Both of them are CSEO projects. The distribution project is basically, again, as I said, is the reference Docker registry implementation. Most providers use it under the Docker Hub, GitHub's container registry Harbor uses it under the hood. So it's basically the reference implementation for container registries. And I think they are working on a version three these days. I don't know if it's out yet or not, but there is a new version coming. The other project is called Zod. It's a new project. I think it focuses purely on the OCI distribution specification. So it doesn't really have support or backward, compatible support for the older Docker registry API. The registry authentication was actually broken for a long time. And fortunately, a couple of days ago, a week ago, they fixed it. So it should work with the registry of specification now. And the third project that I built, it's basically a proof of concept project, actually, but it's a registry authentication library and a service. This is the service that implements the authorization service component. If you remember the diagram before, this is how you can build your own authentication and authorization solution for your own registry. Again, it's a library so you can build your own service with it. And it's also a service comes with a couple of defaults and helpful configuration. You can check it out on GitHub if you want to. Now, couple of caveats with the registry specification. As I said, it's not actually a formal specification. There are several gaps in it, edge cases that are not covered. Properly, different clients and different services may implement the specification differently. There are also competing and not fully compatible specifications. I believe this is the biggest issue with it today. Charmism has its own similar specification which is incompatible. And this is actually the reason why the Zalt implementation was broken, because they used the Charmism oath specification, which is a version of the Docker token oath specification. And that's why it was broken. So hopefully, this is going to be solved by the OCI specification. So this is going to be the fourth, I believe the fourth OCI specification. There's a new formal working group. I believe they formed in August last year. So there's the new working group trying to solve all these issues and try to come up with a consistent solution for both authentication and authorization. So it becomes easier to build these kind of services. And it becomes easier for different clients and different registry implementations to work together. So hopefully, that's going to solve all those issues. And well, that's all I had for today. I'm happy to answer any questions you have. Or I can do a big demonstration of the port word service if you are interested. I'm up for both. Sorry, if you want to ask questions, there is a microphone here. All right, let's see the demo. Just give me a moment. All right. So all right. Can you see my console? I don't know if it's visible from the back. All right, cool. So this is a demo for port word, which I mentioned is an authorization service implementation. Thank you. As you can see, there are a couple other services here. One is called Docker. This is the distribution registry. The other one is Zot. The example works with Zot as well. And there is a fourth service here, which is called Kerbos. This is one of the included authorization solutions in the default port word service implementation. You can use Kerbos to define authorization policies for your container registry repositories. This is just the basic default policy that allows different types of users, like admin users, developers, and customers, to do different kinds of things. Obviously admins can do everything. I don't know. Users can push to their own namespaces. But the idea is, I don't really want to talk too much about Kerbos, but you can use Kerbos to define these policies. And it's integrated into the Docker of authorization specification through port word. Port word has its own configuration. I'm going to show that quickly as well. You don't have to parse this hash. I'm going to tell you its password just to make it easier. This is a very simple configuration here with a few static users. A couple configuration parameters for issuing tokens. And you can see the authorizer is configured as Kerbos here. There are a bunch of other authorizers that you can use. You can build your own, as I mentioned, port word is a library and a service, so you can integrate your own authorization solutions fairly easily. Now let's see if this thing actually works. So everything is running. Let's see if I can log in to the service. By the way, this is on GitHub. If you go to the Kickstarter on GitHub, you can try this out yourself. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry, I can't hear you and there is a microphone here. What type of authentication are supported? Is it only password based or do we use the default authentication? Yeah, it's only password based. That's the only thing that the Docker specification allows. But as far as I know, the OCI working group is trying to add more types of authentication allowed.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 13.32, "text": " So, welcome everyone.
