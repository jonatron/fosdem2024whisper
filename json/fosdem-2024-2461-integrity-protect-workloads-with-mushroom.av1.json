{"text": " All right. So the next speaker is Tom Dormann and Tom is a real hacker. So I first met Tom last year at the CCC event where he talked about, which I did a bit about, an attack he did on NX. And I think it's very inspiring in the Dev Room that we have this great company talks, but it's also really nice in the real, let's say free software ethos. Tom, there's also some work in his free time, just pure hobby projects. And he'll talk a bit about work he's been doing on AMD-SEV. Sure. So thank you for the introduction. Today my talk will be on integrity protecting Linux workloads with Mushroom. Okay. So what are you going to talk about? Well, first up, we'll talk about some of the goals of Mushroom. And then I give a short demo to show you how it actually works. And then we'll talk about higher level architecture and some of the parts in particular. So the supervisor, kernel and the DMM host. And then we'll also talk about some of the things we don't want to do, some non goals. And finally, we'll briefly touch on how Attestation works with Mushroom. Okay. So, but this is a micro walker. Yeah. Okay. But before that, a brief thing about me. So my name is Tom Dormann. I mostly do developing and re-security research. But my day job is also reverse engineering. Here are some of my links. And one thing about me is that I also really love Rust. So all of the code that you may see here today is also written in Rust. Okay. So what do we want to do? The main goal is to run Linux programs securely. And in particular, we want to run programs that just transform an input file or maybe multiple input files into an output file or potentially multiple output file files. And while doing that, we want to prevent any tampering during the process so that we can make sure that the output files are authentic. So for example, one use case would be that you have some untrusted server and that you want to compile code on. And ideally, you want to not trust that server, but still be assured somehow that there hasn't been a backdoor injected somewhere in your code. And you just want to have assurance that the code has been compiled without any tampering. So yeah. I'll give a brief domain of that. So yeah. Okay. So what we'll be doing, I already talked about workloads. Mushroom is completely generic in what kind of workload you want to run. It has to be Linux binary, but that's basically it. So for this example, I chose to do a simple Docker image and just because it's easy to set up. And so in this case, it's an alpine image, which has GCC and muzzle installed. And it will run this in its script, which just copies the input file and that we want to transform to another file on the file system. And then we'll run GCC on that. And then in the end, we'll use that output and copied it to a special output device. And so the file that we want to compile is this one right here. Yeah. So it's just a simple head award, just a proof of concept. Okay. So, yeah, I should clear that. Okay. So beforehand, I already set up some like environment variables just for some of the components. But the important thing is this one right here. Okay. So what we'll do is we'll run this command, which as you might already notice contains some information like the input file that you just that I just showed to you. It also specifies the output and it also specifies where to put the gestation report. And because that's in the end, how we really know that that process hasn't been tabbed with is that gestation report. And so we'll run that. In this case, we'll actually take a bit longer than usual, because like the Docker image is fairly large. It's like under six megabytes or something. And just loading that in this fairly slow process. But any second now, the workload will start running. Okay, now it's started running. And now it's finished. Okay, so let's take a look at the output file. So just file test. And we can already see that it's a 64 bit elf binary, which is of course expected because we compile the C program. But before we actually run the executable, like, let's actually verify that it hasn't been tampered with. And we can do that by just using the same command that we used previously. But instead of saying run, we use verify. So we use the exact same configuration parameters. And this will take very shortly. And it says okay, so we know that the process hasn't been tampered with. And so as the last step, let's actually make it executable. And run it. Yeah, so you can see that also works, which is, yeah. Okay, so now that we saw how it work, like, what it's supposed to be doing, let's talk about some of the details about how it's implemented. And the first thing to note here is that it's implemented using SEV, S&P. And so in this case, we have all the virtualization. The workload is of course supplied by user, which in this case was GCC. And then around that we have a completely custom kernel, which we'll also talk about later. And around that, then we have so called supervisor, and which is a concept I came up with, which is basically just responsible for communicating between the kernel and the host. And the important thing to note here is that most of the logic is actually in the kernel. And this will probably grow a lot in the future as well. And the supervisor is fairly slow, not slow, fairly small, and will also probably not grow a lot in the future. It might even shrink. And even in this configuration, there's some code that's like disabled at compile time because it's only there for like debug features. Okay. So about the kernel, it's completely written in Rust. It just implements the Linux Cisco interface, so that we can run unmodified Linux programs. It currently implements 83 Cisco's more or less because like some Cisco's have a lot of flags and we don't implement all of those. But still it's a lot of, it's enough for some of the applications at least. And yeah. So apart from that, we also support 32-bit and 64-bit binaries. And the reason we have this kernel is that usually you have a lot of bloat and you have a lot of stuff that you just don't need. And so the reason we have those on-custom kernels that we can just throw things away and only implement the things that we need. And yeah. We'll also need that for some things that we'll talk about shortly. Okay. So the really interesting thing I think about mushroom is the supervisor. And so I already talked about that it handles communication between the host and the kernel. What does that mean? Well, the first thing the supervisor does is actually load up the input. And so the input is not part of the initial measurement. The reason for that is that we don't want to measurement to change every time the input changes because then we can sign it or at least not in a way that's like really makes sense. The other thing is memory hot plug. So initially mushroom starts out with a very small amount of static memory. And then after that we use memory hot plug to load in more dynamic memory once it's needed. And lastly, the thing that we do during runtime is scheduling. And so if the kernel wants to run another CPU, it somehow has to tell the kernel about the host about that. And so that's also a responsibility of the supervisor. And so the interesting thing here is that this communication, it's not just a convention, it's not just that the kernel chooses to talk through the supervisor to the kernel and to the host. It's actually impossible for the host to talk to the kernel directly. And so the reason for that is that we want isolation there. We don't want the kernel to have potentially malicious input sending to the kernel and we want to prevent vulnerabilities by just not having an interface there. And this is implemented using a couple of hardware features. So for example, one of them is virtual top of memory, which just basically makes it so that the kernel can't access shared memory, which would of course be needed to access, yeah, to have shared access with the host. Another feature is VC reflect, which is basically in some cases you need the hypervisor. And instead of using the hypervisor, we can then just offload that responsibility to the supervisor. And that way the kernel doesn't even really have to be aware of it being run in a SAP VM. Lastly, the separation between the kernel and the supervisor, which is of course also important, is done using virtual memory privilege levels, which basically makes it so that the supervisor is allowed to access all memory. But the kernel is not. So for example, the supervisor has some secret keys that it uses for agitation. And the kernel is of course not allowed to access those secret keys. And yeah. So the important thing here though is that the supervisor is the only security critical component. The kernel can have as many bugs as it wants. The host will never be able to talk to the kernel directly. So it doesn't really matter if there are security bugs in there. And this is of course really nice for auditing, because the only thing we have to audit and make sure that it actually works is the supervisor, which is this once again fairly small fairly small component of code. Yeah. So for the VMM, we don't use QMU or anything. Reason for that being is that we have this fairly custom like memory hotplug and so on. And like all those interfaces and getting the data in and out. So yeah, instead of using something that already existed, that maybe has like abstractions that are not ideal for us. And we just implemented this for our own. It's not actually that complicated because we once again, we don't have that much host guest communication. So this VMM doesn't really have to implement a lot. And as of a couple of weeks ago, it also supports running the kernel outside of an SCV SMP VM, which is of course really useful for like debugging and profiling. And maybe not everyone has an S like an epic CPU that can actually run those VMs. Okay, so we already talked about a lot about things that we want to do, which yeah, but there are also things that we don't want to do. So one of those important things is that we don't want to do IO at runtime. If I want to run GCC, I don't need network. I will never need that. That's just not a thing that we need. And sort of thing is by not having network, we can reduce the tech surface drastically. And once again, like reduce complexity in the supervisor in the kernel and mitigate vulnerabilities by just not implementing interfaces. Of course, there are a lot of a lot of use cases where you do need network. But in those cases, you can just use standard Linux and like, you can just use other projects. But the point is that for a lot of projects and workloads, you don't need the extra complexity and job us by just not implementing that you can lower the potential for vulnerabilities. Same logic goes for persistent storage. So every time mushroom boots up, you boot into tempfs with like all those files that you split doing initialization. But once the VM actually exits, all that memory is destroyed because for a lot of use cases, you don't need persistent disk. And by not having that, you can once again, low complexity. Similarly, we also have fairly low complexity in the supervisor, which once again is this one part that's actually security critical. So one of the things that you might have noticed is that none of the things that the supervisor is doing are really CPU bound or performance critical in any way. And so for example, we can get away by just not implementing multi threading, because in reality, there's nothing that requires that amount of performance that could potentially be that could potentially like get a performance boost by multi threading. And so by not implementing multi threading, we can once again, just like eliminate the whole class of concurrency bucks, because that's just can't happen if you don't have multi threading. Similarly, the supervisor is fairly simple and doesn't actually need the heap. And then once again, we can just not have any bucks in there if you don't have a heap, if you don't need it. And yeah, so I think those non goals also really important because they could strain the things that we want to do and that way, like increase the security by setting up clear goals. Okay. So lastly, let's talk about agitation. I'm sorry, talked about the measurement. So in this case, this contains all of the binaries that you want to load up in, which is the first supervisor, the kernel and the in the binary. Those could be signed in the future. Currently, we just compare the raw hash. And so the SEV firmware, when you load in the image, it like hashes all the memory and like chains it together and just produces a hash that you could be some could sign, but we don't currently. And the host data field is also field that's supplied when the VM is booted up. And so this, this field just contains a hash of the input file. And the first thing the supervisor does is when it boots up is loading the input file and actually verifying that that hashes correct. So it doesn't even really look at the data, it just hashes it. And that way, there's no way hopefully for the data for the input file to potentially be malicious and influence the supervisor before it's actually been verified that it actually is the one that we want to see. And lastly, of course, we also want to attest the report, I'd like the output. And this is put in the report data field. And this is also interesting because this is actually the only field that the guests can influence at runtime. So both the measurement and the host data field are set by the SCV firmware. And even if you have like some malicious input file or malicious input binary, you can only modify like you can only modify the report data field. And so this is really important because if you have like, assume, assume you have some untrusted input, you will never be able to fortune attestation report in such a way that it pretends to have to come from another host data from another input file. And that way, we can just like by making this the simple abstraction choice, we can hopefully reduce the potential for any vulnerabilities there. And so this is also another thing where it's compared comparatively simpler compared to other projects. Because one of the things is that we only do attestation at the end of the process. So we don't have any certificates during runtime. And because we don't have any IO at runtime, and so we just don't need any other certificates that would usually have to interface with other services. And like, I can see why there are a lot of problems like sanitization. But that's just one of the things that this model doesn't really need. And similarly for like this encryption case, so the attestation model for mushroom is just really, really simple. And hopefully made in such a way that's actually easy to audit for external people if they wanted to do that. Okay, so do we have any questions about that? Thanks a lot for a very interesting talk. So I particularly like this demo that you showed because showing like this use case where you actually run a compiler inside the CVM is like a very, very desirable property in like build environments where you want to have this notion of hermiticicity where like you actually record the entire tool chain that you use to produce software. So related to this, I sort of had a question related to the sort of the trust assumptions here. So you talked about this that the supervisor is the sort of the only security critical component, but that basically only applies to the communication between like the outside world and the kernel. And but you still, you know, you later talk about it that you can still have like attacks via the input itself. So for instance, if I have like malicious code that targets some vulnerability in GCC, let's say, that's still possible, right? But on the other hand, that gets somehow recorded in as part of that station. Can you a little bit like elaborate on like, like these aspects? Yeah. Thank you. Great question. Yeah, of course. So yeah, so if you have an malicious input, that would show up in the attestation report. And I mean, ideally, if you have like a scenario where you want to have like a code cache, where you like compile, compile code once, you will only supply inputs that like are not malicious. So as long as you don't like request malicious inputs, you will not get malicious inputs out outputs out. Yeah. So I mean, in theory, there could be like attacks from the inside, but that's not really a problem because that always shows up in the attestation report and like a normal user will not request that. So yeah. Yes. Yes. So an additional comment was that this is audible. The question was whether or not this is auditable. And yeah, so the answer to that is yes, everything shows up in the attestation report. And yeah, so hopefully that's not a threat. Any other questions? Thank you. This was awesome. And then it's not a question is a feature request. If you could spit out as bomb, as bomb from, from the compilation thing with, you know, that would be fantastic. And yeah, well, the thing about that is that mushroom is not necessarily only meant for compilation processes. But if you want to do that, that's great. And one of the things I've been toying around with was, was running nix compilations and nix builds in that. And of course, those are already contained like in the build hashes, like the way nix works, all the inputs are already specified in that. And so if in that scenario, you would like more or less have an S form at least like traceable to some input. And but that's independent from mushroom. But of course, that's also the use case I intended. Okay. So yeah, first of all, very awesome work. I really like that you show that these confidential VM based solutions can also be used with very tiny trust computing bases. That's nice. And I mostly agree with your design choice of the non golds. But they said that you don't support mighty swing. But wouldn't that be somewhat important for compilation to be able to run on multiple costs? And it's kind of CPU can you consuming? Yeah, sure. And so this thing about multi threading, this only applies to the supervisor. The actual kernel can run as many costs as he wants. I mean, technically, a second limit on 128. But yeah, that could be changed. And it's probably enough. Yeah. Maybe a question also moving forward, you mentioned support and also even protected combination. Do you have a part of your design and I'm thinking about the PMPL support? Okay, so the question was whether or not my designs are tied to S&P, a CV S&P, or whether or not they could also apply on TDX. So currently, the supervisor is highly specific to S&P. But I don't see a reason right now why it couldn't be implemented for something like Intel TDX. That should probably be possible. Yeah, I mean, the MPLs are specific by I think with TDX stuff like partitions, maybe that could be something. I'm not sure. I haven't looked into that. Yeah.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 14.68, "text": " All right. So the next speaker is Tom Dormann and Tom is a real hacker.
