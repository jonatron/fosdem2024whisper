{"text": " Hi, everyone. Thanks for coming to my talk, the monolith versus the swarm. This is not about Starcraft. This is about build infrastructures. First about me, I'm Dan Cermak. I work at SUSE. I interact a lot with open SUSE and SUSE's build system, the open build service. Since I'm also a Fedora contributor, I also interact with Fedora's build system. Every time I switch between them, I get annoyed because of things that are in one and not in the other, and vice versa. At some point, I thought, well, maybe I could give a talk about that. Why, actually? Open SUSE and Fedora are very interesting in one regard, in my opinion. These are very similar distributions. They're both RPM based, and they look and feel kind of similar. For a certain amount of time, I also ran both from the same config. They work kind of the same, look kind of the same, but they have absolutely no common ancestry. They both use the RPM package manager, but SUSE started initially, I think, from Slackware, and then it became its own thing, switched to RPM, and Fedora came from the whole Red Head site, but there was never some kind of common path, and that also reflects itself in the completely different build systems, whereas open SUSE uses the open build service, which is the monolith in this talk, and one giant thing that makes everything. Fedora has 50 million different services, some of every single one doing something else, or sometimes similar things, to which we'll get, and hopefully, maybe, we can also learn from each other, because each approach has advantages and disadvantages. But let's first take a look what you actually need for a distro build system. So this is a very, very simplified graph of what you need to do if you have, if you want to build a distribution, you need some kind of source control where you store your package sources. Usually, you would pick it, but that's not always the case, as we'll see with the open build service, and you have some kind of service that builds your RPM packages. Since we're talking about RPM based distributions, yes, we want to build RPMs, but if this was about a one-two, you could also build depths, whatever. At some point, you want to build your repositories, images, containers, all the other deliverables. You want to take a look, and you want to monitor all the package builds, find out if things start breaking. Then you want to push all the same thing to QA. I'm not going to talk about the QA part because, kindly enough, this part is the same. Both distros use open QA, and if you're not neither from Fedora nor the open Suzerworld, and you don't use open QA, you should. There's enough open QA people around here, and by that, I have fulfilled my contractually obliged commercial part for open QA, but still please do. It's cool. Yeah, and then you push all your deliverables to some mirrors, and you have your distro nice and simple, right? So, in practice, I'm going to breeze through very, very quickly through the open build service, and this whole thing, it deserves at least five lectures, so it's probably not going to be complete. Sorry for those of you who are not familiar with it. So, the open build service is what I would call the distro building Swiss Army Knife because if you decide you want to build a new Linux distro that's based on something Fedora, open Suzer, DBN, Arc Linux-ish, you can do that with OBS more or less immediately. The whole thing's been around for a long time, so I think what I've been able to pick up from the historical documents of which there are unfortunately not many, it started out as a replacement of a service called OrderBuild. The design phase began around something 2005, probably 2006, it started becoming used, and it was introduced to open Suzer factory, which then became open Suzer Tumble with the rolling distro in 2009, and it started to get more and more extended, so initially it was just building RPMs, and that was it. But nowadays it couldn't build not only RPMs, but DBN packages, Arc Linux, web packages, you can build containers, you can build virtual machines, it will build, it will create repositories, it will publish everything, and so on and so on. So, essentially everything that you need to build a distribution, the open build service will do for you. The one big feature of the open build services that it will give you automated rebuilds, so that's something that's unfortunately not there in the Fedora infrastructure, and one thing that annoys me very, very much, and I think other people as well. The thing that annoys me very much in the open build service is the custom version control system, which is unfortunately not gates. Yeah, and then as I said, OBS, there's a ton of features that are, so one thing that I'd like to mention that's especially useful for distro building is a so-called staging area, which you can use if you want to, if you send in stuff into the distribution, you can create a sub-project. If you're familiar with the Koji world, it would be something like an automated side tag where you rebuild everything that depends on your change, and if it's all green, you merge it into the distro, and that's nicely, nicely possible in OBS. So, when I said it's a monolith, I was actually lying, it's two monoliths. You have monolith number one, that's the OBS front-end, that's a giant Rails application that talks to MariaDB database, and the actual magic with the interesting parts that's written in Perl, please don't run away, but yes, but it works relatively nicely, and that's really where the scheduler is, where the dependencies are resolved, this thing, signs your packages, publishes packages, but the actual building part is related to the workers, which invoke the bespoke OBS build script, and that will build your RPMs, DBN packages, containers, and so on. But as the user, you really just talk to the front-end, which has an XML API, so you see it's from the early, early odds, it's no JSON, so too early for that, or you interact via the OSC command line. So let's take a look how this actually looks, though this is an example of the OBS web UI, remind you a little bit of copper from Fedora, and the whole open build service is organized in projects, a project is more or less a collection of individual packages, that then OBS will rebuild for you. So here, let's just make a hypothetical example, you create yourself, you have some Python projects, there you have some Python packages, and OBS will happily keep rebuilding those once there's some kind of dependency change. And that, to all of you who know copper, that looks exactly like copper, but the real magic of OBS comes in, that you can automatically, that you can add dependencies between your different projects. So imagine I now decide that I want to test out some change in pandas, but I need special dependencies for that, and I have found them in some other project, and now I will include them in my build route in this home-danned project. And then OBS will do the dependency tracking recursively across projects, which gives me a whole ton of flexibility for experimentation. And it will also do all the rebuild these stuff across that. So as you can already see, this is a very simple, very simple, very simple, very simple, very simple, very simple, very simple, very simple. And this causes, so every time someone for instance decides to rebuild GCC, and you take a look at the monitoring page of OBS, you see a giant spike, because every single person, more or less, in either some way, depends on GCC. And it also means, when I was showing this picture, I realistically only retained the last build, because otherwise it would run out of this space now. The version control, now we're getting to the Nasty part of OBS, unfortunately, so if you start interacting with OBS via OSC, which is the command line client, it will behave like subversion, but you will very quickly realize it's not subversion. It's something completely custom that is weird and wonky, and it's actually just communicated via an XML API. It does things like there's not really subfolders, there's also no branches, and I hope we can rip this out. Well, I hope we would have ripped it out 2009, but it's still there, because that's the one disadvantage of a huge monolith, ripping out individual parts is very, very hard. And then another thing, which is, I'm not going to give it the full justice. So, on OBS, you have the option to branch packages. So, you can do this, and if I say branch, I actually mean it's more like a fork. So, let's say you find a package and opens with a tumbleweed, and it's not behaving like you would want, for instance, it's twold. So, you branch it, i.e. it makes a fork, and what actually happens underneath it creates a so-called link, which behaves kind of like a floating rebase of the changes you made locally on top of the changes that are in the distro. And if you think this makes no sense, you are not the only one, it kind of makes sense, it's a three-way merge, but getting it right is a nightmare. There are cases where this is very, very useful, because it allows you to have downstream patches that are continuously rebased, and you don't have to do the rebase yourself, and that all sounds nice, until your patch doesn't apply cleanly anymore, and the whole thing breaks down and OBS doesn't tell you. I'm sorry I can't give this whole thing justice, because I think there's like four people who really understand this, and I'm not one of them. And the other four are not here, and two of them will not admit that they understand it. So, a very nice feature of OBS is the project con for one thing that allows you to configure how projects are built and published, that's just a config file, but the other thing is you can tweak macros. So you can really tweak RPM macros. So let's take a look at an example. Here if you would look at the upper two lines, that's just some config stuff, but below there you can really set macros, and once you change them, OBS will rebuild this project, because it will not try to do macro tracking, at least I hope so. And this gives you as a release engineer a lot of flexibility, because if you suddenly find out, okay, but I now want to quickly change this, you don't have to edit redhead RPM config, and then rebuild manually everything yourself, OBS will do this for you. And at last, let me just quickly mention submit requests, so this is essentially the equivalent of a merge request. If you have branched, i.e. forked the project, you can send your changes back, but what's also possible, you can do full submissions of a new package into a project. And that's also a very nice feature how you submit new packages into open source at umbilweed, which in my opinion is a much better user experience than in fedora, where you go to bugzilla, you upload your source RPM somewhere on the internet, then you make a packaging request, then you make a new repo request, and if you haven't given up at that point, then you'll eventually get a repo. And this makes it much, much simpler. So as I said, I haven't given OBS full justice, but we're nearly approaching already 15 minutes, so let's switch over to the swarm. As I said, this is not Starcraft, but so first part of fedora, Paga, that's the Gitforge, so this is really, this is really your classical Gitforge, sadly not as maintained anymore as we all would wish. It's a Python based, it's a Python based GitHub inspired Gitforge, looks a little bit like GitHub from 10 years ago and feature wise, it's unfortunately not much further. It started also as a very great idea, because every repo in Paga is I think four repos in total, you get your own Git repo, you get your repo for your issues, for your merge requests, for your metadata, for your wiki, you can do remote pull requests on Paga, so if you don't have a Paga account and you decide I still want to make a pull request and I don't want to put it up on Paga, you can put it somewhere else into a Git repository and make a pull request to that remote repository. I don't know if any other Gitforge that would support that, but sadly this thing has been mostly written by Pingu, sadly he can't work on that anymore and so development has been very slow and it's more or less just a question of time until this will be replaced with GitLab. The build system of Fedora, that's Koji, that's really just a, it's a very, I'd say relatively simple RPM build system that uses Mock to build your RPMs and in contrast to OBS, which gives you a lot of flexibility, Koji doesn't, which gives Koji the big advantage that it's very, very simple to understand, because you can't do fancy things. You have one build route, there's your packages and then you build your package with a fixed NEVR, so name, Epoch version release in that build route and once it's built, it stays there forever. So Koji persists, builds forever, at least real builds. There's ways how you can test changes, so there are side tags and you can also do build route overrides and nowadays Koji can also talk to the, to Pega, to the Fedora disk Git, but it's in itself, it's relatively, it's a relatively simple thing and it's relatively simple to understand, which is a great advantage for release engineers, because that's all what they have to interact with and it's not, I'd say Koji is not that hard to grasp. OBS, it's a different beast. So then, Pangee, what I've heard Pangee apparently gives a few people PTSD, but then, or at least the configuration file, but Pangee itself is really just a distro composition tool, so yeah, it creates the Fedora composes, all the centers composes and Pangee itself is just, is again, just a tool that executes a bunch of other tools, but you can summarize it essentially. It assembles first all your packages from Koji from the current state, checks which packages you need to create the current snapshot that is called a compose, then it runs the repo creation, also OS tree repo creation, but that's just a different repo and then all your images are built. And this is kind of interesting because this is different than it's done on OBS, so in this step you create your images from the created repos and then the whole thing is published or not if it fails. On the open build service, these two steps are separate from each other and also the repo creation of stable distribution or stable distributions like Fedora is done differently and I don't want to say that this approach is much better, but the approach that's done on OBS has the slight disadvantage because the steps are independent of each other, you can publish your images and not publish a repo or you publish them at slightly different times and then they are not exactly the same and you suddenly, you publish your images, you run a zipper up or zip it up and suddenly there's changes also there shouldn't be. So that's I'd say a release engineering main difference. Now we come to the real swarm part of the Fedora infrastructure, that's image and container building because there's not one service, there's at least four that I know of, OSBS, the open shift build service, image factory which I think many people pray that it will go away very, very soon, then Kiwi, that's the main image builder that's also used in OBS and OS build, that's the new thing. These all are kind of wired all into Koji, where they grabbed RPMs from Koji and built images and built images from that. So at least with OSBS every time I look at it I run away because it includes far too many fancy words that I don't understand if I just want to build containers or images. There's too many. MBS, that's the module build service, unfortunately it will go away so let's not waste our time with that. Koji is a very interesting thing, it's kind of a workaround in the Fedora infra for not having automated rebuilds because it does exactly that. So what you can see here is a screenshot from Koshai where it will track every time there's a dependency change of your packages in either Fedora or height or one of the other variants, it will tell you what exactly changed between a compose, it will run a scratch build, so that's a kind of non-production build in Koji that can be removed and if it succeeded everything fine, if it breaks it will tell you. And it will also tell you if your dependency suddenly failed to resolve. And everyone who's worked with OBS will know that the worst thing that can happen is if your packages dependencies failed to resolve because that's the one thing you don't get a notification about. And that's what really Koji does. And sadly the one thing that Koji cannot do is kick off real builds which would make automated rebuilds happen in the Fedora infra but that's then the problem that there's not enough build power available. Another thing that really does not a clear equivalent in the open SUSE world, that's Bodhi, this is an updates testing facility. So this is primarily meant for end users to test package updates. You can just log in, check out an update to your favorite package and you can vote on updates and if you suddenly realize this update breaks my system you can give it negative karma and it will not go into the distro on the next compose. And nowadays it's also used to gate draw height which might or might not be a great idea. I've heard both sides of that equation. So one thing that I'd like to also mention that's Fedora messaging. That's an AMQP based notification bus where every single of those hundreds of Fedora services sends their notifications to. Open SUSE has something as well but sadly what opens SUSE doesn't have is the equivalent of the Fedora message notifications which is where you can configure on which kinds of events you want to get notified and then it will send you messages on matrix or messages via email which might or might not be a great idea. It's a bad idea during a mastery build because rip inbox. Last thing, what about copper? That wasn't me. I'm going to pretend that doesn't happen. So I hope it's not the smoke alarm. So what about copper? Copper is a community build system and really not the main part of the bad of the build system. And now for my favorite part and because I talked too long, it's going to be quick. The good, the bad and the ugly of each of them. I'd say the good parts are on OBS. It's very flexible and if you want to carry out large scale changes that's the place to go because it's much, much simpler than to do it in Koji. And you have one place where you go and you do everything there and not 500 places like in Fedora. In Fedora on the other hand you have a bunch of simple individual systems. So every one of these things is pretty easy, pretty easy to grog by themselves and if you have to work with just one of them, it's pretty simple. And it's relatively easy to extend at least in the sense that one of those services doesn't do what you want to do, just write a new one because that's sometimes like it appears has been done in the past. The bad, getting started, it sucks on both sides. It sucks in individual ways, in different ways, but I must confess I didn't find the getting started experience in either of them good. On OBS it's the version control. It's terrible. I hope we can replace it. And handling of something like a release distribution is really weird because OBS has been built around the idea you want to constantly rebuild everything. And if you try to shoehorn something where you don't try to rebuild everything all the time, it starts to become ugly. And then the OBS dependency result. Okay, everyone who is clapping has probably worked with OBS. Short explanation for those of you who haven't. OBS does its own dependency resolution, doesn't use the package manager for that. And the dependency resolver is stupid and if there's a possibility to make a choice, it won't make it. And that's when you get this error. Yeah, no automatic rebuilds on Fedora. It sucks. I hate it. Please, can we fix that? And sometimes systems get misused. Yeah, and then the ugly. So on OBS the whole thing is just so darn complex. It's impossible to understand. There's maybe half a dozen of people who really know most of the things. And given that it's a giant monolith, it's impossible to extend unless you really know all the details. And on Fedora you have just far too many systems and far too ugly glue that then also leads to ugly things where you can't extend things and you have just duplication. So who's better? No one. Both setups just have their advantages and disadvantages. If you want to do development, do OBS. If you want to do stable distributions, Fedora. That's my personal preference. I haven't worked ever on Rails, so I don't know if it was set like in production. If you want to do both, oh, I wish we could just combine it and it would work, but I haven't found it. So I hope we start time for questions if there are. I'm sorry. You can send the hate mail to me when you find me. I'm going to run away.
