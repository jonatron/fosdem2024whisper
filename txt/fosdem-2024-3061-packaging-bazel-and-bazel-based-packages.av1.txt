All right. So we now have on stage Guillaume who is going to talk about, as he mentioned,
packaging, Basil packages with Basil Software with Nex. Thank you.
So welcome everyone. I spent some months working on and off on trying to package Basil 7.
And I figured there are plenty of fun things that happened and nice things to learn from that.
So I wanted to share with you today. I'm Guillaume Maudoux, a computer scientist.
I'm like a founder of BIL systems. All of them, well, the one I prefer is the one we don't want to speak about it today.
I'm working, like for my day job as a consultant in doing Basil and Basil work at Twig.
You have all my contact info. And yeah, this work was funded by Intuitive Surgical and Twig together.
So getting Basil 7. Basil 7 was released last year, end of last year, and it took some time to get this into Nex packages,
even though there is already like a Basil 5, a Basil 6, a Basil 4 in Nex packages,
and each time you make a copy, reuse, and try to improve, it still takes a lot of time.
I think there is like a fundamental difficulty in trying to get Basil to work inside Nex because they just don't like each other.
To be honest, I think Basil tries to do everything and doesn't want to share with anyone else.
So of course, there is friction when you want to encapsulate it into something else.
But initially, it looks like they could be quite happy together.
Basil is like file-based, like make, like CMake, like all of these nice build systems we use for all the packages inside Nex.
So that should work, and Nex is package-based, so the kind of one works, manages the package, the other one, just a project, should be easy.
But then it gets a bit worse because of course you cannot get the benefits of Basil.
Basil wants to do remote caching, remote execution, and all of that is prevented by the Nex sandbox.
So just like with other build systems, in this case, it's not different, but you see how these things do not work as well as you may expect from Basil.
Then we have some issues, like a bit more annoying.
Basil assumes that there is like the file system hierarchy stand out everywhere, and like Nex does not provide that anywhere, so I kind of stuck there.
Basil loves to include pre-compiled dependencies, and it will happily, and this feature is intended to help all the users that are not using Nex,
but it's really annoying for us, it downloads dependencies from the Internet, and that's kind of built into Basil.
So with the sandbox, we break Basil completely and we need to work around that.
It's really hard to package, so I would like, like these are like four snippets of things that we won't discuss today, and that we have to do to make Basil work.
We have to patch all of the user bin paths.
We have to remove some chunks of code that try to access the system state, and that's obviously not possible inside a sandbox, like preventing the system from going to sleep.
Apparently, Basil has an empty arg when it calls GCC and it crashes.
I mean, we don't even know if that code is still needed anymore, but like, not so much to do, we didn't try to remove it.
At some point, at least, that was needed.
And, yeah, it comes with nested archive, so if you unpack some things so that the patch works and then you have to repack them in the exact same way otherwise everything breaks.
Lots of fun, but we won't discuss that today.
I've picked like five issues that are more meaningful, I think.
There is the Java toolchain.
That's something that we need to set up properly to be able to build Basil itself.
And then setting the right path, because if we want to package Basil, we want Basil that works as closely as possible to the vanilla Basil.
Then we move slowly to building package that uses Basil as a build system, even if it's also the case for Basil, because Basil uses Basil as a build system to build Basil.
You're still following? Good.
So we enter the realm of like, fetching dependencies of the build, which is quite tricky.
And then we will also discuss about like, picking the right Basil version using dot Basil version file.
And again, the Java toolchain.
Why not?
We will see it's so complex that it deserves two points.
So we start with the Java toolchain.
Basil hardcodes everything everywhere.
So here, Basil tries to do something nice for us.
It will download the single jar binary that's already pre-compiled.
It's a cc++ application, by the way.
So of course it doesn't just work like that with Nix.
And for the Linux and Windows, it will pick the right one for you.
But there is no way to change that, except like patching the source code.
We cannot like, from the outside configure the build so that it picks something else.
In this case, we probably want this one, the one that's built from the cc++ sources with the c compiler,
because we can do that on Nix and we get the proper binary, but none of these pre-built binaries work.
So we have to create, and you see this is a patch, so there is no way to do that without like modifying the source code again.
We create toolchains for Basil that do not contain these like pre-built dependencies.
To do that, we use a non-pre-built toolchain configuration.
So that defines somewhere, even though it's not that much tested in the codebase, so we can reuse it.
And we use the localJRK, meaning we want to use Java from the system and not some pre-built Java,
because that one also doesn't work.
Okay.
Yeah, okay, that's all right.
So this is like showing the non-pre-built configuration that we use,
and this thing that we would get otherwise by default, like the remote SDK,
it's something you download from a remote cache.
And the single Java one we've seen on the previous slide.
But that custom toolchain is kind of fragile, because nobody uses it.
So when I updated, suddenly it was missing one of these entries,
and we got like a proper binary downloaded from the Internet, and that didn't work.
So we have to make upstream patches to get it to work.
Thankfully, that one landed fast enough, so it was like not broken too much.
It was broken between 7 and 7.1, so no one should ever see that on a proper release.
Another funny issue we have is setting the right path.
Initially, it seemed pretty simple, like we have to patch the paths,
so that's onNixBuildBasal finds all of the common bash scripts that everyone expects to have.
So we do that, and we do that in a lot of places until it works.
And in the end, we have something that doesn't really work, like Basal should.
We've discovered that...
So this is the behavior of like Vanilla Basal, based on like several options that you can change.
And if you take Basal with some patch that we have,
there's something very strange there, like it doesn't set an extra branch,
so you can end up with the path that's configured differently than what you would expect.
And you have the same with all the patch, so everything has branches everywhere,
and it's like, yes, it is not consistent with what you would expect from upstream Basal.
That's really annoying, because as we discover later, users rely on that fake behavior,
and then when you try to fix it, they say, hey, you've broken the build.
Yeah, I think this is the correct way to do it with respect to Basal,
but I know that we've been using that NixBuild Basal for like three years, and you're used to it.
So now it changed your build.
It's really annoying that we are maintaining a fork of Basal to some extent.
So the first issue we had, we end up with a path that is like literally no such path.
That thing can only come from Nix.
We are the one that are coded.
If Basch from Nix starts without the proper path, it will default to no such path.
It's kind of similar, like normal Basch will default to user bin, user local bin.
That makes no sense either, so in both cases, it's a kind of a nice default,
but doesn't really work with Basal, because Basal expects to have some default Basch tooling there.
We have a script for that, like if path is like no such path, then we export the path to the default shell utilities.
It should work, except we have this runtime inputs.
I had no idea what it did.
It seemed like good.
We want all of these dependencies, except this modifies the path to that value.
And it does it so that it happens that value to the path.
So we have a no such path, colon, something else.
It kind of works, but it's also kind of ugly, like why is no such path in there?
It shouldn't be.
That's one of these red dots.
Okay, we move that line.
Easy enough.
And then we still have some very strange things.
Like the path is composed of two parts, the path that Basal sees from the outside,
and the outcoded string path.
So some concatenation happens somewhere.
This is like, this does not happen in the default Basal behavior, right?
It's only the path there, only the path, only the path.
So when we should have Basal's path, we see an extra outcoded string.
Where does it come from?
Of course, we wrap Basal with that path.
So this is technically the path that Basal sees, because it has been wrapped.
But it's not what the user expects, because the user expects to have the same path as the one
that's ambient when it calls Basal.
Okay, so we need to remove more and more wrappers.
These were all useful at some point.
They fixed some issues.
Now we have better fixes implemented, but these ones are broken.
And in the end, we get this very nice graph that does not depend on which Basal binary we are using.
I mean, it took me some time to read there, so I'm really happy when I see this graph.
This explains a lot about how Basal decides what is the environment for the actions that you run,
and we can discuss it later at some point.
At least, all our Basal binaries are consistent.
Modular something in the hard-coded version from like Vanilla Basal.
It's been user-bin-user-local-bin, and we set it to some proper path that contains default bash things.
So, if streaming Nick support in Basal, that's like kind of...
Ideally, we would not have to do all of that work.
It should be way easier to build Basal in Nick's.
Maybe some of the common stuff we can accept, like patching Shebangs, we know that,
but having to redefine everything because Nick's is not aware,
because Basal is not aware that Nick's exists and only thinks about, you know,
if it's Linux, then probably that binary works for you.
Give me a way to change that.
Give me a way to configure that, and Basal does not do it.
Technically, it's feasible, but it's not really used, at least in the Basal code base.
There is no way to configure it.
It's just like Basal knows better than you what you should use to build it.
And in this case, it's obviously wrong.
The biggest chunk here is like prefetching build dependencies,
because that's where, of course, we have to fight with Basal.
Inside the sandbox, Basal is not allowed to download anything.
So, we have to download it before Basal kicks in.
And Basal has to find it.
So, what we used to do before is like look at the workspace file,
which defines all of the external dependencies.
This is kind of looks like Python, right?
Yeah, it's Python enough that we can execute in an environment that defines HTTP archive.
And we collect all of the files that we depend on.
It's not perfect, but it's funny because it's a big hack,
and sadly, it just doesn't work anymore, because they have changed the format.
So, now the workspace is empty.
We have no Python to execute.
Now, we need to parse some JSON, the log file,
which is something that really nice that comes to Basal.
Now we have a proper log file, so we know what we can do with log files in X.
We can parse it, we can retrieve the information,
and then make proper NICs derivations of that.
So, we can parse the log file with JQ.
It's a bit obscure, but it works.
Then I wrote it in Python because it seems like it's obvious.
And then I wrote it in NICs because why not?
We can parse JSON in NICs and extract everything.
So, I have this nice script that takes the log file, a JSON file,
and generates a repository cache, and these are like formats that Basal uses
to fetch to store things that were downloaded from the Internet.
And so, we first go there to see if it's already downloaded
before trying to do the actual download.
If you did it well, it will not try to download.
If you do it wrong, of course, it still tries to download and crash.
It's obviously not that easy because there are only three versions of that log file.
It's been released like a year ago, but they are making fast iterations.
Version 4 is there and it's probably going to change everything.
So, I don't know if we will support all of these versions
or maybe stick with the latest.
It's really unclear right now.
And the format is kind of well-defined, but it's like each rule
can have its own internal format.
And sadly, the URLs and the ashes are hidden in that internal format.
So, we kind of need to support everything that's possible,
which is obviously not going to work,
but it seems that all in all, most projects is the same set of commands
and we are able to do something with it.
Of course, any failure makes it that we cannot build Bazel
or that we can't build a package that uses Bazel
because we are missing dependencies
and we are back to the nightmare of just trying to download everything locally
and then make a big blob that we hash and say, hey, take that.
But it's totally not reproducible.
Yeah.
Speaking of dependencies, there was like a nasty issue that came from like the Bazel versions.
If you look at Nix packages, I mean, we are nice guys.
We provide Bazel 4, Bazel 5, Bazel 6, it's Bazel 6,
but it's also the default Bazel, and Bazel 7, right?
All of them are provided, but no.
When you build with Bazel, you want 7.0.2 or whatever.
But Bazel needs exactly that version.
Why?
That's how it works.
But the thing is, it also works really well if you delete that file before building.
Most of the time, but no.
Now again, it started failing and it fails for a funny issue.
Some of your dependencies, they are dependencies of your builds.
There are things that you need.
But some of your dependencies, you don't know about them,
but there are things that Bazel needs because it has built-in rules,
and these built-in rules have like built-in dependencies.
And these are also in the log file.
But if you start building with a different Bazel than the one that was specified
and that was used to generate the log file,
then these built-in dependencies are not the ones that Bazel wants.
And Bazel tries to download it from the Internet and then it crashes.
So we need to do some magic.
We need to take some files that are downloaded for the project
and some files that are downloaded based on the Bazel version.
We need to merge them together.
And that creates a folder that Bazel can use to build correctly with a different version.
I'm really fond of one thing here.
The fact that you can merge this thing by using Simlink Join,
it means that the format is not that bad.
Well, when you reach there, you're like, okay, this is pretty neat.
I think Nix could learn something from that format too,
because what they do is something really smart.
They store like binaries from the Internet under hash,
just like Nix does.
Technically, it's like fixed output derivation.
We download something and we put it in our known hash.
But with this problem, like where we change the name
or change something from the input and forget to update the hash,
then it happily reuses the same hash forever.
Bazel fixes that by having like an extra file
that tells where it was downloaded from.
And so you can pass extra information that will invalidate the cache
and force a re-download.
Probably just to check that it's still the same file,
but if it's not, then at least you'll check.
I'm not sure how to implement that.
It may cost a lot if you make like a few changes in Nix,
but there is some inspiration to take from there, I think.
Anyway, we are back to the Java toolchain.
So we have a Java toolchain that can build Bazel,
but now we want users of Bazel to be able to build Java projects.
It's kind of the same thing as the null-a-dull,
because when we build Bazel, we can hard-code everything we want.
We can even change the source code to make it work.
When users are using Bazel, we cannot like change.
We don't want to patch Bazel too much for it.
We want to make change that work by default,
but we also want this change to be like revertable,
so people that don't need it or it doesn't work for them for some reason,
which happens sometimes, then they need to be able to remove it.
And to do that, we use another hack, a very nice one, I think.
Bazel by default, access slash etc slash bazel dot bazel RC.
There is no redundancy there.
And we add an indirection, so we patch Bazel
so that it access first a Bazel RC that is like hard-coded by Nix.
And that one contains a few settings that Bazel will always rate.
The thing is, using that technique, we can, I mean,
we set up some default values, so we force Bazel to use our local,
non-pribute Java toolchain, the one that we painfully set up.
That's it, yeah, we force the version of Java to run Bazel,
and then we try and import the real file.
This is very transparent.
There is a small risk that users don't know that this exists
and don't understand where this option comes from.
I hope they will know too deep about Bazel.
But otherwise, each of these options can be overridden
because these being options, the last one wins.
Okay, so if you add a new one, like you change Java runtime version
to remote gdk, your last flag will win.
Except for one, because why not?
This one, the first one wins.
So nobody can override it.
When it's there, it's like stuck.
After some discussion, they realized that it was a bit silly,
and so we agreed on removing the order for these flags too.
That was also a funny, funny, funny thing.
So regarding all the things that we do to make people build packages,
we do it with our Nix build Bazel.
I don't think there is as much to upstream
as the things I presented before,
because these hacks are a bit annoying,
but they are kind of expected too.
These are things we do for other build systems.
Like we build packages, we download the dependencies,
and then we provide them, and we then have to add some wrappers.
In Python, we have even more wrappers.
So I think this is kind of expected,
even if it's a lot of work, like parse JSON in Nix,
maybe that wasn't twice, either.
But I think we've reached a place where it's already kind of easy to use,
even if not perfect.
We cannot compile Bazel from real sources.
We use the generated sources,
which is not exactly the same thing and differs in a lot of ways.
It's not fully bootstrapped either,
so we cannot really yet build Bazel with Bazel,
meaning that building things with Bazel is still difficult.
We build Bazel using the bootstrap process,
which is, again, different, simplified,
and more guided by the Bazel team.
So it's not yet perfectly easy to use,
especially on Nix OS.
But then at the same time,
I realize that upstream has some interest in Nix,
they know we exist, they are willing to add patches.
If you have a proper reason why we need it and we can argument,
then they will happily merge it.
I was also surprised.
I know I work on very small projects all over Nix packages,
but on that one, there are reviewers, people making comments,
people testing my temporary thing, reporting issues.
It was a really nice community feeling for one of those projects.
So I think it's really well supported.
And of course, being Nix, every time we update it,
we improve it and we keep the receipt.
And so we can make improvements,
we can build upon the shoulders of Bazel 4 or 5 things that came before.
Well, as you've seen, that's all I did,
and I'm the kind of person that really loves challenges.
So if you are willing to join, you are welcome.
And if you have other challenges to share,
I'm really keen to hear that with you.
Thank you. Do we have any questions?
Thank you for the talk.
You mentioned generated sources versus real sources.
What are the generated sources of Bazel?
They do pre-generate some like,
tarbles, things that are not compiled,
but provided in the Bazel binary.
Like all the built-ins, Starlark rules will be there.
That's like the zip file that I have to unpack and repack.
That zip file does not exist in the normal sources.
You don't commit a zip file to...
And a lot of other things, like they try to help people,
so they provide binaries.
So that's with that generated tarble,
which is huge, like it's like 250 megabytes.
It contains all of the binary dependencies.
And a lot of those we don't need,
but also it makes it really easier to have all of the needed dependencies.
Because of the acts we do with the Java tool chain,
we need one more file that's not there.
That's pretty easy to compile.
So we don't have to think too much about dependencies
when we build Bazel with that tarble.
Okay.
If someone who enjoys Bazel discovers your work
and understands it, do you think they will be convinced
to stop using Bazel and use Nix instead?
No, I mean, that's not at all the point of this talk, at least.
I can't say what they will feel.
Maybe they will discover that Bazel is complex.
But the reason Bazel is taking off is
it has all of these optimizations that you want.
So as someone that deploys Bazel a lot,
and a lot of companies, they still want it, right?
You don't want Nix to come and compile for two hours
because you made one change to one file.
That's like... For me, these are complementary build systems.
But ultimately, Bazel was not trying to be a package manager, too,
because that's the part that's really conflicts between Nix and Bazel.
May I have another one?
So from the practical point of view,
how soon can we have something like
use Bazel mod lock hook instead of fetch utters
with nested if else loops for a platform and queue the support?
And how far are we from being able to say Nix and it tends to flow?
I can answer the second question easily.
Like really far.
But for the first question,
it's definitely something we could do.
It's just like I'm amazed by the amount of work I had to do,
like recompiling Bazel because it's not an incremental process right now.
It takes like 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
So each iteration takes that time.
So we have to focus on making it work, not like trying to make a nice set of hook.
Ideally, this would work, of course.
But there is a slight problem also.
It's like you need these things before evaluation.
So it's not just a hook, right?
Because the hook cannot download the files.
To do something like that, then you would need recursive Nix
or some way of Nix inside Nix to be able to do that.
So right now I have implemented it with import from derivation
for like making it simple to use.
And in some cases I just like download the log file, add it to the sources
and use that directly.
So I don't have to have an import from derivation at all.
Can we just commit the log file of the hook on graph?
Yeah, we can do that.
It's just huge.
So what I do is I take JQ,
remove a lot of the things that are not needed,
and it's still a log file.
All right, let's have a round of applause for Guillain.
Thank you.
