So we're doing gathering in Funky Monkey under this address.
So if you know 3MDep and what kind of part
is we doing for 12 hours on V-PAPS,
then you know what we can do.
And if you are willing to bear with us
talking about the firmware,
talking about trustworthiness,
talking about TPM, secure boot,
whatever was part of this dev room,
you are invited, feel free to join.
And I guess that's it from me.
And thank you very much for surviving to the end.
Thank you.
