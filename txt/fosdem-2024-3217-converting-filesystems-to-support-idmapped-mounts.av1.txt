Hello, my name is Alex, I work for Fogunonical.
I have a pleasure to work on Lexi project
and do a lot of container stuff in the kernel
and user space.
We have been working on that new stuff
about ADMapetMal and support for some file systems
together with Stefan and with Christian.
So today I'm gonna talk about
the problems that we faced when we started
to actually look into the network based file systems
and how to support ADMapetMal for them
because it's kinda hard sometimes.
First of all, I'm not sure that everyone knows
everything about that stuff, so I want to give some intro
about how it works currently.
And yeah, if anyone, if anybody there,
we were listening to our previous talk
about isolated user space stuff,
please forget that for the next 30 minutes
because that's a new feature.
But this stuff is about stable API that we have
in the kernel since I guess 5.11 or something.
So that's more about supporting more file systems.
So we don't do these isolated user space stuff in here.
First of all, we need to understand that we have three
types of ID mappings in the kernel.
First one is the callers ID mapping,
which effectively taken from the user namespace
and from the current user namespace.
User namespace attached, you can get the pointer
to user namespace from the struct cred
and you can get the pointer to struct cred
from the task struct.
Right, so if you're calling any kind of syscall
in Linux kernel, you get a current task
and so you can get a current user namespace.
So we have a macro in the kernel to get that.
And even if you're not doing any kind of container stuff,
even if you're not using user namespaces,
you're always invisibly using that
because you're using the default mapping,
which looks like zero zero in this big number,
which is effectively the largest unsigned integer.
And what does this means?
The first number is the user ID inside user namespace.
Second number is the user ID outside of the user namespace
and effectively the length of this mapping.
So this mapping is the identity mapping,
which means that we effectively map zero to zero,
one to one and so forth.
Next thing that we have when we are working
with any kind of EFS stuff is the file systems ID mapping.
It's also represented as the user namespace
because it's the thing that we are attaching
to the super block of the file system.
So when you're creating a new mount,
let's say for example, for X4 file system,
you have a block device, you're creating a new mount
and if it is the first mount for this file system,
not a bind mount, I mean,
then the super block gets allocated
and on the super block structure,
we have a field called SC user NS
and this field gets filled with the current user NS.
So when you do a mount,
it takes the current user namespace from your current task
and puts that into the super block.
And that's the file systems ID mapping,
which means that if you're, let's say,
inside the container with some user namespace
and you do a mount, so your super block
will get this user namespace effectively
from your containers user namespace.
And that's a pretty old stuff actually
because I believe that it was from the beginning
of the when the user namespace
is very introduced many years ago.
And third thing about we are talking today
is the mounts ID mapping.
Mounts ID mapping is the concept
a little bit more high level
because instead of being attached to the super block,
we have the mount, we have the ID mappings
attached to the mount.
So it means that you can, for example,
create X for file system on top of some block device,
then do a bind mount and you can do this bind mount
with some ID mapping attached to it.
And once you get any kind of IO
through this ID mapit mount,
you will get some extra translate,
UIDJ ID translation layer inside the VFS,
inside the generic VFS code.
And then this, all of that goes through the file system
in mapping and then all of that gets written to the disk.
So that's how it works.
So important to mention that all the time
when you're interacting with the kernel
from the user space and if you use any kind of C-scores
like start get UID, get sock opt for instance
with the option so peer create
which allows you to get the PID and UIDJ ID
of the peer socket,
you will get these values mapped
in accordance with your current user space.
So the callers ID mapping always get,
always taken into account everywhere in the kernel.
And for example, if you, so yeah,
that's effectively all the examples
and also we have the same in proc PID status file
and all that stuff.
So let's take a look what happens
when you for example, take the get UID C-score
which is probably the simplest one.
Inside the kernel we have a few helpers
to convert between the user space,
user ID that we can work with inside the user space
and with the internal representation of user ID
inside the kernel because inside the kernel
we have two types, UID T and K UID T.
UID T is the user space one effectively
because it's just a 32 bit thing.
And K UID T is also 32 bit thing,
it's the same in size,
usually they contain the same value
but K UID T is the value that represents the user ID
always in the initial user space.
Which means that for example,
if you are inside the container with user name space,
you have the, let's say user ID inside the container zero
and if you have the corresponding user ID on the host,
let's say 1000, then K UID will have the value 1000 always.
But once you call the get UID C-score
from the context of the process of the task
that runs inside the container, inside this user name space,
this function called from K UID Monct will be called.
And the first argument of this function
is the current user name space
which effectively the time thing
that represents the UID mapping.
And second argument is the current UID
which will be the K UID T value which is equal to 1000.
And this function called from K UID Monct
will try to effectively remap this host visible value 1000
to the appropriate value inside this specific user name space.
It will be zero in our case
because as I have explained in this case,
let's say we have like mapping of zero inside the container
to 1000 on the host.
And so you will get the zero finally, yeah?
And this function has a pair function called from K UID.
And the difference between these two functions
is that from K UID is like more like internal one.
If we fail to represent the internal K UID
in terms of some user name space UID range,
the from K UID function returns minus one
which means that something terribly wrong.
We can't really represent that ID inside
this user name space which is possible.
For example, if you have the username space
with that maps only like 1000 to zero
and if you have the user ID let's say 2000 on the host
you can't really represent that
is any reasonable value inside, right?
And if you call the from K UID it will return minus one.
But function from K UID month it does the trick.
If the from K UID returns minus one,
it takes the overflow UID and returns that.
That explains why we have these interesting stuff
with like if you have the,
if you try to access the, for example,
the container file system from the host
or that has another ID mapping
and you will see this strange nobody user.
That's because this function is used everywhere
because we can't really give the user space
with this minus one.
We always, the user space always expects us
to give the normal user ID, reasonable user ID.
And also we have a helper called make K UID
which effectively does the opposite thing.
It takes the user space UID
and creates the internal representation of it
for the kernel.
The same, we need to give,
plug the current user space, current ID mapping
to this helper and give the user space value.
And that's what happens inside the set UID cisco.
If you plug the let's say value zero,
let's say one inside the user space to that cisco.
Inside the container it will go like
make K UID current user space one.
It will go to the UID map
and it will try to find that okay,
this one is for what?
And if it fails to do that, then okay,
we get gain well.
And so the set UID will not allow us to set this UID
because it's not mapped.
But if you have a mapping like zero, 1002
which means that you have mapped zero and one,
then they succeed because the end K UID
for that thing will be 1001 on the kernel
and everywhere it will be represented like that.
But once you, until you do the get UID
or something like that.
For file systems, what we have for file systems?
For file systems we have,
it's about super block ID mapping, right?
We have two important helpers.
One helper effectively takes the I node
and tries to get the user space visible UID
so the normal UID.
This function called I UID read,
but in fact it called on the right path.
There is no mistake, that's perfectly fine
because we are reading the I UID value from the I node.
That's why it read because we read this value from I node.
But of course it's called on the right path
because when the file system driver wants to write
the UID on disk or let's say send it over the wire,
in that for file systems like this.
We need to call this to get properly mapped
to remapped user ID that we can then send over the wire,
put on the disk and forget.
And we have a second helper called the I UID write
which does the opposite.
It takes the I node, it takes the user space visible,
normal classical UID that we supposed to work with
and does the same as we have seen in the set UID system.
It calls the helper called make I UID,
but instead of taking the current username space,
it takes the username space from super block.
And second argument is the value.
So let's say if you create a file on the file system
at first from the user ID like one,
so you will get that.
Like it will take the value one and plug in there and so.
This K UID will be written into the I node I UID field.
And finally we're getting to the point
when we can take a look on the whole picture
like how it works together with the amounts ID mapping.
Okay, imagine that we have the caller UID 1000.
And this caller wants to create the file
on the ID mapped mount.
And we have these three ID mappings in place.
We have the caller's ID mapping which is okay,
which is something that we have been discussing right now.
We have file system in mapping which is the,
in this specific example,
which is the identity ID mapping
that does the zero maps zero to zero one to one,
two to two and so on.
And we have a new thing, amounts ID mapping,
which maps effectively zero to 10,000
and has the length 10,000.
So we have like 10,000 UIDs mapped with this shift.
So the second thing is that effectively the shift value.
So the zero goes to 10,000, one to go to 10,000, one and so.
And what will happen in the kernel in this case
once we try to create the file?
First of all, we will create the internal representation
for the user ID 1000, which will be 11,000, right?
Small remark is that effectively in the kernel,
to be honest, we all the time work only
with this KUID thing.
So it means that technically,
when you calling the file system,
CIS calls like let's say open with OcreateFlock,
the first step is not gonna happen
because we already have these values on the struct cred,
but it's easier to think about it like that
just to understand how much different mappings
we have in this place, right?
And second thing is that we need to,
we need to apply this new concept, mount id mapping, right?
We need to take the mounted mapping
and perform effectively the reverse operation.
We call the front KUID,
we take the value that we've got
from the collars ID mapping,
and then we do this mapping in accordance with this
this definition that we have.
In this case, we are mapping the KUID 11,000, remap it,
and what we get, we get 1000, right?
Which is obvious.
And then once we want to create the file on the disk,
we need to get the IUIDT back, right?
So we need to go through the file systems ID mapping
which is attached to the super block
to get the IUID that will be written on the disk.
And so in our case, fortunately,
we have the identity file system ID mapping
which means that okay, we have user ID 1000,
it goes to 1000, that's all.
But let's think about another example,
if we have the, for example, mapping like U0 K1000,
in this case, we can remap that value, right?
Because if it goes like U0 K1000, we fail
because this U1000 is not in the range of this mapping,
but for the second one, U1000 K0, we can remap
because the corresponding user ID will be zero,
but in first place, we can't.
And what happens if the VFS generic code realizes
that it cannot remap the value?
It will give you the E overflow error.
So that's the reason why you can get E overflow error
when you're working with ID mapping, not only.
Even if you're not using ID mapping,
if you're using just normal mouse,
what you're trying to, for example,
to write to this mount from the another user space
with another color ID mapping which is incompatible
in terms of ranges of user IDs
with this mount file systems in mapping,
you can get this E overflow error.
So that's the really complicated behavior,
but that's how it works.
We have no alternatives, actually, right?
So you can create ID mapping mounts
using these effectively two options.
We already have the new feature
that allows you to use the classical
util Linux mount utility to create ID mapping mount,
but in most distros, I don't think
that it actually works right now
because it's too recent, it's like one year
or something like that.
So I'm always using the Christian utility
for to create ID mapping mounts.
And internally, it just uses the syscall called mount setutter
to set the ID mapping on the mount.
And so you can, you always need to specify
this attribute with the username space file descriptor.
So we're always getting the, at least these days,
we're always getting the IUID mappings
and GUID mappings from the username space
because username space, we have the way
to actually set user ID mappings and JD mappings
to the user space, from user space using the proc files,
right, that's the reason.
So currently we have support for all of these file systems,
but if you take a look on the list closer,
you will notice that most of them are local ones,
so it's like the X4, better FS, XFS and so on.
And recently we have been working
with Christian and Stefan on the CIF support.
Christian did the major work a few years ago,
created the first implementation of that,
but unfortunately it get lost in discussions
and it wasn't merged, so I asked the permission
to continue work on that because it was kind of important
for our containers applications.
And I get some rebate stuff and also we decided
to use a little bit another approach to make it work.
I will explain that a little bit later.
So starting from 6.7 you can use the ID map mounts
which is CIFFS, and yeah, CIFFS is the only
network file system in this list, so.
How to port the file system?
The very naive way to do that is to just go
through the file systems code, find all the places
where we have like no M&T map,
which means that this file system id mapping
is not defined, so there is no id mapping.
Replace it with the id map identifier,
which is passed almost to all the VFS API functions
from the generic VFS code.
And then also replace the current FSUID,
which gives you the KUID from the current user.
And with the mapped FSUID, which does the same,
but takes into account the id mapping.
And also raise the FSUID map flag
on the file systems definition.
But no, that's not that simple because you need
to be really, really careful with that stuff,
otherwise you can really break things
and or even open to some vulnerabilities
or something like that.
So the reason for that is that, okay,
I would suggest that if you want to try
to try and porting some file system to support
id mapping, especially the network one,
you need to go through the code of X4
as a really, really good example
because X4 file system is like very complex one.
It has many features.
For example, you can do the overlay FFS on top of,
and use the X4 as a one of the layers for overlay FFS.
And for example, the rename callback on the X4 supports
really interesting rename mode called rename whiteout,
which effectively when you rename the file,
usually it disappears on the previous place
and appears on the new place, right?
But in this case, on the old place
where a file supposed to disappear,
it creates the so-called whiteout thing.
So this is effectively the share character device
with the major and minor numbers zero.
And that mode is enabled only when you call the rename
from the overlay FFS.
And I guess that only for that reason,
this rename callback and VFS takes the id mapping
as an argument because in all the other file systems
where we have no support for that,
we can't really use this id mapping in any case
because we don't need one.
Yeah, also you need to pay attention in the getutter
because getutter what it does,
it's effectively what is getting called
in the file system driver when you call the statistical
because getutter reads the attributes,
fills the case, utter structure in the kernel
with all the data like size, like user ID,
JD stuff and all that.
And you will definitely need to take id mapping
into account in this place to get proper user IDs
and JDs reported to the user space, right?
Also there is a permission callback
which effectively does all the permission checking
unique spike in the kernel.
So you need to also properly pass the id mapping in there.
If you use, if the file system that you want to convert
uses the generic permission helper,
then you just need to pass the id mapping,
check that everything really works
and that's pretty much all.
But sometimes it's not the case
because some file systems will see that later,
use really, really weird machinery to check the permissions.
And also get ACL stuff and that's pretty much all
for read code pass, but for write pass,
the most important pieces is the,
obviously the places where are we creating the new inodes,
right?
So that's the MK node, sim link,
MK dear, atomic open and create.
So we need to take into ID mapping into account
in all of these places
because we actually write the UIDs and JIDs.
That's it.
And set other which is getting code from,
for example, challenges call, right?
So you need to, as the challenges call takes the user IDs
and JIDs from the user space,
you need to properly remap them and write to the attributes.
So that's, so for local file systems, as I said,
you really need to take the X4 or better first or something,
just carefully read the code.
Be absolutely sure that you understand how it works
and then go for the other philosophy that you want to support.
Which problems we can have and we really have.
First of all, some file systems,
especially in Torque Ones, they,
obviously in Torque Ones,
they do the permission checking on the server side,
which is really bad because what we want
is to ID map it, map it mounts,
is the local feature of Linux kernel.
We don't want to tell the file systems remote server
to be aware about that we have this crazy,
interesting Linux specific stuff
because the theoretically user may be
from another operating system, right?
So if we want to, if the file system does some UID,
JID based permission checks on the server side,
it means that we need to extend the on wire protocol,
pass all of this ID map stuff over the network,
write some logic in there, so that's not work usually.
Effectively for a few file system,
which is not the network one,
but it almost the same as network ones, right?
Because you have the user space demon,
you have the kernel, kernel is effectively the client,
and user space demon is effectively the file system,
and the client, the kernel just takes the information
from Cisco, does something with that information,
produces the request, send it over the fuse device,
and the user space read that,
and so if we want to do all the permission checks
on the user space side,
and if you want to support ID map it mounts,
we need to pass these ID mappings over the,
so we need to extend the protocol that we use
between the user space and kernel space for fuse, right?
Also some file systems,
it's also about fuse effectively,
some file systems can do,
some can allow you to completely disable
the standard permission hook permissions,
so effectively implemented almost like an empty thing,
that just allows everything,
and then do all the permission checks
on the level of the I know operations,
and the problem is that,
I can remember that I have seen that
in the while I was working on Ceph,
is that in Ceph it's possible to set the configuration
based on the path to the file,
and specify the user IDs and JDs
that actually allowed to read the sub directory,
it means that you have the combination
of permissions checking on the Linux kernel side,
then you have some permission checking on the kernel side,
on the server side, I'm sorry,
which is the remote server with another kernel,
which does not know anything about this stuff, right?
And they do checks almost everywhere, even for lookup,
and why it's bad for lookup?
First of all, because lookup,
I know the operation does not have ID mapp argument,
and it's not obvious why it doesn't have,
but the reason for that is that the usually lookup operation
is getting called from the slow lookup pass
in the kernel, right?
If you have the pre-cached to dentaries for some pass,
then we won't go to this lookup callback,
instead we will just take the dentary,
and it means that if you have the permission checks
inside the lookup, then everything will depend on that,
if you have this dentary already or not.
So if you have not, then you go to the lookup,
then you do the permission checks.
If you have this dentary cached already for some reason,
for example, if this dentary was accessed
from another mount with another user,
then these permission checks won't happen really,
that's bad, right?
That's why we want to have all the checks
in one place, ideally, for this stuff.
And of course, some of you can say that,
okay, in this case we can do some permission checks
and derevalidate helper, which is always getting called,
yeah, to derevalidate, but not,
because we don't want to do that, I guess.
So, yeah, and also, third case that I've almost forgotten
about is that some file systems has the local feature,
really, really close ideologically
that what we have in Linux,
that does some UID-JD mappings
on the level of the file system itself.
And that's also a problem because I personally
don't understand how to combine all of that together
to make it work properly.
Yeah, in third case, what I have found is that
we have the combination, effectively,
of the classical permission checks
and the server side checks.
Speaking honestly, we decided to forget about that
because we just decided that if someone uses
the IDMAPitMounds, we clearly say that, okay,
you don't want to use the server side permission checks
in this case, just disable that, just trust the kernel,
just trust the client because,
Ceph really trusts the client.
If you have the key to interact with the MDS server,
you can do anything.
So there is no real reason to do some additional checks
because you can, if you have the user ID checks
on the server side and if you have a client,
this client can give you any UID, right?
So it makes no sense to check that
because this information is not like,
trustworthy so.
So in third case, we have this lookup problem
which is okay because it's only actual for this case
when you have some additional setup,
some additional configuration.
And the third one is that for some reason,
most, I guess historically, is that
Ceph uses current FSUID everywhere
to get the current user ID.
Yeah, thanks.
To get the current user ID, but what we want usually,
we want usually to take the credential structure
from the file because when you open,
when you are opening the file descriptor,
the credential structure from your current task
gets stashed to the struct file structure.
And then we expect that if you do, for example,
the right syscall or itsyscall on this file descriptor,
then everything, all the permission checks will be done
in the relevant to this credential structure
that we have on the file.
And you may ask me why it's so important.
It's important if you want to pass the file descriptor
over the Unix socket or if you, for example,
opening the file descriptor while you are privileged,
but then you do some capabilities, drop things,
or set your idea or something,
and you lose your privilege effectively,
privileges effectively, and so that can be a problem.
But I was, to be honest, I decided not to send fixes
for that because I don't want to break any real
user space application.
I don't know, maybe someone relies on that.
So that's technically not ideally correct,
but you will see.
So, yeah, I effectively covered that.
Yeah, what we decided to do,
we just ignored these problems
with the server side permission checks
because we can't really do anything with that.
And we were asked by the CFFS folks,
CFFS maintainers, thanks, by the way, thanks to them
for help, for reviews, to Viennkischenkartus,
Huboli for helping with that
because they were reviewing that stuff,
especially the user space one,
because I was forced to extend the on-wire CFFS protocol
and add some extra UID and JID fields
for the Inode creation operations.
And of course, all of that was done
in the backward, forward, anyhow compatible way,
not to break anything.
Yep, and what we are doing right now,
we're currently working on Fuse,
I have already sent a series of patches
that enables support for Fuse.
Unfortunately, only for the mode
when we have the default permission set,
because as I said, if you have the Fuse mount
without this flag called default permissions,
then effectively the permission callback
is almost empty, it just allows everything.
And in this case, Fuse file system expects
that the user space will do all the permission checks
in the user space, which is a problem
because we can't handle that properly.
And also, obviously Fuse protocol
that between the user space and kernel play
was extended to send these UIDs and JIDs
over the wire, let's say.
Yep, also in addition to this series,
I wanted to be absolutely sure
that this really works properly,
so I have taken the three not random,
really not random file systems.
Overlay Fuse Fuse just as a good and relatively simple example
for this specific case, it's not simple at all.
Overlay Fuse Fuse,
SEPA Fuse Fuse because I was already familiar
with Fuse a little bit while I was working with the,
so and GlusterFS, which is the new one.
For GlusterFS, it's not an ideal implementation
because I found, I unexpectedly found that GlusterFS
also likes to do all the permission checks by default
in the user space.
And so that, a bit painful,
but I found some special configuration option
that allows to disable that
and enable the default permission thing
for that file system and it allows us to make it work.
So to do, in our plan to go further with the Fuse series
to make it fully like tested covered
to be absolutely sure that everything is fine,
then we want to convert the nine PFS and virtualFS,
which can be useful if you do some nesting stuff
like virtual machine with some shared director
from the host and then the container inside, for example,
which is not a rare case.
And yeah, that's all.
Questions?
Thank you.
Hello, thank you for your talk.
Is there any caveats with ID mappings
and interaction with Alasams?
So like if you're doing some checks in Alasams,
like what kind of UI did we get there?
Because I was confused.
That's a good question to be honest,
because all of these ID mappings works
is done by Christian, thanks to him,
because he did all of these great API in the kernel,
all of these preparation stuff.
I mean that our isolated user space work
and how we managed to make it work with the file systems
is all, it became so small in terms of lines of code
that were modified just because Christian did all
of these crazy complex hard stuff in the kernel
a few years ago, because he effectively provided us
with the two functions in the kernel
that we can patch easily, relatively easily.
And so we get the ID mappings supported
for some like new crazy case, right?
And to be honest, I don't know much about Alasams,
so I guess that it should be integrated.
So when I did the original work,
I went through all of the Alasams.
And so for example, Alasams like SA Linux
don't fuck with UIDs and GIDs,
don't care about this at all.
So most of these Alasam functions don't get past the path
or UID and GID value at all.
The only hooks are relevant,
like security file open and so on.
And then it's mostly Tomoyo and possibly some app armor stuff
and they are all patched to take the ID mapping
into account, although one caveat is I once tried to do
some additional fixes inside of Tomoyo itself
because it kind of does weird stuff,
but the maintainer said, no, we don't care.
I mostly care about like BPF Alasam
because the hook doesn't get the UID,
but like you can extract it from something.
Oh yeah, they are aware of that.
I talked to them.
So yeah, well, for example, if you do a BPF Alasam
and in hooks like security file open,
you get the relevant ID mapping provided.
And in other hooks where you only have the inode,
yeah, then you don't have access,
but that's also for example, not feasible.
Like no, there is no security hook in lookup,
but there is certainly locations where we have security hooks
where you, for example, in the dentry cache,
where you don't have any of that information available
and it's impossible to make that work.
Like you mentioned the lookup stuff,
the lookup stuff itself, like it was two reasons
why we didn't do it this way.
First of all, because in lookup you initialize an inode
and that always needs to be take the global UID
and GID into account, the one that you see everywhere.
Otherwise you end up with inode aliases in a way
because if you can't cache an inode per mount,
that's the one thing.
And the other thing that lookup is called deep
from within the dentry cache,
which would have meant then suddenly you would have like,
have to pass mount information more or less
because it's mount information through the dentry cache.
It doesn't make any sense.
Also L would have killed me.
But I mean, that's another thing
why in these locations we don't want to have this.
But for example, BPF Alasams,
if they need that sort of information in specific hooks
and is doable, then we can easily extend the hooks.
Like I don't have a problem with this,
like sort of more of a LSM question
if they're ready to do this.
It's, I think for most LASMs hooks,
it simply hasn't been done because the LASMs
that didn't implement that this specific hook
didn't want this information.
So it didn't make sense to provide it.
If you have an LASM that wants this information,
it's easy to extend it.
Well, I think the other point is the LASMs
should use the code behind the way
because it seems this one is not the LASM.
I think it's a little faster.
And for always tricky when you provide a policy
from users based on the current idea,
you don't need to translate it to the LASM.
Question?
Yeah, you mentioned an FS real quick.
How does it work with an FS?
If I remember correctly,
there's an upcall through the Linux Curing, right?
So you get the translated.
